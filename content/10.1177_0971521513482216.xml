<p>Women’s role in biological reproduction is recognised in Indian society over and above their contributions to social reproduction. For ages, <italic>dai</italic>s—traditional midwives—have played important roles in birthing care in India, yet they are subjected to social and economic marginalisation. Contemporary interrogations into the lives of these women reveal their precarious condition. Despite continuing to represent a rich heritage of health care, they now mostly serve those who are yet to benefit from planned development. The current status of the <italic>dai</italic> has roots in the social history of the institution, which is yet to get adequate attention in research. This article attempts to explore how the images of the <italic>dai</italic>s have been socially constructed in the changing socio-economic, cultural and political contexts of 20th century Bengal.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Women’s role in biological reproduction is recognised in Indian society over and above their contributions to social reproduction. Feminist discourses in women’s health movements have been more concerned about the discrimination experienced by women gynaecologists in health care delivery systems under the influence of patriarchy rather than about the problems of indigenous midwives. The institution of traditional midwifery has been overwhelmingly the domain of <italic>dai</italic>s (as they are known in many parts of India) skilled in the work of birthing care. They have been offered the social status equivalent to that of a biological mother and addressed as ‘<italic>dai-ma</italic>’ in Bengali literature of the 20th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0971521513482216">Akhter, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0971521513482216">Mukhopadhyay, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0971521513482216">Sathyamala, 2005</xref>). For ages, <italic>dai</italic>s or traditional indigenous midwives in India have attended at childbirth and performed a range of tasks before, during and after delivery. Discourses in the literature reveal links with three major intersecting areas of knowledge and practices. These include the different fields of traditional indigenous medicine, modern Western medicine and women in development. The folk wisdom of the <italic>dai</italic> is located in the common space shared by these broad areas of knowledge and practice. Any historical inquiry into the institution of the <italic>dai</italic> therefore needs to take into account these intersecting realms of knowledge and practice and their transformation in time. Drawing from a range of secondary and primary sources of information including narratives (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0971521513482216">Soman, 2011</xref>), this article attempts to capture a view of the social history of the indigenous tradition of midwifery in the changing socio-political landscape of rural Bengal during the 20th century.</p>

<title>Social Questions in Traditional Midwifery: A Glimpse of the Literature</title>
<p>The institution of the traditional midwife or <italic>dai</italic> in India has undergone transformations particularly since the 19th century, when the management of childbirth became an area of intervention when the British established Western medicine in India. This phase continued till 1947 in Bengal when India achieved freedom and East Pakistan was created out of Bengal province as a consequence of political partition. Transformations in the institution of the <italic>dai</italic> that continued through the following period took place in the context of the evolution of health services in independent India through planned development. While colonial interventions in health care practices were projected as an attempt at ‘modernisation’, approaches in developmental planning reflected the continuing confidence of Indian planners in Western medicine.</p>
<p>The available literature that has traced the development of modern Western medicine and health service systems in pre- and post-Independent India has touched on the institution of midwives only marginally. Historical research that has looked into reforms or the modernisation of childbirth in the region has drawn attention to issues of hygienic management, official policies and the politics of childbirth in attempts to establish Western medicine in India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0971521513482216">Engels, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0971521513482216">Guha, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0971521513482216">Harrison, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0971521513482216">Qadeer, 1998</xref>, and others). Deviating from these, Malhotra (2006), however, also referred to the ‘traditional’ and ‘modern’ midwives as categories for analysing women’s reproductive health in the context of her historical study of colonial Punjab.</p>
<p>According to Malhotra (2006), historical scholarship has only begun to explore the various compulsions and agendas of the colonial state in its impulse to impose new biomedical regimes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0971521513482216">Arnold, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0971521513482216">Forbes, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0971521513482216">Lal, 1994</xref>), including the reassertion of indigenous medical systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0971521513482216">Girija, 2000</xref>) that managed to thrive along with ‘metropolitan’ medical science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0971521513482216">Arnold, 2000</xref>). According to her, only a few of these ‘medicine-oriented’ exercises have shown how new medical paradigms interact with the social structure. It is this linkage that she herself examined in the context of colonial Punjab. She explored how the opportunistic adoption of ‘seemingly new’, that is, hygienic, clean and scientific midwifery practices by middle class interventions in the management of reproductive health had implications for social relations. The promotion of these ‘new’ practices was to the disadvantage of those who provided the elite Punjabis with customary services, such as, the indigenous traditional midwife or <italic>dai</italic>. Such a politics also divided women into categories of ‘lady’ doctors and ‘certified’ practitioners, isolating the traditional <italic>dai</italic>. The promotion of new practices in health care not only replaced the <italic>dai</italic>s and created a category of ‘lady’ doctors but also advanced the formation of a new kind of class division and pattern of hierarchy within the social network of medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0971521513482216">Malhotra, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In another context, Ruth Richardson (1988) had earlier observed in her volume <italic>Death, Dissection and the Destitute</italic> that a new class of ‘physicians’ had emerged following the introduction of the dissection of the human body in England during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Elite male surgeons displaced female midwives in the care of the wealthy. In 1834, domination of surgeons over practitioners of midwifery in medical education at the Royal College of Physicians was questioned by the selection authority. Formation and practices of new knowledge that came with reform gradually provided a space in which the ‘lady’ doctor or her equivalent could claim the status of an epistemologically privileged cultural referee as compared to male doctors.</p>
<p>In the present-day context, Sadgopal (2009) has analysed in great detail the marginalisation of the ‘<italic>dai</italic> tradition’ in the evolution of health services in India. She points out that there is still considerable potential in this local health tradition, even in the current framework of health services that treats the <italic>dai</italic> as an ‘honorary’ actor in the management of childbirth. Sadgopal has proposed the idea of ‘maternity care governance for the benefit of local communities’ and has looked at the possibilities of strengthening the existing services with significant inputs from the <italic>dai</italic>s. At the same time she has also drawn attention to the possible social implications of an acceptance of the ‘<italic>dai</italic> tradition’ within the health care delivery system—in the dimensions of class, caste, gender, power and ideology. Almost simultaneously, in the specific context of Tamil Nadu, Gopal (2010) has examined the practices of the traditional midwives of the <italic>barber</italic> caste and points out that the government training programmes have totally ignored their traditional knowledge, experience and skills in birthing care. In spite of these important observations, however, writing the social history of the constituency of <italic>dai</italic>s or indigenous traditional midwives is a task yet to be accomplished.</p>
<p>There are concerns expressed in interdisciplinary discourses for writing such a history from the point of view of the socio-economically marginalised and discriminated. While acknowledging that a history of the <italic>dai</italic>s is yet to be written, it is important to emphasise that any inquiry into the lives of <italic>dai</italic>s, or indigenous traditional midwives, needs to be centrally located in the politics of gender and gendering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0971521513482216">Hardiman, 2010</xref>). This, in turn, indicates that viewing the world through the eyes and perceptions of the women themselves appears to be an important prerequisite to the formulation of a social history of <italic>dai</italic>s.</p>
<p>As in most places in India, the traditional <italic>dai</italic>s of Bengal who conduct or help in deliveries and in maternal and new-born care are also members of the folk communities of traditional healers who have been in close touch with the natural resources available in their bio-diverse localities. Moreover, many of their practices even today are found to be rooted in classical texts. In spite of making considerable contributions in social reproduction, they live and struggle like other women of their communities. Their status and existence are shaped by the immediate dynamics of their families which, in turn, are influenced by the larger forces of socio-economic transformation of class–caste and patriarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0971521513482216">Soman, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0971521513482216">1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0971521513482216">2007</xref>). In the course of my research, I have explored the views expressed by three generations of women and men, reflecting on the social dynamics of women’s lives in rural West Bengal in eastern India. As a consequence of the socio-economic transformation of rural Bengal, the institution of the indigenous traditional midwife or <italic>dai</italic> has undergone several changes in the course of the 20th century, shaping her productive and reproductive roles within and beyond the family. This, in turn, influenced the image of the <italic>dai</italic> that was constructed either by <italic>dai</italic>s themselves, by others in the family or society at large. The important role of the <italic>dai</italic> in social reproduction, however, has been lost sight of by planners in the evolution of India’s health services.</p>
<p>The social identity of the <italic>dai</italic> has constantly been shaped by gender equations prevailing in the society and social systems—the health system in particular. The politics of gender has been discussed in history largely in the intertwined contexts of medicine and nationalism but not so much in that of the changing interfaces of caste, class and patriarchy, which this article will attempt to address. The emphasis is on the 20th century, which saw contrasts in the political, socio-economic and cultural dimensions of both the public and private spheres of women’s lives. However, journeys back to the preceding period of colonial history will also be in order to locate the 20th century in a historical perspective.</p>

<title><bold><italic>Dai</italic></bold>s in 20th Century Bengal: A Changing Landscape</title>
<p>The <italic>dai</italic> tradition may be traced in two political contexts in Bengal—before and after the partition of India, dividing Bengal at Independence. During this period, the <italic>dai</italic> tradition evolved with the expansion of modern Western medicine at the expense of the traditional indigenous systems of healing as well as with the changing socio-economic forces shaping the lives and status of women in the rural and local health cultures of Bengal. Various social perceptions of the role and activities of the <italic>dai</italic>s in this changing socio-political landscape of Bengal provide some scope for constructing a social history of the <italic>dai</italic>s during this period.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0971521513482216">
<title>Colonial Reforms under British Rule</title>
<p><italic>Dai</italic>s of Bengal—the women who have been traditionally providing maternity and newborn care—were addressed as ‘<italic>dai-ma</italic>’ and held in high social esteem in early 20th century Bengal. This social identity of ‘mother’ was an extension of portrayals that surfaced in Bengali novels, biographies and other literature illustrating the <italic>dai</italic>’s roles in Bengali society at large, for example, Bibhutibhusan Bandopadhyay’s <italic>Pather Panchali</italic>,<italic> Agradaani</italic> by Tarashankar Bandopadhyay, Atin Bandopadhyay’s <italic>Nilkantho Paakhir Khoje</italic>, Achintyakumar Sengupta’s <italic>Parampurush SrisriRamkrishno</italic>, Ashapurna Debi’s<italic> Subarnolata</italic>, Manik Bandopadhyay’s <italic>Janani</italic> and Bireswar Bandopadhyay’s <italic>Adi Kolkatai Loukik Sanskriti Charcha</italic> are some of these published between 1948 and 1998 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0971521513482216">Mukhopadhyay, 2008</xref>). These writings highlight the important roles that <italic>dai</italic>s had played in Bengali society in the past, which, in turn, earned them the status of ‘mother’. This dignified social status however began to change through processes of neglect and de-recognition by modern medicine, mediated largely through colonial policies. Further, changing socio-political formations in Bengal had implications for the sustenance of the tradition as well. In short, the 20th century saw shifts in medicine and medical practices, political equations and social relations that affected the status of the <italic>dai</italic>.</p>
<p>Bengali periodicals published in the late 19th and early 20th centuries largely reflected on the developments of the time. Writings on midwifery, maternity and child care by doctors and nationalist government officials and memoirs written by women serve as important sources of information. Contemporary documentation of the tradition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0971521513482216">Mukhopadhyay, 2008</xref>) along with observations and analysis that refer to the dimensions of the institution of traditional midwifery across time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0971521513482216">Engels, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0971521513482216">Forbes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0971521513482216">Soman, 2011</xref>) are useful. Mukhopadhyay’s documentation highlights articles published in Bengali periodicals (over six decades till the 1930s), such as, <italic>Tattwabodhini, Swasthya Samachar, Indian Medical Gazette</italic> and others. These writings collated maternity related traditional folk knowledge. They also reflected on the pressures of cosmopolitan medicine in the garb of Western modernity in science, asserted by the British in order to consolidate power and dominate the cultural spheres of colonised Bengal. In a memoir, Sudha Majumdar, a married woman from an urban elite family, wrote about how the gradual shift from the <italic>dai</italic> to trained modern midwives and physicians, from family to nursing homes took place. All these did not always have a positive outcome, though. Whereas Engels (1993) had engaged in a scrutiny of historical records to look into the politics of childbirth that prevailed in the cultural context of Bengal between 1890 and 1930, she examined the contesting roles played by British and Bengali women in particular. One of her important observations is that unlike Europe where modernisation of medicine was accompanied by the displacement of female birth attendants, a similar intervention could not alter existing cultural norms governing child birth including the gender of birth attendants. In a recent article published in Bengali, Geraldine Forbes (2009) traced the process of Indian women’s education and training in Western medicine including midwifery and medical practice since mid-19th century. In her attempt to find out whether such training helped the women to choose economic engagements outside the home, she observed that women were restrained from using their training to earn a livelihood. This made them play an intermediary role and to depend on the British authorities for training and opportunities. They also required recognition of their emerging roles in families and the society at large, which was not easy to obtain. Soman (2011), in an interdisciplinary exercise, attempted to construct a social history of the institution of the <italic>dai</italic> in 20th century Bengal before and after Independence. Based on what the women and <italic>dai</italic>s in particular had to say about the transition of the institution in transforming the rural ambience in Bengal, she indicates that the journey of the <italic>dai</italic>s has been largely shaped at the interfaces of medicine and women, influenced by the politics of gender.</p>
<p>Already in the 19th century the modernisation of health care and its institutionalisation had led to the gradual disapproval of traditional medical systems. Such disapproval went to the extent of drawing Ayurvedic physicians like Madhusudan Gupta into the fold of Western modern medicine by offering them admission to the first batch of students in the medical college that was established in 1835 in the city of Calcutta (now Kolkata). He became one among the early native Indian male physicians and advocates of Western midwifery, following the European practitioners in India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0971521513482216">Roberton, 1846</xref>). Opposition towards traditional healing systems was clearly reflected in the first census of the 20th century, published in 1901. Simultaneously, the modernisation of childbirth as an objective of colonial reform continued to have implications for the folk practices of traditional midwifery in Bengal. <italic>Dai</italic>s continued to be under attack from the reformers. Faults were identified in their practices and they were criticised for being ‘dirty’, ‘unclean’ and ‘ignorant’, breeding infection among women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0971521513482216">Mayo, 1937</xref>) and newborn children. They were held responsible for creating adverse health implications for mothers and babies, justifying upcoming Western midwifery training schools in India, including Bengal.</p>
<p>Financial and other support for institutions that ran training courses in ‘modern’ midwifery came overwhelmingly from the West. Female physicians and other personnel, who were at a disadvantage there, compared to their male counterparts, came to India to provide training and other services in maternal and child health care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0971521513482216">Qadeer, 1998</xref>). Initiatives for establishing ‘lying in’ hospitals and ‘modern’ nursing and midwifery training courses were assisted by the Dufferin Fund, after efforts by British educators and vicereines had failed in the late 19th century to effectively mobilise Bengali women in institutions like the Campbell Medical School. The British were relentlessly trying to modernise and medicalise childbirth. The picture was not very different in the early years of the 20th century. For instance, the Victoria Memorial Scholarship Fund that was organised by Lady Curzon in 1903 to introduce a training scheme for traditional midwives could not effectively retain the <italic>dai</italic>s and reform their practices. Those who attended the classes for a couple of weeks soon returned to their old habits. For the majority of women, practices at childbirth remained unchanged till 1910 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0971521513482216">Engels, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>A section of the urban elite, convinced by colonial arguments in favour of modern medicine as opposed to traditional indigenous knowledge and practices, had initially joined British attempts to modernise and actively engage in educating and motivating the public towards the colonial recommendations. This collaboration, however, was sustained only till the political wave of ‘nationalism’ picked up momentum in British India. The wave of nationalist politics affected the support of the Indian proponents of Western style midwifery influencing the trajectory of the <italic>dai</italic>s as well. In other words, in the wake of the Swadeshi movement in Bengal, the British reformist initiative failed; it was not strong enough to shake off the cultural hold of traditional midwifery in Bengal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0971521513482216">Engels, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Bengali women who were earlier prepared to follow the joint initiative of the ruling British and the socially dominant elite Indian medical male establishment in the management of childbirth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0971521513482216">Roberton, 1846</xref>), now started arguing against the official views. They argued over the issue of high maternal and child deaths in the first quarter of the century. British officials blamed the ‘early marriage’ of Bengali girls as the major cause for this, whereas Bengali doctors and other health workers, on a note of denial, pointed to the malnutrition of overworked women and the economic deterioration in Bengal province as the major causes of such deaths. This argument raised by the defiant Bengali on the basis of official census data was officially ignored. Eventually, not only white women doctors but also competing Indian woman doctors became the target of criticism by the Bengali press, who were charged by the wave of nationalism in Bengal.</p>
<p>Reforms in birthing and childcare initiated by these Swadeshi inspired Bengali women were welcome in the vernacular press. Their urban centred initiatives gradually embraced the villages too. In 1926, Chittaranjan Seva Sadan—a maternity hospital with a department for public health—was established for the special purpose of training midwives for village work. Unlike earlier colonial attempts, reforms under the Swadeshi movement were successful in mobilising middle class women into taking up midwifery and nursing. Reforms in education and continuing supervision of <italic>dai</italic>s for improving their practices were initiated in villages. Though the Indian nationalist women overcame the racist bias of their European predecessors, with their middle class background they could bring only limited benefit to the mothers and <italic>dai</italic>s in rural Bengal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0971521513482216">Engels, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>The colonial agenda in Bengal had influenced the institution of the <italic>dai</italic> who was part of the indigenous tradition. Among the upholders of Western medicine, a section of the Bengali elite followed the Europeans; the women followed their male counterparts in due course. Later on, the grim picture of maternal and new-born deaths during delivery emerged as a political concern among freedom-seeking Indians. Bengal was viewed by the British reformers as the heartland of opposition against colonial rule. Bengali women from urban elite families, who had earlier collaborated with the colonial project of modernising the management of childbirth, later adapted the colonial ideas of reforms in local contexts through their own independent organisations. Irrespective of all these developments villages of Bengal were transforming gradually anyway.</p>
<p>During the first half of the 20th century, some of the processes of social transformation had begun to touch the lives of the <italic>dai</italic>s in villages. For instance, <italic>dai</italic>s representing the communities of untouchable castes (variously termed Dalit or ‘Scheduled Caste’ after 1935, and especially after Independence) were oppressed by the laws of the Hindu <italic>Varna</italic> or caste system and consequently subjected to social discrimination by the members of the dominant castes. Located at the bottom of the social hierarchy, they were discriminated against till 1935 when anti-caste movements and their impact on British legislation brought some relief. New legislation opened up some social and economic opportunities for Dalit households through reservations, particularly in education, employment and land allotment, with the introduction of the<italic> Government of India Act 1935</italic>, followed by the <italic>Government of India (Scheduled Castes) Order 1936</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0971521513482216">1</xref></sup> and later additions or amendments.</p>
<p>In an account of change in two-and-a-half decades in some villages of Birbhum district, Amir Ali (1960) observed that a section of the Dalits (where many of the village <italic>dai</italic>s or medical women were located) had experienced upward social mobility through occupational or rather socio-economic transition. While the men left the villages in connection with employment, women continued to stay within the cultural fold of the household during this late phase of colonial rule. The official sex ratio in the district of Birbhum continued to be in favour of women till 1941 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0971521513482216">Soman, 1992</xref>); and the ‘modernisation’ of child birth touched the villages only lightly through the <italic>dai-</italic>training activities organised by the rural reconstruction unit of Visva-Bharati (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0971521513482216">Pathabhavan Praktoni News, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0971521513482216">Ray, Biswas and Sen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0971521513482216">Tagore, 1938</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0971521513482216">Visva-Bharati, 1928</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0971521513482216">1933</xref>). The <italic>dai</italic>s continued to conduct deliveries in the villages; they took care of the mother and the newborn as and when necessary, prescribing folk medicine largely for women and children.</p>
<p>In brief, irrespective of British policy and changing socio-economic formations in villages in the pre-Independence decades, the <italic>dai</italic> continued to be popular and a source of support for communities in Bengal. This was reflected in the uninterrupted practice of home deliveries. Western and colonial ideas of reforms and training of <italic>dai</italic>s were narrow and limited in their approach. They were a far cry from the cultural setting of Bengal. Taking note of the reality that most of the deliveries were still being conducted at home, the Bhore Committee<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0971521513482216">2</xref></sup> later recommended the integration of traditional <italic>dai</italic>s into the health care delivery system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0971521513482216">Government of India, 1946</xref>). At the time of Independence, this became an important reference point for health care planning. However, Western ideas have largely continued to influence Indian planners and maternity care interventions. But the dichotomy of tradition and modernity in the discourses on reforms in the area of childbirth has created two sets of midwives: one trained in Western knowledge and ‘modern’ practices and the other, who has retained traditional practices and folk wisdom. Attempts to transform the ‘traditional’ into ‘modern’ have continued after Independence through planned interventions in health care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0971521513482216">Soman, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Planning for Development in the Health Sector</title>
<p>The urgency of dealing with maternal and infant mortality came up as a concern at different points of development planning. Initiatives for improving maternity services could not ignore the huge pool of <italic>dai</italic>s available, especially when midwives trained in modern medicine were scarce in the rural health care services of West Bengal.</p>
<p>Around Independence, two committees made recommendations. The Bhore Committee, also known as the National Health Survey and Development Committee (1946), and the Sokhey Committee or the National Planning Committee (1948), both attended to the appalling state of maternal and child health. These prioritised integration of traditional <italic>dai</italic>s into the public health care services, offering equal space for traditional and modern midwives in the proposed infrastructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0971521513482216">Government of India, 1973</xref>). However, their equal status did not continue for long (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0971521513482216">Qadeer, 1998</xref>). At the turn of the 20th century official statistics from the West Bengal government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0971521513482216">Government of West Bengal, 2001</xref>) indicated that indigenous traditional <italic>dai</italic>s played a major role in maternal health care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0971521513482216">Soman, 2003</xref>). Even after more than a century of ‘reform’ 49 per cent of deliveries were conducted by <italic>dai</italic>s compared to 13.9 per cent conducted by modern medical doctors, nurses and midwives put together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0971521513482216">Government of West Bengal, 2001</xref>). While presenting the strength of government medical doctors, nurses, midwives and others, the official report maintained silence on the number of <italic>dai</italic>s who were providing crucial support to the public health care system in the state.</p>
<p>The status of the <italic>dai</italic>s in public health care has been always one of subservience. In the 1960s, they were recruited as community mobilisers or motivators in the Family Planning Programme. Towards the end of the 20th century, they were offered the status of ‘link worker’ to bridge the gap between communities and the public health care system under the National Rural Health Mission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0971521513482216">CHSJ, 2008</xref>). This trend of marginalising the <italic>dai</italic>s and using them at will in the public health care system has continued in the middle of shifting priorities and lopsided development in national planning and interventions. Institutional deliveries are explicitly promoted under the influence of the international community of donors and promoters of technologies in health care interventions, as well as under the Millenium Development Goals. West Bengal, as part of the Indian polity, has experienced the consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0971521513482216">Banerji, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0971521513482216">Qadeer, 2001</xref>). Qualitative research conducted between 1990 and 2002 indicates the overwhelming presence of such donors in health research in West Bengal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0971521513482216">Soman, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>At the beginning of the millennium—in 2004—a celebration of ‘Safe Motherhood Day’ organised by the state government and a donor agency turned into a platform for hot debate on traditional birth attendants—the <italic>dai</italic>s versus skilled birth attendants, namely, qualified nurses, midwives and doctors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0971521513482216">Soman, 2011</xref>). There were references to studies and publications of the World Health Organisation (WHO) that viewed the <italic>dai</italic>s as ‘ineffective’, incapable of being the long-term solution: at best they constituted a stopgap arrangement till the health care delivery system is fully supported by modern ‘skilled’ personnel. The root of this attitude, however, can be traced back in the 1990s when the WHO had actually shifted its stance from a recommendation to integrate trained <italic>dai</italic>s into modern maternity care (WHO, 1992) to the promotion of ‘skilled birth attendants for all’ (Stanton, 2013). The social implications of such a shift are many (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0971521513482216">Sadgopal, 2009</xref>). To put it squarely, the <italic>dai</italic>s have been subjected to discrimination within the public health care system. While ideas of Western medicine continue to influence <italic>dai-</italic>training and recommended practices, totally ignoring the folk wisdom of traditional midwifery, their training has not been effectively translated into desired ‘safe’ practices, such as, the use of kits, often due to lack of timely supplies or irregular follow-up at the state level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0971521513482216">Soman, 2003</xref>). Above all, training failed to release the <italic>dai</italic>s from the various charges of the colonial past of damaging society by being ‘ignorant’, ‘unscientific’, ‘unhygienic’ and to raise their status to that of ‘informed’, ‘scientific’ and ‘hygienic’ midwives.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the training of <italic>dai</italic>s has had a ripple effect, unanticipated by officialdom. Trained <italic>dai</italic>s shared with their un-trained rural colleagues the ideas, knowledge and skills that they had acquired. They also selected ideas, knowledge and skills that they thought would be viable for improving the outcomes of deliveries in their communities and settings. Some of these selective practices could influence those who were not formally trained. This ripple effect went unnoticed in the available documentations. The <italic>dai</italic>s of Bengal—trained or otherwise—have constantly combined both inherited traditional and acquired modern knowledge in their practice to meet the challenges of maternal and newborn care in West Bengal, particularly among communities that are not served or are underserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0971521513482216">Mukhopadhyay, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0971521513482216">Soman, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0971521513482216">1997</xref>). This diffusion of traditional health culture and modern Western practices in specific sites of deprivation and marginalisation and the consequent reformulations of folk practices and knowledge have been overlooked in state level planning exercises.</p>
<p>The subservient and marginalised position of the <italic>dai</italic>s within the health service system is matched by their inferior status in the family and society at large. Narratives of the <italic>dai</italic>s presented by Soman (2011) reinforce this fact. Sotika Bauri, Sundari Hembram and Vidya Bibi—residents of Bolpur–Sriniketan clusters of Birbhum district—are three protagonists in one of her narratives titled <italic>Dais in the new Millennium: A Story of Three Women</italic>. These women, socially and economically deprived, represent diverse communities of Dalits or ‘Scheduled Castes’, <italic>adivasi</italic>s or ‘tribal communities’ and Muslims. Intergenerational narratives on the socio-economic transition of surrounding villages (as depicted in another narrative: <italic>Dai—The Medical Woman in Changing Villages of Bolpur</italic> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0971521513482216">Soman, 2011</xref>) indicate that development has had a differential impact on the families of <italic>dai</italic>s across three generations in the 20th century, benefitting the better-off, irrespective of their ‘inferior’ position in the caste hierarchy. This has left the ‘chotolok’ (families considered ‘inferior’ by both caste and class position) behind with the responsibility for carrying on the <italic>dai</italic> tradition.</p>
<p>In the stratified villages of West Bengal, women across generations in various socio-economic strata reveal influences of changing social formations on their position in family and society to varying extents. They also reveal that socio-economic transformation in the area, however, touched their own lives more lightly than the lives of men. In the realm of maternity care practices, while a shift from home delivery to institutional delivery has been evident in rural West Bengal, risks or threats to women’s biological reproduction generated greater social concern in the patrilineal social structure, than concern for their general ill-health, compromised nutrition and lack of rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0971521513482216">Soman, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0971521513482216">1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0971521513482216">2006</xref>). It is within this contrast that continuity and change in the lives of <italic>dai</italic>s, who are socially and economically marginalised, need to be assessed. Mukhopadhyay too in her documentation (2008) states that <italic>dai</italic>s overwhelmingly represent marginalised social groups, such as, Dalits, <italic>adivasi</italic>s and Muslims, who are usually landless wage earners. According to Sadgopal (2009), this situation demands cognisance of the dimensions of social class, caste, gender, power and ideology by the ‘maternity services’ establishment that is ready to accept the ‘<italic>dai</italic> tradition’ into the health services system.</p>
<p>Villages in Bengal possess a heritage of folk knowledge and a tradition of healing and health protection. The <italic>dai</italic> tradition has preserved and nurtured this folk wisdom. Some of the <italic>dai</italic>s demonstrated special knowledge and skills of healing that included application of medicinal herbs. With the onslaught of urbanisation, commercialisation and encroachment on forest and agricultural lands, many species of the medicinal plants were lost. With this loss and a simultaneous growth of hospitals and dispensaries offering ‘quick fixes’ for illnesses and delivery care, <italic>dai</italic>s alone appear to be the chief repositories of traditional knowledge and practices in maternity care. They continue to serve both communities and the public health care system, and continue to be valued in places where planned development and public health care facilities are yet to be made accessible. They work for free or charge nominal fees, without any restriction on their availability or timings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0971521513482216">Banerji, 1985</xref>). Akhter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0971521513482216">2002</xref>) from Bangladesh has also reported that <italic>dai</italic>s there work under similar conditions. Although the public health administration in India has not only always discouraged them from playing their traditional role in social reproduction, but it underestimates their potential in the health care system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0971521513482216">CHSJ, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0971521513482216">Sadgopal, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>The <bold><italic>Dai</italic></bold> at the Interface of Medicine and Society</title>
<p>Feminist discourses in women’s health movements have been more concerned about the discrimination experienced by women gynaecologists in health care delivery systems under the influence of patriarchy rather than about the problems of indigenous midwives who continue to contribute to both biological and social reproduction in Indian society. In the changing socio-economic and political landscape of rural Bengal, the social history of the <italic>dai</italic> is located at the interface between medicine and society. The social/public image has been constructed under patriarchal influences in both, the changing health care and social systems.</p>
<p>The <italic>dai</italic> tradition witnessed ruptures in 20th century Bengal. At the beginning of the century, <italic>dai</italic>s served as an important support in not only biological but also social reproduction. They were socially offered the status of ‘mother’. Their status and dignity, however, came under threat when imperial projects of modernising medicine attempted to reform traditional practices in childbirth. Whatever was indigenous and traditional in delivery and childcare practices was rejected on the grounds of being ‘unscientific’ or ‘dangerous’. <italic>Dai</italic>s were blamed for being responsible for the high rate of infant deaths at birth. They were targeted for reform through training that they were certainly not comfortable with. They expressed their resistance by fleeing the training sessions that were organised in Calcutta. Later, though waves of ‘nationalism’ and demand for ‘self-reliance’ worked against the alliance of the elite (who had accepted modern childbirth practices) with colonial authorities promoting modern medicine, the image of the <italic>dai</italic> as the major cause of infant deaths persisted as did the need and attempts for their reform through training and education.</p>
<p>After Independence, state planning did not bring about any change in the approaches to <italic>dai</italic> training as Indian planners were overwhelmingly convinced of the superiority of modern Western medicine over traditional indigenous schools of medicine. International establishments, through their influence on research and policy formulations, encouraged the introduction of modern medical technologies into national health programmes. The first example is the Family Planning Programme, whose expansion ignored cultural contexts and human experiences. The event of ‘birthing’ in families was shifted from a cultural setting governed by the <italic>dai</italic> and family to modern health care institutions. Simultaneously, the aggressive Family Planning Programme reduced the <italic>dai</italic>s to a bunch of family planning motivators in communities. Later, the state agenda of population control became even more aggressive. In the name of protecting women’s health, it invaded the female body by controlling biological reproduction. The techno-centricity of the programmes ignored the fact that technology is invariably linked to social relations and has consequences for women’s role in not only biological but also social reproduction. The application of reproductive technologies in public health care programmes silently threatened the respect and relationship that the <italic>dai</italic>s had cherished so far with communities in rural Bengal.</p>
<p>At the end of the 20th century, international agencies initiated research and dialogue on policy formulations that, apart from repeating the previous century’s colonial blaming of the <italic>dai</italic>s (now known as TBA or traditional birth attendants), also proposed to replace them by a category of SBAs or skilled birth attendants. Skilled birth attendant is a collective consolidated category of modern midwives, nurses and physicians. According to the international advocates in health they alone can ensure safe delivery, particularly in emergency obstetric situations. In the process, the <italic>dai</italic>s have been disempowered and now granted the role of honorary link worker or potential activists to perform as community mobiliser in the National Rural Health Mission. The status of the <italic>dai</italic> has fallen in the 20th century from that of a dignified social reproducer to a subservient ‘link’ worker in public health care. Simultaneously, their status as women continued to be shaped by the patriarchal forces of the larger Bengali society.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier in this article, research in Birbhum district has shown that changing social formations in the villages have had impacts on the lives of women in general in communities and across generations. Amongst them, the<italic> dai</italic>s too (representing Hindu, Muslim and <italic>adivasi</italic> communities) experienced social change. An in-depth exploration of the change in a Hindu village indicated that welfare policies specific to the Dalits (or ‘Scheduled Castes’) had differential impacts on households, families and women. While the Sahas—traditional ‘toddy-makers’ of rural Birbhum—experienced upward socio-economic mobility, others, such as, Bagdis or Bauris, remained far behind. <italic>Dai</italic>s from the better-off Saha households improved their status. Their daughters moved out of the village with aspirations of becoming a modern midwife or nurse. Thus, a new category of modern midwives emerged—women bestowed with economic independence that could change gender relations within and beyond the family. In contrast, <italic>dai</italic>s from poorer Dalit households continued to live the lives of women who were yet to benefit from welfare policies and became further marginalised. The story of Sotika Bauri who is attached as a ‘honorary trained <italic>dai</italic>’ to the <italic>Surul</italic> sub-centre is an example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0971521513482216">Soman, 2011</xref>). Having little control over their withering tradition and their subordinate social position in family and society, <italic>dai</italic>s like Sotika Bauri and her contemporaries like Vidya Bibi and Sundari Hembram find it hard to bargain with the public health care system on irregularities of payments, supplies and lack of other types of support.</p>
<p>Sotika is caught in the contradiction that exists between the inherited tradition of the <italic>dai</italic> and her honorary position in the world of modern medicine and midwifery. While the tradition made the <italic>dai</italic> ‘socially accountable (<italic>jawabdihi</italic>) to [one’s] own communities’, she admitted that she accepted her lower status in her present honorary role of community-motivator for institutional delivery with the hope of earning a ‘salary’. However, there were women like Vidya Bibi of Moldanga or Sundari Hembram of Balipara who silently asserted themselves by remaining independent in their practice and being selective in the adoption of practices that the ‘doctors’ and ‘nurses’ had taught them in training—thus protecting their own independent space and the tradition to the extent possible. According to Vidya Bibi, Sotika had compromised her ‘autonomy’ by joining the (government) health centre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0971521513482216">Soman, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Development has not only undermined woman-centred folk wisdom, but also reduced the autonomy of the <italic>dai</italic>. It has reduced the status of the <italic>dai</italic> from ‘social reproducer’ to ‘birth attendant’ and later ‘link activist’<italic>.</italic> While marginalisation of the <italic>dai</italic> is a reality, there is a thread of continuity in the tradition. The tradition that has been part of folk wisdom sharing strong connections with the classical texts—Ayurveda in particular—now sustains marginalised sections of Bengali society who are un-served or underserved by state social policies and public health interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0971521513482216">Mukhopadhyay, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0971521513482216">Soman, 2011</xref>). Data provided by the third report of the National Family Health Survey for rural West Bengal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0971521513482216">IIPS, 2008</xref>) reiterates a similar contrast where a larger proportion of births (more than 60 per cent) is conducted at home by the <italic>dai</italic>, in spite of modernisation and marginalisation of the institution through the 20th century. It also reveals another aspect of the story indicating that the traditional role of the <italic>dai</italic> in post natal care has almost withered away (reduced to 2 per cent cases) over the same period of time, while one-fourth of the mothers continue to live with absolutely no care from government institutions.</p>
<p><italic>Dai</italic>s are doubly marginalised—first, as auxiliary workers in the health care system and second, as women whose lives are governed by patriarchal norms of the society. In the domain of the health care system, they have come full circle in three successive stages. In the beginning of the 20th century they faced attacks from modern Western medicine facilitated by the colonial power and the Bengali elite, with the latter changing their views under the influence and politics of nationalism. In the 1950s, Indian planners had recognised the prevailing role of the <italic>dai</italic> in rural areas and needed their support in the development of the health services as well. However, the national Family Planning Programme, aiming to control population by controlling biological reproduction, used women as guinea pigs, violating their rights to health and dignity. While the status of women remained unchanged even in successive programmes on reproductive health or the rural health mission, traditional <italic>dai</italic>s were displaced from their traditional position and utilised as intermediaries in social mobilisation.</p>
<p>In the current social scenario of rural Bengal, the <italic>dai</italic>s are popularly identified as a collective of women engaged in maternity and childcare services with inputs from the public health care system. In reality, they represent a plural institution. <italic>Dai</italic>s, across generations, reflect a mix of traditional and modern influences in their practices. Although the majority of them have been exposed to modern midwifery through training, the nature and intensity of training and the subsequent impact on their practices vary widely. Any attempt to compartmentalise them simply into ‘trained’ and ‘untrained’ categories, engaged in modern and traditional practices, would be rather simplistic. Knowledge and experiences are exchanged between the two categories through regular social interactions. As evident in the earlier section of this article, this plurality might also have roots in the influence of socio-economic transformation on social classes in rural Bengal in the 20th century when the institution of the <italic>dai</italic> underwent diversification. In time, traditional practices got limited to the less developed regions and poorer households within villages. Located in the internal gender dynamics within the patrilineal families of Bengal, their lives have changed following that of their men. They have benefitted marginally in terms of division of labour, control over resources and in other spheres. The social history of the <italic>dai</italic> in 20th century Bengal, thus, has been shaped by marginalisation of the institution within the health care system and the continuing social subordination of women. The reinstatement of <italic>dai</italic>s as bearers of knowledge and as healers is important in the context of the wider struggles of Indian women today.</p>
