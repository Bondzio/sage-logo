<p>Just as the first reports of cuckoos herald the spring, so the first reports of multiple norovirus outbreaks herald the start of winter in the UK. This outbreak column is dedicated to the bane of most infection prevention and control team’s (IPCT) winter – norovirus outbreaks. It may seem a little incongruous to publish a norovirus outbreak column when winter is over; however, this is when we should be busy preparing for norovirus winter 2012–13. It may also be difficult at this time to drum up enthusiasm for norovirus; sometimes when we think we know the problem, and/or the solution, there is a reduced appetite to read anew on a topic. However, the four articles (a recent insights paper, two outbreak reports and an epidemiological review of outbreak data from residential care facilities), discussed here remind us there is always something new to learn, or at least there are new ways of delivering a message, even when the topic is very familiar.</p>
<p>The recent insights paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177412442580">Marshall and Bruggink, 2011</xref>), provides a useful synopsis of the latest literature on noroviruses covering genetics, virus shedding, survivability and meteorological factors, with which to better understand our winter challenge. The new genetic information is that noroviruses, like flu viruses, undergo frequent genetic change – by mutation and recombination. This genetic change explains some but, according to the authors, not all of the alterations in the variation of virulence of norovirus from season to season.</p>
<p>The summary on norovirus excretion patterns clarifies the reason why sometimes wards are shut, then opened, then immediately shut again (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177412442580">Marshall and Bruggink, 2011</xref>). Norovirus can be excreted for some considerable time by people who have been infected – in one individual 44.5 days post natural infection. This information can be communicated to the clinical staff to enable them to better understand that reopening of the ward is not the point when it can be guaranteed that no further cases will arise. Reopening the ward is the point when any ongoing risk of cross-transmission should be manageable with good infection control. As might be expected, there was nothing new to refute the data on the survivability of norovirus in the environment. Indeed one relatively new study found that norovirus could survive for up to 28 days at room temperature on surfaces that come into contact with food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177412442580">Marshall and Bruggink, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>These authors also reveal (and it was a revelation to me at least) that norovirus outbreaks occur most frequently in the warmer months in the southern hemisphere; thus indicating that norovirus outbreaks are not associated with temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177412442580">Marshall and Bruggink, 2011</xref>). They report that there is evidence to suggest that rainfall may be associated with norovirus outbreaks; a correlation having been found between peaks of rainfall and peaks of outbreaks. This, however, cannot be the entire picture. If this were a ubiquitous association then living in a very wet (rainfall) west of Scotland, one would expect to have a continuous high level of norovirus outbreaks and this is thankfully not the case. The need for still further research into meteorological, genetic and environmental factors is well made by the authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177412442580">Marshall and Bruggink, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In the first outbreak column I said that I would include outbreak papers where there were original ways of presenting the data. Both these next two reports have something to offer on this topic. The first is a norovirus outbreak in a long-term care facility by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177412442580">Carpentier et al (2011)</xref>. This report describes an outbreak that took place in winter 2008. In this report four epi curves are presented, an overall outbreak epi curve, and then one for each of the three floors of the facility. The epi curves are presented not just as incidence but as a combined incidence and prevalence epi curve. This presentation provides a description of not just how the outbreak is progressing, but also how much the ward is still at risk due to the presence of symptomatic patients. The three individual floor epi curves combined with the text reveal that the outbreak started on 5 November on two floors, but did not spread to the third floor until 12 November. Unfortunately, the infection control team were not alerted until 14 November. The presentation of the descriptive data in this outbreak (107 patients, median age 83 years, attack rates by ward and the use of supplementary control measures) details the thoroughness with which the problem was investigated and managed once reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177412442580">Marshall and Bruggink, 2011</xref>). However because of the delay in reporting, the opportunity to change the shape of the epi curve was lost.</p>
<p><italic>Would early reporting have made a difference?</italic> This was the question that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757177412442580">Davis et al (2011)</xref> attempted to answer from an epidemiological study of 264 outbreaks (70.4% of which were confirmed as being caused by norovirus) in residential care facilities in Queensland, Australia. They showed that outbreaks that were reported to public health within 24 hours were of significantly shorter duration (7.5 days) when compared to outbreaks notified within two to three days (10 days), or longer than four days, (14 days) (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). In addition, they showed that outbreaks in larger facilities (&gt;150 beds) had a significantly smaller attack rate than in smaller facilities (15% for &gt;150 beds vs. 25% for &lt;=150 beds, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757177412442580">Davis et al, 2011</xref>). It is possible that the larger facilities can be more compartmentalised and segregated, facilitating better infection control. Therefore, had the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177412442580">Marshall and Bruggink (2011)</xref> IPCT been alerted earlier then it is possible that fewer cases could have resulted and the facility may have returned to normal functioning sooner. There clearly needs to be more data of the type reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757177412442580">Davis et al (2011)</xref> from the UK and Ireland. Perhaps to facilitate early effective control measure instigation, the time-to-reporting a norovirus community outbreak could become a useful quality indicator for care homes and other long-term care facilities.</p>
<p>The final outbreak report from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757177412442580">Thornley et al (2011)</xref> is of an ‘aeroplane outbreak’ and manifested when successive flight crews became sick with norovirus from continuously contaminated on-board source(s). These authors present an epi curve made up of dates of new staff cases with shading indicating the different exposed flights they were on. Five passengers reported to the company that they were ill, but many others are likely to have been ill – further case-finding among these cohorts did not take place. However, the detailed epidemiology of time (which flight, duration of the flight), place (where on the plane the crew worked, which toilets they used) and person (roles on the flight) were gathered and presented. There is a detailed description of the facilities and functioning of the 304-seated aeroplane. As there were no reports of illness before the aeroplane exposure, the conclusion was that a passenger who vomited on the carpet in economy class was the index case. The vomitus was ‘cleaned up’ by one flight attendant. A total of 29 crew members became ill. The attack rate was 43%. However, the key finding eloquently illustrated by the epi curve was the successively decreasing number of new crew cases over time – a dose relationship. The aeroplane was thereafter subjected to thorough cleaning and disinfection by staff wearing personal protective equipment. The lessons for hospital staff from this outbreak report are clear; lack of personal protective equipment and a lack of effective disinfection of the vomitus with a virucidal agent facilitated the spreading of the virus through contact, and by maintaining a viable nidus for new flight attendants (and passengers) to be cross-infected from on subsequent flights. This paper provides a useful anecdote to convey to healthcare workers key messages regarding norovirus survivability, the importance of decontamination and the consequences of a failure to effectively decontaminate.</p>
<p>So, even if there is no new information for IPCTs here, I hope the descriptions of the novel presentations of the outbreaks, and the data associated with the outbreaks may provide new ways to get the messages to help prepare hospitals and healthcare workers for our next norovirus season challenge.</p>
