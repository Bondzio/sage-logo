<body>
<p>Wilson disease is well known for its protean psychiatric manifestations including affective disorders, behavioral/personality abnormalities, cognitive impairment, and schizophrenia-like states.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812465011">1</xref></sup> Interestingly, the authors observed isolated occurrence of obsessive-compulsive behavior, a rare finding, in a child with Wilson disease after 1 year of treatment.</p>
<p>The authors had a 12-year-old boy who initially presented with dysarthria, deterioration in hand writing, and behavioral problems including inappropriate cheerfulness and excessive talkativeness of 1 year duration. He also had history of jaundice 2 years previously. He had Kayser-Fleischer rings, risus sardonicus, dysarthria, and dystonia affecting predominantly upper limbs. On investigations, he had low serum ceruloplasmin levels (4 mg/dL; normal 20-40 mg/dL) and high urinary copper excretion (121 µg/dL; normal &lt; 25 µg/dL). Magnetic resonance imaging of brain revealed bilateral caudate and putamen hyperintensities. He was diagnosed as a case of Wilson’s disease and treated with <sc>d</sc>-penicillamine, zinc acetate, pyridoxine, and pacitane. There was significant reduction in dystonia and decrease in dysarthria over 1 year period. Later, he developed frequent hand-washing behavior over 2 months. The hand-washing episodes occurred 10-12 times a day, each episode lasting about 4-5 minutes. The child believed this would prevent him from germ contamination. He also believed that these thoughts were his own and were unreasonable. He tried to resist them but failed. His behavior gradually increased significantly to a level where it was disturbing his activities of daily living. There was no associated neurologic worsening. There was poor compliance in dietary measures, supported by low urinary copper excretion. A diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disease was made as per <italic>DSM-IV</italic> criteria (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Child was treated with fluoxetine and strict compliance with medications and dietary measures and 80% improvement was observed over a 2-month period.</p>
<p>There are important learning observations in this case. First, isolated obsessive-compulsive behavior, although rare, can occur in Wilson’s disease on treatment. There are anecdotal reports of association of obsessive-compulsive with Wilson’s disease,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812465011">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812465011">3</xref></sup> but isolated occurrence on treatment has not been reported. The second interesting fact is the rapid response in obsessive-compulsive symptoms with intervention (fluoxetine and strict compliance with therapy); this is contrary to the fact that psychiatric symptoms in Wilson’s disease are usually refractory to symptomatic therapy. Third, the concurrence of Wilson’s disease and obsessive-compulsive disorder suggests common sharing of neuroanatomic substrate, probably basal ganglia. This probably also explains the co-occurrence of obsessive-compulsive symptoms in other basal ganglia diseases, for example, Huntington’s chorea and Sydenham’s chorea.</p>
