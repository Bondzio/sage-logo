<p>Titanium in the form of TiO<sub>2</sub> can be used not only as a delustring agent, but also as a photocatalytic compound in smart and high-tech textiles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0040517511435005">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) is applied to textile materials due to its high chemical resistance, high refractive index and photocatalytic effect. The other advantages of using titanium dioxide are its affordable price and large-scale production. For this very same reason, titanium dioxide has been used in several fields related to the textile industry, such as paper production and coating. Today, the consumption of TiO<sub>2</sub> has reached 10<sup>5</sup> tons per year for the production of textile materials. The greater part of TiO<sub>2</sub> has been used for such things as a delustring agent in textile materials. It is a substance that scatters light passing through a textile structure. TiO<sub>2</sub> is applicable at a concentration of about 0.5% of the weight of fibers being produced, for the purpose of dulling by means of TiO<sub>2</sub>. The other applications were found with the development of nanotechnologies, which are based on its chemical resistance and, in particular, its photocatalytic effect.</p>
<p>Photocatalysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0040517511435005">Figure 1</xref>) is the ability to transform the energy of ultraviolet (UV) radiation into chemical energy, which can be used for the decomposition of hazardous organic substances in liquid or gaseous environments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0040517511435005">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0040517511435005">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aim of this study is observations of the influence of textile structure on the results obtained by the laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) method, observation of the structural changes of textiles by the laser pulses and to generally introduce the LIBS method to elemental analysis of textiles.</p>
<p>This process can be used for the cleaning and decolorization of wastewater. The molecules of textile dyes are very sensitive and can be easily decomposed by photocatalysis. This decomposition is very interesting, especially for the textile industry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0040517511435005">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0040517511435005">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>In catalytic processes, it is advantageous to use a catalyst with a high specific surface such as materials in the form of fibers. Best are finer fibers (nanofibers) with a diameter of about 100 nm with a high specific surface. These nanofibers can be obtained by electrospinning TiO<sub>2</sub> sol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0040517511435005">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another approach to preparing a photocatalytic agent is making another material and covering it with a layer of TiO<sub>2</sub>, for which we can use common organic polymers as substrates. There are different ways of applying TiO<sub>2</sub>. One is to spread it with plasma or using the sol-gel methods of nanoparticle deposition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0040517511435005">7</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0040517511435005">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Textiles can be used as a substrate, which is coated with titanium dioxide nanoparticles. Fabric with this modification can be used, for example, for cleaning of water or for self-cleaning fabrics with antibacterial effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0040517511435005">10</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="sec1-0040517511435005"><title>Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy method</title>
<p>LIBS is a novel dynamically developing method of atomic spectroscopy with a wide range of applications. In the LIBS technique, a high-power laser pulse is focused on to a sample surface and a plasma plume forms as a result of the interaction of the laser beam with the sample matter. The plasma created breaks down all sample chemical bonds and ionizes many of the constituent elements. The spectral emission occurs as a result of the subsequent relaxation of constituent excited species. Emission from the atoms and ions is collected by a fiber optic lens and analyzed by a spectrometer and gated detector. Wavelengths of the spectral lines emitted can be used to determine the elemental composition of the sample intensities of characteristic lines corresponding to the concentrations of elements in the sample.</p>
<p>The most significant and recent applications of LIBS described in the literature are the analysis of alloys (molten samples, detection of defects, surface analysis, analysis of light elements and so on), archaeological materials and art objects (low invasive analysis, possibility to perform in situ measurements, high spatial discrimination, rapidity and capability for direct analysis without sample pre-treatment, connection of analytical and cleaning process), pharmaceutical products (fast multi-elemental analysis), aerosols (mobile systems for direct analysis of automatically acquired aerosol filter samples), military, homeland security and forensic samples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0040517511435005">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>In LIBS, a high-power laser pulse is focused on a small spot of the sample, which ablates the surface layer and successively heats and ionizes the vaporized matter, producing plasma. The spectral emission, which occurs as a result of the subsequent relaxation of constituent excited species, is measured by an appropriate spectrometer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0040517511435005">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The LIBS method is useful for the analysis of many elements in textile structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0040517511435005">13</xref></sup> and, in particular, titanium content is important from the practical point of view.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0040517511435005"><title>Experimental details</title>
<sec id="sec3-0040517511435005"><title>Textile fabric</title>
<p>The experiment was carried out on a polyester fabric manufactured from delustred fibers (containing TiO<sub>2</sub> particles). The fabric structure is plain wave (weft: 200 per 10 cm<sup>−1</sup>, warp: 410 per 10 cm<sup>−1</sup>), with areal weight of 180 g m<sup>−2</sup>. The concentration of Ti in the fabric is 1481 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> (estimated by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy).</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0040517511435005"><title>Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy spectrometer</title>
<p>The LIBS spectrometer used (LEA S500, Solar TII Ltd., Belarus) is fully described by Mo and Ye.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0040517511435005">5</xref></sup> The instrument integrates a dual pulse Q-switched Nd:YAG laser, operating at 1064 nm. The laser emits two colinear pulses of about 10 ns duration, with energy per pulse variable between 80 and 150 mJ at a maximum repetition rate of 20 Hz. The inter-pulse delay can be set from 0 to 20 ms. The spectrograph has a focal length 500 mm and grating 1800 lines mm<sup>−1</sup>. The wavelength range of the spectrograph is 170–800 nm. Recording of spectra is carried out by means of a back-thinned and front-illuminated charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (2048 pixels, pixel size 14 µm) with a minimal integration time of 1 ms.</p>
<p>The adjusted parameters of LIBS (LEA 500) are as follows: emitted light is measured in intervals of wavelengths between 385 and 415 nm, the count of double-shots is from 1 to 20, the lit width 15 µm, the diameter of the irradiated spot is 400 µm, the lamp energy is 20 J in each shot and the time distance between two shots in one double-shot is 7 microseconds.</p>
<p>Extracted from the measured spectra were values connected with carbon concentration in the sample (carbon peak at 388.340 nm) and values connected with titanium concentration in the sample (titanium peak at 399.864 nm). The background was measured near to the titanium peak – at the wavelength 399.796 nm.</p>
<p>The sample was irradiated by the laser in the LEA 500 instrument at six different places (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0040517511435005">Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0040517511435005" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title>
<p>The values of background and both measured peaks (titanium and carbon) decrease with the quantity of shots. The background and peak of carbon decrease linearly with the quantity of shots, but the titanium does so non-linearly. The average values from all six measured places are presented in graphical form in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0040517511435005">Figure 3</xref>. The variation of results is relatively high. Each measured dependence is different (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0040517511435005">Table 1</xref>), because the textile structure is uneven (unhomogenic). The diameter of the irradiated place spot in the instrument LEA 500 is a maximum of 0.4 mm. This value was used in the experiment, but 0.4 mm is not enough to obtain stable values of textile structures. The diameter of the spot used is smaller then the size of a structural period in the used fabric, so that we can obtain different ratios of polymer/air at different locations of measurement. Samples of spot locations on textile structures are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0040517511435005">Figure 4</xref>.

The energy of a single shot is high enough to decompose some fibers and a high quantity of shots can go through the textile structure. The minimal quantity of shots necessary to go through the textile is connected with the quantity of polymer below the irradiated area.

<p>We can theoretically divide the experimental results into two groups. In group A the textiles show higher resistance to laser shots. Up to the eighth measurement we obtain stable values of carbon content. These measurements were realized in location (a) in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0040517511435005">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0040517511435005">6</xref>.</p>
<p>In group B the textiles are showing lower resistance to laser shots. Measured values are decreasing approximately linear with the quantity of shots. This measurement was realized in location (b) in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0040517511435005">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0040517511435005">6</xref>. The average dependence of measurements at locations (a) and (b) is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0040517511435005">Figure 7</xref>.

<p>In all cases (A and B), we obtain a relatively stable value after 13 double-shots, which exhibits the laser going through the textile (creation of a hole in the structure).</p>
<p>All measured values are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0040517511435005">Figure 8</xref>. The measured values of titanium peak, carbon peak and background are presented in graphical form in order to show possible connections.

<p>Theoretically the connection between titanium and carbon peaks should be linear, because the real ratio between these two elements in delustred fibers is stable.</p>
<p>The real dependence is different, probably because carbon and titanium need different energy levels of plasma for light emission, and the property of plasma depends on the quantity of evaporated polymer.</p>
<p>From the presented results (coefficient of variation as a function of the number of double-shots) it is clear that the increase of pulse quantity increases the variation of results. The lower quantity of pulses does not have enough energy to make holes in the fiber structure and the laser beam was more effectively used to create plasma and emit radiation detected by the LIBS detector.

<sec id="sec6-0040517511435005" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Using LIBS to analyze the elements in textile samples is possible, but the results are connected with the position of the spot on the textile, especially when the size of the irradiated location is smaller than the structural unit of the textile. The first double-shot at one place shows accurate results, which are only slightly influenced by the position of the irradiated place on the textile structure. The next measurements in the same location are connected not only with the chemical composition of fibers, but also with the structure (porosity, thickness, etc.) of the textile. If we would like to estimate the chemical composition it is necessary to use one double-shot on one location.</p></sec>
