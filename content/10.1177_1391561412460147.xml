<p>Countries across the world, more importantly the developing countries, are now more integrated compared to a decade and a half back. Growth of an economy therefore no longer solely depends on internal factors. International factors are too important in determining an economy’s growth. This is an era of globalization. Faster, low-cost and technologically advanced transportation across countries is the key to this globalization, where we find a strong relationship between growth in international trade and the logistics performance. Efficient logistics not only ensures faster movement of goods and services but also improves country’s competitiveness.</p>
<p>Express delivery services (EDS), which refer to the collection, transport and delivery of documents, printed matter, parcels, and/or other goods on an expedited basis, while tracking and maintaining control of these items throughout the supply of service. It is an integrated service that covers door-to-door transport of goods across and within borders on timely and efficient manner. Originated in early 1960s in the United States, EDS industry has become a key component of international trade. A key feature of this industry is that it handles Customs clearances and reduces the requirements of multiple agents. In developing countries such as India, the EDS industry has long been present but it saw high growth in recent years with increased global integration, entry of multinational enterprises, and liberalization of transport services, among others. Normally, EDS offers premium services vis-à-vis ordinary mail delivery services. It basically handles high-value or low-volume shipments of critical and/or time-sensitive goods. Most low-weight, high-value items and niche products are transported through EDS rather than freight forwarding service providers. Stronger EDS generates an efficient logistics system, undoubtedly.</p>
<p>There is another important reason why EDS is essential for South–South trade. Developing countries are having higher trade among themselves, more particularly in the period of ongoing second phase of the global financial crisis. We see vertical fragmentation of production across borders. Production blocks have been fast appearing in a global/regional value chain, driven by multinational enterprises, where stronger service links between production blocks are critical to trade and competitiveness. Just-in-Time (JIT) delivery of goods, and also services, is the key to this new wave of trade. The increasing use of JIT shipments has increased the importance of EDS. India is no exception. We find that EDS has become a key component to the logistics efficiency in India as it is the case in other developing countries such as China and Brazil. More and more EDS companies are now doing business in India. However, EDS is still in nascent stage of development in India, but it has high potential. There has been not much account of the EDS industry in India till this book of Oxford University Press was published.</p>
<p>Unlike China, the present logistics chain in India is heavily fragmented and yet to become seamless. Therefore, improvement of the supply chain and logistics will be extremely important to raise India’s competitiveness and in this context role of the EDS becomes paramount. Development of EDS would not only promote higher trade in goods but also generate newer services trade in transportation, financial and information technology sectors. In other words, an efficient and competitive EDS segment is a prerequisite to sustain the growth of services-driven Indian economy, and to promote growth and efficiency of manufacturing sector.</p>
<p>This book is the first attempt to present India’s EDS industry. It has eight chapters which articulately present a detailed discussion on EDS in India and its future prospect. Ideally, this book has two distinct contents: in the first part, we find features, trends and perspectives of EDS in India and abroad, and a more critical discussion on its prospect through reforms and integration was carried out in the second part. Authors have made a brave attempt to identify the barriers to EDS, and argued for reforms in order to strengthen the EDS industry and also to improve the logistics efficiency. In Chapter 7, authors have also discussed India’s negotiating strategies for EDS and policy options in WTO and selected FTAs that India has signed already or are under negotiation. The findings on barriers are indeed credible as these are based on primary survey. The study has shown that corruption at offices and on roads is the foremost barrier faced by SMEs of EDS in India, whereas inadequate airport infrastructure was found as key barrier faced by large EDS enterprises. Bureaucracy, red-tapeism and paperwork, poor rail and road infrastructure were also identified as important barriers to growth of the EDS in India. Authors then discussed the reforms requirement in India in those particular areas which are critical to the growth of EDS industry in India and improvement of logistics efficiency.</p>
<p>This book contains a rich discussion on India’s emerging EDS. However, analytical content would have been improved had the authors taken the help of econometrics or other quantitative techniques, more particularly in Chapter 7. With large sample size, quantitative assessment of barriers to EDS would have added further research value to this effort of presenting India’s express delivery system. Also a question: Why there was no concluding chapter? Perhaps, Chapter 8 could have been divided into two chapters—one is exclusively on barriers and reforms, and other is on conclusions and the way forward. In any way, authors should be congratulated for presenting this timely piece of study. Policy-makers and logistics companies in India and abroad will gain a lot from this publication as well as students who are pursuing advanced courses in international economics.</p>
