<p>Prenatal testing and screening once meant maternal care; prenatal screening now is commonly understood to mean fetal testing—while blood is drawn to check maternal status, of far greater social interest is the blood drawn to test the fetus. While maternal heart tones may well be taken, it is the sound of the fetal heartbeat that draws clients and practitioners alike. With the invention of technologies that permit visual access to the fetus (the ultrasound scans now up on Facebook pages) prenatal screening entered a whole new dimension.</p>
<p>There are some really interesting questions raised in Kate Reed’s <italic>Gender and Genetics</italic> on prenatal testing, focusing primarily on “to what extent men are involved in screening” and “how advantageous is this for both men and women” (p. 162), but the value of the testing and screening is entirely unquestioned: “As well as being hugely beneficial for clinicians, ultrasound and imaging techniques more generally are seen to offer significant benefits for pregnant women” (p. 61).</p>
<p>Does Reed mean that clinical care is hugely improved? Fetal imaging is primarily useful for determining which pregnancies to terminate; only very rarely are prenatal treatment options available for conditions discovered in imaging. As to benefits for the pregnant women, the tests are claimed, in work cited here, to heighten a woman’s sense of prenatal bonding, reduce fears about labor and birth, increase her confidence in the health of the baby. With the routinization of testing, any given woman denied screening might feel concern, but there are no data that women today are better bonded, or less fearful of labor, or more confident in their baby’s health than were women before the technologies came into use.</p>
<p>But if we start from the assumption, as Reed does, that this is a wonderful technology for clinicians and pregnancy care, it makes sense then to look at how it works for men and women, together and separately.</p>
<p>Her work began with her own experience: a prenatal blood draw that showed her fetus to be at risk for a recessive genetic condition. If a woman screens positive, testing male partners for the genetic trait does not actually confirm or refute a diagnosis (as Reed mistakenly says on page 89). It just determines whether the fetus is indeed at risk, assuming that the man is the genetic father. If both parents are positive, the resulting fetus has a one-in-four chance of having the condition. In my own first pregnancy almost forty years ago, as Ashkenazi Jews, my husband and I worried about Tay-Sachs disease. The testing was not then a routine part of prenatal care, so without much discussion, he went off to have his blood tested: if he was negative there was no point in checking my blood. Now maternal blood testing for genetic conditions has become routine, and if the woman is found positive, rather than doing invasive testing on the fetus and risking miscarriage, the logical next step is to first test the father. (The assumption that the partner is always the father is never questioned in this book, though not all babies are the genetic children of their social fathers.) If the fetus was affected and one would not terminate the pregnancy, then the entire exercise is pointless.</p>
<p>What can Reed teach us about gender and the prenatal, looking at two social parents, one of whom has a clear and obvious bio-genetic relationship with the fetus (assuming a pregnancy without egg donation) and one of whom may be claiming such a relationship? When you look only at heterosexual couples in a pregnancy, as she has, differences between the carrying and non-carrying partner are going to look like gender. If you looked at two women, one bearing mother and one co-mother, you might see some of the very same behavior, but you would not think to “gender it.” Is it even noteworthy that the non-pregnant partner is less interested in being present for a blood test on the pregnant woman, the results of which will come in a week or so, than to be present for the ultrasound with its immediate feedback? In adoption and surrogacy, parents with known carrying-mothers are not particularly interested in being present for maternal serum screening blood draws, but very much want the ultrasound faxed over. Do we learn anything about gender?</p>
<p>The main limitation of the book lies in the data: drawn from a northern city in the United Kingdom, there were only 38 respondents, 22 pregnant women and 16 of their partners, some as few as 17 weeks pregnant. If all of these were targeted cases where the woman screened positive for a recessive condition, that might be enough to learn something. But these were a rather random assortment of pregnancies, which is a good thing with big numbers, but fairly useless here: women were in their first pregnancy and their fifth; one partner or more in prior pregnancies; partners who were present or stationed overseas; respondents ranged from 18 to 40; had healthy babies and babies with microcephaly; were physicians and plumbers and nannies and nurses and unemployed. How can we make sense of the role of gender in all this?</p>
<p>One chapter focuses on race/ethnicity: in the United Kingdom where the research was done, women are routinely offered a (growing) range of blood tests which screen for fetal health and risk rates. Some of the screens are targeted to ethnic “risk groups,” such as Ashkenazi Jews for Tay-Sachs (though rates of that condition, not noted here, are higher among ethnic British than they are for other populations around the world) or the sickle-cell anemia trait among people of African descent. The heightened risk for cystic fibrosis among white British people is also not noted in this book as an ethnic risk—it is the racialized “others” who have risks, a belief the authors note in the respondents. Reed does acknowledge that the research related to ethnicity and race is “tentative” in her work because of the small numbers—but this is beyond small numbers. Of the 16 men, all but four were white British. Two were white Irish, leaving us one South Asian and one black African. Among the 22 women, all but five were white British—two British Asians, one British Mauritian, one Czech, and one African. So what do you make of a sentence like, “Although sample size was small, Black, South Asian and Mauritian women in this study tended to accept screening for Down Syndrome in the same way that most white respondents did” (p. 153)?</p>
<p>An N of 1 is just always problematic: there is one woman who had five pregnancies, with at least two different men, two of them have disabilities, she is unemployed, her current partner is a semi-employed plasterer, and oh yes, she is 27 years old. She reports the midwives “were perfectly nice to me but I get the impression that they thought here we go again. Why doesn’t she just pack it in, you know, they look at me with me five kids, not all have got the same dads and some of em with problems and you know they make assumptions.” This Reed reports is “the clearest illustration in this study of the ways in which women are ranked by the medical profession according to their genetic capital” (p. 112). Genetic capital? Do we have any reason to think that is what the midwives were thinking about? If we had a number of women with histories of genetic problems being treated differently, we would have something to look at. One 27-year-old unemployed mother of five gives many bases on which to raise concern.</p>
<p>We should, as Reed has begun, do more research on the role of gender in prenatal care and management: this project is a start in that direction.</p>
