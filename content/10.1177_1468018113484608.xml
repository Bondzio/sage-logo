<p>The study of how ideas and discourse evolve within international organizations is one of the most important frontiers of global social policy theory. Setting forth an ideational approach to understanding their behavior, the article argues that international organizations are more open systems than most realists and structuralists believe. Their constantly evolving discourse and ideas can directly impact domestic policy. In order to stress this reality, drawing on the case of pension privatization, the article compares these organizations with ideologically driven domestic think tanks which, as far as pension privatization is concerned, have proved much more rigid in their policy prescriptions than the World Bank and other international organizations traditionally associated with the global pension privatization campaign.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>One of the core beliefs in the global social policy literature is that some international organizations and coalitions are more liberal – or more socialist – than others, reflecting the political biases of leading states. In their 1997 volume, Bob Deacon and his colleagues argued that, on social policy, the World Bank and the IMF followed the liberal line of the United States while the European Union and the ILO took a more ‘European’ or socialist approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468018113484608">Deacon et al., 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1468018113484608">Robert O’Brien (2002</xref>: 144) similarly classifies international organizations into those ‘with little concern for social policy’ versus those that advocate a more vigorous social policy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1468018113484608">Robert Wade (1996)</xref>, in an outstanding blow-by-blow account of debates over the landmark World Bank publication <italic>The East Asian Miracle</italic>, argues that liberal forces within the Bank successfully fought off Japanese attempts to raise questions about liberal development strategies and to highlight the successes of state-directed investment in a clear cases of ‘paradigm maintenance.’ International organizations, in this view, have more or less fixed preferences on social policy and other matters that reflect the politics of their masters (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1468018113484608">Wade, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1468018113484608">2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Taking seriously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1468018113484608">O’Brien’s (2002</xref>: 145) notion that ‘international organizations are both a tool for implementing policy of powerful actors and an arena for contesting the content of that policy,’ we argue that this characterization of international actors as politically aligned along predictable axes is problematic. Ideas matter much more – and international organizations are far more flexible – than most structuralist accounts would predict. In fact, the policies of international organizations are highly and continually contested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468018113484608">Deacon and Stubbs, 2011</xref>), to the extent that policy consensus within international organizations may be the exception, not the rule. International organizations<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1468018113484608">1</xref></sup> are open systems in the sense defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468018113484608">Bertalanffy (1968)</xref> and other system theorists, who argue that a living or open system exchanges ‘matter with its environment, presenting import and export, building-up and breaking-down of its material components.’ International organizations frequently have shown themselves to be open to new ideas and approaches espoused by well-positioned policy entrepreneurs. They commonly reverse course on policy. This makes it difficult to characterize the policy approach of international organizations as stable, except during relatively short periods of time, where they may exhibit ideological consistency. Intense contestation differentiates international organizations from those think tanks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1468018113484608">Rich, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1468018113484608">Stone and Denham, 2004</xref>) that are tied to a particular interest group or ideology. International organizations tend to navigate a route between complex and shifting ideas and interests, rather than adhere to a consistent, single path.</p>
<p>To illustrate this theoretical claim, the following analysis shows how international organizations approached pension privatization from 1994 to 2011, with an emphasis on the World Bank and, to a lesser extent, the European Union, to show that international organizations changed their positions over time in response to changing circumstances and perceptions within transnational pension policy networks. This made them far more flexible than many domestic think tanks actively involved in the same policy area. Working within international organizations, policy entrepreneurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468018113484608">Kingdon, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1468018113484608">Mintrom, 1997</xref>) directly impacted transnational pension policy advice, building and ultimately rejecting the transnational campaign for pension privatization. Moreover, the directions that these policy entrepreneurs took were not entirely predictable from their political background or the governments they served. While it would be foolish to argue that structures of political power have no bearing on the actions and advice of international organizations, our point is that it is difficult to pin international organization behavior too closely to the power of strong states or stable ideologies. International organizations as sites of contestation are simply too fluid for this to be true, except over relatively short periods of time (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1468018113484608">Kogut and MacPherson, 2011</xref>). They are open systems that create incentives for continuous contestation and are vulnerable to political and ideological shifts in the broader ideational arena. To stress this reality, we compare these organizations with several ideologically driven think tanks, which have proven much more rigid in their advocacy of pension privatization than the World Bank and other international organizations.</p>
<p>Examining changing ideational and discursive processes within international organizations matters because studies have shown that these processes can have a direct influence on domestic policy (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468018113484608">Béland and Cox, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1468018113484608">Mahon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1468018113484608">Mahon and McBride, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1468018113484608">Schmidt, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1468018113484608">Skogstad, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1468018113484608">True and Mintrom, 2001</xref>). This makes the analysis of how ideas and discourse evolve within international organizations one of the most important frontiers of global social policy theory. We contribute to this discussion by showing that international organizations are far more open systems than many believe and that their constantly evolving internal ideas and discourse can strongly impact policy.</p>

<title>Ideas and international organizations</title>
<p>Since the 1990s, a growing number of scholars, including students of international organizations, have paid attention to the direct role of ideational and discursive processes in politics and policy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1468018113484608">2</xref></sup> A number of authors have demonstrated that ideational processes help construct the social and economic problems most public policies are designed to address (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468018113484608">Kingdon, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1468018113484608">Mehta, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1468018113484608">Stone, 1997</xref>). Accordingly, ideas shape the understandings that underpin political action and the rationale and purposes of organizations and policies. As far as the role of transnational actors is concerned, especially crucial are the ideas that can supply country-level policy actors with goals, norms, and blueprints grounded in a set of assumptions about how to address the issues of the day through the use of specific policy instruments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468018113484608">Blyth, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1468018113484608">Hall, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1468018113484608">Skogstad, 2011</xref>). These ideas provide guidance on institutional creation and reform and generally serve to reduce uncertainty in times of perceived crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468018113484608">Blyth, 2002</xref>). By doing so, ideas help actors define their interests, which are shaped not only by material conditions but through interpretations of these conditions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468018113484608">Blyth, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1468018113484608">Hay, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1468018113484608">Jenson, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1468018113484608">Schön and Rein, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1468018113484608">Steensland, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1468018113484608">Stone, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1468018113484608">Weir, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>From the perspective of international organizations, ideas are a crucial vehicle through which they can influence domestic policy development. This is true because these organizations lack formal veto power over domestic policy. This lack of formal veto power forces them to work through persuasion, convincing important domestic ‘veto players’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1468018113484608">3</xref></sup> to adopt new policy preferences. Considering this and the limits of financial conditionality, ideational processes are the most central means through which they attempt to shape domestic policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1468018113484608">Orenstein, 2008</xref>). Consequently, under most circumstances, international organizations are analogous to domestic think tanks, in the sense that ideas and expertise constitute their main source of policy influence. Yet, as our analysis of the pension privatization debate suggests, this analogy between international organizations and think tanks should not hide one key distinction: that international organizations are much more open to ideational change than ideologically driven think tanks. Ideologically driven think tanks typically promote the same policy paradigm for extended periods of time, regardless of changes in expert discourse, new information, or perceived successes and failures of the paradigm. International organizations do not, since they tend to be riven by disputes between different experts and policy paradigms.</p>
<p>Policy paradigms often are seen as a major source of policy stability. This is the case because policy paradigms are coherent sets of assumptions that help policy actors reduce uncertainty and deal with emerging social and economic problems using integrated policy solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1468018113484608">Hall, 1993</xref>; for a critique of the concept of policy paradigm see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468018113484608">Carstensen, 2011</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1468018113484608">4</xref></sup> In the analysis of international organizations, it is common to use the concept of policy paradigm, which offers much analytical leverage to analyze the discourse and the domestic policy impact of such organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1468018113484608">Skogstad, 2011</xref>). Yet, one contribution of this article is to show that, in the field of social policy reform at least, international organizations like the World Bank do not stick to the same policy paradigm over long periods of time, as these organizations are open to the influence of diverse policy entrepreneurs who mobilize and bring about profound ideational change.</p>
<p>International organizations are not consistent over time in their policy preferences because they are not subservient to a single interest group or state, but rather open systems, vulnerable to a wide variety of influences and experts committed to competing social policy ideas and paradigms. This view of international organizations as open systems contrasts with the realist one, which looks at international organizations through the lens of a ‘principal-agent’ dilemma. In the realist perspective, international organizations are ‘agents’ of national states. The ‘principal’ decision-makers are powerful states. Rarely do international organizations do anything important that they are not delegated to do by their masters (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468018113484608">Hawkins et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>While liberal internationalists contest the realist view by arguing that international organizations can act on their own to promote cooperation among states, in recent years, constructivist scholars have taken a different tack, focusing on the ideational or agenda-setting function of international organizations. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468018113484608">Michael Barnett and Martha Finnemore (2004</xref>: 25) have argued that international organizations have four basic sources of legitimacy: the rational-legal authority that comes from their charters, the delegated legitimacy that they derive from states, the moral legitimacy that comes from their important missions, and the expert legitimacy based on their widely accepted expertise in core areas. While realists emphasize rational-legal and delegated authority, constructivists emphasize moral and expert legitimacy as well, showing that these give international organizations a certain autonomy from the agendas of powerful states.</p>
<p>This article adopts a constructivist approach, according to which international organizations are open systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468018113484608">Bertalanffy, 1968</xref>) motivated by agendas of a variety of powerful states as well as the training, beliefs, and ideas of their staffs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468018113484608">Chwieroth, 2010</xref>). As a result of these competing sources of legitimacy and power, advocates of a wide variety of perspectives may have an impact on the construction of the perceived interests and the actual policy behavior of international organizations to an extent that may vary over time. Empirical analysis of internal discourse of the World Bank on pension privatization shows that IOs are in fact more open to the shifting ideas of expert communities than ideologically driven think tanks.</p>
<p>The example of pension reform is interesting to analyze because this field is typically described as an arena in which the World Bank has developed a coherent and stable policy paradigm associated with the idea of privatization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1468018113484608">Merrien, 2001</xref>). Recognizing the importance of the time frame used to study both ideas and policy changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468018113484608">Campbell, 2004</xref>), the following analysis shows that, even within the World Bank, policy ideas are continuously in flux, an important yet seldom recognized feature of the policy life of international organizations.</p>

<title>Pension privatization: The World Bank-led campaign</title>
<p>Pension privatization began in 1981, when US-trained economists working for the government of dictator Augusto Pinochet cancelled the pay-as-you-go (PAYG) pension system in Chile and replaced it with one based on individual pension savings accounts administered by competing pension fund companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468018113484608">Brooks, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1468018113484608">Madrid, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1468018113484608">Müller, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1468018113484608">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1468018113484608">Valdes, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1468018113484608">Weyland, 2005</xref>). Pension privatization, as the term is used here, refers to the partial or full replacement of state-administered PAYG pension systems with ones based on individual pension savings accounts. The Chilean experiment garnered interest from the UK government of Margaret Thatcher, which initiated a partial replacement of income-related state pensions with voluntary individual accounts in 1986 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1468018113484608">Pierson, 1994</xref>). Other Latin American countries began to show an interest in pension privatization in the early 1990s once Chile’s economy started to grow rapidly. It was widely believed that pension privatization had created a pool of domestic capital that helped to stabilize and grow the Chilean economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1468018113484608">World Bank, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>At the same time, the World Bank got on board with the pension privatization campaign. Chief Economist Lawrence Summers launched an effort to promote pension privatization to help countries cope with demographic aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1468018113484608">Orenstein, 2008</xref>). Summers believed that pension privatization would enable countries to continue to provide old-age pensions without bankrupting PAYG pension schemes, which require a rough balance between contributions and benefits and could run into problems as the proportion of older beneficiaries increases. In 1993, Summers became Undersecretary of the US Treasury for International Affairs under President Bill Clinton. Starting in 1994, with the publication of its landmark report, <italic>Averting the Old Age Crisis</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1468018113484608">5</xref></sup> the World Bank led a transnational campaign for pension privatization through a core group of pension reform officials from its Social Protection division. This campaign was joined by additional international organizations and government agencies, including the IMF (International Monetary Fund), the OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development), the ADB (Asian Development Bank), and USAID (United States Agency for International Development). Most of these were Washington-based organizations, with the exception of the Paris-based OECD, which played a key role in popularizing pension privatization in Europe. The campaign, as a result, had a major impact on policy in Central and Eastern Europe, but also succeeded in spreading pension privatization ideas in Asia and Africa<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1468018113484608">6</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1468018113484608">Orenstein, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1468018113484608">2008</xref>).</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468018113484608">Figure 1</xref> shows, just as suddenly as pension privatization took off in the developing world, it stopped. Pension privatization was adopted by dozens of countries between 1994 and 2004, during the height of the World Bank-led campaign. As the United States debated pension privatization during the presidency of George W Bush (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468018113484608">Béland, 2005</xref>), it appeared that the trend would reshape pension systems worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468018113484608">Blackburn, 2003</xref>). Then, the momentum stopped. Between 2005 and 2010, no country privatized its pension system. In contrast, during the previous six-year period, 18 countries had adopted some form of pension privatization.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1468018113484608">7</xref></sup></p>

</fig>
<p>While the global financial crisis of 2008 can help explain the prolongation of the pension privatization lull, it started three years earlier and thus cannot be accounted for by the 2008 crisis and its impact on both stock market valuations and the fiscal position of national states. The timing of the decline in 2005 instead appears to be linked to three factors that helped alter ideas and perceptions about pension privatization worldwide: (1) the publication of major World Bank reports in 2005 and 2006 that produced a damning critique of pension privatization and World Bank advocacy of it; (2) the revision of Chile’s landmark privatized pension system under President Michelle Bachelet; and (3) the failure of President George W Bush’s efforts to enact pension privatization in the United States in 2005. Without consideration of these three episodes that had a strong impact on pension privatization ideas and discourse worldwide, it would be hard to account for the stoppage of pension privatization in 2005, since none of the other key factors thought to account for pension privatization – demographic, economic, political – changed at that time. Importantly, the critical ideas and discourse that seem to have halted the pension privatization trend emerged, at least in part, from within the World Bank, the very same international organization that had driven pension privatization in prior years. This raises some important questions about how the World Bank (and international organizations in general) formulates its advice and how discourse within the World Bank unfolds.</p>
<p>We observe this ideational battle in the pension arena, where international organizations have regularly become a battleground for experts of diverse perspectives who seek to mobilize the resources of these organizations to their own ends. Starting in the 1990s, the World Bank was captured by a core group of pension privatization experts, some from Chile and Argentina, two of the early adopters in Latin America, and their sympathizers from OECD countries, who used the World Bank effectively to pursue their own policy agenda. This group clearly enjoyed a period of strong ideational dominance within the World Bank and broader global pension policy circles. However, the vigorous campaign they launched for pension privatization worldwide drew detractors from within the World Bank that ultimately challenged the dominance of the pension privatization core group.</p>
<p>The first major challenge was launched in a 1999 conference organized by then-World Bank Chief Economist Joseph Stiglitz, in which he presented a paper with future White House Budget Director Peter Orszag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1468018113484608">Orszag and Stiglitz, 2001</xref>) critiquing the World Bank approach to old-age pensions. Their ‘deliberately provocative’ paper took aim at World Bank pension advice over the years since 1994 and questioned the basis upon which the World Bank supported privately managed pension savings accounts. Orszag and Stiglitz argued that pension privatization did not increase national savings rates as advocates claimed, did not improve labor market incentives, did not increase rates of return, could not control fees through competition, and was based on an erroneous critique of PAYG pension systems. In conclusion, as they claimed, most of the arguments used to support pension privatization were ‘not substantiated in either theory or practice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1468018113484608">Orszag and Stiglitz, 2001</xref>). This helps explain why Lawrence Summers, then Undersecretary of the US Treasury for International Affairs, called for Stiglitz not to be renewed when his term expired in 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1468018113484608">Wade, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>This critique sparked other, more sustained efforts, culminating in two major reports published in 2005 and 2006. <italic>Keeping the Promise of Social Security in Latin America</italic> was a 2005 World Bank report that heavily criticized the impact of pension privatization in that region of the world. It argued that mandatory private pension savings accounts had little benefit other than ‘ratcheting down . . .expectations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468018113484608">Gill et al., 2005</xref>: 280) of unsustainably high promises made in PAYG pension systems in Latin America. However, systems based on private pension savings accounts that replaced them did not give appropriate focus to poverty reduction, did not address coverage issues, and suffered from high fees. For instance, in Chile, such fees ate up half of all pension benefits for workers who started contributing in the 1980s and retired starting in 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468018113484608">Gill et al., 2005</xref>: 272). The report concluded that there was no basis for individual accounts playing such a large role in pension provision in Latin America.</p>
<p>As this report was being written, Chile, the country that pioneered pension privatization, re-reformed its pension system under President Michelle Bachelet to improve poverty reduction. Bachelet’s pension reform commission issued a bold condemnation of the privatized system along lines that were similar to those emphasized in the 2005 World Bank report: half of contributions were lost to fees, the promise that the system would increase coverage had not materialized, and the system was manifestly unfair, harming the poor, women, or those without high salaries or long work histories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1468018113484608">Matijascic and Kay, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The 2006 Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) report headed by Emily Andrews similarly criticized the World Bank’s pension work for focusing too much attention on switching to individual accounts and ignoring poverty reduction goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1468018113484608">World Bank, 2006</xref>). Andrews had worked for the Bank in Kazakhstan and came to the conclusion that the Bank had advocated reform in countries that lacked important preconditions for successful private pensions, such as inadequate financial markets or regulatory capacity. The IEG report recommended rebalancing the World Bank’s pension work to support reform of PAYG pension systems and making sure that it only advocated pension privatization in countries that had developed financial systems and institutional capacity. The report argued, echoing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1468018113484608">Orszag and Stiglitz (2001)</xref>, that there was little evidence that pension privatization had increased national savings or aided capital market development. The World Bank had been over-enthusiastic in its support for pension privatization and needed to refocus on other goals. Interestingly, the World Bank regularly commissions independent evaluations of its advisory work. These IEG reports are directed by Bank officials nearing mandatory retirement age who do so as their last assignment for the Bank, to enable them to provide dispassionate analysis – an institutionalized process in which the Bank invites critical examination of its own work.</p>
<p>It is striking, given <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1468018113484608">Wade’s (1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1468018113484608">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1468018113484608">2002</xref>) conclusions about paradigm maintenance at the World Bank, that these reports were published at all. They appear to have been subject to the same process of redaction that Wade reports for the documents he analyzes. Yet, the burning conclusions ultimately came through. And in this instance, World Bank ideas and behavior seem to have changed. Pension privatization fell out of favor at the World Bank. The Director of Social Protection who helped to organize the World Bank campaign for pension privatization retired and was replaced not by a pension advocate, but by a labor market expert with limited interest in pension privatization. Core pension privatization experts at the World Bank went to work in a variety of other departments and their pension work no longer focused so heavily on privatization. At the same time, government interest in pension privatization worldwide slowed. Both supply and demand dried up as the pension privatization lull of 2005–2010 set in.</p>
<p>The European Union experienced similar debates on pension privatization and similar changes of opinion over time. While starting in 1990s, ECOFIN (European Council for Finance) issued statements strongly in favor of pension privatization and fiscal ‘sustainability’ and ‘modernization,’ social policy ministers came out against privatization and in favor of pension ‘adequacy.’ With the foundation of a joint committee to study the pensions issue in 2001 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468018113484608">Council of the European Union, 2001</xref>), such contrasting views began to be reconciled. This process culminated in a 2012 <italic>White Paper: An Agenda for Adequate, Safe and Sustainable Pensions</italic>, in which pension privatization was no longer seen as the chief means with which to address Europe’s demographic aging problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468018113484608">European Commission, 2012</xref>). Instead, increases in retirement age, unification of male and female retirement ages, and restricting access to early retirement were stressed. Encouraging greater supplementary pension saving was also mentioned as an important target; however, it was portrayed as ‘supplementary’ to, rather than as a replacement of, public PAYG systems. This represented a change in emphasis even over the preceding Green Paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468018113484608">European Commission, 2010</xref>), which accorded private pensions a more central role in resolving Europe’s demographic challenges.</p>
<p>It would be wrong, therefore, to view international organizations as single-minded and stable on pension policy. The best way to emphasize this reality is to compare these organizations with domestic think thanks that exhibit strong ideological and policy consistency over time. Although some think thanks like the US Brookings Institution are genuine ‘universit[ies] without students’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1468018113484608">Weaver, 1989</xref>) emphasizing detached, academic research over advocacy, other think thanks work more like interest groups and political advocates defending the same policy alternatives over long periods of time. In the field of pension privatization, as elsewhere, the comparison between this type of ‘advocacy tanks’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1468018113484608">Weaver, 1989</xref>) as they operate in the United States and international organizations is especially telling.</p>
<p>As background to the discussion about US think tanks, it is important to stress the nature of the debate on pension privatization in that country and, especially, the dramatic nature of the political rejection of this policy alternative in 2005, when President George W Bush failed to convince Congress and the public to privatize the federal old-age insurance scheme, which was created during the New Deal and is known as Social Security. Although the push to privatize Social Security began in the 1970s and 1980s, it is only during the mid- to late 1990s that the privatization campaign strongly impacted US policy debates. In the end, although President Clinton failed to support this policy alternative, privatization became for the first time a mainstream legislative option during his second term. Once in the White House, George W Bush put together a commission that supported Social Security privatization but its report came out in the aftermath of the events of 11 September 2001, after which pension reform was no longer a priority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468018113484608">Béland, 2005</xref>). It is only after his re-election in November 2004 that George W Bush launched a bold campaign to privatize Social Security. In early 2005, the president toured the country to advocate reform but he failed to convince most members of Congress and the public to support reform. In the end, his campaign was a genuine and spectacular political failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468018113484608">Altman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468018113484608">Béland and Waddan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468018113484608">Edwards, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1468018113484608">Ross, 2007</xref>). This rejection of pension privatization by a country that had long supported this type of reform through organizations like USAID did not help promote it around the world.</p>
<p>Interestingly, however, in the United States since 2005, influential ideologically driven conservative think tanks have kept promoting pension privatization, both at home and abroad. This is where the comparison between these think tanks and international organizations is especially telling, as far as the ideational fluctuations of the latter are concerned. Compare, for instance, the World Bank or the EU to the Cato Institute, a libertarian US think tank. For decades, this organization has been a strong advocate of pension privatization in the United States. In the mid-1980s, the Cato Institute even developed a long-term, ‘Leninist’ strategy to weaken support for defined-benefit public pensions in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468018113484608">Butler and Germanis, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1468018113484608">Teles, 1998</xref>). More than a decade later, during the final years of the Clinton presidency, the Cato Institute was at the forefront of the push for pension privatization in the United States, as it published books and papers that backed this policy alternative and articulated a systematic privatization paradigm (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468018113484608">Ferrara, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468018113484608">Ferrara and Tanner, 1998</xref>). The same remark applies to the George W Bush years, during which Cato experts continued to support efforts to transform Social Security into a system of individual savings accounts explicitly inspired by the Chilean model. During the 2005 campaign to privatize Social Security launched by President George W Bush, the Cato Institute provided strong support for the president’s initiative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1468018113484608">Niskanen, 2005</xref>). More interesting for our discussion, however, is the fact that the crushing political defeat of this initiative and even the 2008 financial crisis did not push Cato to significantly alter its views on pension privatization. As opposed to the World Bank, which revised its position over time, the Cato Institute has continued to this day to actively promote the pension privatization paradigm, without interruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468018113484608">Cato Institute, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1468018113484608">Tanner, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1468018113484608">2012</xref>).</p>
<p>In the United States, the Cato Institute is not the only ideologically driven, conservative think tank that has maintained its support for Social Security privatization after the humiliating defeat of President Bush’s 2005 privatization campaign. Take the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), for example. Since late 2007, the main Social Security expert at the AEI is Andrew G Biggs, a strong privatization advocate who had been appointed by President George W Bush as Principal Deputy Commissioner and, earlier on, Deputy Commissioner for Policy of the Social Security Administration, the organization in charge of administrating the federal old-age insurance program. A controversial figure, Biggs moved to the AEI as a staunch advocate of Social Security privatization, an ideological orientation and a policy paradigm clearly displayed in his recent publications (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468018113484608">Biggs, 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468018113484608">2011b</xref>). The many publications of this LSE-trained economist illustrates the enduring commitment of the AEI to Social Security privatization, which began long before the 2005 Bush initiative and was not deeply altered after its clear political defeat.</p>
<p>As opposed to ideological think thanks like the Cato Institute, which constitute policy entrepreneurs devoted to the stable, long-term promotion of a clear policy agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1468018113484608">Rich, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1468018113484608">Weaver, 1989</xref>), international organizations are sites of contestation because they are open systems. Governments of various and changing political stripes may seek influence at any point in time, though in the pension reform area, this influence appears to have been minimal. The openness of international organizations also derives from their expert character and staffing. Experts are free to change their minds with shifting perceptions of ‘best practice.’ They are not trained ideologues, like some think tank ‘experts,’ who are little more than advocates, but shaped more by their professional training. This may induce certain biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468018113484608">Chwieroth, 2010</xref>), but in the pension area, it does not seem to have prevented the existence of sharply contrasting policy views concerning pension privatization. Led by policy experts, vulnerable to influence of governments, international organizations are radically open to ideas that may arise in any number of ways from a variety of sources.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1468018113484608">
<title>The impact of policy entrepreneurs</title>
<p>One of the most important sources of international organization ideas is not governments, but individual policy entrepreneurs. In the expert-dominated environment of international organizations, policy entrepreneurs have the ability to have a strong impact. Indeed, the launching of the pension privatization campaign at the World Bank can be traced to the advocacy of one leading policy entrepreneur, Lawrence Summers, together with a policy team led by Nancy Birdsall, and a report-writing team led by Estelle James. These entrepreneurial figures established a clear problem definition, a critique of pre-existing PAYG pension systems, an analysis that proved the value of pension privatization, and formed an advisory group to promote this privatization paradigm around the world. Without the efforts of these individuals, pension privatization would never have become Bank policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1468018113484608">Orenstein, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, the following Chief Economist of the World Bank, Joseph Stiglitz, also acted as a policy entrepreneur in this area to sell a very different perspective on policy. Rather than supporting pension privatization, he opposed it. While his initial paper, book publication, and conference did not put an end to pension privatization, he did encourage further dissent within the World Bank that ultimately brought the pension privatization campaign to a close. Likewise, the individuals who sought to make their careers within the World Bank through a critique of pension privatization certainly had a strong impact, as did the outgoing Bank official who led the internal evaluation report that slammed its pension work.</p>
<p>Since the World Bank’s reputation depends on its expert legitimacy, the viewpoints of individual experts can matter a great deal. Like in domestic policymaking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468018113484608">Kingdon, 1995</xref>), powerful and well-placed policy entrepreneurs can have a substantial impact on policy. Often, this impact takes place through careful analysis and scholarly proof, not just bureaucratic infighting. Since the currency of the World Bank’s work is largely knowledge, individuals who appear to improve upon that knowledge can gain considerable power. Their expert legitimacy may also be closely tied to their training and academic track record in the top western universities.</p>
<p>What is also interesting is that it would be difficult to trace the views of these policy entrepreneurs to the parties or governments that elected them. Lawrence Summers and Joseph Stiglitz, for instance, both served in the Clinton administration in the United States, the first just after and the second just before his term as Chief Economist of the World Bank. The fact that they took diametrically opposed views on pension privatization suggests that the policy ideas of these policy entrepreneurs are not tightly connected to those of particular governments, but reflect their own professional opinions, at least in some important instances. Experts’ opinions are not dictated entirely by their career profession or academic background either, as both these diametrically opposed economists were trained and employed at both Harvard and MIT.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1468018113484608">
<title>Adaptability and impact</title>
<p>As we argue in this article, the policy prescriptions of international organizations change regularly in response to a number of factors, including expert ideas. As evidenced above, the position of the World Bank and EU on pension privatization has been anything but stable. The World Bank has swung from having no real position on pension privatization, to launching a major advocacy campaign, to backing away and endorsing other approaches, in more recent years. The EU similarly has been riven by disputes that it has sought to resolve in a decade-long process culminating in a recent White Paper on pension reform across Europe.</p>
<p>One may wonder: if international organization ideas about policy are so contentious and unstable, why would anyone accept their advice? Yet, the idea that policy advice should be stable is naïve. As the world changes, countries typically demand the most up-to-the-minute policy advice, even if it differs from what was on offer in previous years. The expert legitimacy of international organizations demands flexibility and adaptability to changing demands and not to be bound primarily by ideology or past practice. Indeed, up-to-the-minute, flexible expertise may be part of why demand for international organization advice is in such great demand.</p>
<p>The impact of international organizations depends upon their delegated, expert, and other sources of legitimacy. In order to maintain this credibility, they cannot afford to be far out of step with dominant expert paradigms or ideas in international politics. They must change with the times, in contrast to ideological think tanks, which ideologically driven individuals and political organizations of various stripes rely on to provide intellectual support at times when they have access to government. Access to, and control of, international organizations is a valuable prize. Policy entrepreneurs and their networks compete to define the policy ideas and agendas of international organizations. This suggests that the key to influencing international organization ideas and behavior is to develop and control policy networks with expertise and credentials relevant to particular organizations and situations.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1468018113484608">Wade (1996)</xref>, in a brilliant account of paradigm maintenance, argued that the <italic>East Asian Miracle</italic> report of the World Bank showed that the World Bank was in thrall to a liberal economic ideology at the service of the United States. Yet there is a different interpretation of his story. A truly rigid, ideological organization would never have agreed to write the <italic>East Asian Miracle</italic> report in the first place. That the World Bank was forced by Japan, one of its shareholders, to study the Japanese model of economic development at a time when its leaders were committed to a different policy path shows openness to new policy ideas as a matter of principle and organization. The <italic>East Asian Miracle</italic> story is one of contestation, not unchallenged hegemony. Different ‘camps’ and policy entrepreneurs within the World Bank debated whether state planning or market signals contributed to rapid development in Asia and found some sense in both perspectives. It is true that liberal perspectives were inserted and even dominated, for a number of years. It is true that the report had no real impact on the World Bank’s work in subsequent years, in which it sought to impose liberal policies on Asia. However, times, as well as ideas, change. Today, the Chief Economist of the World Bank is a Chinese economist, Justin Yifu Lin, who supports the state side of the <italic>East Asian Miracle</italic> story. At the time, the Japanese were isolated. This is no longer the case.</p>
<p>International organizations are open systems that may be dominated for relatively short periods of time by certain paradigms and other ideational influences that arise from powerful governments, professions, or policy communities. However, they also display a remarkable fluidity over time, especially when compared to ideologically driven ‘advocacy tanks’ that operate in countries like the United States. International organizations are truly sites of contestation. They may be influenced from a variety of different sources, but in the pension area, they appear to be particularly swayed by dedicated and well-placed policy entrepreneurs, who help promote ideas they believe best address the problems of the day. Thanks to their reliance on expert legitimacy, expert discourse and ideas can have a fundamental impact on the behavior of these organizations. In contrast to advocacy think tanks, which identify with relatively stable ideological creeds and policy paradigms, international organizations can and do change.</p>
<p>In this article, we have suggested a comparative context, in which international organizations are relatively open compared to ideologically based think tanks. We have developed several propositions about international organization behaviors, such as seeing international organizations as open systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468018113484608">Bertalanffy, 1968</xref>), sites of contestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1468018113484608">O’Brien, 2002</xref>), and deriving their legitimacy from expert discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468018113484608">Barnett and Finnemore, 2004</xref>). This makes international organizations open to a variety of ideas and perspectives on policy, and rarely committed to one perspective forever. We have shown that it is dangerous to stereotype international organizations’ viewpoints on policy, except during relatively short periods when key policy entrepreneurs and their network succeed in asserting their dominance.</p>
<p>It should be recognized that this contested and continually changing perspective on ‘best practice’ within international organizations makes them difficult to study. One cannot assume much about their intent without doing a detailed analysis of the thinking and expert debates taking place within the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1468018113484608">Kogut and MacPherson, 2011</xref>). Nonetheless, the experience of pension privatization suggests that, despite these inherent difficulties, it is vital to policy analysis to improve our understanding of changing ideas and discourse within international organizations, as these relatively flexible, expert organizations can have such a major impact on policy decisions made by governments throughout the world.</p>
<p>Much more research in global social policy needs to be conducted on the determinants of ideational change in international organizations and other transnational actors. For instance, in future research, scholars could take a truly systematic look at the mechanisms according to which, at certain points in time, some ideas, and the experts articulating them, become more legitimate or dominant within particular international organizations. Another important issue to address in future research is the conditions under which international organizations are likely to change their dominant policy ideas and paradigms. Future research also may identify the factors that empower or reduce the influence of experts and their ideas within particular organizations. This type of analysis could test the applicability and identify the potential limitations of our ideational model. In short, there is plenty of work ahead for scholars who recognize the role of ideas in international organizations and in global social policy and seek to develop a systematic understanding of their impact.</p>

<p>In 2011, two countries privatized their pension systems, Czech Republic and Malawi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1468018113484608">Orenstein, 2013</xref>). Actually, Malawi’s decision to mandate individual pension savings accounts above a certain income threshold was not strictly a privatization, since it had no prior national pension system. Participation in the Czech Republic’s system is voluntary. It is difficult to know if this signifies the restart of a pension privatization trend or two anomalous cases. However, if pension privatization does restart, it will most likely take a different form, reflecting the evolution of expert debate since 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1468018113484608">Orenstein, 2011</xref>).</p>
