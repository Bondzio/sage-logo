<p><italic>The European Bioeconomy in 2030</italic>, states that the bio-based economy ‘refers to the sustainable production and conversion of biomass into a range of food, health, fibre and industrial products and energy. Renewable biomass encompasses any biological material as a product in itself or to be used as raw material.’ Indeed, the bio-based economy is the novel concept associated with the development of renewable resources management in a modern society, related to biomass management but also to the biogenic fraction of society’s generated wastes. As reported by PRO-BIP 2009 ‘every year about 170 billion tonnes of biomass are produced by nature, of which only 3.5% (6 billion tonnes) are utilized by mankind. Most of these 6 billion tonnes are used for food, about one-third is for energy, paper, furniture and construction, and only 5% (300 million tonnes) are consumed for other non-food purposes such as chemicals and clothing’. Overall, it makes sense for a bio-based economy to use more of the world’s biomass for food, energy, and new industrial bio-products.</p>
<p>The unstable price of petroleum and its dwindling supply, coupled with climate change concerns and steady population growths, have led to implementation of sustainability programmes by government and private industry on many fronts, including the extraction and manufacturing of chemicals, materials, and fuels. The government’s push for green products, consumer demand and energy conservation are some of the key factors that drive research towards the development of renewable resource-based bioproducts (bioenergy including biofuel, biochemicals and biomaterials). The use of bio- or renewable carbon for manufacturing is moving forward to reduce mankind’s carbon footprint. The goal is to use bio-based materials containing the maximum possible amount of renewable biomass-based derivatives to have a sustainable future. There is nowadays a remarkable increase in research and development funds in several countries to advance bioenergy and biomaterials technology, resulting in the development of bio-industrial systems combining feedstock selection and use, process technology and specific products and new markets. However, oftentimes these bio-industrial platforms compete with each other and also with fossil carbon-based industrial platforms, particularly in the field of fuels, materials and chemicals. In a fossil-based economy sale and use of both transportation fuels and materials produce nearly equal revenue although the amount of fossil resources for transportation fuel use is more than 16 times higher in comparison with chemicals, including plastics, rubber and other materials. Thus in the emerging bio-based economy, improvements in production and consumption for both materials and fuels should be emphasized simultaneously.</p>
<p>In 2009, as reported in <italic>The European Bioeconomy in 2030</italic>, the bio-based economy turnover in the European Union (EU) accounted for 17% of the whole EU economy, including food (47%), agriculture (19%), pulp and paper (18%), forestry and wood products (13%), chemicals and plastics (3%), biofuels (less than 1%) and enzymes (less than 1%). In addition, employment in the EU bio-based economy supported 9% of the EU’s total work force in 2009, with agriculture as the most significant sector (56% of employees in this sector). However, there is major challenge to overcome in Europe regarding the low availability of woody biomass for energetic purposes, as a relevant fraction of this biomass is not really available because the respective forests are privately owned and not managed accordingly. In addition, there is strong competition with other ways of biomass utilization including, for instance, fibre-board manufacturing. The conclusion here in many energy scenarios is that woody biomass in the long run should only be used for producing fuels but should not be used for producing heat anymore.</p>
<p>Partially replacing fossil fuels with biogenic raw materials offers opportunities in both developed and developing countries, particularly in rural areas where incomes and employment have been declining. But why is this transition so complex? As explained in <italic>The Bio-Based Economy. Biofuels, Materials and Chemicals in the Post-Oil Era</italic>, ‘a transition towards a bio-based economy thus involves the implementation of a combination of technologies: some new and some already known. New technologies are based on breakthroughs in biomass conversion or use, while existing technologies may find new applications.’ It is expected that this transition will have a major effect on society, and this may be the reason why bio-based innovations often provoke debates regarding novel specific products and/or markets. Extended production and/or import of feedstocks impacting the commodity markets as well as consumer behaviour will be some of the key factors affected by this transition.</p>
<p>In the past few years, a stream of bio-based products have been making their way to retail shelves in the USA, including compostable dinnerware made from corn, plant-based laundry detergents, and bamboo flooring among them. Two of the main beverage companies are now competing to be first to market with a soft drink bottle derived entirely from sugarcane or other plant materials. Natural fibres are known to be lighter, less expensive, have superior specific strength, require comparatively less energy to produce, are biodegradable and have superior sound abatement characteristics as compared to traditional synthetic E-glass fibres. All of these attributes of natural fibres are quite favourable, especially in the automotive sector where even a fractional weight saving can make a significant contribution to energy savings with reduced gasoline or diesel consumption and with added advantages of eco-friendliness. It is true that natural fibres are comparatively hydrophilic and less thermally stable in comparison with traditional E-glass fibres. However, the developments in natural fibre technologies have overcome some of these disadvantages if used intelligently. The incorporation of bio-resources, for example, crop-derived green plastics and plant-derived bio-fibres (natural fibres) into composite materials are gaining prime importance in designing and engineering new green composites. Recent developments of natural fibre technologies are attracting their uses in automotive parts, building construction, consumer products and packaging.</p>
<p>In the context of an economy based on biological resources and the management of the waste materials from them, it appears advantageous to process raw biogenic resources and wastes in a biorefinery facility, ensuring the highest resource efficiency conversion, and simultaneously promoting the development of different primary and by-products with different qualities. In a bio-based economy, waste management elements may evolve instead into a by-products management system, involving the entire supply chain to develop and produce high-value-added products.</p>
<p><italic>Waste Management &amp; Research</italic> serves as a forum for exchanging research expertise and scientific ideas supporting the development and application of novel bio-based fuels, materials and chemicals, particularly those produced from residual biogenic streams. In doing so, <italic>Waste Management &amp; Research</italic> invites researchers to submit manuscripts that focus on technologies for enhancing the quality of residual biomass as a raw material for both bioenergetic purposes and higher-value-added materials.</p>
