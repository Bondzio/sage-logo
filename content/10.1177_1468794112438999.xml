<p>For an anthropologist, reading a book about ethnography grounded in sociology and education is like a Peruvian getting an Ecuadorian recipe for <italic>cerviche</italic>: rivals to the methodological tradition, the absence of familiar disciplinary points of reference can be off putting. However, Hammersley and Atkinson’s book is among the best introductions to ethnographic fieldwork available, integrating diverse methodological innovations. Although the book has limitations, the third edition demonstrates that the work is still a landmark in the field and among the best teaching texts available, especially at the graduate level.</p>
<p>The three great strengths of this text are its scholarliness, breadth, and focus on reflexivity. When the first edition was published in 1983, Hammersley and Atkinson write in the “Prologue,” they struggled to find materials with which to teach ethnography. The context has shifted so radically that the volume’s purpose has reversed; where they once sought to transform oral traditions into formal methodology, now the authors confront so such methodological diversity and specialization that they write against fragmentation, arguing that core issues still unite practice. Ultimately, they succeed.</p>
<p>The scholarliness of the book, especially the wide range of examples drawn into the discussion, demonstrates convincingly that shared issues provide a core for teaching and thinking about ethnographic methods. The discussion is particularly gratifying because Hammersley and Atkinson demonstrate convincingly that, although we certainly need methodological innovation, we also must be aware of the sophisticated ways in which previous generations of researchers have confronted shared problems. As they write, the authors refuse to declare “novelty when all that is really revealed is collective ignorance or amnesia” (p. x).</p>
<p>The breadth makes this truly a pan-disciplinary work. Disciplinary ethnographic specialization in a single type of site has broken down. Increasingly, sociologists and other researchers are venturing abroad or across cultures, and anthropologists are training their students for fieldwork closer to home or “studying up,” where Hammersley and Atkinson’s consideration of the challenges of ethnography in both strange and familiar settings is invaluable.</p>
<p>In the authors’ hands, reflexivity is not just a rhetorical strategy in ethnographic writing or a post-modern existential crisis. Rather, they describe reflexivity as a necessary component of research design and ongoing practice. Their focus on rigorousness leads to a corresponding emphasis on participant observation as both design and data-gathering resource and an insistence, following Herbert Blumer, that research method must respect the formal characteristics of the social phenomenon being studied. Reflexivity means that data must influence design in an ongoing process of methodological refinement, especially because of the role contingency plays in ethnographic research.</p>
<p>On a more detailed level, the book offers excellent discussions of the problems of access to and social relations in field sites. The authors steadfastly refuse to privilege one type of ethnographic data over any other; interviews, observations, visual materials, and life histories are all discussed. The book provides a brief discussion of methods for analysing these materials, which will likely seem short to anyone familiar with the field, but is a concise introduction to the practical and epistemological challenges of turning experience into meaningful “data.” The chapter on research ethics has also been revised and highlights crucial issues that are still points of live debate. In the third edition, Hammersley and Atkinson have added a reflection on working with online resources to an already strong chapter on the role of material culture and documents in ethnography.</p>
<p>Although the book’s strengths outweigh its weaknesses, some issues remain in this edition. <italic>Ethnography: Principles in Practice</italic> is not the most reader-friendly text available, especially for those new to the method; chapter conclusions are cursory, and the authors sometimes “name drop” academic works without describing them. More extended case studies would be helpful to students. The book does not offer as much practical advice as some other methodological works, nor does the book provide some of the resources that raw novices might find useful, such as guiding questions, research design checklists, key terms, diagrams, or other tools to help gain an overview of the field.</p>
<p>For this reason the audience for the text appears to be ambiguous. In general, the authors address fellow scholars, such as practitioners of other research methods seeking to adopt qualitative methods; at other times, they appear to be writing for novices to social science research in general (for example, in an early discussion of positivism and naturalism). Ultimately, the text is probably most appropriate for course adoption with experienced students of social sciences, especially at the graduate level. The work should definitely be on the bookshelf of anyone teaching social science methodology or seeking to move toward qualitative research; these may be the audiences for which the work is best suited, especially because of its remarkable bibliography and excellent history of the field.</p>
