<abstract>
<p>This article responds to the new and major work on Lobby Loyde by Paul Oldham. It focuses on the middle period of Loyde’s career, from the Chicago-period Billy Thorpe and the Aztecs through to Lobby’s work with Sharpie band (was it?) Coloured Balls, and connects and compares Lobby’s trajectory to that of the post-Lobby Aztecs, as expressed in Sunbury, the 1972 parallel Australian event to Woodstock. Who led these processes, the bands or the crowds? If the crowd claimed a band, what happened to musical autonomy in this process? This was a moment when mass audience response became tribal, and opened the possibility that musicians were no longer in charge of their art. Trying to escape from the wiles of the music industry, these musicians instead seem to have become captive to their audiences.</p>

<body>
<p>Who, or what, was Lobby Loyde? Paul Oldham’s great contribution in his thesis ‘Lobby Loyde: The G.O.D. father of Australian Rock’, excerpted in this issue of <italic>Thesis Eleven</italic>, is to draw serious scholarly attention to these questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0725513611434136">Oldham 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0725513611434136">2012</xref>). Recognition of Loyde’s contribution hitherto has been restricted to the fields of journalism where, like the kindred and connected phenomenon of the ‘Sharpie’ culture in Melbourne, it has attracted dossier and memoir, but little sustained or critical analysis. The significance of Oldham’s work is that he carefully periodizes Loyde’s work. This is especially useful because, independently of its own quality and calibre, Loyde’s work acts as a litmus or a carrier of rock music in Australia and in the English-speaking musical universe. From Hank Marvin through to R&amp;B, psychedelia, Chicago blues, pre-punk Sharpie style, progressive rock and more, Lobby Loyde’s project and lifework covered five decades and numerous musical styles and inflections. It provides a wonderful optic into rock history and its broader context.</p>
<p>And then there is the content. Lobby Loyde was one of the most extraordinary guitarists of his time. Innovative, loud, cutting edge, fluid; sometimes off, with bum notes and intensity fully part of the life-force that was his music. It was not always perfect, though it often was; and sometimes it was badly sung, but that was the DIY ethic it expressed: young man with mates, with guitar and microphone, and audience jumping.</p>
<p>I knew and loved Lobby Loyde in the middle period, from the middle sixties with Purple Hearts through to the seventies, ending with Coloured Balls, which ended my enthusiasm for Lobby Loyde until rather later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0725513611434136">Beilharz 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0725513611434136">Beilharz and Supski 2011</xref>). I gave up on Lobby Loyde at a 1973 free concert in the inner city park location of Richmond, just outside of Melbourne city, when it became clear that the crowd was no longer safe, and that Sharpie violence or at least the cult of violence associated with Sharpies had taken over from the music. Already, at this point, I had renegotiated my relationship with my city, because of the no-go zones that Sharpies had staked out, such as those around Ringwood and Box Hill railway stations. Sharpies hunted in packs. They drank, rather than did drugs, and they were young, often too young to drive. So the nodal railway system which holds Melbourne’s suburbs together became dangerous. By this point, then, my commute and my relationship to my city had been transformed by the presence and rumour of Sharpies, whose favourite victims, apart from other Sharpie gangs, were longhairs, hippies like me.</p>
<p>Oldham is correct, I think, to claim that Sharpies themselves were stigmatized, made the subject of a tabloid moral panic. But they were not only victims. As Mark Feary, a participant, remembers:<disp-quote>
<p>… the Sharps were as concerned with busting heads as they were with looking good. Sharps expressed their difference through a well dressed thuggery that was designed to intimidate by thumbing its nose at mainstream conventions of dressing and behaviour. A lot of the time, violence and bullying was the defining experience of being a Sharp. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0725513611434136">Feary 2002</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0725513611434136">Biondo 2006</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>How did Lobby Loyde become associated with Sharpie culture? Like Alice Cooper and Iggy Pop, a point arrived at which hippy culture had begun to some to look mainstream and insipid, commercialized: the counterculture called out another counterculture, whose norms anticipated punk: tough, nasty, 1-2-3-4! loud and fast. And as a postscript there was a slogan: Die Hippy Die!</p>
<p>Lobby’s earlier phases were noisy but less aggressive than this, though the most recurrent word, for example, in his interviews is ‘intense’. He valued intensity. As Oldham observes, the aural archive here is a bit thin; his first 12" record was his last recording with the Aztecs, <italic>The Hoax Is Over</italic> (1971). All Loyde’s earlier recordings are singles or EPs. Record companies were hesitant to give studio budget time or long-playing status to bands like the Purple Hearts, whose traces are apparent in songs like ‘Hopes and Dreams and Tombstones’, ‘I’m Gonna Try’, and the Graeme Bond tune ‘You Can’t Sit Down’. The Purple Hearts’ posthumous recordings included Nick Gravenites’s ‘Born in Chicago’ and Sonny Boy Williamson II’s ‘Bring It on Home’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0725513611434136">Johnston 2010</xref>: 111, 163). This was not the stuff of commercial success. It was serious R&amp;B. Shepherded by the innovative producer Pat Aulton at Festival Records, Lobby’s blues path then intersected with Billy Thorpe and the three-piece Aztecs, of which Lobby became the fourth member, the guitar front man. This line-up recorded one single, a fiercely processional version of BB King’s ‘Rock Me Baby’ backed by Sonny Boy Williamson I’s ‘Good Morning Little Schoolgirl’, in 1969. ‘Rock Me’ was explicitly non-commercial, or anti-commercial, at 6 minutes 58 seconds. It lopes, then races, picks up speed, but gives ample space for Lobby’s piercing guitar solos, as powerfully reminiscent, as I suggested elsewhere, of Clapton’s fine filigree work on ‘Have You Heard’ on the 1966 Mayall Bluesbreakers’ <italic>Beano</italic> album (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0725513611434136">Beilharz 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In between these two moments, the Purple Hearts and the Aztecs, Lobby pioneered Australian psychedelia in the Wild Cherries. The Cherries combined blues impulses with the finesse of the classically trained. Their recording highpoints, at least from the perspective of guitar, were ‘Krome Plated Yabby’ (the last a freshwater crustacean native to Australia) and ‘That’s Life’, no relation to Sinatra and reputedly the first time Melbourne is named in an Australian rock song. Most lyrics in this period, including those on <italic>The Hoax Is Over</italic>, still placed Oz blues in Mississippi or Chicago. <italic>The Hoax Is Over</italic> was a grand gesture of exit, or departure. By now Lobby was bored with 12 bar blues, though he plays his heart out on its four tracks – ‘Gangster of Love’, 24.35, and ‘Mississippi’, both slow blues, and ‘Truth’ and ‘Goodbye Baby’, both fast blues. There are really only two tracks on the album, one quick, one slow blues, and the levels of acid-fuelled self-indulgence are period. Yet what stands out, alongside the extraordinary talent of Warren Morgan on piano, is Lobby’s beautifully fluid playing on ‘George’, his Gibson Les Paul Professional, which echoes something of Clapton’s ‘Woman Tone’ on a Gibson SG on <italic>Disraeli Gears</italic>. The guitar sound is qualitatively different to that on ‘Rock Me’, where his older Fender Jaguar, ‘The Yellow Canary’, sounds like a giant fuzz box. Lobby’s phrasing is unique; he always sounded different. I remember hearing this really electric guitar playing at the Dorset Gardens Hotel during my Year 12 final high school exams. My mother wasn’t pleased by my indiscipline at study; perhaps it gave me the inspiration to sit through those exams and eventually become a Marxist professor. Like the time my band played with the Aztecs at the Thumpin Tum in Melbourne when I was 16, it was a source of inspiration and identity from which I never looked back, even when music eventually gave way to the Marx boy.</p>
<p>Lobby plays George guitar on the most remarkable available youtube clip, ‘GOD’, by the new Wild Cherries on the wonderfully innovative ABC TV series <italic>GTK</italic> (<italic>Get to Know</italic>). GOD – Guitar Over Drive, not, as is sometimes said, Guitar Over Dose – is a fine instance of the last hippy phase of Lobby’s work, 1971. Billy Thorpe was still referring later to his Sunbury work, after Lobby, as a hippy phase, though it also begins to be compromised by its audience, beer-swilling yobbo boys whose slogan was ‘Suck More Piss’. Lobby on <italic>GTK</italic> plays chords, not the notes for which he was famous; the ambience is laid back, cool, harmonic, recessive. It has a rhythm like the sound of surf. The later Wild Cherries (Loyde on guitar, John Dick on drums, Teddy Toi on bass) also played at Sunbury, where the evidence is that they were already shifting in the direction of Coloured Balls, fast and aggressive. Yet the early Coloured Balls single ‘Help Me’/‘Rock Me’, played at Sunbury ’73, was straight blues, even though the semiology of the band is now Sharpie – hair cut short all over except for long and fine at the back, uniform T-shirts and singlets and jeans, and images of scuffles in the crowd that make it clear that the energy on stage was suffering the lunar pull of latent violence.</p>
<p>Did Coloured Balls then fully embrace Sharpie culture? Paul Oldham indicates that the relationship between band and crowd is problematical. The relationship looks to me fraught and conditional. Lobby Loyde has told the story of his embrace, accidental or incidental, of Sharpie style, and especially the Sharpie haircut, as a misadventure conducted under the influence of drugs and responding, partly, to the masculinist accusation of looking like a girl (with long hair). (I remember that, too. Gratuitous insult on the street was the order of the day.) The point about Lobby’s haircut, however, was that it went both ways – the short back and sides of Australian male tradition, and yet long and thin at the back. Its semiology was mixed, receptive to and rejecting of both mainstream and hippy convention. Lobby tells the story this way:<disp-quote>
<p>Everybody was so righteous and so on the money, and ‘Hey, love, man’, and nobody was playing fucking rock and roll! Every prick had really long hair and dressed flamboyantly in pretty, pretty shirts and flares and lovely sandals and played comfortable, naturally stained Les Paul’s and Strats all in beautiful woods with a very casual manner. To me, Coloured Balls was the antithesis of all that. (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0725513611434136">Engelheart 2010</xref>: 57)</p>
</disp-quote>Engelheart relates the story of Lobby’s haircut, but he also offers a significant interpretation of Lobby’s appeal to Sharpies. Lobby Loyde connected mimetically with his audience but also acted as a reluctant figurehead, the hero as antihero. Lobby Loyde, godfather, author of GOD, also filled a god function for his new tribe. Clapton, remember, had also been cast in London earlier as God. Engelheart quotes Billy Thorpe:<disp-quote>
<p>The Sharpies were looking for a god and there he was, and he was the perfect dude. I mean he was it. Lobby was always that guy. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0725513611434136">Engelheart 2010</xref>: 57)</p>
</disp-quote>Lobby’s own views on Sharpies were defensive, but also detached. In the long run, he knew that he had helped create a monster. He viewed the music of the Coloured Balls as therapy, similar in this regard to sport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0725513611434136">Jackson 1975</xref>). He knew that some Sharpies were trouble, but as Oldham argues, also viewed the fuss around Sharpie culture as something like a moral panic, a media beat-up begot of quiet news days when anything looking lurid would do in the tabloids. Yet something had changed in the dynamics between musicians and audience, and this was mediated by the size of crowds, which themselves expanded dramatically as pub rock opened with changes to the early 6 o’clock closing licensing laws, and inebriation peaked. ‘Suck more piss!’ became a chant, and this was a culture of chanting. As much as the punters revelled in the culture of Sunbury, the mass outdoors three day camping festival, others fled, viewing it as a vibe more like the Nuremburg Rallies of Hitler.</p>
<p>Engelheart quotes Thorpe again:<disp-quote>
<p>I was reading an article where [Chain’s] Phil Manning, who is a wonderful guitar player but just missed the point, was saying that unlike most of us who believed Sunbury was the beginning of the music scene, [he] believed it was the end because it turned into endless riffing by morons for yobbos … I mean, Phil, that was the charm! But what happened was it [the bringing together of a rowdy mass subculture] scared the living shit out of 95 percent of the industry.</p>
<p>
<italic>Phil Manning</italic>: That whole aspect of the alcohol-fuelled crowd basically brought music back to the level of sport. And sport is fine but music is an art form. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0725513611434136">Engelheart 2010</xref>: 50)</p>
</disp-quote>The lines of dispute were drawn. The year that later became Whitlam’s point of arrival, 1972, was also the year of Sunbury, and the victory of Billy Thorpe and the Aztecs. Phil Manning’s contribution, like Arlo Guthrie’s at Woodstock, was to play acoustic and sing sweetly about the need to get out to the country and stay there. Chain, Matt Taylor and company were living on communes, Taylor embracing Krishna consciousness and vegetarianism, as on the classic 1973 album <italic>Straight as a Die.</italic> (Phil Manning’s remarkable guitar history, still alive and kicking, deserves fuller recognition as well: few period guitarists achieved such a combination of beauty, technique and originality.) The Aztecs, after Lobby, offered their standard fare to mass adulation: covers of ‘CC Rider’, ‘Be Bop a Lula’, and ‘Ooh Poo Pa Do’. These songs were woompa boompas, loud and elementary crowd pleasers which limited the capacity of band members like Warren Morgan and Gil Matthews to show their flair or precision. Thorpie, meantime, a chord player rather than a note player, relied on his extraordinary vocals and significant charisma to carry the act. Lobby Loyde had already stepped back, and at Sunbury ’72 with the renewed Wild Cherries played similar woompa boompa music, and a sped-up, punchy version of GOD.</p>
<p>By this stage I had given up on Thorpie, too, and his people. I never recovered from the Chicago period Aztecs, with Lobby out front, cigarette on lip, eyes closed, flying. I didn’t have the stomach for Sunbury; I have always preferred smaller venues, as Lobby later did, where you can see musicians sweat and you don’t have other punters breathing down your neck and treading on your sneakers. The last time I saw the Aztecs, until their 2006 revival with Lobby in the closing stages of his cancer, was at the Melbourne Town Hall in June 1971. It was a sign of things to come, and indeed before the year was out I had been invited to join a manufactured band by an impresario who had worked out that there would be big money in the ‘suck more piss’ mob. I declined the invitation, which came just before my Year 12 exams; maybe this time my mother thought I had better sense. My brother had declined a separate offer to play bass with another rising band; in response to the query, ‘don’t you want to go professional?’, his response was, understandably, ‘no, I don’t want to be unemployed’.</p>
<p>The Town Hall event was paranoid in its ambition; massive inflatables on stage, banks of amplifiers, and Warren Morgan sitting up high like some Nosferatu in a gothic movie, playing back to the crowd on the Town Hall’s massive 19th-century pipe organ (this may have been the only occasion that keyboard work in the Aztecs was actually audible). The Cherries played too that night. There was a sense of great possibility, new beginnings, perverse respectability when Oz rock gained entry to the bastions of the Melbourne establishment, for the Town Hall was and is a serious space, dark and forbidding, redolent of the city’s burghers’ most serious claims to high respectability. The avant-garde, nevertheless, was entering the mainstream.</p>
<p>There were crossovers and continuities between the experiences of Lobby and Thorpie over this period, all the same. The two had grown together on Chicago blues, whose infectious 12-bar structure underpinned so much of rock and roll. The two bands in the 1971 period, the Wild Cherries and the Aztecs, shared a preference for long, slow, grinding motifs like GOD, for Lobby, or ‘Mama’, or ‘Time to Live’, for the Aztecs. They both came to cultivate chants or anthems – ‘Most People I Know (Think that I’m Crazy)’ for Thorpie, ‘Liberate Rock’ for Lobby. But for Lobby Loyde there was always GOD. The rock music of the period in Melbourne was loud and loose. Its heart, as Lobby put it in an interview with Clinton Walker for the ABC TV documentary series <italic>Long Way to the Top</italic>, was in the live scene, where the musicians connect with each other, the audience connects, and something magical happens.</p>
<p>Billy Thorpe was a shrewd businessman as well as a great performer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0725513611434136">Thorpe 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0725513611434136">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0725513611434136">Thorpe and Scatena 2010</xref>). He rode the wave of mass adulation, finally to escape to Los Angeles. Lobby Loyde stepped back. Unlike Thorpe, he didn’t sing, at least not with charisma. He liked to be marginal. After 1974 he steps back again, sick of being up front. He was a maverick who actually didn’t expect success, an oddity in a rock scene where others are always looking for a career escalator to ride, keen for recognition or for perks. Lobby Loyde forged no Faustian pact. This is why he died under-recognized.</p>
<p>Before Lobby revived his major bands to play closing gigs in those last moments of his life – he reformed the Purple Hearts, the Wild Cherries, the Aztecs and finally Coloured Balls before he died – I saw him play at a Melbourne club with sideman Sonny Hawkins. He shook my hand – the audience was two men and a dog, and a few young tearaways who didn’t know who he was – and said something about how us old blokes had to stick together. The closing number for the evening was typically sacrilegious – an acoustic version of GOD. He never stopped loving the form, the moment, or the experience. He kept playing, shifted into producing, encouraging younger players who had that intensity; he did those last gigs, and then he slipped away.</p>
