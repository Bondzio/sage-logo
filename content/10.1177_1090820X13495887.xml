<sec id="section1-1090820X13495887">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Hypotrichosis of the eyelashes may negatively influence an individual’s self-perception and appearance. Assessing the impact of treatment from a patient’s perspective may be particularly relevant in trials of aesthetic agents. Once-daily dermal (topically applied) administration of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% has been associated with increased eyelash prominence (ie, length, thickness, darkness).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1090820X13495887">
<title>Objectives:</title>
<p>The authors assess patient-reported outcomes (PRO) after treatment with bimatoprost for hypotrichosis of the eyelashes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1090820X13495887">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>In this multicenter, double-masked, randomized, vehicle-controlled, parallel clinical trial, 4 PRO questionnaires were distributed to 278 patients (bimatoprost [n = 137] and vehicle [n = 141]). The primary PRO questionnaire was the 23-item Eyelash Satisfaction Questionnaire (ESQ), which measured satisfaction in 3 domains: length, fullness, and overall satisfaction (LFOS); confidence, attractiveness, and professionalism (CAP); and impact on daily routine (DR).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1090820X13495887">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>By week 16, the bimatoprost group reported significantly greater improvements from baseline on all ESQ items (<italic>P</italic> ≤ .0433). These improvements were sustained through the 4-week posttreatment study visit. Patient satisfaction was significantly greater in the bimatoprost group than in the vehicle group for all 3 domains: LFOS (weeks 8-20; <italic>P</italic> ≤ .0052), CAP (weeks 12-20; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001), and DR (weeks 16 and 20; <italic>P</italic> ≤ .01).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1090820X13495887">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>The bimatoprost group reported significantly greater levels of positive patient outcomes and satisfaction than the vehicle group across all 23 questions and all 3 domains of the primary PRO questionnaire. These results support the effectiveness, as measured by objective measures and PRO, of once-daily bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% at producing more prominent eyelashes in adults.</p>

<p>Eyelashes function to protect the eye against airborne particles, as well as serve an important aesthetic role.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X13495887">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X13495887"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X13495887"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X13495887">4</xref></sup> Long, thick eyelashes are considered a sign of beauty in many cultures and are often desired by women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X13495887">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090820X13495887"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090820X13495887">7</xref></sup> As such, women have used a variety of techniques to enhance the overall prominence (ie, length, thickness, darkness) of their eyelashes for millennia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090820X13495887">8</xref></sup> The increased length of eyelashes has been described as having a positive psychological effect,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X13495887">5</xref></sup> which suggests that growth of eyelashes may be preferable to artificial techniques.</p>
<p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved the use of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% (LATISSE; Allergan, Inc, Irvine, California) for the treatment of hypotrichosis of the eyelashes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090820X13495887">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090820X13495887">10</xref></sup> A recent phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, vehicle-controlled study demonstrated that once-daily administration of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% was safe and effective at increasing eyelash growth and enhancing prominence when applied to the upper eyelid margins of healthy patients for up to 16 weeks (4 months).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090820X13495887">11</xref></sup> Of the 278 enrolled patients, 137 were randomized to treatment with bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% and 141 with vehicle. Efficacy was demonstrated by significant superiority of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% (compared with vehicle) in clinician ratings (ie, Global Eyelash Assessment [GEA] scores) and digital image analyses (DIA) assessing eyelash length, fullness/thickness, and darkness. Benefits of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% on all efficacy measures were sustained during a follow-up period lasting up to 1 month after treatment was discontinued. The adverse events (AE) reported in more than 2% of either treatment group were eye pruritus, conjunctival hyperemia, pinguecula, eye irritation, dry eye, erythema of the eyelid, upper respiratory tract infection, and skin hyperpigmentation. The only AE reported by a significantly greater number of patients receiving bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% than those receiving vehicle was conjunctival hyperemia (3.6% [n = 5] vs 0%; <italic>P</italic> = .028).</p>
<p>The mechanisms of action by which bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% promotes eyelash growth are not entirely known. It is suggested that bimatoprost influences the hair cycle of eyelashes by increasing the rate that follicles transition from the resting phase of the hair cycle (ie, telogen) into the growth phase of the hair cycle (ie, anagen), similar to prostaglandin analogues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090820X13495887">12</xref></sup> Bimatoprost also appears to cause follicles to remain in anagen for a longer period, subsequently resulting in a greater percentage of follicles in anagen, contributing to increased eyelash length.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090820X13495887">9</xref></sup> Bimatoprost increases eyelash darkness through putative effects on melanin production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090820X13495887">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The effectiveness of an aesthetic treatment such as bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% for eyelash growth can be evaluated using a number of measures, including clinician ratings and objective measures of eyelash growth. Patient-rated measures can also be used. Conceptually, a patient-reported outcome (PRO) is any report of a patient’s health status that comes directly from the patient without interpretation from another party.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090820X13495887">14</xref></sup> PRO can provide information regarding treatment effects for which there are no observable or physical measures. They can also provide a patient’s perspective on the effectiveness of treatment and allow for a formal assessment of a patient’s impressions. Initially used to assess pain, reliable PRO tools are now widely used in clinical trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090820X13495887">15</xref></sup> When assessing the impact of a treatment, PRO questionnaires can be used to investigate a wide range of concepts, events, behaviors, or feelings that may not be observable to clinicians.</p>
<p>PRO instruments vary in their design and implementation and have been used to assess treatment effects in a variety of therapeutic areas, including rheumatology, oncology, psychiatry, and plastic surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090820X13495887">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090820X13495887">17</xref></sup> These instruments can be administered on paper or via electronic media.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090820X13495887">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1090820X13495887">18</xref></sup> Instruments that ask patients to describe their current state may be superior to instruments that require them to recall prior states.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090820X13495887">19</xref></sup> Finally, when a PRO instrument requires a patient to compare his or her current state with a past state, a shorter recall period is preferred over an extended recall period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090820X13495887">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>PRO instruments have been successfully used in prior studies of facial aesthetic treatments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1090820X13495887">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090820X13495887"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1090820X13495887">22</xref></sup> Given that aesthetic treatments are not medically necessary, it is recommended that PRO instruments be used to assess the subjective response of patients undergoing such treatments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1090820X13495887">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>The present analysis aims to evaluate the patient-reported effectiveness of treatment with bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% for hypotrichosis of the eyelashes using data from 4 PRO questionnaires included in a phase 3 pivotal trial.</p>

<title>Study Design</title>
<p>The design of this study has been described in Smith et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090820X13495887">11</xref></sup> Briefly, this phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, vehicle-controlled study consisted of a 4-month treatment period and 1 month of posttreatment follow-up. Patients were required to be at least 18 years of age and dissatisfied with their overall eyelash prominence to be eligible for participation. Patients were also required to have minimal or moderate baseline eyelash prominence as assessed by a GEA score of 1 or 2 (on a 4-point scale), best-corrected visual acuity score equivalent to a Snellen acuity of 20/100 or better in each eye, intraocular pressure (IOP) ≤20 mm Hg in each eye, and standardized eyelash photographs at screening that were of acceptable quality for DIA. Patients were excluded from the trial if they had any uncontrolled systemic disease, lacked visible eyelashes, or had asymmetrical eyelashes. Additional exclusion criteria included any known disease or abnormality of the lids, lashes, ocular surface, or lacrimal duct system; known or suspected trichotillomania disorder; active ocular disease; ocular surgery during the prior 3 months; and concurrent treatment with any prostaglandin or prostamide, or treatments that may affect hair growth (eg, minoxidil, cancer chemotherapeutic agents), within 6 months of study entry.</p>
<p>Each patient attended 8 study visits: screening; baseline; week 1; weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16 (ie, months 1-4); and a posttreatment follow-up visit at week 20 (ie, month 5). At the baseline visit, patients were randomized (1:1 ratio) to use 1 drop of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% or vehicle per eye once daily. The medication was to be applied to each upper eyelid margin using a disposable, single-use-per-eye applicator and brushed along the upper eyelid margins nightly for 4 months. The study protocol was approved by institutional review boards, and all patients gave their written, informed consent to participate in the trial. The clinical trial registration number is NCT00693420 (accessible at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00693420">http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00693420</ext-link>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1090820X13495887">
<title>Efficacy Measures</title>
<p>The primary efficacy measure defined a priori was based on a 4-point, clinician-rated, reliable and reproducible measure of eyelash prominence, the GEA scale with photonumeric guide (1 [minimal], 2 [moderate], 3 [marked], and 4 [very marked]).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090820X13495887">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1090820X13495887">24</xref></sup> The DIA, based on standardized superior view eyelash photographs, was used as a secondary efficacy measure and assessed patients’ upper eyelash length, thickness, and darkness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1090820X13495887">
<title>PRO Measures</title>
<p>Four PRO questionnaires were used to record each patient’s perspective on the effectiveness of treatment and allowed for a formal assessment of the patient’s impressions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1090820X13495887">Table 1</xref>). These PRO questionnaires specifically measured patient perception of the importance of improving eyelash qualities, satisfaction with overall eyelash prominence, and the impact of treatment on perceived attractiveness, confidence, and daily eyelash routine.</p>

<p>The primary PRO questionnaire (the Eyelash Satisfaction Questionnaire [ESQ]) consisted of 23 items and was self-administered at every visit. Each item was scored according to the patient’s static perspective at the time of the assessment (ie, required no recall). The measure was developed and validated as a comprehensive measure for the assessment of 3 major concepts influential on eyelash self-perception and, as such, comprised 3 domains: length, fullness, and overall satisfaction (LFOS); confidence, attractiveness, and professionalism (CAP); and daily routine (DR). All items were scored on a 5-point Likert scale that varied by question. For instance, some items required patients to rate their level of agreement with a statement (ie, <italic>very much agree, agree, neutral, disagree</italic>, and <italic>very much disagree</italic>), whereas other items asked patients to rate their level of satisfaction (ie, <italic>very satisfied, satisfied, neutral, unsatisfied</italic>, and <italic>very unsatisfied</italic>) or assess current eyelash length (eg, <italic>very long, long, medium, short</italic>, and <italic>very short</italic>).</p>
<p>The LFOS domain of the ESQ consisted of 8 items, including a question regarding overall satisfaction, and assessed patients’ perspectives of the current physical characteristics of their eyelashes. A low score in this domain was indicative of a high degree of satisfaction in terms of the particular eyelash attributes queried, whereas a high score indicated dissatisfaction. The 10-item CAP domain assessed patient satisfaction with subjective measures contingent on eyelash health (eg, confidence, attractiveness, professionalism, healthiness, and perceptions of beauty). A low score in the CAP domain indicated a high degree of satisfaction in terms of the eyelash attributes assessed. The DR domain had 5 items and was intended to comprehensively assess patient perception of the time and effort required to make eyelashes presentable. A high score in this domain indicated a high degree of satisfaction in terms of the attributes assessed.</p>
<p>The second PRO (PRO-2) was a baseline questionnaire, which was collected only during the baseline visit, requesting patients to rate the importance of improving eyelash length, fullness, darkness, and number of eyelashes. This was a single-item questionnaire with 4 subquestions (ie, 1 question for each aspect of eyelash prominence). Patients assessed the importance of each aspect of eyelash prominence using a 5-point scale (ie, <italic>extremely important, important, neutral, not very important</italic>, and <italic>not important at all</italic>).</p>
<p>In the third PRO (PRO-3), patients were asked to complete a 39-item recollection questionnaire, the Eyelash Satisfaction Follow-up Questionnaire (ESFQ), at all postbaseline visits during the treatment period (ie, weeks 1-16). This instrument was a dynamic measure of change from baseline and aimed to assess participants’ perception of changes in physical and subjective attributes of eyelashes and eyelash care.</p>
<p>Finally, a fourth PRO (PRO-4) was collected only at the end of the study (week 20) visit. Participants were prompted to complete a single-item, posttreatment questionnaire. Patients were asked to rate their change in overall satisfaction with the appearance of their eyes, daily activities, and eyelash-related quality of life. The instrument used a 15-point scale ranging from <italic>a very great deal better</italic> to <italic>a very great deal worse</italic>. This last PRO, a global rating of change, was included to assist in the determination of the minimally clinical important difference of the ESQ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1090820X13495887">25</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1090820X13495887">
<title>Safety Measures</title>
<p>Safety assessments included the recording of AE, as well as ophthalmic examinations that assessed iris color, biomicroscopy measurements, IOP, and visual acuity, along with vital signs (ie, pulse rate and blood pressure) and physical examination.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1090820X13495887">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Efficacy and PRO-related data were assessed in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, defined as all randomized patients. Safety was assessed in the safety population, defined as all patients who received 1 or more doses of study medication.</p>
<p>For the PRO data, the response to each item or domain was summarized by descriptive statistics (ie, number of patients, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) or frequency distributions (ie, counts and percentages). No statistical adjustments to control type I error due to multiple comparisons were made, since PRO results were not primary or secondary efficacy end points. For the ESQ, change from baseline was also calculated for each visit. For the ESQ and the ESFQ, missing data were imputed up to week 16 using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method. Intergroup comparisons of change from baseline by follow-up visits were performed using a Wilcoxon signed rank test. Intragroup comparisons were performed using a Wilcoxon rank sum test. To assess the concordance between the patients’ overall satisfaction with their eyelashes and efficacy measures, the ESQ were summarized and compared with change in GEA score from baseline and change in eyelash length.</p>

<title>Patient Demographics</title>
<p>A total of 278 patients enrolled in the trial and comprised both the ITT and safety populations. Among those 278 patients, 137 patients received bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% and 141 patients received vehicle. Overall, 257 (92.4%) patients completed the trial. The 2 groups were comparable at baseline, with no statistically significant demographic difference (ie, age, race, sex, and iris color) and had similar distribution of GEA scores. Overall, the mean (SD) age of the patients was 49.8 (11.5) years (range, 22-78 years). The majority of the population was female (97.1%) and white (80.9%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090820X13495887">11</xref></sup></p>

<title>ESQ</title>
<p>At baseline, there were no significant differences between the 2 treatment groups on any of the 23 individual items or 3 domains of the ESQ. At week 16, both treatment groups demonstrated improvements from baseline in mean scores of all 3 domains, but significantly (<italic>P</italic> ≤ .0076) greater improvements were seen in patients treated with bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% compared with those patients receiving vehicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090820X13495887">Figure 1</xref>). During the treatment period, patients receiving bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% reported significantly greater improvements from baseline compared with vehicle for the LFOS domain at weeks 8 to 16 (<italic>P</italic> ≤ .0052), for the CAP domain at weeks 12 to 16 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001), and for the DR domain at week 16 (<italic>P</italic> = .0076). The differences favoring bimatoprost were sustained through week 20 (ie, 1 month after treatment was stopped) for all 3 domains of the ESQ (<italic>P</italic> ≤ .01).

<p>When individual items measuring satisfaction in the LFOS domain were analyzed, most patients receiving bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% reported they were satisfied or very satisfied with the length (68.6%), fullness (57.7%), and darkness of (54.8%), and overall satisfied (64.9%) with their eyelashes at week 16. The proportion of patients that reported such satisfaction at baseline was considerably less (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1090820X13495887">Figure 2</xref>). In comparison, the percentage of patients receiving vehicle who were satisfied or very satisfied with eyelash length, fullness, darkness, and overall satisfaction were 20.6%, 17.8%, 25.6%, and 18.5%, respectively. Similar to the LFOS domain, patients treated with bimatoprost for eyelash growth demonstrated higher levels of satisfaction at week 16 than at baseline for all CAP domain items (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1090820X13495887">Figure 3</xref>). For instance, when queried on day 1 regarding their level of confidence, only 2.2% of patients in the bimatoprost-treated group felt confident with their looks at baseline (without use of mascara) compared with 22.8% at the end of treatment (vs 11.3% in the vehicle group). Similarly, only 2.9% and 2.8% of patients in the bimatoprost- and vehicle-treated groups, respectively, reported at baseline they “very much agreed” or “agreed” that without mascara, their eyelashes look naturally attractive; at the end of treatment, 28.5% of patients in the bimatoprost group and 9.9% in the vehicle group felt their eyelashes look naturally attractive without the use of mascara, respectively. As indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1090820X13495887">Table 1</xref>, patients treated with bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% were significantly more likely than patients receiving vehicle to report they were satisfied with their daily eyelash routine as assessed by the DR domain of the ESQ.</p>

<title>Other PRO Questionnaires</title>
<p>The baseline PRO questionnaire (PRO-2) asked patients to rate the importance of improving 4 eyelash characteristics: eyelash length, eyelash fullness, eyelash darkness, and number of eyelashes. For each characteristic, there were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in rating the importance of improving such characteristics.</p>
<p>Of the 39 items comprising the ESFQ, 3 items were not scored on a Likert scale. These items were, therefore, not amenable to statistical analysis. However, at week 16, patients receiving bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% were more likely (vs vehicle) to receive positive feedback (56.3% vs 16.3%) and notice the greatest change in eyelash length (65.2% vs 23.4%). Most participants receiving bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% (52.6%) noticed a change in their eyelashes within the first 2 months of treatment. Of the remaining 36 items, only 1 item (ie, “treatment preferred to daily mascara usage”) did not reach statistical significance favoring bimatoprost. The remaining 35 items were all statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) in favoring bimatoprost at week 20. In addition, 34 items were significant at week 16, and 33 items were significant at week 12.</p>
<p>For the posttreatment questionnaire (PRO-4) administered at week 20, the mean (SD) scores for this PRO measure were 3.6 (2.3) for the bimatoprost-treated group and 6.8 (1.9) for the vehicle-treated group (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001), with lower scores representing greater overall improvement. Of the patients applying vehicle, 9.6% responded that their satisfaction with the appearance of their eyes, daily activities, and aspects of eyelash-related quality of life were a “very great,” “great,” or a “good” deal better than at the beginning of the study, whereas 56.6% of patients receiving bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% for eyelash growth selected the same responses. More than half (56.8%) of the vehicle-treated patients reported no change in their satisfaction with the appearance of their eyes, daily activities, and some aspects of eyelash-related quality of life, compared with 12.4% of patients in the bimatoprost-treated patients. Representative results after treatment for 16 weeks with bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% at night to the skin of the upper eyelid margin at the base of the eyelashes are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1090820X13495887">Figures 5</xref> (more dramatic) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1090820X13495887">6</xref> (less dramatic).</p>

<title>Overall Satisfaction With Eyelashes by Treatment Response</title>
<p>The PRO measures used in the present study were intended to provide insight regarding patient perspectives of treatment effects. As previously reported, bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% was associated with significantly greater overall eyelash prominence as assessed by the GEA as well as darker, longer, and thicker lashes as assessed by DIA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090820X13495887">11</xref></sup> With regard to the single ESQ item asking patients about overall satisfaction, at week 16, 65.0% (n = 89) of patients receiving bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% reported they were satisfied or very satisfied compared with 18.4% (n = 26) in the vehicle group. Additional analysis examining levels of overall satisfaction for patients who received bimatoprost treatment by changes in eyelash length as assessed by DIA demonstrated that patients who experienced greater amounts of change from baseline in eyelash length reported increasingly greater levels of overall satisfaction. The majority (76.3%) of patients who experienced at least a 1-mm increase in eyelash length reported that they were “satisfied” or “very satisfied” with their eyelashes overall.</p>
<p>The relationship between patient satisfaction as assessed using the ESQ, clinician-rated GEA, and DIA was also examined. All 3 (100%) patients who experienced the maximum increase of 3 grades on the GEA scale reported satisfaction with their eyelashes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1090820X13495887">Figure 4</xref>). Of the 42 patients who experienced a 2-grade increase from baseline on the GEA scale, 90.5% reported satisfaction with their eyelashes. Of the 62 patients who experienced a 1-grade increase from baseline GEA score, 64.5% reported satisfaction with their eyelashes at the end of the 16-week treatment period. The mean increases in eyelash length experienced by patients who increased from baseline by 0, 1, 2, or 3 grades on the GEA scale were 0.5 mm, 1.3 mm, 2.1 mm, and 2.2 mm, respectively, indicating concordance between increases in eyelash length and increased prominence. These results indicate that improvements of eyelash prominence as demonstrated by 1-, 2-, or 3-grade increases on the GEA scale and increases in length of approximately 1.3 mm (mean change in the pivotal phase 3 multicenter study was 1.39 mm) were perceived as clinically meaningful aesthetic benefits by a large proportion of the patients who experienced this change (data on file, Allergan, Inc).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As reported by Smith et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090820X13495887">11</xref></sup> bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% for eyelash growth was effective and well tolerated. Treatment with bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% resulted in statistically significant improvements from baseline compared with vehicle in all evaluated measures of efficacy (ie, clinician-rated GEA and DIA), indicating increases in eyelash length, fullness, darkness, and overall prominence. Changes in IOP, although statistically significant, were not clinically meaningful. Conjunctival hyperemia was the only AE significantly more common in patients receiving bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% than those receiving vehicle. The incidence of conjunctival hyperemia seen in patients treated with bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% for eyelash growth (3.6%) was markedly less than that reported when bimatoprost was instilled ocularly for glaucoma or ocular hypertension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1090820X13495887">26</xref></sup> This safety profile is consistent with reports that the amount of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% delivered to the upper eyelid margin skin with the applicator is, on average, approximately 5% of that delivered by the indicated 1-drop ocular dose for the treatment of glaucoma (unpublished data, Allergan, Inc).</p>
<p>Given the aesthetic nature of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% treatment, in addition to assessing efficacy with objective measures, it is critical to examine PRO results. The PRO tools are recognized as important measures that provide insight into patient perception of treatment effects and effectiveness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090820X13495887">14</xref></sup> The formal assessment of patient views provided by measures of PRO is extremely valuable, since patient satisfaction can influence a patient’s decision to continue treatment and may affect the physician-patient relationship.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1090820X13495887">23</xref></sup> The present analysis further clarified the effects of treatment with bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% on eyelash growth using 4 questionnaires. The 1-item baseline questionnaire confirmed that most patients thought it was very important to make their eyelashes longer, darker, and fuller/thicker or to increase in number. The remaining 3 PRO questionnaires included in the trial assessed patient perspectives on the effectiveness of treatment.</p>
<p>Patients treated with bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% for eyelash growth reported feeling more satisfied with their eyelash prominence, more confident in their looks, more attractive, and more satisfied with their DR than they did before treatment or compared with those patients receiving vehicle. Patients reported their eyes looked vibrant and less tired with bimatoprost-treated eyelashes than they did before treatment or compared with patients receiving vehicle. The ESQ, which did not require patient recall, demonstrated statistical significance favoring bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% on all items by 16 weeks of treatment. Subsequent analyses demonstrated considerable concordance of the instrument with the clinician’s GEA and objective DIA, such that levels of patient satisfaction with bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% treatment for eyelash growth increased in relation to the physical characteristics of their eyelashes. Improvements in eyelash prominence as assessed by clinician-rated GEA scale scores and increases in eyelash length of approximately 1.3 mm were perceived as clinically meaningful aesthetic benefits by a large proportion of patients who experienced such a change. The effects of daily bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% use were sustained through the 1-month posttreatment follow-up period. This is consistent with other reports that suggest the effects of prostaglandin analogues on eyelash growth can persist for some time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090820X13495887">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% for eyelash growth is the only FDA-approved product shown to safely and effectively grow eyelashes, making them longer, fuller, and darker. Globally, eye makeup represents the fastest growing category of color cosmetics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1090820X13495887">27</xref></sup> Other products that aim to enhance eyelash appearance (eg, mascara, eyeliners) do not affect the growth of eyelashes, and as such, bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% may be a convenient and safe method for achieving longer, darker, and fuller eyelashes.</p>
<p>Although the current analysis presents largely PRO results, the importance of clinician ratings and other objective efficacy measures such as those obtained using DIA must also be considered when evaluating the efficacy of aesthetic treatments. In the present trial, the growth of eyelashes was not only observed through the statistical interpretation of clinical measurements as reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090820X13495887">11</xref></sup> but was also noticeable and acknowledged as beneficial by the study participants.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, the 23-item ESQ used in this study represents the first PRO questionnaire developed to assess the patient’s perspective of eyelash prominence in either a controlled clinical population or a sample from the general population. The results of the 39-item ESFQ are similar to those of the ESQ, but there is a possibility that some recall bias may be present with this measure since the items are based on patient memory of eyelash appearance at baseline prior to treatment. This recall bias may partially reduce the instrument’s reliability. The results of the present analysis should be viewed in light of several limitations of the bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% pivotal trial. Although safety has been demonstrated for bimatoprost as an ophthalmologic agent for chronic treatment of glaucoma, new data are needed to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% as treatment for eyelash hypotrichosis. Treatment periods longer than 4 months will also provide more clarity on the long-term patient-reported outcomes of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% for eyelash growth. Since the present study largely excluded individuals with dark skin as a result of the technical (ie, contrast) requirements of DIA, as well as individuals with ocular pathology in general, future studies should evaluate the safety and efficacy of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% for eyelash growth in these patients.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Despite the study’s limitations, the present results suggest that once-daily administration of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% is an effective treatment for healthy adults with hypotrichosis of the eyelashes. Bimatoprost administration results in significant improvement in patient satisfaction with their eyelashes, including aspects of satisfaction with the physical attributes of eyelashes (length, fullness, and thickness), the subjective attributes related to their eyelashes (eg, confidence, attractiveness, and professionalism), and the daily routine involved in making their eyelashes look presentable. In conjunction with the efficacy results observed on the clinician-rated GEA scale as well as DIA and previously reported safety data,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090820X13495887">11</xref></sup> this trial supports that bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% is safe, is effective, and has positive patient-reported outcomes in growing eyelashes.</p>
