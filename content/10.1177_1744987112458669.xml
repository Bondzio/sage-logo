<p>The rapid increase in gene-disease discoveries offers real promise of clinical applications for people and families affected by genetic conditions but for which health professionals are not prepared because of lack of training. The availability of clinically relevant education resources is critical to enabling nurses to develop the appropriate genetics-genomics knowledge and skills to provide optimum care for individuals and families.</p>
<p>The Internet is a core resource to support teaching and learning in nurse education. Evaluating such resources is important to maximise the education experience, particularly for subjects traditionally perceived by nurses as being difficult. <italic>Telling Stories, Understanding Real Life Genetics</italic> is a web-based educational resource. It uses real accounts from individuals and professionals to promote understanding of the impact of genetics-genomics on the lives of people and their families. Google Analytics™ Web analytics service provides time series data for analysing web usage to optimise website effectiveness. We present data of visitor activity and behaviour from 123 countries over three years from 2009–2011 and consider how the application of the web analytics informs approaches to enhancing visibility of the website, provides an indicator of engagement with genetics-genomics both nationally and globally, and informs future expansion of the site as a global resource for health professional education.</p>
<p><italic>Telling Stories</italic> is an accessible, broad-reaching resource that is of global relevance for health professionals, attracting over 33,500 visitors between 2009–2011, with steadily increasing numbers of returning visitors. The United Kingdom, United States, Canada and the Netherlands are the largest site users. Returning visitors spend significantly more time on site and view more pages than new visitors. Most referring sites are education establishments. More needs to be done now to enhance the site’s accessibility for people of other languages and cultures.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1744987112458669" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>In his review of the scientific advances since the human genome was initially sequenced in 2001, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744987112458669">Lander (2011)</xref> comments on the impact of the dramatic acceleration in biomedical research on our understanding of the biological basis of inherited diseases and cancer. When the Human Genome Project was launched in 1990, fewer than 100 of the genes associated with single gene conditions had been identified, but a decade after its completion more than 2850 Mendelian disease genes have been identified. Research into the genetic basis of common diseases and traits has also been characterised by ‘an explosion of discoveries’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744987112458669">Lander, 2011</xref>:191). In 2000, only around a dozen genetic variants associated with common diseases were known but by 2011 over 1100 variations associated with more than 165 common conditions had been found.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987112458669">Feero and Green (2011)</xref> comment on how the rapid increase in gene-disease discoveries is leading to benefits for people and families affected by genetic conditions in terms of accurate diagnosis, with the promise of novel treatments for many. However, they caution that although there is still much to be done, the discoveries offer real promise for clinical applications for which health professionals are not prepared because of lack of training. Specialist genetic services have limited capacity to meet this need and a knowledge-practice gap in relation to genetics-genomics limits mainstream service provision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987112458669">Feero and Green, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The report by the United Kingdom’s Human Genomics Strategy Group (HGSG) (<italic>Building on our inheritance</italic>, 2012) echoes these views, stating that ‘Increased knowledge and better use of genomic technologies and genetic data will form the basis for a reclassification of disease, with important implications both for predicting natural history and for identifying more effective therapies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744987112458669">HGSG, 2012</xref>:14). This offers benefits across the spectrum of healthcare, presenting a major change in medical practice and public health. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987112458669">Burton (2011)</xref> argues firmly that it is for the clinical specialties to develop and integrate genomic technologies, rather than the specialist genetics services expanding to move into the ‘medical mainstream’. One of the greatest challenges in realising the benefits however lies in equipping healthcare professionals with the knowledge and skills to use genomic technology and information in everyday practice.</p>
<p>As the largest sector of the health professional workforce, this has significant implications for nurses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987112458669">Jenkins and Calzone (2012)</xref> question the extent to which nurses are educationally prepared to integrate genomic technology, including being able to translate complex information to individuals and families. An evidence-based programme of activities to improve the knowledge and skills of the nursing profession in relation to genetics/genomics is in place in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987112458669">Jenkins and Calzone, 2012</xref>), in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744987112458669">Kirk et al., 2008</xref>) and across Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744987112458669">Skirton et al., 2010</xref>). Globally however, preparation of nurses in this subject area is variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744987112458669">Kirk et al., 2011a</xref>) and exposure to clinical situations to support training may be limited. In their review of genomic education resources for nurses, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1744987112458669">Tonkin et al. (2011)</xref> highlight the availability and accessibility of clinically relevant teaching and learning material that links theory to practice. They see such resources as critical to enabling nurses to develop the appropriate genetics-genomics knowledge and skills to provide optimum care to individuals and families both now and as new discoveries are applied to healthcare.</p>
<p><italic>Telling Stories, Understanding Real Life Genetics</italic> is a free web-based, multimedia education resource launched in 2007. Hosted by the NHS National Genetics Education and Development Centre, it was created for the nursing professions and subsequently expanded for use by other health professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744987112458669">Kirk et al., 2011b</xref>). It aims to promote understanding of the impact of genetics-genomics on the lives of people and their families and to demonstrate the relevance of genomic healthcare to professional practice. Using real accounts from service users and providers, stories are set within an educational framework, accompanied by a ‘toolbox’ of resources (including video clips to accompany 29 stories so far) to stimulate learning and develop practice. The site supports the teaching of core scientific concepts as well as providing learners with an opportunity to explore a range of clinical situations.</p>
<p>The site is dynamic and new content continues to be uploaded. Evaluation has been positive from site visitors and from the storytellers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744987112458669">Kirk et al., 2011b</xref>). The <italic>Telling Stories</italic> team uses Google Analytics™ Web analytics service, a communication technology tool, to help monitor site performance. This is a hosted service providing time series data for tracking and analysing website usage, freely available to Google account-holders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1744987112458669">Plaza, 2011</xref>). Its application has been reported by several authors in other fields and to a limited extent in health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987112458669">Crutzen et al., 2012</xref>) but not to our knowledge in relation to health professional education.</p>
<p>In this paper we present data of visitor activity over three years from 2009–2011 and consider how, in the context of an internet-delivered education resource, the application of the web analytics:
<list id="list1-1744987112458669" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>informs approaches to enhancing visibility of the website</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>provides an indicator of engagement with genetics-genomics both nationally and globally</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>informs future expansion of the site as a global resource for health professional education.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The context in which the website operates is an important factor in the interpretation of the data. Demographic information on selected countries will be presented and the wider context of global activity in genetics-genomics and nursing will be discussed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1744987112458669" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title>
<p>The <italic>Telling Stories</italic> Google Analytics™ account was opened in January 2009. Account-holders are provided with a code that is then inserted into the HTML code of every page of a website that the site owners wish to track over time. Google Analytics™ then uses cookies (small text files) to gather information about website usage. The first time the website is accessed from a specific device (such as a laptop computer or mobile phone), Google Analytics™ downloads the cookie (containing a unique identifier and the domain name of the website) onto that device. The cookie gathers information from the device for this and subsequent visits, on website usage.</p>
<p>On accessing their account, website owners are presented with a user-friendly display (the ‘dashboard’) of standard website performance indicators over any specified time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1744987112458669">Figure 1</xref>). In addition, custom data can also be sought, providing further in-depth information on demographics, visitor behaviour, technology, traffic sources and content. The data can be exported to a spreadsheet for further analysis.
<fig id="fig1-1744987112458669" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>The Google Analytics™ dashboard: visitor overview 2009–2011 (Source: Google Analytics™ for www.tellingstories.nhs.uk.)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1744987112458669-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Activity for all pages within the www.tellingstories domain can be tracked by Google Analytics™. We gathered the following data relating to the period 1 January 2009–31 December 2011.</p>
<sec id="sec3-1744987112458669"><title>Visitors and visits</title>
<p>Information was sought on the number of visits and visitors over the three years and annually. We looked at the number of new and returning visitors and their activity (number of visits; average time on site; average pages viewed per visit). Activity is an important component in assessing engagement as a single visit on its own does not necessarily indicate interaction with the site. The number of pages viewed per visit does give an indication of interaction, and these data incorporate video clips viewed and downloadable PDF files for each story and toolkit. Google Analytics™ records a visitor as ‘new’ the first time the website is accessed from a device that does not contain the cookie for the website (in this case, <italic>Telling Stories</italic>). Visitors are categorised as ‘returning’ when the device they are using does contain the cookie. In this case, Google Analytics™ will record the session as a visit, but not as an additional visitor. Statistical analysis (Chi-square) was conducted using the bounce rate to compare activity between new and returning visitors.</p>
<p>Google Analytics™ notes the number of individual visitors to the site and also captures the proportion of these who are returning. The cumulative total of returning visitors was recorded at six monthly intervals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1744987112458669"><title>Bounce rate</title>
<p>The bounce rate is the percentage of visitors who view only one page before leaving the site, and thus it acts as a quality metric. It is reported only as a percentage by Google Analytics™ and will be expressed in this paper as a whole percentage. Generally, a high bounce rate could be seen as indicating that visitors who enter the site do not find the entrance page to be of relevance. However, it could also be that the visitor comes to the page via a bookmark for a particular page or a search term has been used that brings them directly to the information required. The visitor then views what they need before leaving the site from that same page. For this reason, it is useful to look at bounce rate alongside metrics on the time spent on site.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1744987112458669"><title>Location</title>
<p>Google Analytics™ provides information about visitor location. We looked at site usage by country and city. To provide further insight into global activity, we selected the top 10 countries ranked by site usage, and any other countries where 10 or more returning visitors were recorded in any one year between 2009–2011. Sixteen countries in total were included. Demographic detail on population and numbers of practising nurses was sought for these countries using data from the United Nations and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).</p>
<p>For each country where Google Analytics™ recorded some interaction with <italic>Telling Stories</italic>, we sought evidence of activity in provision of specialist genetic services in that country. One indicator used was country representation/membership of Human/Medical Genetics societies and Google searches were performed to ascertain this. Building on a survey by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744987112458669">Kirk et al. (2011a)</xref>, evidence of genetic nursing activity was determined by: the availability of nurse training in genetics; formal recognition of the specialist genetic nurse role in that country; the existence of a national organisation for genetics nurses/ counsellors; country representation in the membership of the International Society of Nurses in Genetics (ISONG) as of January 2012; membership of the European Network for Genetic Counsellors and Nurses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1744987112458669"><title>Traffic source</title>
<p>Google Analytics™ tracks the origin of every visit to the website. Visitors may come directly to the site by typing its URL (Uniform Resource Locator: a unique address for a resource available on the World Wide Web) into their browser or clicking its URL in their Favourites menu; these are referred to as direct visitors. Other visitors may click on a link to <italic>Telling Stories</italic> provided on another website: known as a referring site. Finally, visitors may come to the site via a search engine such as Google or Yahoo. We sought information on traffic sources for all countries over the three-year period, comparing new and returning visitors against the metrics of pages per visit, average time on site and bounce rate. Chi-square analysis was conducted using the bounce rate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1744987112458669"><title>Referring sites</title>
<p>Google Analytics™ records the URL of all referring sites. Ranking URLs according to the number of visitors coming from that site indicates which sites are most successful in referring visitors and identifies any unexpected referring sites. This in turn may indicate additional avenues to explore to boost site traffic. The top 25 referring sites were considered.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1744987112458669"><title>Keywords</title>
<p>Keywords used by visitors who come to the site via search engines can be captured by Google Analytics™. Understanding which keywords bring visitors to the site can help inform the development of site content. We looked at the top five keywords used in searches from the 16 selected countries.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1744987112458669"><title>Language</title>
<p>Monitoring visitor language preference settings can help direct plans for development of the site as a global resource and is an important adjunct to location where countries have diverse, multicultural populations speaking different languages. Language is determined from the browser setting. Preferences for different versions of a language have been grouped together. For example, English-United Kingdom, English-USA and English-Canada are combined into a single group as are Portuguese-Portugal and Portuguese-Brazil.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1744987112458669"><title>Mobile traffic</title>
<p>Information about the technology that visitors use helps to inform decisions about site development. We interrogated Google Analytics™ to identify the proportion of visitors who were using mobile devices to access <italic>Telling Stories</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1744987112458669"><title>Ethical approval</title>
<p>The development and maintenance of the <italic>Telling Stories</italic> website itself has had approval from the Faculty of Health, Sport and Science Ethics Committee, University of Glamorgan. The Google Analytics™ data do not contain any personally identifiable information.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1744987112458669" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<sec id="sec13-1744987112458669"><title>Overview of activity</title>
<p>The overview of visitor activity displayed on the standard dashboard (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1744987112458669">Figure 1</xref>) shows that <italic>Telling Stories</italic> was accessed by 33,536 visitors in 43,065 visits. A total of 200,148 pages have been viewed from 2009–2011, incorporating 4428 video clips and 2636 PDF files.</p>
<p>The visits, plotted on a daily basis, show six spikes in activity. The dates of these spikes can be identified by Google Analytics™. Three coincide with conference presentations about <italic>Telling Stories</italic>, one coincides with an email promotion and one with media coverage of the 100<sup>th</sup> story being uploaded (8 December 2011). We are unable to account for the sixth spike (6 May 2011).</p>
<p>If activity is plotted on a monthly basis, comparing visits from new and returning visitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1744987112458669">Figure 2</xref>) it can be seen how new visitors account for the majority of visits, with notable fluctuations in activity. Returning visitors show a more consistent level of activity.
<fig id="fig2-1744987112458669" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Visits from new and returning visitors by month, 2009–2011 (Source: Google Analytics™ for www.tellingstories.nhs.uk.)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1744987112458669-fig2.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Plotting the cumulative total of unique visitors to the site who have returned and used the site on more than one occasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1744987112458669">Figure 3</xref>) indicates that this group has increased year on year with a linear trajectory. Returning visitors come back to the site with varying frequency, for example 345 returning visitors left more than six months between visits, 79 visited more than a year later. For educators, this may link with times of curriculum delivery over an academic year.

</fig></p>
<p>Data can be further broken down by year to compare visitor activity over time. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1744987112458669">Table 1</xref> sets out information on new and returning visits, the average number of pages viewed per visit, the average time spent on site and the bounce rates.

<p>Whilst new visits have increased each year, returning visitors are more engaged with the site. They view more pages on average on each visit and spend longer on the site, e.g. 11.6% visit for between 10–30 minutes and 21.4% have visited the site nine or more times. Returning visitors are also significantly less likely to bounce than new visitors.</p>

<p>The United States (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1744987112458669">Figure 4(c)</xref>) and the United Kingdom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1744987112458669">Figure 4(d)</xref>) are the largest site users. New York City and New York State show the greatest activity in the US (2492 visits), followed by California (941), Pennsylvania (787) and Texas (774). In the UK, London (6533), Caerphilly (1261), Manchester (869) and Birmingham (724) have the highest number of visitors.</p>
<p>Looking at site traffic from new and returning visitors over the period in the 16 selected countries (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1744987112458669">Table 2</xref>) it can be seen that the highest numbers of visits are associated with many of the English-speaking countries. Whilst 14 of the countries show an upward trend in new visitors, the trend for returning visitors numbers is less clear. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1744987112458669">Table 3</xref> presents more detail on the activity of returning visitors and again, does not reveal any clear trends in relation to the average pages viewed per visit, average time on site, or bounce rate. Whether English is widely spoken in the country does not appear to be an influencing factor, although it may contribute to the length of time on the site for some countries.

All 16 countries appear to have some activity in relation to provision of specialist genetics services and evidence of nursing activity was found in all bar two countries. Of all 123 countries (data not shown), in those where the total number of visits over three years was 50 or more (<italic>n</italic> = 36 countries), we found evidence of activity in both genetics service provision and nursing engagement in genetics in 26 (72%) of these countries, evidence of either service provision or nursing engagement in 6 (17%) countries and evidence of neither in 4 (11%) countries. For the countries with fewer than 50 visits (<italic>n</italic> = 87), we could find evidence of both service provision and nursing activity in only 15 (17%) countries, with no evidence of either activity found for 36 (41%) countries.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1744987112458669">Figure 5</xref> sets out how visitors come to the site and subsequent behaviour for both new and returning visitors. Three traffic sources are identified: direct traffic, referring sites, and visitors coming via search engines.
<fig id="fig5-1744987112458669" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Traffic sources and visitor behaviour: new and returning visitors 2009–2011</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1744987112458669-fig5.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Returning visitors stay on the site longer and view more pages on average than new visitors irrespective of source, with returning visitors who come to the site directly staying longest. There are significant differences between new and returning visitors in relation to the bounce rate for visitors coming to the site through all three access routes; direct (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), referring sites (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and search engines (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). These results show that returning visitors from all sources are less likely to bounce than new visitors. These results remain significant at the 0.05% level (that is<italic> p</italic> &lt; 0.0005) which is the significance level adopted for this paper.</p>
<p>A more in-depth analysis of traffic from referring sites found over 560 sites have linked to <italic>Telling Stories</italic>. The top 25 referring sites are shown (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1744987112458669">Table 5</xref>). It is worth noting that a site such as Google could show as a referring site if the user has set up short cuts/links to the most recently used websites, or has clicked a link from a non-search results page on Google.com.

<p>Over the three-year period, less than 0.1% of visits (1660) were accessed using mobile technology. The UK and US accounted for 85.5% of all such visits. These mobile users have a lower average page/visit rate (1.6 compared with 4.5), spend less time on the site (1 minute 7 seconds) and have a high bounce rate (80%). Nine of the 34 visits from Nigeria used mobile phones.</p>

<sec id="sec20-1744987112458669"><title>Website visibility</title>
<p>Since its launch in 2007, the website has become well established and attracted over 33,500 visitors between 2009 and 2011 from 123 countries. Over 22% of visitors returned to the site, around 7% of these coming directly to it and 24% of visitors coming via links on over 560 other sites. This indicates that the site has good visibility. The number of returning visitors shows a steady increase, with such visitors spending more time on site with less tendency to bounce. The average time spent on site and the average number of pages viewed for both new and returning visitors indicates that the content does generate interest. This is reassuring when raising awareness about genetics and genomics and its relevance to health professional practice is a major challenge for nurse leaders in this field.</p>
<p>The analysis indicates that there is scope for improvement, in increasing the conversion of new visitors to returning ones, decreasing the bounce rate and increasing the time spent on site. An important factor in this is the quality of the ‘landing page’. This aspect, along with a more in-depth analysis of visitor behaviour and needs, is the subject of a further paper.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec21-1744987112458669"><title>Global activity in context of nursing engagement with genetics services and healthcare</title>
<p>The <italic>Telling Stories</italic> website usage may relate to the levels of activity in genetic nursing in each country. It is possible that the use of such resources is linked to countries where nursing competences in genetics exist. This is certainly the case in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744987112458669">Kirk et al., 2003</xref>) and the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744987112458669">Greco et al., 2006</xref>), where such competencies have existed for some years. Within Japan, there is a strong development in genetic nursing and development of a set of genetic competences for nurses in that country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987112458669">Arimori et al., 2007</xref>), which might also help to account for the level of interest there. It is relevant to note that in a recent systematic review, it was clear that nurses’ knowledge of genetics was poor even in those countries with a relatively long tradition of genetic nursing and nursing competences, such as the US, Canada and the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987112458669">Godino and Skirton, 2012</xref>). This emphasises the ongoing need for effective educational resources.</p>
<p>ISONG is an organisation that has had a considerable influence on the integration of genetics into nursing. It was founded in the US but includes members from Canada, Japan, UK and Brazil, all of which featured in the top 10 countries in the analysis of traffic and returning visitors. The goals of ISONG include promoting nursing as part of genetic healthcare services and incorporating genetics into nursing education (www.isong.org/ISONG_about.php). As the resource has been publicised at ISONG through conference presentations, it may be that members in those countries are encouraging its use among colleagues or nursing students.</p>
<p>Those countries from Europe that also appeared in the top ten visitor lists were Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, Netherlands and Ireland. Within Europe the involvement of nurses in genetic healthcare has been limited to a few countries until very recently. However, the increase in application of genomic technologies has forced acknowledgement that a multi-disciplinary workforce is needed to address a population’s genetic healthcare needs. A recent survey (Cordier et al., 2012) indicates that genetic nurses are working in eight European countries and, of these, Italy has the greatest number of genetic nurses (<italic>n</italic> = 37), while Finland, Romania and the UK each have 20 genetic nurses (although the UK has around 300 genetic counsellors, many of whom are nurses). Nurses are also working in genetic healthcare in Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland and Ireland. Genetic counsellors are employed in France (<italic>n</italic> = 75), the Netherlands (<italic>n</italic> = 65), Norway, Denmark, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. While the <italic>Telling Stories</italic> website may be used by health professionals working outside specialist genetics or by students, there could be a relationship between use of the site and the presence of genetic nurses or genetic counsellors, who are frequently involved in providing health professional education within a country. However, the use of the resource is greatly limited as it is available only in English. The differences in cultural norms and healthcare systems might also have an impact on the perceived usefulness of the website and we welcome collaboration to help address this.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec22-1744987112458669"><title>Global development of the resource</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1744987112458669">Tonkin et al. (2011)</xref> note that there is an extensive range of good quality education resources to facilitate the development of nurses’ knowledge and skills in genetics-genomics. They suggest that building on these to provide relevant content for individual nations may be preferable to developing new material. The development of the <italic>Telling Stories</italic> website commenced in 2005 and there is still much we wish to do, particularly in building it as a global resource. There are a number of factors that have to be considered in relation to this.</p>
<p>Whilst there are indicators of global activity, in many countries this is sporadic and minimal. There is a trend towards increasing numbers of new visitors, but the bounce rate associated with these is high. To promote engagement with the site, we need to develop content that is culturally relevant to the countries visiting the site most frequently. However, there are economic constraints to such work, particularly for translation to and from other languages.</p>
<p>The gradual move towards mobile technology for health applications and mobile learning (mLearning) necessitates that the resource be developed in a mobile-friendly format. The growth in mobile phone usage in developing countries may provide a valuable route to enhancing accessibility.</p>
<p>Referring sites include a number of UK and overseas universities, professional organisations and health related sites. It is interesting that three out of the top five referring sites are outside the UK, including two academic institutions. We were also pleased to note the role of patient/family support organisations in referring visitors to the site. Increasing the breadth of sites linking to <italic>Telling Stories</italic> will help improve visibility to a greater proportion of our target audience. Indeed, activity at another institution or organisation event where <italic>Telling Stories</italic> has been utilised may account for the unexplained spike in activity. As a result of this analysis, we plan to target more such organisations to invite them to link to the site, both nationally and internationally.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec23-1744987112458669"><title>Limitations</title>
<p>Google Analytics™ does not provide demographics on individual users and any occupational role of a visitor cannot be ascertained. Site usage thus cannot be compared across professional groups, ages, qualifications of visitors or other personal variables. The URL of referring sites can provide some insight into possible visitor background (such as those coming from patient support groups, universities or the health sector). Satisfaction with the site is not captured and must be inferred by other metrics such as the number of returning visitors, time spent on the site and bounce rate. As indicated earlier, time spent on site does not necessarily indicate engagement and this metric needs to be viewed in the context of other data, such as the number of pages viewed. There also needs to be some caution in interpreting the bounce rates over time for both new and returning visitors however. The activity of returning visitors in the US and UK (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1744987112458669">Table 3</xref>) illustrates this. The increase in bounce rate over the three years could be indicative of established visitors coming solely to view a specific page and then leaving. For new visitors, a high bounce rate could be indicative of the increasing number of people who search the internet for diverse reasons and on clicking on the search link, quickly determine that it is not relevant.</p>
<p>Google Analytics™ relies on the device accessing the website to accept cookies. If it does not, a returning visitor would be counted as a new visitor so the number of returning visitors may be underestimated. Furthermore, because Google Analytics™ takes its data from the device used to access the website, it may not distinguish between sessions conducted where a device has multiple visitors. Thus there may be an underestimate of the number of unique visitors to the site (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1744987112458669">Figure 3</xref>), although not the number of visits.</p>

<p>In the digital age, online education resources play an essential role in supporting teaching and learning. However, as with <italic>Telling Stories</italic>, such resources can be personnel-intensive and developed over an extended period. Optimising such resources, particularly in economically challenging times, is essential and rigorous evaluation is fundamental to this. Google Analytics™ provides a useful tool for evaluation, helping to improve visibility through understanding visitor activity and behaviour. The perspective it provides of national and international activity, in conjunction with additional demographic data, offers some insight into global engagement both with the resource and more generally, with genetics-genomics.</p>
<p><italic>Telling Stories</italic> provides a useful resource that is of global relevance for nurses and other health professionals, as well as members of the public. More needs to be done now to enhance the accessibility and relevance of the website for people of other languages and cultures.</p>
