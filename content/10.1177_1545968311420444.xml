<title>Introduction</title>
<p>For peripheral nerve repair, tissue-engineered nerve grafts (TENGs) have been developed as a promising alternative to the autologous nerve grafts that are considered as the gold standard.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1545968311420444">1</xref></sup> TENGs typically consist of a neural scaffold with support cells and growth factors. Typical scaffolds include a nerve guidance conduit (NGC) with or without lumen fillers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1545968311420444">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1545968311420444">7</xref></sup> Following a peripheral nerve injury with a long gap between proximal and distal ends, axonal regeneration is highly restricted due to inhibitory molecules and the lack of growth-promoting cues, resulting in random growth patterns and aberrant innervation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1545968311420444">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1545968311420444">11</xref></sup> In comparison to a neural scaffold alone, a scaffold with support cells can increase the length of a nerve gap that can be bridged.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1545968311420444">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Among a variety of support cells, Schwann cells (SCs) are the most important candidate because they are primary structural and functional glial cells and play a crucial role in peripheral nerve regeneration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1545968311420444">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1545968311420444">13</xref></sup> The clinical use of SCs, however, are associated with many difficulties,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1545968311420444">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1545968311420444">17</xref></sup> which sparked interest in other sources of support cells. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are pluripotent cells that localize in the stromal compartment of the bone marrow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1545968311420444">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1545968311420444">22</xref></sup> MSCs can serve as support cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1545968311420444">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1545968311420444">28</xref></sup> We used a silicone NGC with MSCs for sciatic nerve regeneration in rats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1545968311420444">29</xref></sup> More recently, we repaired a 50-mm-long sciatic gap in dogs with a TENG of a chitosan NGC inserted with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) fibers and autologous MSCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1545968311420444">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>To explore the maximum repair capacity of MSCs-based TENGs and obtain further evidence to support translation from experimental studies, we bridged a 60-mm-long sciatic nerve gap in dogs with TENGs that were also prepared by introducing autologous MSCs to a chitosan/PLGA scaffold. The regenerative outcomes of TENGs were evaluated by a combination of behavioral analysis, electrophysiology, retrograde tracing, and histological examination.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1545968311420444">
<title>Animals</title>
<p>Twenty adult male Beagle dogs, weighing 8 to 10 kg, were provided by Yangzhou University (Yangzhou, Jiangsu Province, China). All experiments involving animals were carried out in accordance with the US National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals and approved by the administrative committee of experimental animals of Jiangsu Province.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1545968311420444">
<title>Harvest and Characterization of MSCs</title>
<p>Autologous MSCs were isolated and cultivated from dogs as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1545968311420444">31</xref></sup> For cell characterization, MSCs at passage 2 were treated with 0.125% trypsin and 0.01% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) for 5 minutes, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 0.1 M, pH 7.4), and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate–labeled or phycoerythrin-labeled monoclonal antibodies against CD29, CD11b, CD34, CD45 (all from BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA), and CD133 (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, California), in dark at 4°C for 30 minutes, followed by phenotypic analysis with flow cytometry (BD FACScalibur, San Jose, California). In a separate experiment, the cells were treated with 0.125% trypsin and 0.01% EDTA, resuspended in PBS, and fixed with 70% cool ethanol overnight at −20°C; the fixed cell samples were centrifuged, washed, and stained with propidium iodide (PI)/RNase staining buffer (BD PharMingen, San Jose, California) for 30 minutes at 4°C and analyzed by flow cytometry.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1545968311420444">
<title>TENG Construction</title>
<p>An NGC with an inner diameter of 5 mm, a wall thickness of 0.6 mm, and a length of about 60 mm was made up of chitosan (Nantong Xincheng Biochemical Company, Nantong, Jiangsu, China) as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1545968311420444">6</xref></sup> A bundle of about 1000 PLGA fibers (14 µm in diameter and about 60 mm in length each; Holycon Biochemical Instrument Co, Nantong, Jiangsu, China) was threaded into the NGC lumen and pulled to form a longitudinal alignment by using a crochet hook, thus building a chitosan/PLGA scaffold. For implantation to a sciatic nerve gap, 2 ends of the NGC were anastomosed to the proximal and distal nerve stumps, which had penetrated into the NGC lumen about 1 mm, and PLGA fibers were fixed within the coaptations followed by trimming redundant fibers. Then, a suspension of autologous MSCs in saline at the cell density of ~1 × 10<sup>8</sup>/mL was injected from the distal coaptation until full occupation of the conduit lumen. Thus, implantation of TENGs was concomitant with their construction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1545968311420444">
<title>Surgical Procedure</title>
<p>After each dog was anaesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (30 mg/kg body weight), the sciatic nerve in the left lateral thigh was exposed by making a skin incision and splitting the underlying muscles. A segment of sciatic nerve was excised and removed, leaving a 60-mm-long gap following retraction of nerve stumps.</p>
<p>The dogs were randomly divided into 3 grafted groups and a nongrafted group (n = 5 in each group). The former included an autograft group, in which the resected segment of sciatic nerve was reimplanted into the nerve gap; a TENG group, in which the sciatic nerve gap was bridged by a TENG prepared as described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1545968311420444">Figure 1A</xref>); and a scaffold group in which the sciatic nerve gap was bridged by a chitosan/PLGA scaffold alone. In a nongrafted group, the sciatic nerve gap was left untreated. The surgical incision in all animals was closed in a routine fashion, and the dogs were housed and fed the same.</p>

<title>Behavioral Analysis</title>
<p>Posture and gait were recorded with videotapes and photos over a 12-month period. To evaluate the motor function of the hind limbs, we used a scale proposed by Levine and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1545968311420444">32</xref></sup> with some modification, in which the function score of hind limb ranges from 0 to 100: a score of 100, normal; a score of 0, complete paralysis of the hind limbs (D. Levine, Pelvic limb functional score, personal communication, 2004). All tests were accomplished by 2 investigators blind to the treatment who reviewed the videotapes and raw data files recorded at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months postsurgery. The final score for each animal was the mean value of each investigator’s scores. This scale categorizes a combination of posture, muscle atrophy, hind limb movements, stair climbing, sit–stand transition, hind limb force, dancing, stand upright, and joint motion (see Supplementary Table 1, available online).</p>

<sec id="section8-1545968311420444">
<title>Electrophysiological Assessment and FluoroGold (FG) Retrograde Tracing</title>
<p>For electrophysiological tests, the sciatic nerve on the injured side was reexposed under anesthesia before electrical stimuli (10 mA in strength, 0.01 ms in pulse width) were applied to the nerve trunk at the proximal and distal ends sequentially, and compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) were then recorded in the gastrocnemius belly on the ipsilateral side by using a portable digital MYTO electromyographic machine and Galileo NT System software (Esaote, Genua, Italy). CMAPs were also recorded on the contralateral uninjured side. The motor nerve conduction velocity (MCV) was calculated from the CMAP amplitude and the distance between the distal and proximal stimulated sites.</p>
<p>For FG retrograde tracing, 100 µL of 5% FG solution (Fluorochrome Inc, Denver, Colorado) was injected into the regenerated nerve trunk 10 mm from the distal end, and then the incision was closed. After survival for 2 weeks, animals were transcardially perfused sequentially with saline and 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS. The spinal cord segments at L6, L7, and S1, together with the corresponding dorsal root ganglia (DRGs), were excised and cut into 30-µm-thick transverse sections (for spinal cords) and 20-µm-thick longitudinal sections (for DRGs) on a cryostat, followed by observation under a DMR fluorescent microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) with ultraviolet illumination and photography under a confocal laser scanning microscope (TCS SP2, Leica). The percentage of FG-labeled DRG sensory neurons was calculated by dividing the FG-positive cell number by the total neuron number, and the number of FG-labeled spinal cord motoneurons was directly counted. For neuron counting, serial sections were obtained from spinal cord specimens and divided into 4 parts according to the rule of counting 1 out of every 4 slides. Therefore, only a quarter of these spinal cord segments were counted and the total number of motor neurons in these 3 spinal cord segments was calculated. Both spinal cord and DRG sections displayed enough nonspecific background autofluorescence to help identify neuron bodies. Furthermore, only a FG-labeled neuron with relatively complete cell contour was counted under a fluorescent microscope.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1545968311420444">
<title>Morphometric Analyses</title>
<p>The gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles on both sides were harvested from deeply anesthetized animals, and the wet weight of muscles was measured. Several pieces were cut from the mid-belly of gastrocnemius muscle and embedded in paraffin. The procured 5-µm-thick transverse sections were prepared to undergo Masson trichrome staining followed by observation under light microscopy. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) staining was applied to the longitudinal sectioned gastrocnemius muscle followed by visualization under light microscopy as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1545968311420444">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>Afterward, animals were transcardially perfused. The regenerated nerve, together with 2 nerve segments 20 mm beyond the 2 ends of the graft, were dissected out. The contralateral uninjured sciatic nerve served as a control. Transverse sections from the distal portion of regenerated nerve were obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1545968311420444">Figure 7A</xref>). They were subjected to Meyer modified trichrome staining followed by visualization under light microscopy, and photographs were taken with a DFC 300FX color digital camera (Leica) as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1545968311420444">6</xref></sup> They also underwent immunofluorescent double-staining with rabbit anti-S100 polyclonal antibody (1:400 dilution) and mouse anti-NF200 monoclonal antibody (1:400 dilution, both from Sigma, St Louis, Missouri), in which the primary antibodies were added to allow incubation at 4°C overnight, followed by further reaction with TRITC-labeled secondary antibody goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200) and FITC-labeled secondary antibody goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200, Gibco) at 4°C overnight, and the sections were observed under a fluorescent microscope (DMR, Leica).</p>
<p>The nerve and muscle specimens were respectively harvested from 3 randomly selected animals of each group in the same way and cut into ultrathin sections for staining with lead citrate and uranyl acetate and observation under a transmission electron microscope (Jeol, Tokyo, Japan) as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1545968311420444">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The nerve and muscle specimens were further subjected to morphometric analysis by using a Q550 IW image analysis system (Leica Imaging Systems Ltd, Cambridge, England) and Leica QWin software package as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1545968311420444">6</xref></sup></p>

<title>Characterization of MSCs</title>
<p>MSCs were isolated from the bone marrow of dogs according to cell adhesion to plastic and used for the same dog. In primary culture, a morphologically homogeneous population of spindle-like, small rounded, large flattened cells was observed. From passage 2, MSCs grew rapidly, more than 90% of cells showed a spindle-like shape and retained high proliferative potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1545968311420444">Figure 2A</xref>). To confirm the identity of MSCs, cell phenotype analysis indicated that most of the cells were positive for CD29 but negative for CD11b, CD34, CD45, and CD133 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1545968311420444">Figure 2B</xref>); cell cycle analysis showed that 60% to 70% and 30% to 40% of MSCs were at G<sub>0</sub>-G<sub>1</sub> and S phase, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1545968311420444">Figure 2C</xref>).

According to behavioral analysis, the 3 grafted groups, unlike nongrafted animals, exhibited a gradual increase in the hind limb function score over 12 months and no significant differences from 1 to 6 months postsurgery. The hind limb function score was significantly higher in TENG and autograft groups than in the scaffold group from 9 to 12 months postsurgery; furthermore, the hind-limb function score in TENG and autograft groups were similar to each other throughout the 12-month period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1545968311420444">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Functional Recovery Evaluation</title>
<p>To examine the restoration of electrophysiological properties at 12 months postsurgery, CMAPs and motor nerve conduction velocities were determined on the injured side versus the contralateral uninjured side. As expected, no CMAP was recorded on the injured side of nongrafted dogs. In contrast, CMAP values were detected on the injured side of 3 grafted groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1545968311420444">Figure 4A</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1545968311420444">C</xref>) and on the contralateral uninjured side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1545968311420444">Figure 4D</xref>). There were no significant differences in the CMAP amplitude between 3 grafted groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1545968311420444">Figure 4E</xref>). As for the MCV, despite no significant difference between autograft and TENG groups, the parameter in the scaffold group was significantly lower or lower than that in the autograft or TENG group, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1545968311420444">Figure 4F</xref>; see Supplementary Material for data).

<title>Electron microscopy</title>
<p>According to transmission electron microscopy, in 3 grafted groups, the regenerated myelinated fibers as well as numerous unmyelinated fibers were dispersed in clusters, and the myelinated axon was surrounded by a clear, thick, and electron-dense myelin sheath that was thinner than that in contralateral uninjured nerves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1545968311420444">Figure 6B</xref>: b4-e4). The lamellae structure of myelin sheaths of regenerated nerves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1545968311420444">Figure 6B</xref>: b5-e5) provided further evidence for this observation.</p>
<p>Transmission electron micrographs were further used for morphometric analysis to obtain the important parameters about myelinated nerve fibers. Either the myelin sheath thickness or myelin lamellae number in the TENG group was smaller than that in the autograft group and larger than that in the scaffold group with significant differences between each other. The diameter of myelinated fibers in the autograft group was significantly larger than that in the scaffold or TENG group, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1545968311420444">Figure 6C</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1545968311420444">E</xref>; see Supplementary Material for data).

<title>Histological Observation and Morphometric Analysis of Target Muscles</title>

In the 3 grafted groups, the muscle cells on the injured side of animals were uniform in their size and their nuclei were under the sarcolemma, but the muscle situation remained worse on the injured side than on the contralateral uninjured side even after 12-month recuperation. In the autograft or TENG group, a few collagen fibers were present only among muscle fiber bundles, while in the scaffold group a number of collagen fibers were present among muscle fiber bundles and among muscle cells. In the nongrafted group, however, serious muscle atrophy, adipocyte hyperplasia, and a large number of collagen fibers were seen.</p>

<p>AChE staining of the motor endplates on longitudinal sections of gastrocnemius muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1545968311420444">Figure 7A</xref>: a2-e2) further indicated that target muscle atrophy in the 3 grafted groups was attenuated to varying degrees because of target reinnervation after the repair of injured sciatic nerves. In brief, the size and shape of motor endplates in the scaffold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1545968311420444">Figure 7A</xref>: b2) or TENG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1545968311420444">Figure 7A</xref>: c2) group were comparable with those in the autograft group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1545968311420444">Figure 7A</xref>: d2); in the nongrafted group, however, motor endplates were hardly found but showed serious atrophy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1545968311420444">Figure 7A</xref>: a2). In contrast, the motor endplates in the normal muscle on the contralateral uninjured side displayed an oval-shape or orbicular-ovate appearance with homogeneous and clear structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1545968311420444">Figure 7A</xref>: e2).</p>
<p>In addition, transmission electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1545968311420444">Figure 7A</xref>: a3-e3) exhibited that the target muscle in the 3 grafted groups, just like the normal muscle on the contralateral uninjured side, was featured by the regularly arranged sarcomeres and myofibrils and the well-organized Z-bands in myofilaments; in the nongrafted group, however, disorganization and fragmentation of myofilaments in the vicinity of Z-bands were observed with intact and degenerated areas existing in some muscle cells.</p>
<p>Morphometric analysis offered quantitative comparison in target muscle-associated parameter. (<italic>a</italic>) The wet weight ratio (injured side/contralateral uninjured side) of either gastrocnemius or tibialis anterior muscle was significantly smaller in the nongrafted group than in each grafted group and also in the scaffold or TENG group than in the autograft group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1545968311420444">Figure 7B</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Behavioral analysis indicated that MSC-based TENGs improved the healing of peripheral nerve injuries and the restoration of locomotive activities. Indeed, motor recovery was similar to autografts. TENGs produced better hind limb motor function compared with scaffolds alone by 9 months postsurgery.</p>
<p>The amplitude of the CMAP is proportional to the number of nerve fibers innervating the muscle, and the MCV positively correlates with the diameter of myelinated nerve fibers and the myelin sheath thickness. In this study, unlike the CMAP amplitude, the MCV was significantly smaller in the scaffold than the autograft group but not smaller in the TENG than the autograft group. These results correspond with the morphometric differences of regenerated nerves among the 3 grafted groups.</p>
<p>FG retrograde tracing is usually used to confirm the completeness of nerve regeneration and axonal transport. The percentage of labeled sensory neurons in autograft and TENG groups was similar and higher than for the scaffold group. The result might be attributable to the establishment, by MSCs, of a favorable microenvironment that encouraged sensory function restoration.</p>
<p>Histology revealed the reconstruction of 60-mm sciatic nerve gaps in animals at 12 months postsurgery. The maturity of regenerated myelinated nerve fibers is usually assessed by the diameter distribution of myelinated nerve fibers or myelin sheath thickness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1545968311420444">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1545968311420444">38</xref></sup> We found that the maturity of regenerated nerve fibers, as indexed by these 2 parameters, was better in the TENG group than in the scaffold group, presumably due to MSCs. The frequency distribution of the diameter of myelinated fibers showed a progressive, significant decrease from autografts to TENGs to scaffolds, but the mean diameter of myelinated nerve fibers on the injured side of all 3 grafted groups was significantly less than the contralateral uninjured side. Accurate path finding guides the regenerating axons to their targets for appropriate reinnervation, which is thus considered as a measure of nerve regeneration. In this study, both target muscles (tibialis anterior muscle and gastrocnemius muscle) showed significantly better recovery, as indexed by the wet weight ratio values in the autograft group than the scaffold or TENG group. Presumably, the preserved structure of autografts provided the most ideal pathway and microenvironment for regenerating axons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1545968311420444">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this and a previous study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1545968311420444">30</xref></sup> TENGs with the same composition and structure were used in similar animal models. This study, however, featured a longer nerve gap, longer follow-up, and more detailed outcome measures. The data increase the feasibility of translation to clinical trials using autologous MSCs as support cells for peripheral nerve applications.</p>
