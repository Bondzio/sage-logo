<p>Anniversaries call us to remember the past and Princeton’s Seminary’s two hundredth anniversary presents a unique opportunity to revisit the history of the study of Old Testament at Princeton in the nineteenth century and ask what lessons it has to teach us as we face the future. This article examines the work of Princeton’s legendary Old Testament professors, Archibald Alexander, Charles Hodge, Joseph Addison Alexander, and William Henry Green, as well as three of Green’s colleagues, James Frederick McCurdy, Gerhardus Vos, and John Davis. It shows development and continuity in teaching and scholarship as the Old Princetonians confronted cutting-edge issues of their day, committing themselves tirelessly to their vocations as Christian teachers and scholars, and diligently training students to serve the Church and academy.</p>

<p>Anniversaries call us to remember the past and Princeton’s Seminary’s two hundredth anniversary presents a unique opportunity to revisit the history of the study of Old Testament at Princeton in the nineteenth century. This subject was a very big part of my life for several years as it was the focus of my doctoral thesis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0040573612453159">1</xref></sup> As I read the journals, sermons, lecture notes, and publications of the Old Princetonians, they became friends and mentors.</p>
<p>This article suggests that Princeton Seminary’s heritage should be celebrated as its students received one of the finest theological educations available in America. Academic excellence was expected of both faculty and students. The Old Princetonians were bound together ideologically and familially. While much good came out of the continuity, loyalty, and tenacious inflexibility of approach, their inbreeding became problematic. Still they remind us of the importance of asking such questions as: What makes a good teacher? What is Scripture? How do we read the Bible as a divine and human book? and What is the role of confessions and tradition in the interpretive task? The Old Princetonians remind us that a recognition of the otherness of religion need not be antithetical to grappling with scholarship. They remind us of the importance of training and hiring faithful, articulate, and well-rounded scholars to continue Princeton’s long tradition of “the highest grade of biblical and theological learning.” The usefulness of the archival materials they left reminds us of the importance of keeping records for future generations. In this article I want to revisit Princeton’s legendary professors of the Old Testament, making their dry bones live, so that we can consider what they can teach us today.</p>
<p>Archibald Alexander (1772–1851), Princeton Seminary’s founder and first professor, was responsible for teaching all subjects, including the Old Testament. Following the Plan of the theological seminary drafted in 1810 by Ashbel Green, Alexander gave biblical studies a central place in the school’s curriculum.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0040573612453159">2</xref></sup> He taught students biblical languages, introduction to the Bible, biblical history, and biblical geography. Alexander’s approach to teaching had a defensive or apologetic orientation. Two basic assumptions undergirded his teaching. First, Alexander assumed the otherness of Scripture and second, he believed in the usefulness of modern scientific studies of texts. Alexander’s teaching of the Scriptures showed his commitment to study the Bible as both a divine book and as a book that should be studied using tools consistent with Scottish common sense realism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0040573612453159">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Alexander’s teaching on the formation of the canon exemplifies Alexander’s “both and” approach to the study of the Bible.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0040573612453159">4</xref></sup> Alexander talked to his students about the problem of phrases and even whole chapters in the Old Testament that looked like additions, corrections, or updates, suggesting that a group of inspired men of the synagogue, whom he designated “the Society of Biblical criticism,” made changes to earlier texts. He proposed that these inspired editors, working “before the lamp of inspiration was entirely extinguished,” added details such as the account of the death of Moses, and updated what would have been obscure to later readers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0040573612453159">5</xref></sup> Thus using a “both and” approach, Alexander tried to solve legitimate critical problems theologically.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0040573612453159">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Alexander faced the task of interpreting the Scriptures with confidence in his early career. Questions raised by critics were not threatening to his faith. He believed that the results of any legitimate critical inquiry into the biblical texts would necessarily corroborate the orthodox understanding of Scripture. Alexander repeatedly encouraged openness to critical inquiries into the Scriptures, arguing that “faith which is weakened by discussion is mere prejudice, not true faith.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0040573612453159">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Consistent with his avowed openness to new ideas, Alexander was committed to keep abreast of developments in continental biblical scholarship. In 1833 Alexander wrote a review of contemporary German scholarship to inform his American readership of what he thought was an impending battle in the realm of biblical studies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0040573612453159">8</xref></sup> Passionately and prophetically he wrote,<disp-quote>
<p>If the church consents to close her eyes upon the increasing facilities for biblical investigation which are possessed in Germany, and to turn away from the controversies which are there waged, she will find herself in a field of battle without armour, or, if armed, with the mail and greaves and heavy weapons of a former age, wholly unsuited to the emergency, and the new modes of attack.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0040573612453159">9</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Alexander looked to German confessional scholars such as Hengstenberg to deliver the frontal attacks against scholars who based their theories on what Alexander named as “the German ground of skepticism and nonsense.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0040573612453159">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Alexander embraced a supporting role in the battle over radical biblical criticism: he introduced students and readers to new ideas and when tensions existed between the results of modern critical inquiry and the traditional ways of understanding the Bible, he defended tradition. Using rhetorical language, sarcasm, and contempt as ways of dealing with the serious challenges to traditional views of revelation, inspiration, the miraculous, and history, he schematized the issue as one of faith and unbelief. He argued that the Scriptures were “either a revelation from God” or they were “a vile imposture.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0040573612453159">11</xref></sup> So when pushed to the wall, Alexander’s “both and” approach became more of an “either or” response. Under duress, Alexander’s preferred weapon of warfare was apologetics and it can be argued that apologetics seemed to devour Old Testament studies under Alexander.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0040573612453159">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Alexander realized he could not carry the teaching load by himself and in 1820 his 23-year-old student, Charles Hodge (1797–1878), was appointed to teach biblical languages.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0040573612453159">13</xref></sup> Hodge was an excellent teacher and fostered such interest in biblical languages that his students raised $1100 over a period of five years to fund a professorship in Oriental and Biblical Literature. Hodge pushed to make the study of Hebrew and Greek the “urgent order of the day at the seminary,” a precedent that was followed until the tumultuous decade of the 1920s. In 1822, Hodge became Princeton’s first Professor of Oriental and Biblical Literature, a position he held until 1840 when he was transferred to the chair of exegetical and didactic theology.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that Hodge’s approach to the study of the Old Testament was similar to that of his teacher and mentor, Archibald Alexander. Like Alexander, Hodge believed that the presuppositions one brought to the study of the Bible determined the outcome of the study. Hodge spoke of two approaches to the study of the Bible. Following the first, he suggested we come “to the Bible in some measure as we would enter God’s presence, and read its pages as we would hear his voice.” By contrast, using the second approach, “we come to the scriptures as to the works of men, without reverence, and without prayer, trusting in ourselves, our rules, or our learning.” Hodge believed that the results of the second approach were “disastrous.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0040573612453159">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hodge’s commitment to Reformed confessionalism, however, did not block his openness to contemporary biblical scholarship, and as a young scholar he worked diligently to learn everything he could about Scripture and biblical scholarship. In a letter written during the second year of his teaching, he confessed, “I have more writing to do than I should, and really believe that I shall find it essential to carry on the study of six languages this winter. I look forward to a pretty severe term, for I must keep up before my students or they will find out.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0040573612453159">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Like Alexander, Hodge was committed to disseminating new ideas. To that end, in 1825 he founded the seminary’s quarterly journal, <italic>The Biblical Repertory</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0040573612453159">16</xref></sup> which initially produced translations, reprints, and reviews of important continental works on the criticism and interpretation of the Bible. Hodge essentially edited Princeton’s highly influential journal until 1871.</p>
<p>In 1826 Hodge left his teaching position and family for two years to do graduate studies with the best European scholars. He approached his studies cautiously having been warned by Alexander that he would breathe a poisoned atmosphere in Germany: “If you lose that lively and deep impression of Divine truth, if you fall into skepticism or even into coldness, you will lose more than you gain from all your German professors and libraries.” Alexander wanted Hodge “to come home enriched with Biblical learning, but abhorring German philosophy and theology.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0040573612453159">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Alexander’s wishes came true. Hodge went to Europe as a young, enthusiastic professor and returned a well-trained scholar. He returned with stronger opinions about German philosophy and critical scholarship and renewed convictions about the legitimacy of the theological and philosophical tradition in which he had been nurtured. His studies had made him more cautious about critical scholarship and like his new mentors, the German confessionalists, Neander, Tholuck, and Hengstenberg, he became a nay-sayer to radical criticism. Initially, Hodge’s students and the readers of the journal reaped the benefits of his training. But for a number of reasons, Hodge never really blossomed as an Old Testament scholar. Within five years of his return, for reasons of ill health, and perhaps because he felt he should step aside for Princeton’s prodigy, Joseph Addison Alexander, he began to relinquish some of his teaching responsibilities in the Old Testament. Over time, Hodge’s interests shifted to systematic theology where he would make his most lasting contributions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0040573612453159">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Joseph Addison Alexander (1809–60), the son of Archibald Alexander, was the most eccentric and brilliant of the Old Princetonians.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0040573612453159">19</xref></sup> Early on his genius was recognized. He learned the Hebrew alphabet at six and Hebrew grammar at ten when his father prepared a Hebrew grammar just for him. He taught himself Arabic at 12 from a grammar he found in his father’s study. By the time he was14, he had read the Koran, and studies in Persian and Syriac soon followed. His biographer estimated that he knew well between 21 and 24 languages and several others less well.</p>
<p>In his early twenties, Alexander had a conversion experience, which gave him new focus, and soon he was studying theology under the direction of his father and Hodge. The brilliant Alexander shaped his own training: he studied the Old Testament passage by passage over the course of a year. He went over each text twice in unpointed Hebrew looking up every word in Gesenius’s lexicon, and reading the whole article upon it carefully. He then analyzed the pointed text, reading every related article in Gesenius’s primer. During this time he memorized the Psalter in Hebrew and English, as well as the opening verse of each chapter in Isaiah. Alexander also mastered several German, Syriac and Aramaic grammars and read extensively in biblical criticism and other subjects related to the Old Testament. In addition, he critically reviewed the works of contemporary scholars, wrestling with the important question, “To what extent can one use the results of scholarship which is based upon presuppositions which are contrary to orthodox Christian theology?”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0040573612453159">20</xref></sup> At this point in his life, he determined that he should promote German scholarship that was based on sound presuppositions and was not antagonistic to faith.</p>
<p>Alexander’s directed studies included reading the great books written by biblical scholars of the past. He was greatly disturbed by contemporary disrespect for the great divines of the church and the evident discontinuity between scholarship of the past and the present. In 1833 he asked Christian scholars to consider giving Augustine and Calvin the same kind of attention as Eichhorn and Gesenius since he thought that it would be worse to “abjur[e] all idolatrous dependence upon the fathers and reformers” than to “fill their empty niches with the rationalists, and pyrrhonists, and pantheists of Germany.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0040573612453159">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Alexander’s quest for knowledge took him to Europe where he studied with many masters, most notably with confessional scholar Hengstenberg. His esteem for Hengstenberg became excessive, however, and instead of publishing a commentary on Psalms based on his own scholarship and creative engagement with the text, for example, he popularized Hengstenberg’s ideas. This decision was unfortunate because Alexander’s notes on the Psalms suggest that he was exploring important new directions in Psalms’ scholarship related to the question of the theological shaping of the Psalter.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0040573612453159">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>For 25 years Alexander had teaching responsibilities in the area of Old Testament studies at Princeton Seminary. Like his father and Hodge, he carried a very heavy teaching load, but he even added to it when he offered special classes for Old Testament enthusiasts in Arabic, Aramaic, Syriac, and advanced exegesis. Biblical studies under the brilliant and eccentric Alexander took on a new life. His teaching style was unique and his courses and publications were distinguished by his breadth of knowledge, his mastery of biblical scholarship, and his personal idiosyncrasies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0040573612453159">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>In truth, Alexander was only a great teacher for some. He had little patience for the “very dull or incorrigibly stupid youths” who were present in almost all of his classes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0040573612453159">24</xref></sup> Not surprisingly, some students felt that he imbued them with too much learning. After three years of Hebrew with Alexander, some thought they had “learned enough of oriental literature to teach Hebrew anywhere, except perhaps in a German university.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0040573612453159">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Alexander was a very good teacher of exegesis, however. One student wrote that every chapter of Isaiah that Alexander “touched seemed to be suddenly lighted up with a new beauty and glory, and often a single remark would be so suggestive that it seemed at once to pour light all over the Bible.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0040573612453159">26</xref></sup> Sadly, Alexander’s brilliant exegesis was shared only in the classroom and pulpit and rarely in print where his scientific and empirical training and his deference to other scholars won over his romantic spirit.</p>
<p>Alexander’s two-volume commentary on Isaiah was his most successful published work. Students loved to peak into the window of his office as he wrote his commentary. His biographer described what they saw:<disp-quote>
<p>Alexander had 2 standing desks reaching from one end to the other of his large study. These were 2 stories high … [and] held about 50 volumes, all of them open. Alexander would first pass down the line where the commentaries were, then on to the lexicons, then to the other books, and when he was through, he would hurry to the table at which he wrote, write rapidly for a few minutes, and then return again to the books, and this he would repeat again and again for 10–12 hours together.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0040573612453159">27</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Alexander mastered both contemporary and classic works on Isaiah. He was drawn toward accepting the findings of scientific research, but he rejected the work of extreme rationalists. In his diary, he castigated Hitzig’s work on Isaiah, judging it “disgusting.” He opined, “He is far worse than Gesenius, more unblushing, and malignant; his remarks on the offer of a sign to Ahaz are worthy of Tom Paine.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0040573612453159">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Alexander recognized that the debate over the notion of a second Isaiah was really one of presuppositions. He made a case for the unity of the book of Isaiah, but admitted the difficulty of establishing direct proof either for or against the book’s unity. Unlike his father and Hodge, however, Alexander did not battle the issue of presuppositions. He seemed to resign himself to the present impasse in the field of biblical studies.</p>
<p>Alexander’s lecture notes from his Old Testament classes provide further examples of his willingness to engage scholarship and think in new ways about old problems. In a lecture on the book of Joshua, for example, Alexander examined the evidence for the theory that the book was made up of a mass of heterogeneous fragments. Based on what he found, he argued that the old assumptions about the book’s chronological sequence and structure be dropped. Instead he advocated an approach to reading Joshua that was sensitive to the book’s literary structure. He proposed, for example, a re-examination of passages in which Joshua is said to have conquered the whole land, since he felt that in several places, the intention of the author was to “designate the boundaries within which Joshua was victorious, without necessarily or even naturally implying that there were no other enemies there left to conquer.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0040573612453159">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>Alexander’s work in hermeneutics was also important.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0040573612453159">30</xref></sup> He positioned himself between those who denied prophecy and inspiration and those who followed a strictly literal or entirely figural reading of biblical texts. He commended the “natural” method of interpreting Scripture, a method built on reason and sanctified by common sense. Briefly he posited that the Scriptures be interpreted as both human and divine: the human words, he argued, required the use of general hermeneutical principles; the divine word of God needed to take into account the phenomena of revelation, inspiration, and prophecy. Alexander’s ideal interpreter was open to “sense” what method of interpretation would be appropriate to a particular text in light of a careful reading of its immediate and canonical context. The sensitive reader would be also able to determine whether a particular text warranted a literal, figurative, or even a double-sense reading. Alexander felt that the history of interpretation supported his methodology, with Calvin modeling the ideal approach to interpretation.</p>
<p>Alexander’s quest to seek the middle ground between extremes in interpretation symbolized his conflicted life as a Christian academic. Born into the Old Princeton School, he valiantly tried to remain faithful to its traditions and at the same time he felt compelled to modernize orthodoxy in America, by wedding the truths of orthodoxy and the Enlightenment. Though Alexander made great strides in modernizing Old Testament studies at Princeton, he did not develop his full potential as a scholar. His most innovative ideas related to the Old Testament were never fully developed or shared with the academic world.</p>
<p>One of J.A. Alexander’s most promising students was William Henry Green (1825–1900).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0040573612453159">31</xref></sup> At 17 Green began his theological studies at Princeton Seminary and at 21 he began teaching biblical languages. Green was a lover of languages and in 1861 he published the first of many editions of his popular book, <italic>A Grammar of the Hebrew Language</italic>; two years later he published <italic>A Hebrew Chrestomathy</italic> for students. He was also a great teacher, though like Alexander, he did not tolerate laziness or trifling.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0040573612453159">32</xref></sup> Students spoke of him as a rigorous taskmaster of the Hebrew bondage. One student recalled that Green assigned unusual lessons and hurled “exhaustive questions like hot shot,” and on one occasion in the recitation room, Green asked one student over sixty questions on the first word of Genesis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0040573612453159">33</xref></sup> Apparently he would drive unprepared students to tears.</p>
<p>In 1851, Green was elected to the chair of Biblical and Oriental Literature and charged to train his students to wield the tools of warfare contained in the Bible, common sense and Reformed confessional theology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0040573612453159">34</xref></sup> For almost half a century, Green carried out his mandate to be a warrior, teacher, and scholar. His defensiveness and commitment to the traditions of the past were such that he changed few of his opinions on fundamental issues. A student’s lecture notes on Green’s lectures on Ecclesiastes suggest that Green was sometimes pulled by reason to change his position: “Dr. Green does not see how to answer objections from style against this being by Solomon.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0040573612453159">35</xref></sup> Even when the weight of the evidence went against a traditional consensus, Green held on tenaciously to tradition.</p>
<p>Like his mentor, Alexander, Green was a very sensitive reader of texts and used literary insights to read texts holistically or synchronically. The most striking example of Green’s literary approach is found in his highly polemical publication, <italic>The Unity of the Book of Genesis</italic> (1895). In this work, Green scrutinized the documentary hypothesis as it had been applied to Genesis verse by verse and chapter by chapter with a view to proving that Genesis was “not a compilation from different documents, but rather was a continuous work of a single writer.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0040573612453159">36</xref></sup> Green’s arguments for unity were based on his observations about the present shape and structure of the book. He highlighted elements of intentionality in Genesis, which critical scholars were overlooking. For example, he argued that the series of <italic>toledoth</italic> formulae - traditionally translated, “these are the generations of,” were not “merely incidental or subordinate, but essential” functioning as “the skeleton or framework of the history itself.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0040573612453159">37</xref></sup> Specifically, Green argued that Gen 2:4a functioned as the heading of the section which followed; the expression, “these are the generations of the heaven and the earth … plainly declares the subject of the second section to be not the creation of the world, but the formation of man and the first stage of human history.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0040573612453159">38</xref></sup> Here Green adumbrated the work of scholars like Brevard Childs who more than 80 years later made similar observations about the literary shaping of Genesis. Green went on to make his arguments for the literary unity of the book of Genesis part of his apologetic for the historicity and Mosaic authorship of Genesis. Not surprisingly, those who rejected his views on authorship also rejected his insights into the literary nature of the text and those who were convinced by his apologetic defense focused on his conclusions and not his mode of argument.</p>
<p>In the last two decades of his life, Green stepped up his engagement in battle, taking on such leading proponents of higher criticism as William Robertson Smith, Julius Wellhasuen, Samuel Rolles Driver, and Charles Briggs. Not surprisingly, Green’s position remained primarily defensive. In his opening lecture in the fall of 1881, Green declared,<disp-quote>
<p>the burning question of the age is not, What does the Bible teach? It is one yet more radical and fundamental: What is the Bible? In what sense is it the Word of God? Is it a revelation from Him, and divinely authoritative; or is it to be left to the interpreter to say what in it is from God and worthy of our faith, and what is the fallible human element that may be rejected?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0040573612453159">39</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Green called his audience to engage in the battle, declaring “the battle rages around the citadel. No drones or cowards are wanted now. It is not the incompetent and unfaithful who can serve the Church in such a crisis … the times demand those who shall be prepared to acquit themselves like men.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0040573612453159">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>One of the reasons Green stepped up the battle plan in the 1880s was that he himself sensed that he was losing the battle and that the Old Princeton approach to the Old Testament had outlived its effectiveness. Green watched defection within the ranks of his own when one of his finest students, Canadian James Frederick McCurdy (1847–1935), who had spent 15 years studying and working with Green, adopted a more moderate Reformed theological stance and moved outside the Princeton fold to find the academic freedom he felt he needed to pursue Old Testament studies with integrity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0040573612453159">41</xref></sup> McCurdy resigned from his teaching position at Princeton, studied in Europe and returned to Canada in 1885, where he successfully promoted biblical criticism through his teaching post at the University of Toronto and in his publications. A reviewer of the third volume of McCurdy’s book, <italic>History, Prophecy and the Monuments</italic> (1901), noted that “The significant thing about this volume is that the author, one of Dr. Green’s more distinguished pupils, accepts cordially and unreservedly, ‘the documentary theory’ of the Pentateuch, against which the great Princeton scholar fought so valiantly to the very last.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0040573612453159">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>Other new faculty were appointed to join Green in the battle against modern biblical criticism in the 1880s. Assyriologist John D. Davis (1854–1926), whose initial training was under Green, was a modest and reserved tradent of classic Princeton positions, updating them where possible with new archaeological, historical, and linguistic data. But Davis had neither the personality nor desire to become Green’s successor in the battlefield.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0040573612453159">43</xref></sup> Indeed student notes of his lectures from 1925–26 show that Davis did not keep fighting the old battles in the twentieth century. In his exposition of the flood story, for example, Davis explained to students that while the flood story itself was credible, it had to be understood in its ancient context: “we must understand the language and geography in the sense that that ancients meant to use it.” Thus Davis argued against a universal flood: “the whole world in Moses’ day [was] the size of the U.S. east of Omaha and Kansas City,” and there is “no evidence that Noah went to the Arctic to get reindeer, or went to distant parts to gather food for the animals.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0040573612453159">44</xref></sup> Similarly, Davis stressed the importance of the “religious” as opposed to the “scientific” purpose of Genesis 1, averring that when read in its context, it did not conflict with science. Davis also moved the debate about Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch from the center to the perimeter of the court. At one point in a lecture to students, he declared, “We don’t care who wrote [the Pentateuch], or if Moses wrote every word—[this is] purely a literary question. It might have been called the books of Moses because Moses is the chief actor, [or] hero of the story.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0040573612453159">45</xref></sup> Davis also refused to be drawn into the debate about the significance of sources, stating, “we are often told that the author of [Genesis] Ch[apter] I is not the author of Ch[apter] II. Of that we are not concerned, it doesn’t make any difference. At least one hand put them together, there is nothing in the theory of different writers of Genesis to conflict with our theology of Holy Scriptures.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0040573612453159">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 1893, Green also convinced another of his former students, Gerhardus Vos (1862–1949), who had been teaching at the Reformed Seminary in Grand Rapids, to return to Princeton to help hold back what Green considered to be a major break in the dikes that threatened to flood the whole country.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0040573612453159">47</xref></sup> Like Davis, Vos brought to Princeton a fresh approach; his interests lay in biblical theology, specifically on the centrality of the covenant in Scripture. But Vos did not become the major combatant Green had desired. His thick Dutch accent had a negative effect on his teaching. His copious writings were plagued by a heaviness of style and a predominately negative tone which blunted their effectiveness. He also did not continue to produce creative scholarship; his book, <italic>Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments</italic>, published in 1948, essentially rehearsed the same ideas he had presented in his 1894 inaugural address 54 years earlier.</p>
<p>William Henry Green’s death in 1900 marked the end of an era at Princeton. The approach to the Old Testament that was begun by Archibald Alexander and honed by Charles Hodge and J.A. Alexander was carried forward faithfully by Green. But those who were recruited to assist Green in battle were not able or willing to continue the Old Princeton defense into a new era as the philosophical and theological landscape of America had changed. Green had correctly determined that the battle he had been fighting was lost. What Princeton needed was not revision or improvement of the old, but an entirely new vision of an approach to the study of the Scriptures that could hold together a commitment to their humanness and otherness.</p>
<p>Having reconstituted the bones of the great men of the Princeton Old Testament school in the nineteenth century, we can now ask what lessons they have to teach us as we face the future.</p>
<p>First, I suggest that Princeton’s Seminary’s heritage should be celebrated. Although the quality of instruction varied, an examination of all the extant Old Testament courses and course outlines and lecture notes shows that Old Testament instruction at Princeton Seminary in the nineteenth century was most often of the highest quality. Students at Princeton received one of the finest educations available in Old Testament in America. With the exception of Archibald Alexander and Green, all the Old Testament professors at Princeton from 1812–1900 did graduate studies in continental Europe. Through their teaching and writing, they promulgated in a remarkably objective fashion the most recent trends in European scholarship together with a conservative response to them. Academic excellence was expected of both the Old Testament faculty and students. The Old Princetonians set the bar high in terms of academic excellence. Those who are responsible for planning and teaching in the future should plan to continue this tradition of excellence.</p>
<p>The Old Princetonians confronted the cutting-edge issues of their day with courage, commitment, and faith. They were not afraid to meet their enemies head to head. They committed themselves tirelessly to their vocations as Christian teachers and scholars and diligently trained clergy and scholars to serve the Church and academy. Their stories remind us of the importance of training and hiring world-class scholars committed to excellence in scholarship and generous orthodoxy who are able to prepare the future leaders of the church and academy to serve the needs of the church and the world. The Old Princetonians also remind us of the importance of engaging the “battles” current in the academy, the church, and the contemporary culture both in the classroom and in print.</p>
<p>The story of the study of the Old Testament at Princeton in the nineteenth century suggests that inbreeding in a faculty or school can lead to problems. Princeton’s Old Testament professors were bound together ideologically and familially. Archibald Alexander was like a father to Charles Hodge and was the biological father of Joseph Addison Alexander. William Henry Green was mentored by Alexander. McCurdy, Vos, and Davis were all sons of Princeton Seminary. Much good came out of the continuity, loyalty, and what might be considered tenacious inflexibility in their approach to the study of the Old Testament and to theological education. In the end though, many of the battles the Old Princetonians chose to fight were lost. The reasons for failure are complex, but the inbreeding of faculty at the seminary was a contributing factor. I think an argument can be made for the importance of diversity on a faculty.</p>
<p>The Old Princetonians remind us of the importance of asking such fundamental questions as What is Scripture? How do we read the Bible as a divine and human book? What presuppositions do we bring to our reading of Scripture? and What is the role of confessions and tradition in the interpretive task? Princeton’s biblical scholars attempted to answer these questions, but real tensions are apparent in their writings and personal lives as they struggled to give a place to faith and criticism, the divine and human aspects of the text. The philosophical framework the Old Princetonians inherited both allowed and restricted their research. Often their most creative scholarship and exegesis were stifled or lost. This is seen especially in the writings of J. A. Alexander and Green. We are faced with the same challenges of balancing faith and criticism and the divine and human aspects of Scripture. Although we may not think that their solutions are entirely satisfactory, the Old Princetonians present a challenging model of forefathers who did not shy away from the problems presented by the critical approach to Old Testament studies. They remind us that a recognition of the otherness of religion need not be antithetical to grappling with scholarship.</p>
<p>As we read about the various ways the Old Princetonians taught subjects related to the Old Testament, we can reflect on the important question, What makes a great teacher? Does a great teacher demand so much that he makes students cry? Does a good teacher take time to teach extra classes to exceptional students? Does a good teacher get so inspired by her own engagement with Scripture that she passes on that enthusiasm to students? How much does personality impact teaching? Is a good teacher honest before students about her own intellectual and faith struggles? The personal quirks of the brilliant J.A. Alexander negatively impacted his teaching. He really didn’t like many of his students and he even ran from the classroom to his office to avoid making personal contact with students. The Old Princetonians remind us of the importance of training and hiring faithful, articulate, and well-rounded scholars and teachers who can continue Princeton’s long tradition of “the highest grade of biblical and theological learning.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0040573612453159">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally, we are able to reconstitute the bones of the Old Princeton School simply because the Old Princetonians left such full records of their professional lives. Their extant lectures, sermons, study notes, student lecture notes and even marginal notes left in books are invaluable. They remind us of the importance of keeping records of what is being taught for future generations.</p>
