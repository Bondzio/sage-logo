<abstract>
<p>This paper reports part of a larger qualitative study and focuses on exploring the educator role in shaping clinical academic careers for nurses and allied health professionals. Using a purposive sampling technique, 30 key participants from four universities were recruited with 7 or 8 from each institution. Individual interviews were undertaken between October 2005 and January 2007 and data were managed, analysed and coded thematically using the data analysis software NVivo. The findings illustrate participants’ commitment to sustain a positive research culture within their departments. They identify the need for a more systematic approach to target able students and introduce creative ideas to engage their interest in research and raise its profile as a viable career option. Whilst participants offer exemplars of flexible employment models to support those in clinical research, the study confirms the need for robust funding and effective marketing of new research roles to permit security for professionals’ long-term career prospects and mainstream such roles in the future. In conclusion, educationalists see themselves as having a key role working with practice colleagues to prepare and support the new clinical academic workforce to help them achieve their successful engagement.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1744987111399394" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The introduction of the new clinical academic career pathway and associated resources for nurses, midwives and allied health professionals (AHPs) in the United Kingdom (UK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1744987111399394">UKCRC, 2008</xref>) indicates significant progress in the research, education and practice of these professions, as well as signalling its importance globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744987111399394">Kim, 2009</xref>). Funding commenced in September 2009 to establish an education infrastructure ultimately at four discreet levels to support and sustain research careers based in clinical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1744987111399394">NIHR, 2010</xref>). However, with a history of underfunding in research for these professional groups, there is a need to explore how practitioners might be encouraged to adopt and be supported in such a career, within a climate of economic uncertainty. This paper reports a qualitative study exploring the role that educationalists may play in shaping and supporting research careers for nurses and AHPs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1744987111399394"><title>Background</title>
<p>In comparison to decades of investment and development in medical research, there has been relatively little investment in research activity for nurses and AHPs in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1744987111399394">Rafferty et al., 2003</xref>). From a fairly recent move of nursing and AHP education into the higher education system nationally, traditionally there have been few opportunities to prepare these professionals for a career in research. With different contractual conditions for those in practice and education, the potential to follow a flexible career pathway to accommodate experience in each of these fields has been prohibitive, without severe financial penalty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1744987111399394">UKCRC, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Whilst <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744987111399394">Kim (2009)</xref> confirms the challenges in the USA to developing clinical nursing research, over time, clinical research nurses (CRNs) in the UK have made a significant contribution to this agenda. In spite of the increase in their volume of activity in recent years, a number of papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987111399394">Deave, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1744987111399394">Jackson and Butterworth, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1744987111399394">Woodward et al., 2007</xref>) report difficulties gaining access to data on the nature of CRN research activity, their employment contracts, their qualifications and their level of seniority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1744987111399394">UKCRC, 2007</xref>: 19). Indeed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744987111399394">Gelling (2008)</xref> recognises that nationally, the work of CRNs has varied considerably with very different levels of support for their career development. In an attempt to offer practical support for the role at different points in their career progression, a competency framework was published to guide their development and be used alongside a structured education programme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744987111399394">Gelling, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>With a number of studies identifying the challenges and strategies to developing research capacity for nurses and AHPs, particularly in the clinical setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744987111399394">Ilott and Bury, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1744987111399394">Segrott et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1744987111399394">Woodward et al., 2007</xref>) the National Institute for Health Research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1744987111399394">NIHR, 2010</xref>) training pathway for clinical academic career development confirms the need to support these professionals at four levels of preparation. Now in the second round of annual awards, up to 70 places have already been supported at master’s level, fifteen at PhD and 10 at post-doctoral clinical lectureship levels, with senior clinical lectureship awards launched in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1744987111399394">NIHR, 2010</xref>). To ensure sustainability and leadership development for these professionals to combine a career in research whilst at the same time continue their clinical practice, a well-developed mentorship scheme is essential. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744987111399394">Kim (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987111399394">Butterworth (2009)</xref> confirm that educationalists have a key role to play in this process.</p>
<p>Acknowledging the parallels in the USA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744987111399394">Kim (2009)</xref> identifies that traditionally, nurses in the UK who sought a research career commonly left their clinical practice to pursue their interests through a second career in education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1744987111399394">Watson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1744987111399394">UKCRC, 2007</xref>). Indeed, capacity building in research for the education workforce in the UK has seen significant funding over the past decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1744987111399394">HEFCE, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744987111399394">Green et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1744987111399394">Segrott et al., 2006</xref>) and, after only seven years, already universities are beginning to seek a minimum of doctoral status to enter education even at basic lecturer grade. In spite of their high teaching loads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1744987111399394">Watson, 2005</xref>), educationalists in healthcare are currently preparing themselves for the 2014 Research Excellence Framework. Through this process, universities can gain research funding for those who achieve well through peer review of their research achievements and increasingly greater recognition is being given to the importance of <italic>applied</italic> healthcare research, which benefits patients and favours multi-authored rather than single-authored papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1744987111399394">Watson, 2006</xref>). Indeed, educationalists in nursing and AHPs are minded to direct their energies towards collaborative work with clinicians and as such would position themselves to better support the new clinical academic.</p>
<p>As the education workforce in nursing and allied health professions develops its infrastructure in research, the research culture for students has been less quick to respond. Nevertheless, it is anticipated that with England following its neighbours across the UK and moving to an all-graduate intake by 2013 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1744987111399394">NMC, 2010</xref>), a more robust research infrastructure will be established, redressing the criticism of the current situation within nursing, where newly qualified nurses can emerge with relatively little knowledge of research by the time they register, due to curricular differences across the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1744987111399394">UKCRC, 2007</xref>: 17). With radical changes in policy reform for the UK National Health Service (NHS), advances in technology and service improvement, there is a recognised increase in the demand for research. However, with the introduction of the new clinical academic, it is anticipated that their success will be in part dependent on the support and encouragement of educationalists.</p>
<sec id="sec3-1744987111399394"><title>Flexible careers</title>
<p>Within the modernisation of the UK NHS, the introduction of new roles and new ways of working, building services around patient pathways, has helped retain experienced clinicians at the bedside and discouraged their move into either education or research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987111399394">DH, 2006</xref>). Whilst some educationalists may be enticed to re-invigorate their clinical skills to pursue a research role in practice, there remain problems related to pay and reward, differences in infrastructure and culture that prohibit movement of employment between universities and the health service that need to be addressed to facilitate any flexibility of careers across practice, education and research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1744987111399394">UKCRC, 2007</xref>: 18). Now, with the introduction of a competency framework for CRNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744987111399394">Gelling, 2008</xref>) and four tiers of educational preparation, initially fully funded, the role of clinical academic careers for nurses and AHPs suggests that educationalists become key to nurture and encourage practitioners into such a career and support them in their development.</p>

<sec id="sec6-1744987111399394" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title>
<p>Using semi-structured interviews, this qualitative study was designed to explore how experienced educationalists perceive their influence in developing and shaping a research workforce in nursing and allied health professions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1744987111399394"><title>Sampling</title>
<p>A purposive sampling technique was used to determine the views of 30 participants employed in some capacity by one of four schools of health in each of four universities in south west England. Maximum variation sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1744987111399394">Patton, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1744987111399394">Polit and Beck, 2008</xref>) was used to gain information-rich data from those who had some responsibility for research either as a manager, teacher, researcher or clinician with an education and researcher role. Some occupied several roles in relation to research and represented a range of views in relation to shaping the future research workforce in healthcare (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1744987111399394">Table 1</xref>). Different professional groups were represented, although the majority were nurses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1744987111399394">Table 2</xref>). Given the different organisation of research activity in each of the four schools, the researcher interviewed each of the four research leads and then invited them to recommend colleagues using a prepared sampling frame. Owing to work commitments, two participants declined to be interviewed and a further two were selected.

<sec id="sec8-1744987111399394"><title>Data collection</title>
<p>Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted by one researcher between October 2005 and January 2007. A framework for each interview was based on Recommendation 3 of the StLaR HR plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1744987111399394">StLaR, 2004</xref>: 10), which refers to a range of ‘off-the-shelf’ employment models to be used as examples to facilitate the development of the future healthcare research workforce. Indicative questions relevant to the focus of this paper (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1744987111399394">Table 3</xref>) were guided by the framework in an informal conversation with each participant and the framework also guided the analysis. Each participant was sent a copy of the framework and indicative main questions, as recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987111399394">Erlandson et al. (1993)</xref>, to allow them to prepare their response and achieve the goal of obtaining rich data. The researcher was influenced by the busy lives of the participants and the geographic spread across the four universities and offered each individual either a face-to-face or telephone interview, with most choosing the latter. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987111399394">Bryman (2001)</xref> acknowledges the economy of time and cost of telephone interviews. The majority of interviews lasted approximately one hour and each interview was tape recorded with participants’ permission and the transcript was returned for their confirmation.

<p>The interview framework was piloted with two individuals with minor amendments and thereafter, a total of 30 participants were interviewed, with eight participants in each of two higher education institutions (HEIs) and seven in the remaining two institutions, until data saturation occurred.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1744987111399394"><title>Ethics</title>
<p>The study was approved by the ethics committee of the host institution and accepted by the other three universities. All participants were sent an introductory letter, interview framework and information sheet, explaining the project and their right to withdraw at any time, without consequence and assuring them of the confidentiality of their responses. Then, the researcher explained the study to each participant by telephone before seeking their consent to participate both verbally and in writing. The project was managed in accordance with the principles identified in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744987111399394">Department of Health (2004)</xref> research governance requirements.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1744987111399394"><title>Data analysis</title>
<p>From the tape recordings, data were transcribed verbatim and analysed and coded with the assistance of the computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS) NVivo (v2) using thematic analysis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744987111399394">Gibbs (2002)</xref> reinforces the benefits of using CAQDAS in processing a large number of lengthy transcriptions in a consistent and well-defined manner, avoiding the difficulty of analysing the data manually.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1744987111399394"><title>Validity and rigour</title>
<p>Face validity of the interview framework was assessed using an expert panel of senior university researchers. Content validity was assessed by piloting the tool with two participants not involved in the main study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1744987111399394">Streiner and Norman, 2006</xref>). Each participant was sent a copy of their interview transcript for validation and confirmation. This process resulted in a few minor amendments to further protect confidentiality. To establish trustworthiness and ensure credibility, a sample of transcripts was content analysed independently by a second experienced researcher, who confirmed the identification of five main themes and groups of sub-themes and cross-referenced them with the analytical framework to ensure their relevance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1744987111399394"><title>Findings</title>
<p>The findings of this paper focus on the views of 30 experienced educationalists in four schools of health across south west England as to how they influence the development and shaping of a research workforce in nursing and associated health professions. When reporting the findings, each participant will be referred to by number. In an attempt to ensure anonymity, numbers were allocated at random and not sequentially by institution.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1744987111399394"><title>Research culture</title>
<p>The majority of participants (<italic>n</italic> = 23) moved into their HEI from the previous monotechnic schools of nursing and allied health professions in the early 1990s. There was a firm belief that creating and developing a culture where research and evidence-based practice is valued by both academics and students was seen as fundamental at all levels. One strategy was to actively recruit new academics who will lead this agenda and actively contribute to changing the existing culture.<disp-quote>
<p>It’s been a deliberate strategy to grow fast very rapidly … And develop(ing) a real research base within the school … so from virtually a nil base really, we moved into a situation where we had a core group of staff who all came with track records in their own research areas, and most of them were nurses (participant #11)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>However, with the high teaching workload from the NHS contract, participants confirmed the need to support teaching activity as priority with research becoming integrated into the curricula at all levels. In spite of the challenges that this presents, most expressed their enthusiasm for the way the department has created:<disp-quote>
<p>a very positive environment … I do think one in which is quite orientated towards research (participant #10)</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1744987111399394"><title>Student engagement in research</title>
<p>Student engagement in research at all levels was seen as important from a variety of perspectives.</p>
<sec id="sec15-1744987111399394"><title>Targeting students</title>
<p>Given the move to a modularised curriculum and large undergraduate student cohorts, targeting students was recognised as problematic. Where it did exist, it was haphazard through module delivery: ‘I will try and plant the seeds …. all very informal and individualised’ (participant #9) with others believing ‘I think we need to be more systematic about that’ (participant #17).</p>
<p>There was a belief by some (<italic>n</italic> = 10) that targeting the more able students who have the potential to grasp the concepts of research ‘will go on to become leaders, the senior managers, the senior researchers and it is about making it clear to them that a research role is available for them as any stage’ (participant #4).</p>
<p>However, one participant (#19), a first-class honours graduate, was targeted at point of registration, rather than in any managed way throughout her pre-qualifying preparation and this failed to have any impact on her at that time. It was recognised that students generally enter the health professions to practice rather than seeing research as a viable career option (participant #13).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-1744987111399394"><title>Research in the curricula</title>
<p>Many participants confirmed the shift in focus of research in their curricula:<disp-quote>
<p>the emphasis in many of our programmes has begun to shift, we don’t really teach research, it is more teaching students to become evidence based practitioners, so it is teaching them to <italic>use</italic> research rather than <italic>do</italic> research (participant #1)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Although several participants believed that hands-on experience of research is the best way of whetting students’ appetites for research, many (<italic>n</italic> = 14) confirmed that since the introduction of the NHS research governance constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744987111399394">DH, 2004</xref>) most health professional groups no longer permit primary data collection at undergraduate level, giving rise to concerns, for example<disp-quote>
<p>… I don’t know where the research skills come from for these people because I don’t know about other degree programmes and maybe I do the one here a disservice, but we don’t develop researchers in any way, shape or form … (participant #13)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Breaking down barriers to research understanding and making the subject accessible and enjoyable were important at all levels, but particularly at the post-qualifying level, where three participants recognised the fear of research expressed by qualified practitioners, requiring themselves as educators to ‘foster a kind of curiosity and a critical understanding and an enquiry based thinking you know and I think that’s what we start with …’ (participant #15)</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-1744987111399394"><title>Practitioner engagement in research</title>
<p>The majority of participants confirmed that their influence on qualified practitioners in research was through their continuing professional development. There was strength of feeling that clinical academics should come from practitioners rather than educationalists:<disp-quote>
<p>I do think it’s from within clinical practice that future researchers will, or should come from, and they should have the opportunity to stay in clinical practice when they’re doing research (participant #6)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>One notable respondent saw educationalists researching in practice as high risk:<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t think everyone can do it. I think some people will be an absolute liability (participant #12)</p></disp-quote></p>
<sec id="sec18-1744987111399394"><title>Practitioner support in the workplace</title>
<p>Nevertheless, there was recognition of the need for sustained support in the workplace for CRNs:<disp-quote>
<p>Well the R + D departments cannot keep up with the amount of support that is required … they will spend time with people in the big trials … so the nurses … who are not involved in any of that … don’t get that sort of support (participant #12)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>One participant in her research consultancy role expressed enthusiasm about supporting applications for PhD funding within the trust. She suggests that this has been a key role ‘there are loads and loads of PhD funding within those charities and they [Charities] like that’ and knowing they have some support within the workplace, practitioners are keen to engage. However, crucial to success is the reciprocation of the relationship: ‘one of my big ahas … with working in this consultancy role, is that we support each other … I am absolutely equal to all my clinical colleagues’ (participant #12). From this developing relationship will come the collaborative opportunities and support for leadership roles in clinical research projects.</p>
<p>At a more fundamental level, one participant who had recently moved wholly into university from a joint appointment with practice presented an inspiring relationship with practitioners across a wide geographical area in the development of critical appraisal skills. Although the focus was not on actively engaging in empirical research, he/she had begun to break down some of the barriers associated with research, and this inspired and motivated practitioners:<disp-quote>
<p>I see it as being an emancipator and empowering and therefore a transformational process …… and the feedback that I’ve had, they are feeling empowered at the end of the session (participant #26)</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec19-1744987111399394"><title>Creativity in engaging practitioners in research</title>
<p>There was general acknowledgement of the need to engage practitioners as post-qualifying students more creatively in research:<disp-quote>
<p>getting them to critically look at data or appraise it, or using secondary data sources for analysis and I don’t know, but we are probably not quite creative enough about working out how we do that yet (participant #25)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>A number of participants talked of a clash of the two cultures of academia and practice and the need for the two worlds to come closer together. One way of bringing them together would be to link excellent students/practitioners at both pre-and post-qualifying levels, with research groups in the school:<disp-quote>
<p>we’ve made a point of … trying to target much more excellent students on our Bachelor of Nursing programme, where we have specifically raised the opportunity for them to either connect with or engage with a particular research group … (participant #10)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Other ideas included the possibility of practitioners on their post-qualifying programmes seeking publication through their innovative assessments, to present poster work to colleagues in the NHS trusts and to work collaboratively around research as a formative part of their taught research module. Recognition was also given to the need for novice practitioners to learn from role modelling so that they can see from other ‘… nurses who’ve chosen to have a career which also embraces research’ (participant #10).</p>
<p>At the doctoral level of activity, some participants expressed their difficulty encouraging senior practitioners to undertake further study due to financial constraints, with individuals being required to contribute both financially and with their own time. Without there being a recognised pathway for them to move across to, it is difficult for practitioners who need to combine the pressures of work with study:<disp-quote>
<p>particularly we are talking about a female workforce, they have families, children … (participant #24),</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>or leave their employment to take up a studentship:<disp-quote>
<p>the biggest problem there is that in our discipline, the people who are most able to do clinical research are the clinicians with most experience and there is no way they can drop to a £12,000 a year salary for 3 years stipend … (participant #27)</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec20-1744987111399394"><title>Flexible employment models</title>
<p>Each of the four HEIs offered a range of flexible and innovative employment models in support of those in clinical research roles and these were illustrated among the participants themselves.</p>
<p>One senior educationalist has a role linked directly with research in practice: ‘Essentially my role is predominantly to work with clinicians and to build up clinical research’ … by working with individuals in practice through funded projects: ‘so in a way, all I am doing is providing a bit of an incubator for them to be able to grow’ (participant #27)</p>
<p>Another participant, a practitioner with education responsibilities illustrated his/her commitment through leading research surgeries in practice and working together in bidding for research grants:<disp-quote>
<p>I think that’s the way to go really small responsive funding grants (participant #6)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>A further participant, an educationalist seconded part time as a research consultant sees herself as ‘teacher, advocate, guide, monitor and promoter … and it is nursing and midwifery, although I have had physios, OTs, radiographers and doctors asking me for support’ (participant #12).</p>
<p>She acknowledged the ‘massive’ potential as educationalists, to collaborate successfully between HEIs and practice (participant #12).</p>
<p>However, to foster a climate where research is valued and supported by the organisation, some participants recognised the need for commitment at a strategic level:<disp-quote>
<p>so I would like to see some joint appointments at executive level …. joint working has to be beneficial to patients (participant #3)</p></disp-quote></p>
<sec id="sec21-1744987111399394"><title>Barriers to flexible employment models</title>
<p>Support for joint flexible working was recognised at a number of different levels. Collectively they believed that support in securing the protection of employment benefits was necessary, avoiding significant salary and pension losses:<disp-quote>
<p>we’re not going to get nurses going into research in a serious way unless there is a well-established career pathway for them …. because it is just too risky for them (participant #28)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>They believed in the need for organisational support for their management of two discreet roles and recognising the different cultural expectations of research activity. While there was a belief that practitioners were interested in research secondments, ‘we’ve had less success in persuading their employers to release them for research’ (participant #14).</p>
<p>There was a concern expressed about the sustainability of involving clinicians in research:<disp-quote>
<p>so basically, one of the barriers is short-termism, funding things around a particular project whether clinical or research project and not seeing the strategic opportunities that there are where their mutual goals of both the NHS and the University can be met by appointing people at senior clinical professor positions (participant #10)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>There was a belief by some that AHPs seemed not to be as far advanced as nurses and midwives in terms of the development of clinical academic careers, that AHPs seemed to be ‘a step back from it’ (participant #6).</p>

<sec id="sec22-1744987111399394" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The study aimed to explore the educator role in supporting research capacity and capability in their students and their practitioner colleagues. In addition, it explored staff perceptions of flexible employment models in research. The study’s strengths lie in the information-rich data obtained from experienced educationalists, although it is limited by the lengthy time span of data collection due to the difficulty gaining interview time with these busy academics. Since commencement of the study, a number of policy decisions were made, particularly in relation to the funding to support the new clinical academic training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1744987111399394">NIHR, 2010</xref>) and competency framework for CRNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744987111399394">Gelling, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec23-1744987111399394"><title>Research culture</title>
<p>The findings illustrate the rapid move to develop a research culture in each of the four schools under study, the development of an infrastructure to support research activity, the creation of a positive research environment and to ensure its presence at all levels of the student curricula. Although each of the four institutions approached these in different ways, they saw the need to embrace a strong research culture as identified the Research Excellent Framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744987111399394">HEFCE, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec24-1744987111399394"><title>Student engagement in research</title>
<p>Contrary to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1744987111399394">UKCRC (2007)</xref> findings, educationalists in this study recognised the importance of harnessing students into a research career and acknowledged their own responsibility to target those high achievers with a particular inclination towards research. However, as this study suggests, there is a need to nurture an interest in research early on in their preparation, rather than wait until the point of registration to ensure success and to do this in a more systematic and co-ordinated way.</p>
<p>Clearly the lack of hands-on engagement with research at the undergraduate level was of concern to participants in this study. This adds credence to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1744987111399394">UKCRC (2007)</xref> suggestion that there is a wide diversity of research experience among pre-qualifying nursing students nationally, with some having relatively little knowledge of research at the point of registration. Nevertheless, the present study confirms their ideas and practices of engaging nursing and allied health profession students more creatively in research through a variety of strategies. This proposed creativity in teaching research and the move to an all-graduate intake for nurses in 2013 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1744987111399394">NMC, 2010</xref>) should further support a solid foundation for evidence-based practice in nursing, as well as research and development as a key component of AHP jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987111399394">DH, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744987111399394">DH and SfH, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744987111399394">Rattray and Taylor (2007)</xref> offer four potential models to support research capacity and capability among nurses, the need to develop appropriate research skills early on is emerging as a requirement for future research leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744987111399394">McKenna, 2009</xref>). With appropriate support in the workplace, evidence from this study supports the interest by some clinicians to undertake doctoral studies and enthusiasm of educationalists to support them. The need to harness a critical mass of clinical academic nurses with doctoral qualifications to lead the development of its evidence base is further supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744987111399394">McKenna (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744987111399394">Kim (2009)</xref>, who confirm that they should be carefully selected and further developed to become leaders in clinical research. More importantly, once established, the emerging critical mass of clinical academics in practice will provide an environment where students in the future will be captivated by nurses doing research and this will become their stimulus to follow such a career themselves.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec25-1744987111399394"><title>Practitioner engagement in research</title>
<p>Participants in the present study recommend future clinical academics should come from practice, rather than re-orientating educationalists/researchers back into practice. Whilst <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744987111399394">Gelling (2010)</xref> recognises that CRNs have been hampered by professional isolation with little or no training or potential for career progression, the new clinical academic career pathways offer planned and well-resourced education preparation for research nurses based in practice and not only leadership development in research but also hope for greater employment opportunities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744987111399394">Kim (2009)</xref> reinforces the need to remove the barriers to successful career pathways in clinical research, as identified by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1744987111399394">UKCRC (2007)</xref>. She confirms the need for a single pay scale and pension scheme like that offered to medicine, as well as protected time for research whilst in clinical practice to encourage the sustainability of such posts. Once the initial funding has been exhausted, careful thought needs to be given as to how to sustain these roles and remove the barriers expressed in the present study, especially in light of the current financial constraints. These have all been recognised as areas of need by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1744987111399394">Latter et al. (2009)</xref> in their current pilot of clinical academic roles. Given the small numbers nationally supported by NIHR funding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1744987111399394">NIHR, 2010</xref>), they acknowledge the need for sustainable funding for long-term commitment to grow a critical mass. To ensure success in mainstreaming these roles in the future and recognising the required culture shift, they recommend the need for visible organisational support for these roles to ensure full integration into clinical practice and education. In addition, they need security of funding for the role, clear lines of responsibility and accountability for their development and quality monitoring, as well as ongoing mentorship for the individuals. As educationalists continue to develop their research skills and collaborations with practice, they become well placed to act in a mentorship role for the new clinical academic, and this is well reported (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744987111399394">Kim, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987111399394">Butterworth, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec26-1744987111399394"><title>Flexible employment models</title>
<p>A range of flexible employment models to support those in clinical research were illustrated by participants in the present study and rated by them as highly successful. They reinforce others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744987111399394">Kim, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987111399394">Butterworth, 2009</xref>) in advocating the need for greater resources to support a system of mentoring to ensure these professionals are being better prepared ‘to lead in a changed system’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744987111399394">DH and SfH, 2008</xref>: 19). However, the present study confirms that individuals enter the nursing and allied health professions first and foremost to practice. Therefore, the opportunity to remain in practice whilst at the same time pursuing skills in research and education is likely to be a more favourable alternative than to require practitioners to jump wholly out of practice and into either research or education. From their own pilot, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1744987111399394">Latter et al. (2009</xref>: 141) acknowledge the importance of ‘embedded pathways based on consolidated funding and increased numbers of substantive posts’ to mainstream these career pathways to sustain the future of these roles. Whilst funding for the education of the new clinical academic careers is well into the second year of a three-year envelope, there is not yet any security for their career prospects and, in the current financial climate, this may be difficult to achieve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987111399394">DH, 2009</xref>: 36). Nevertheless, the educational infrastructure is becoming established and the present study reinforces the commitment by educationalists to move forward with their support, offering a range of innovative roles as ‘exemplars’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec27-1744987111399394" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>With the present commitment to modernise nursing and allied health profession careers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987111399394">DH, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744987111399394">DH and SfH, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987111399394">DH, 2009</xref>), this study provides valuable insight into educationalists’ views of their own role in shaping research careers for these professionals. Whilst ideally a research-rich clinical environment would appear to offer the best incentive for practitioners to move into a career in research, until this becomes an accepted culture nationally, these highly committed educationalists articulate their own motivation to sustain a positive research culture in their organisations and support them in their endeavours. Recommendations include the need for a more systematic approach to target student interest in research at all levels, to introduce their creative ideas for engaging students in research and achievement of a basic level of research competence at point of registration. By raising the profile of research, students may see a career in clinical research as a viable option early on in their pre-registration programme. In addition, participants offer examples of a range of flexible employment models to support clinical researchers, but recognise that sustained funding is required to mainstream such roles in the future. With a robust infrastructure to support new research roles and greater collaboration, educationalists have a key role to work with practice colleagues to prepare and support the new workforce to achieve their success.</p>
