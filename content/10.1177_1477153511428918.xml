<abstract>
<p>A simulation study of daylight autonomy in perimeter office rooms at high latitudes is presented where the following variables are studied: Glazing-to-wall ratios (GWR), climate, orientation, inner surface reflectance, glazing visual transmittance, Venetian blind management and electric lighting dimming and switching systems. Based on daylight utilisation alone, the results indicate an optimal GWR ranging between 20% and 40%, with a North orientation requiring a larger GWR (40%), a South orientation a smaller GWR (20%) and an East/West orientation an intermediate GWR (30%). The reflectance of inner surfaces has a significant effect on daylight autonomy and the use of low transmittance glazing demands a larger GWR (60%) to achieve the same daylight autonomy as 20% GWR with high transmittance glazing. Also, the results indicate that the choice of electric lighting dimming and switching systems has a more significant impact on electricity use than the GWR, orientation and the other variables examined.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1477153511428918" sec-type="intro"><title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>The exploitation of daylight, commonly referred to as ‘daylighting’ or ‘daylight utilisation’, is recognised as an effective means to reduce the electric lighting requirements of non-domestic buildings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1477153511428918">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1477153511428918"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1477153511428918"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1477153511428918">4</xref></sup> Besides direct savings, which reduce energy consumption for lighting, indirect energy savings can be obtained (under ‘warm’ conditions) because of the reduced heat production and energy consumption by air conditioning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1477153511428918">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, excessive fenestration areas may yield excessive solar gains and highly varying heating and cooling loads.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1477153511428918">6</xref></sup> Large fenestration areas could lead to a net increase in energy consumption if the additional cooling load due to daylight exceeds the energy saved due to reduced electric lighting, or if the net heat gains and losses through the fenestration do not compensate for the lighting energy saved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1477153511428918">7</xref></sup> Poirazis <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1477153511428918">8</xref></sup> have presented extensive energy simulations of a typical, single skin office building and shown that office buildings with fully glazed facades are likely to have a higher energy use for heating and cooling than buildings with conventional facades (e.g. 30% window-to-wall area ratio or WWR). In the ‘best’ case of their study, the additional energy use of the 100% glazed building was 15% higher than that of a 30% glazed building.</p>
<p>In addition, excessive fenestration areas can lead to glare problems. In fact, an all too common scenario in over glazed buildings is where the blinds are down to control glare and the lights are on.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1477153511428918">6</xref></sup> The research of Poirazis <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1477153511428918">8</xref></sup> also indicated that increased window areas do not necessarily lead to a reduction in energy use for properly lighting the building. Glare problems that can be caused by the large amount of daylight entering a highly glazed working space often reduce the quality of visual comfort. Thus, shading devices are used more frequently in highly glazed buildings, often maintaining the same levels of daylight as in a building with a conventional facade.</p>
<p>One key design decision in low energy office buildings is thus the selection of a sufficient, yet not excessive, glazing area that allows a satisfying view out while preventing overheating, glare and a wastage of cooling and heating energy. In an attempt to provide some guidelines to architects and engineers concerning this key design decision, this paper presents the results of a parametric study about glazing area ratios and other design aspects focusing on individual perimeter office rooms located at high latitudes. The variables considered in the parametric study are glazing-to-wall ratios (GWR), climate, orientation, reflectance of inner surfaces, glazing visual transmittance, shading and electric lighting dimming/switching scenario.</p>
<p>Architects in private practice are often under the impression that they need to design building facades with extremely large glazing areas in order to exploit the free daylight provided by the sun and sky. This is especially true for architects practising at high latitudes, where natural light is scarce during the winter. The main objective of this study is simply to demonstrate that good to excellent daylight design can be achieved with ‘reasonable’ GWR (i.e. 20–40%) and that increasing the glazing ratio beyond these limits does not provide more useful daylight. A second objective consists of showing relationships between the selected GWR and other relevant variables such as the specific climate, orientation, inner surface reflectance, glazing visual transmittance and the use of shading devices. Finally, the last objective is to quantify the potential electricity savings for lighting with respect to lighting control strategy, in relation to the previously named variables.</p>
<p>This parametric study is part of the Swedish project ‘Low energy office buildings with low internal heat gains: Simulations and design guidelines’. This paper focuses mainly on daylighting and electric lighting aspects; thermal aspects (heating and cooling loads) will be considered in a future phase of this project and the results will be reported in a separate publication. Moreover, the first part of this project focuses on individual perimeter office rooms; a future article will address landscape office configurations, which are becoming increasingly common in the Nordic countries.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1477153511428918"><title>2.1. Early studies of daylight utilisation</title>
<p>In 1984, Treado <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1477153511428918">9</xref></sup> studied daylighting in relation to windows, skylights and clerestories (without movable shading) for a single floor commercial building in Washington DC with variable orientation and glazing ratios (10%, 25% and 50% of wall area), using the NBSLD-2 dynamic building energy analysis computer program, which included a daylight program (DALITE). They showed that, for any fenestration area, the use of daylighting reduced total building energy use compared to the non-daylighting cases. Although not explicitly stated, their results also indicated that energy use was not linearly dependent on the glazing ratio, but followed a ‘diminishing return’ curve.</p>
<p>Later, Bodart and De Herde<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477153511428918">10</xref></sup> studied global energy savings produced by the use of daylighting in office buildings (of variable facade configurations, glazing transmittance, orientation, internal wall reflectance) for the Belgian climate (50°47′ North) using the computer programs ADELINE and TRNSYS. They showed that daylight utilisation allowed reductions of electric lighting consumption by 50–80%, with related global primary energy savings of up to 40%. The savings obtained depended on the glazing visual transmittance, facade configuration, room width and other factors. However, regarding the glazing visual transmittance, they noted that electricity consumption did not vary linearly with glazing transmittance but rather followed a ‘diminishing return’ curve: A high visible transmittance reduced the lighting energy consumption but beyond a certain value, the benefits decreased. They also found that North-oriented rooms always had a higher consumption than other orientations but that when there was a large amount of available daylighting in the room coming from large windows or high glazing transmittance, the orientation influence was minor or even non-existent. The authors concluded that the energy saving potential was high, even for North-oriented facades.</p>
<p>Around the same time, Reinhart<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1477153511428918">11</xref></sup> studied the influence of various design variables on daylight availability and electric lighting requirements in 1000 open-plan office settings relevant to 186 North American Metropolitan areas, using the RADIANCE-based annual daylight simulation method, DAYSIM. The simulation results revealed that daylighting availability in peripheral offices allowed for electric lighting energy savings between 25% and 60% for ideally commissioned dimmed lighting systems, but that these savings were highly dependent on the underlying blinds control strategy. If the blinds were permanently retracted, a northern facade had the lowest energy savings due to the absence of direct sunlight. On the other hand, as an automated system excludes direct sunlight, it yielded very similar savings for all facade orientations. Also, energy savings were falling with rising latitude and total annual solar radiation with differences appearing in the winter months due to shorter day lengths in the North. However, it was shown that the blinds moderated the difference between sites by excluding direct sunlight from the interior. Thus, in sunnier climates, the blinds were closed more often resulting in ‘equivalent’ daylight utilisation potential as in less sunny sites. In addition, changing from a high (75%) to a low (35%) transmittance glazing reduced energy savings by about 20 percentage points for the peripheral office. Thus, in this study, the relationship between glazing transmittance and energy savings was also non-linear (halving glazing transmittance did not result in a halving of energy use for lighting), although this was not explicitly observed by the author.</p>
<p>Of relevance to this study, Krarti <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1477153511428918">12</xref></sup> presented a simplified analysis method to evaluate the potential of daylighting to save energy associated with electric lighting use for several combinations of building geometry, window opening size and glazing type for four geographical locations in the United States and four building geometries. The daylight aperture (i.e. the product of window visible transmittance and window to perimeter floor area ratio) was found to have a significant impact on energy savings from daylighting. Increasing daylight aperture lead to greater daylighting benefits. However, they showed that a daylighting aperture greater than 0.3 yielded diminishing returns on energy savings, results which are in line with earlier findings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477153511428918">10</xref></sup> They also showed that geographical location had a relatively low impact on daylighting savings potential and that relative energy savings were rather directly proportional to the change in perimeter to total floor area ratios.</p>
<p>More recently, Tzempelikos and Athienitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1477153511428918">6</xref></sup> studied the simultaneous impact of glazing area, shading device properties, shading control and electric lighting control (on/off) on building cooling and lighting demand for a perimeter office located in Montreal, Canada, for the four cardinal orientations. The interactions between cooling and lighting energy use were evaluated as a function of WWR and shading parameters by simulations and calculations. The results showed that for 30% WWR and a South orientation, daylight provided the space with 500 lx on the work plane, 76% of the working time in a year. Increasing the WWR above 30% did not result in a significant increase in useful daylight (9% more for 80% WWR). Thus, the 30% WWR was identified by the authors as the daylighting saturation region for South-facing facades in Montreal. Note that these results are in line with results obtained earlier.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477153511428918">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1477153511428918">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>In Sweden, Bülow-Hübe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1477153511428918">13</xref></sup> investigated the light distribution, daylight factors, daylight availability and lighting electricity use in individual and open-plan offices using computer simulations for Gothenburg and a South orientation. The effect of a few façade alternatives were compared, where the WWR was 30%, 60% and 100%. The results indicated that for the 100% WWR with louvres case, daylight autonomy was 50%, while it decreased to 45% for the case of 60% WWR with louvres. The author thus concluded that an office glazed to 100% does not provide significantly more daylight on the office desk than a 60% glazed office both with and without shading system. The results also indicated that the daylight factor does not increase in direct proportion to the glazed area. One reason is that light transmitted below 0.8 m primarily hits the floor, where around 70% is absorbed. The author concluded that very large windows do not mean that daylight is automatically better or proportionally more abundant. She also noted that it can be difficult to achieve a glare-free environment with large glazing areas without adding interior curtains or blinds.</p>
<p>Very recently, Haase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1477153511428918">14</xref></sup> presented a study about energy efficient control of daylight in a single configuration of an office room oriented South under a Norwegian climate using the backward raytracing method (DAYSIM, TRNSYS). Different shading control strategies and user types were studied. Daylight control strategies provided a reduction in net energy demand for lighting which resulted in the lowest total net energy demand for both exterior and interior shading systems, repeating results obtained earlier.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1477153511428918">9</xref></sup> The user behaviour had a great impact on daylight autonomy. While an active user increased daylight autonomy considerably in the whole depth of the office room, a passive user yielded less daylight autonomy, which was also then restricted to the facade perimeter.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1477153511428918"><title>2.2. Early studies of preferred window size and view</title>
<p>Various researchers have investigated people’s preferences for the size, number, position in the wall and degree of transparency of windows.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1477153511428918">15</xref></sup> It is simply impossible to make a proper review here in a few words. Limiting our review to the Nordic countries, it is interesting to mention a post-occupancy evaluation which was conducted in 20 Danish office buildings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1477153511428918">16</xref></sup> with perimeter offices and workstations positioned at a maximum of 7 m from the windows. In this study, over 70% of the respondents said that they were never bothered by sunlight and were ‘highly satisfied’ or ‘satisfied’ with the daylighting conditions in their offices and 80% were never bothered by glare. Regardless of orientation, the number of office workers who found the windows to be either too small or too large increased with glazing areas of less than 20–25%, or over 30–35% of the building facade.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1477153511428918"><title>2.3. Early studies of depth of daylit zone</title>
<p>Also of relevance to this study, Reinhart<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1477153511428918">17</xref></sup> examined the validity of the ubiquitous daylighting rule-of-thumb that relates window-head-height to the depth of the daylit area adjacent to a facade, using the RADIANCE-based DAYSIM simulation tool. He found that the simulation results generally supported predictions made by the daylight rule-of-thumb for standard design variants and proposed the following formulation:<disp-quote>
<p>“The daylit area in a building corresponds to the area in which target illuminance is routinely met through daylight during occupied hours. In a sidelit space with a standard window and venetian blinds, the depth of the daylit area usually lies between 1 and 2 times the size of the window-head-height. The exact number for a particular space is largely influenced by the glazing type and the target illuminance level in the space. In case a space does not require the use of a shading device, the ratio can increase up to 2.5 times.”</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1477153511428918"><title>2.4. Summary of literature review</title>
<p>In summary, previous work has shown that large electric lighting and total energy use savings are feasible by daylight utilisation in perimeter sidelit office spaces. Regarding window areas in office buildings and daylight utilisation, previous research converges to the same conclusions: Higher daylight aperture (increasing fenestration areas or glazing transmittance) do not necessarily yield better or more daylight: There appears to be a ‘diminishing return’ relationship between daylight aperture and daylight utilisation or electric lighting reductions. Increasing daylight aperture yields benefits in terms of daylight autonomy and electricity savings. However, beyond a certain limit, these benefits decrease. Also, a user preference evaluation carried in Denmark indicated that although sunlight is desirable in the office environment, satisfaction decreases with either too small or too large windows. Finally, it is also important to bear in mind that the daylit zone in a sidelit space is limited to roughly one to two times the size of the window-head-height; so, for deeper plan offices, it is important to find other complementary solutions (light tubes and the like) rather than increasing the glazing area below desk height, which is often the intuitive approach used by architects unaware of daylight geometry in space.</p>
<p>Previous work has, however, been mainly limited to regions located ‘below’ 50°N in latitude and the only studies carried in the Nordic countries were limited to one city and one orientation (South). This study extends previous research since annual daylight simulations have been used in a systematic way to investigate the impact of design variables which are specific to individual peripheral office rooms, ranging from circumstantial boundary conditions like the geographical site and orientation, to general building parameters like GWR and glazing transmittance, use of shading devices, inner wall reflectances, etc. The goal of this paper is to provide more comprehensive guidelines to designers of low-energy office buildings located at high latitudes.</p>

<sec id="sec7-1477153511428918"><title>3. Method</title>
<p>This parametric study was achieved using computer simulations following the plan presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1477153511428918">Table 1</xref>. Preliminary tests indicated that each case took 17 min to calculate on a PC (2.13 GHz, 2.92/4.0 GB RAM, 32-bit operating system). Thus, some cases had to be selectively removed after each run to reduce the calculation time, which otherwise would have summed up to 1958.4 h. One case was immediately eliminated after one run if the results obtained were similar to those obtained with another variable (for example East similar to West, GWR 80% similar to 60%, etc.). Sometimes, the variable was eliminated simply because it was judged unrealistic (e.g. 10% GWR). The total calculation time was in this way reduced to 38.0 h using batch programming.

<p>The study was entirely performed using the validated dynamic daylight simulation (DDS) program DAYSIM 3.1b,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1477153511428918">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1477153511428918">19</xref></sup> which is based on the backward-raytracer RADIANCE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1477153511428918">20</xref></sup> DAYSIM uses the daylight coefficient method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1477153511428918">21</xref></sup> to efficiently calculate illuminance distributions under all sky conditions in a year and the Perez sky model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1477153511428918">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>The simulation parameters for the DAYSIM calculations are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1477153511428918">Table 2</xref>. These parameters refer to optimal settings in the backward raytracing algorithms used by RADIANCE. For example, one of the most significant parameters in the raytracing calculation is ambient bounces (ab). A setting of ‘–ab 7’ means 7 ambient bounces for each ray sent towards the light source, see Larson and Shakespeare.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1477153511428918">20</xref></sup> The rendering settings must be adjusted as a function of scene geometry and complexity. Higher level of scene complexity requires larger numbers of ambient bounces (and longer calculation times), for instance. The settings of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1477153511428918">Table 2</xref> are normally acceptable for a simple space as the one modelled in this study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1477153511428918">19</xref></sup> Also, note that the –dds calculation algorithm was used, which is a standard daylight coefficient model for ‘DDSs’. The DDS standard outperforms the original validated DAYSIM approach, notably in cases where sensors are subjected to sudden changes in solar exposure, e.g. for sensors located far from the window. Generally, it allows more accurate predictions of illuminance, especially in the direct calculation and for high illuminance levels from direct sunlight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1477153511428918">23</xref></sup>

<sec id="sec9-1477153511428918"><title>3.2. Description of the office model</title>
<p>An individual office room was modelled using Google SketchUp and exported to DAYSIM. This office room was 2.4 m wide by 4.2 m deep with a floor-to-ceiling height of 2.7 m, which are standard dimensions for individual office rooms in Sweden.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1477153511428918">24</xref></sup> The room was furnished with a 0.8 m deep and 0.75 m high corner desk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1477153511428918">Figure 1</xref>).

</fig></p>
<p>The reflectance of inner surfaces in the base case were 80% (ceiling), 70% (walls) and 40% (floor and desk), which are within the recommended range (see EN 12464-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1477153511428918">25</xref></sup>). The selected reflectance values were relatively high to follow general Scandinavian design trends which favour light colours in indoor environments. All surfaces were modelled as perfectly grey and diffuse.</p>
<p>The office room had a single window located on the 2.4 m wide facade. The room alternately faced the South, East, North and West directions. The GWR was varied so as to correspond to approximately 10–20–30–40–60–80% of the facade area facing indoors. A 0.1 m wide and 0.1 m deep frame was built around the glazing area and centred with respect to the 0.25 m thick outer wall.

<p>A horizontal grid consisting of 12 points at desk height (0.8 m) was defined in the model for the calculation of illuminance values, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1477153511428918">Figure 1(b)</xref>.</p>
<p>The following metrics were analysed for each case:
<list id="list1-1477153511428918" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>continuous daylight autonomy, DA<sub>con</sub> (%);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>daylight autonomy max, DA<sub>max</sub> (%); and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>electricity use for various lighting control strategies (kWh/m<sup>2</sup>·yr).</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>For daylight autonomy calculations, benchmark illuminance values of 500 lx and 300 lx were used. The calculations were performed assuming that the office was occupied Monday through Friday from 8:00 to 17:00 h with an occupant leaving the office three times during the day (30 min in the morning, 1 h at midday and 30 min in the afternoon). Daylight saving time was assumed from 1st April to 31st October.</p>
<p>The following sections provide brief descriptions of the daylight metrics considered in this study.</p>
<sec id="sec13-1477153511428918"><title>3.5.1. Continuous daylight autonomy, DA<sub>con</sub> (%)</title>
<p>Daylight autonomy at a sensor is generally defined as the percentage of the occupied time of the year when the minimum illuminance requirement at the sensor is met by daylight alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1477153511428918">18</xref></sup> The main advantage of daylight autonomy over the daylight factor is that it takes facade orientation and user occupancy profiles into account and considers all possible sky conditions throughout the year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1477153511428918">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The new metric used in this study called ‘continuous daylight autonomy’ (DA<sub>con</sub>) attributes partial credit to time steps when daylight illuminance lies below the minimum illuminance level.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1477153511428918">29</xref></sup> For example, in the case where 500 lx is required and 400 lx is provided by daylight at a given time step, a partial credit of 400 lx/500 lx= 0.8 is attributed for that time step. Thus, the metric acknowledges that even a partial contribution of daylight to illuminate a space is still beneficial.</p>
<p>Rogers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1477153511428918">29</xref></sup> proposed that DA<sub>con</sub> levels of 80–100% represent some excellent daylight designs, while good daylighting designs fall in the 60–80% DA<sub>con</sub> range and adequate ones in the 40–60% DA<sub>con</sub> range.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1477153511428918"><title>3.5.2. Daylight autonomy max, DA<sub>max</sub> (%)</title>
<p>Rogers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1477153511428918">29</xref></sup> also proposed an indicator called daylight autonomy maximum (DA<sub>max</sub>). DA<sub>max</sub> compiles the percentage of times during a year when the illuminance at a sensor is at least 10 times the recommended illuminance. In such a situation, there is a high chance that this will correspond to a situation with a direct sunlight patch at the sensor and hence glare. A remaining weakness of the DA<sub>max</sub> concept is, however, that it is based on intuition rather than documented research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1477153511428918">30</xref></sup> Nevertheless, Rogers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1477153511428918">29</xref></sup> proposed an acceptable limit of DA<sub>max</sub> of 5%, i.e. DA<sub>max</sub> values above 5% are not acceptable.</p>

<p>The first simulations were performed for a South-oriented office with variable GWR (10–80%) located in Stockholm. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1477153511428918">Figure 2</xref> shows that the continuous daylight autonomy (DA<sub>con</sub>) varies from 62% to 82% at 1.575 m from the window, which is the preferred sitting position. At 30% GWR, DA<sub>con</sub> is around 78%, which is the lower bound for ‘excellent’ daylight design according to Rogers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1477153511428918">29</xref></sup> This is a good performance considering the fact that the base illuminance was 500 lx (300 lx would be sufficient according to Swedish lighting norms). An increase of GWR to 40% allows reaching 80% in DA<sub>con</sub> at this sensor and an increase of GWR to 60% provides 83% in DA<sub>con</sub>. Thus, a GWR larger than 30% provides marginal additional benefits, which is in line with the previously reported research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477153511428918">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1477153511428918"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1477153511428918"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1477153511428918">13</xref></sup> Also, note that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1477153511428918">Figure 2</xref> shows that DA<sub>max</sub> below 5% is reached for 20% GWR or less at 1.575 m from the window.

<p>The next simulations were performed for a South-oriented office with variable GWR (10–80%) using the climate files of Malmö, Gothenburg, Stockholm, Östersund, Quebec and Montreal. The climates files of Quebec and Montreal were only used as a reference. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1477153511428918">Figure 3</xref> shows that DA<sub>con</sub> values sharply rise for GWR varying between 0% and 30% but more or less ‘stabilise’ for larger GWR, for all climates studied. The results obtained for Montreal repeat results obtained earlier.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1477153511428918">6</xref></sup> DA<sub>con</sub> values are higher (around 88–92% for GWR &gt; 30%) in Montreal and Quebec than in the Swedish cities (around 72–81% for GWR &gt; 30%), which is due to the different latitudes and climates. DA<sub>max</sub> values (bottom) show that the requirement of 5%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1477153511428918">29</xref></sup> is met only for a 20% GWR, indicating the need for solar shading devices for all GWR larger than 20%. At 30% GWR, DA<sub>max</sub> values are around 8–10% and they are 10–15% for 40% GWR. In general, DA<sub>max</sub> values increase with increasing GWR, reaching a maximum of around 19–25% for GWR 60–80%. There are negligible differences between the 60% and 80% GWR cases because the extra glazing in the 80% GWR case is located below the sensors.

</p>
<p>East and West orientations return results which are ‘between’ South and North in terms of DA<sub>con</sub>. In general, the orientation has a larger impact on DA<sub>con</sub> for smaller GWR and less impact as the GWR increases, in the three cities, repeating results observed earlier.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477153511428918">10</xref></sup> All curves show a steep rise from 10% to 30% GWR but the DA<sub>con</sub> more or less ‘stabilises’ after 40% GWR, especially for the South, East and West orientations. In the three cities, there are negligible differences in DA<sub>con</sub> with 60% and 80% GWR and differences of less than 5% in DA<sub>con</sub> values between 40% and 60% GWR. The choice of optimum GWR should thus be somewhere between 20% and 40%; all other glazing ratios are clearly uninteresting.</p>
<p>Also, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1477153511428918">Figure 4</xref> shows that there is more benefit of increasing the GWR above 30% (i.e. up to 40%) on the North facade compared to the other facades. Increasing the GWR from 20% to 40% in Montreal on the North facade allows increasing the DA<sub>con</sub> from 69% to 85%. In Östersund, going from 20% to 40% GWR allows increasing DA<sub>con</sub> from 52% to 69%, and in Stockholm, the same increase in GWR allows an increase of DA<sub>con</sub> from 55% to 71%, indicating that larger GWR (40%) may be justified for North-oriented office rooms, but this must be weighed against the extra costs for heating due to the larger GWR.</p>
<p>The bottom part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1477153511428918">Figure 4</xref> shows that DA<sub>max</sub> values increase almost linearly with increasing GWR, except for GWR 60–80%. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1477153511428918">Figure 4</xref> shows that the steepest rise in DA<sub>max</sub> curve is for the South orientation, as expected. For this orientation, the requirement to keep DA<sub>max</sub> values below 5% is reached only for GWR smaller than 20% in the three cities. For the East and West orientations, DA<sub>max</sub> is under 5% at 30% GWR and below, and for the North orientation, DA<sub>max</sub> is under 5% for all GWR studied in the three cities. These observations show that the South orientation is the one more at risk of direct sunlight glare and overheating problems and should have visual and solar protection devices for all GWR larger than 20%. The East and West orientations should also have glare protection devices for all GWR larger than 30% and for the North orientation, it is possible to have a nearly all glazed facade without significant direct sunlight glare.</p>

<sec id="sec19-1477153511428918"><title>4.4. Effect of inner surface reflectance</title>
<p>In a fourth series of simulations, the GWR was varied from 20% to 60% along with the reflectance of inner surfaces and orientation (S, N), using only the climate file of Stockholm. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1477153511428918">Figure 5</xref> shows that an increase in inner surface reflectance has a significant effect on DA<sub>con</sub>, especially for the North orientation and for smaller GWR (e.g. 20%). It is interesting to observe that the difference in DA<sub>con</sub> values caused by ‘low’ (70–60–30%) versus ‘high’ reflectance (90–80–50%) are almost as large as the differences between North and South orientations for the same GWR.
<fig id="fig5-1477153511428918" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>DA<sub>con</sub> (%, top) and DA<sub>max</sub> (%, bottom) as a function of GWR (%) in relation to inner surface reflectances, GWR and orientation for a single office in Stockholm</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1477153511428918-fig5.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>On the North orientation, DA<sub>con</sub> is 50% at 20% GWR with reflectances of 70–60–30% (ceiling–walls–floor) and 60% for the same GWR (20%) with reflectances of 90–80–50%. For the South orientation, increasing the reflectance from 80–70–40% to 90–80–50% has a small effect. This may be due to the fact that a larger portion of the DA<sub>con</sub> value is attributable to direct sunlight on this facade and less to the indirect reflected component. For large GWR (60%), the inner surfaces’ reflectance values have a negligible effect on DA<sub>con</sub> for all orientations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec20-1477153511428918"><title>4.5. Effect of glazing visual transmittance</title>
<p>The fifth series of simulations consisted of studying the impact of glazing visual transmittance on DA<sub>con</sub> comparing (1) the original glazing with 72% visual transmittance and (2) a solar-protective glazing with a visual transmittance of 36%. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1477153511428918">Figure 6</xref> shows that DA<sub>con</sub> values are significantly lower with the 36% glazing visual transmittance and also that this low-transmittance glazing generates larger differences between South and North orientations and between the various GWR studied. However, it is interesting to note that although the glazing visual transmittance is only half of the first glazing tested (36% vs. 72%), DA<sub>con</sub> values are not divided by two, as would have been intuitively expected. In fact, DA<sub>con</sub> values are at least 75% or more of the original DA<sub>con</sub> values obtained with the 72% glazing. Similar results have been previously observed as outlined in the literature review.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477153511428918">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1477153511428918">11</xref></sup>
<fig id="fig6-1477153511428918" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>DAcon (%, top) and DAmax (%, bottom) as a function of GWR, in relation to glazing visual transmittance, for a single-cell, South or North-oriented office in Stockholm</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1477153511428918-fig6.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The DA<sub>con</sub> values fall in the range 40–60% with the 36% glazing, which is considered as ‘adequate’ daylight design according to Rogers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1477153511428918">29</xref></sup> The results also indicate that the benefit of increasing the GWR above 40% is marginal for both glazing tested, especially for the South orientation. On the North facade, however, an increase in GWR from 40% to 60% brings an increase in DA<sub>con</sub> from 53% to 65% for the 36% glazing, which is significant.</p>
<p>Regarding DA<sub>max</sub> values, both North orientations return close to zero values for almost all GWR. On the South, the 5% criterion is met only for a GWR of 20% or less for the 72% glazing type, whereas it is met at 30% GWR or less for the 36% glazing type. This shows that solar-protective glazing may allow increasing the glazing area slightly while preserving ‘acceptable’ sunlight glare levels, although not to a much larger extent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec21-1477153511428918"><title>4.6. Effect of shading device</title>
<p>One source of error for overoptimistic energy savings predictions based on daylight utilisation is the treatment of blinds. It is often assumed that blinds are retracted all year round (maximum daylight availability), while the lighting is always activated during the office hours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1477153511428918">11</xref></sup> The next series of simulations thus consisted of testing a more realistic situation, i.e. one with a Venetian blind that the occupant could control. In these simulations, a simpler blind model was used, which is pre-programmed in DAYSIM to let 25% of daylight pass through the window. Two simulation alternatives were studied on two orientations (South, North) in Stockholm:

Note that the blinds are re-opened once a day in the morning upon arrival.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A passive user, i.e. a user who keeps the blinds partly closed throughout the year to avoid direct sunlight. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1477153511428918">Figure 7(a) and (b)</xref> presents DA<sub>con</sub> and DA<sub>max</sub> values obtained for an active and a passive occupant combined with a Venetian blind (simple model). The results can be compared to the ones obtained for the case with no Venetian blind (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1477153511428918">Figure 2</xref>). The results show that the Venetian blinds reduce DA<sub>con</sub> a little, most significantly for the sensors located in the back of the room. But generally, the curves have the same shape with a sharp increase from 10% to 30% GWR and more or less a ‘stabilisation’ afterwards, which makes it hard to justify a large GWR. At the bottom of the same diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1477153511428918">Figure 7(a)</xref>), DA<sub>max</sub> values are presented, showing that the Venetian blind does reduce DA<sub>max</sub> values, especially for large GWR and close to the window.</p></list-item>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1477153511428918">Figure 7(b)</xref> shows that the use of a Venetian blind in the case of a passive occupant greatly reduces DA<sub>con</sub>. The additional benefit of increasing GWR from 30% to 40% or from 40% to 60% is an increase of roughly 10% in DA<sub>con</sub>, which may be worth considering. It is interesting to note that with much larger GWR (e.g. 60%), the DA<sub>con</sub> is still below that of a case with no Venetian blind and much smaller GWR (e.g. 20%), and this is for all sensors in the room. This then again confirms the fact that using larger GWR does not necessarily guarantee larger electricity savings for lights, since a Venetian blind could be left down in the case of a larger GWR and this would greatly reduce daylight autonomy in the room compared to a case with no blinds. At the bottom of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1477153511428918">Figure 7</xref>, DA<sub>max</sub> values are presented; they were all zero, because the blinds were pulled down most of the time.</p>

<sec id="sec22-1477153511428918"><title>4.7. Effect of electric light dimming and/or switching strategy</title>
<p>The last simulations consisted of studying the effect of various switching and dimming strategies for the electric lighting system. This part of the calculation uses the programme Lightswitch,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1477153511428918">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1477153511428918">28</xref></sup> which is a user behaviour control model embedded in DAYSIM. The model predicts when users will lower window blinds in response to glare, or when they will switch on the electric lighting. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1477153511428918">Figure 8</xref> shows that the electric lighting strategy has more impact on energy use than the GWR. In general, the automatic occupancy switch on/off system is the one yielding the highest electricity use (more than a manual switch near the door). In fact, since the calculation with the manual wall switch near the door takes into account about half active users who will actually turn off the lights and work solely with daylight, the occupancy on/off system will turn on the lights more often than necessary in some cases and yield more energy use. The system yielding the lowest electricity use is the photoelectric dimming combined with occupancy switch-off. This system can in fact reduce electricity use by more than 50% compared to a case with manual light switch at the door, and this for all cases studied. This is in line with results reported by Reinhart<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1477153511428918">11</xref></sup> who obtained electric lighting energy savings between 25% and 60% in open plan offices for an ideally commissioned, dimmed lighting system. The results also show that the energy savings on the North facade are almost as high as the ones achieved on the South facade (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1477153511428918">Figure 8(a) and (b)</xref>), indicating that the North facade also has a large potential for daylight utilisation.

<sec id="sec23-1477153511428918"><title>5. Discussion and conclusion</title>
<p>This article presents a parametric study about daylight utilisation in a single, perimeter office room located at high latitude, in this case Sweden and Canada. To the authors’ knowledge, this study presents the first systematic application of DDSs in standard, perimeter office space located at high latitudes, i.e. ‘above’ 50°N and taking into consideration a range of variables such as GWR, orientation, inner wall reflectances, glazing visual transmittance and the use of shading devices. The study generally shows that the optimal GWR for an office in Stockholm, Malmö, Gothenburg or Östersund is between 20% and 40%, considering only daylighting aspects. DA<sub>con</sub> sharply increases with GWR increasing from 0% to 30% but stabilises afterwards typically following a ‘diminishing return’ benefit curve. The benefits of increasing the GWR from 40% to 60% are marginal and they are nonexistent for an increase in GWR from 60% to 80%. For the South orientation, a 20% GWR provides good daylight design without major direct sunlight risk. There are significant benefits of increasing the GWR from 10% to 20%, but the benefits of increasing the GWR from 20% to 40% must be weighed against the additional costs of cooling and heating on this facade. However, for the North orientation, a 40% GWR provides significantly higher additional DA<sub>con</sub> compared to a 30% GWR, without any additional direct sunlight risk. The results also show that the South orientation has the largest potential for DA<sub>con</sub> but also the highest glare risk. North orientation has the lowest DA<sub>con</sub> but no direct sunlight glare risk and East/West orientations have a similar DA<sub>con</sub>, which is almost exactly between that of South and North orientations. One design advice would then be to seek GWR of 20% on the South facade, 30% on East and West facades and 40% on North facades but these numbers must also consider the impact of GWR on heating and cooling loads, thermal comfort and view out. We do not present the results of thermal simulations in this paper since this would require describing the method of the thermal simulations in detail. However, it is worth mentioning here that the results of thermal simulations analysed so far all indicate that the smallest GWR always yields the lowest total energy use on all facades, including South and with the use of a dimming system for lights. So, increasing the GWR (for example from 20% to 40%) will always yield a significant increase in total energy use.</p>
<p>Moreover, this paper shows that the North orientation presents good DA<sub>con</sub> potential and no direct sunlight risk even with large GWR. North is thus an interesting orientation for office rooms where plenty of diffuse daylight and large glazing areas are desired but this must be weighed against the extra heat losses and cold draughts problems which may arise with large glazing areas on the North side. The quality of the window is very important in this case (lowest possible U-value).</p>
<p>Most of the simulations in this paper were performed for a case with no shading device (bare window). Two reasons justify this: The first one is that Nordic countries are generally dominated by overcast skies (more than 75% of the time) and thus, the use of shading devices is somewhat of an exception as long as the window is of ‘reasonable’ dimension. Second, a previous post-occupancy evaluation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1477153511428918">16</xref></sup> done in Denmark indicated that people do actually want to have direct sunlight in their work environment so when the sun shines, which is rare, there is a psychological need to feel this sunshine in the office space. In addition to this, we may argue that when the glazing ratios are ‘reasonable’, it is possible to achieve visual comfort in the office even with a direct sunlight patch in the space, as long as this sunlight patch is not directly on the occupant, on the computer screen or indirectly reflected in the computer screen. This is possible if an appropriate location of the office desk and computer screen is selected with respect to the window and the cardinal orientation. For example, an office with a West-facing window should have a computer screen on the South wall or near the South-West corner, an office with an East-facing window should have a computer screen on the South wall or near the South-East corner, etc.</p>
<p>Generally, the results indicate that, although DA<sub>con</sub> is more limited in the Swedish cities compared to cities at lower latitude (Montreal and Quebec), it is still possible to achieve good to excellent daylight design with ‘reasonable’ GWR of 20–40%, depending on the orientation, glazing visual transmittance and inner surfaces’ reflectance. It is interesting to note that in a Danish post-occupancy evaluation in 20 office buildings,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1477153511428918">16</xref></sup> the number of office workers who found the windows to be either too small or too large increased with glazing areas of less than 20–25%, or over 30–35% of the building facade, regardless of orientation. These ratios are in line with the optimum GWR identified in this paper. Moreover, the results show that there are negligible differences in DA<sub>con</sub> between the three largest Swedish cities (Stockholm, Malmö, Gothenburg). Östersund has a slightly more limited but not significantly lower DA<sub>con</sub> than Stockholm, Malmö and Gothenburg.</p>
<p>The results also show that the effect of inner wall reflectance can be significant and even as important as the effect of orientation. This is especially true for small GWR, where a large portion of daylight is from the internally reflected daylight component. Architects ought to pay as much attention to the selection of inner wall reflectances as the selection of orientation and GWR. Unfortunately, we have to mention that it is not rare, in real projects, that the selection of inner wall colours is decided by an interior decorator, who is involved much later in the design process and has no clue of energy considerations.</p>
<p>Simulations with low-transmittance glazing (<italic>T</italic><sub>vis</sub> = 36%) showed that larger GWR (60%) are needed to obtain the same DA<sub>con</sub> as ‘small’ GWR (20%) with relatively little reduction in direct sunlight risk. Thus, the results prove that it is preferable to have smaller GWR (20%) with high visual transmittance glazing (72%) than large GWR (60%) with low visual transmittance glazing (36%) since there will necessarily be less heat losses in the winter in the former case and DA<sub>con</sub> will be about the same or even higher.</p>
<p>Simulations also showed that DA<sub>con</sub> is slightly reduced with the use of a Venetian blind in the case of an active user who manages the blinds coherently. However, with a passive user who leaves the blinds down all day once they are pulled down, DA<sub>con</sub> is much more limited. This emphasizes the need for an automatic or ‘active’ management of window blinds; otherwise, the potential for daylight utilisation is limited in the Nordic countries.</p>
<p>The study of different electric lighting dimming and switching strategies showed that the choice of electric lighting system generally has more effect on energy use than the GWR. Automatic switch on/off system yields more energy use than an ordinary manual switch near the door with a mix of active and passive users. Perfectly commissioned photoelectric dimming with occupancy switch-off allows reducing electricity use by at least 50% compared to all cases with manual switch near the door. A simple occupancy switch-off yields intermediate savings, i.e. around 25% compared to the case with manual switch near the door. Interestingly, electricity savings are not significantly lower on the North than on the South facade. The initial LPD is an important design decision, especially if there is no possibility for photoelectric dimming. In this case, it is possible to achieve an annual electricity use target under 10 kWh/m<sup>2</sup>·yr with automatic occupancy switch-off and LPD 8 W/m<sup>2</sup> regardless of GWR. For all cases with LPD 10 W/m<sup>2</sup>, photoelectric dimming is required to obtain lighting electricity use below 10 kWh/m<sup>2</sup>·yr, which is a proposed target in future low energy office buildings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1477153511428918">31</xref></sup></p>
