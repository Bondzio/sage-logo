<p>The rural–urban divide has been a key issue among Chinese policymakers and students of China’s development over the last few decades. The bias against the peasantry inherent in the Maoist development approach had bestowed upon the rural population a discriminatory regime, rendering them as second-class citizens. And yet despite the persistent attempts by the post-Mao leadership in redressing the imbalance, the deprivations of Chinese peasants compared with urban dwellers remain evident. Rural–urban migration into big cities appears to be the dominant option for aspiring peasants who strive for better life chances.</p>
<p><italic>Small Town China</italic> by Beatriz Carillo redirects our attention to a related and no less important phenomenon that has long been overlooked: population movement into towns and small cities. According to the author, China’s urbanization is in fact a dual-track process. While most of the attention has been focused on the hundreds of millions of migrant workers flooding into metropolises in coastal China, a parallel process of ‘bottom–up urbanization’ has also taken place in an equally dramatic fashion. Millions of peasants have identified small cities and towns as their destination in their pursuit of higher income and comfort. This movement of the rural population within the boundary of a county has proceeded unbridled with an annual growth rate averaging about 20 per cent during the last two decades of the 20th century. Unlike the expansion of existing cities, which is primarily due to marketization, influx of foreign capital and economic growth in these metropolises, the bottom–up urbanization process is more a result of internal changes in the rural economy. Carillo argues that such an expansion of urban growth at the lower level is mainly attributed to the rural economic growth and rapid rural industrialization in the post-Mao years. The proliferation of township–village enterprises and off-farm employment has transformed towns into magnets that attract aspiring peasants and the consequent population growth and economic development in turn have unleashed the demand for urban or quasi-urban facilities, thus introducing many traits of urban life into the countryside.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the contribution of the book is not confined to an explanation of the rise of small towns or a factual narrative of the population movement. The author also examines the viability of this small town formula as an alternative for achieving greater social cohesion in China. Carillo also uncovers the process and institutions that enable or preclude the social inclusion of rural workers into an urban or quasi-urban setting. Much of the analysis is thus focused on the examination of rural workers’ immersion into the urban labour market and their access to welfare benefits and services such as health, housing and education. As revealed in the study, the proximity between rural and ‘urban’ worlds in this context does lead to a different experience for the rural workers as compared to the urbanization process in big cities where segregation and exclusion appear to be the norm. The short distance from home, for example, has implied less demand for housing in towns as commuting is possible for most workers. And it is also found that social networks or <italic>guanxi</italic> also facilitate access to employment. However, it is the distinctive institutional context of local administration that accounts for the rural workers’ accessibility to services. Administrative and fiscal decentralization implies on the one hand discretion in service delivery, but it also entails the shifting of funding responsibility to the lower levels of government. Sharing of responsibility, insurance schemes and other forms of marketization of social services are the administrative answers to the obligations to provide a safety net. The limited presence of the state sector typical of small towns and the resultant restricted welfare coverage and thus lower expectation of state protection among the local population certainly help legitimize the marketization of social services as well. In other words, accessibility to services in these settings is determined not so much by residential status, but more so by affordability. It is, however, important to note that such parity in access is not a result of the extension of rights of the rural population. Instead, the narrowing of the gap between the two worlds is a result of the gradual deprivation of entitlement on the part of urban citizens as a result of retreat of the Chinese state from its socialist ideal of cradle-to-grave protection. ‘Inclusion’ is thus not a result of the peasant’s enhanced entitlement but rather it is due to an improvement of life experience for those with higher consumption power.</p>
<p>As an extension of her doctoral research, Carrillo has done a great job in expanding our knowledge on the intricacies and dynamic of the urbanization process and the trajectory of social inclusion in China. The single case study approach in this project certainly has limitations and some of the key issues probably warrant further exploration. For instances, despite the author’s elaborate discussion of the relevance and prospects of the <italic>hukou</italic> system towards the end of the book and the repetition of the claim of ‘relaxation’ of the <italic>hukou</italic> system in small towns, how it actually affects the rural workers’ life at the town level in today’s China remains unclear. In addition, the moral or cultural dimension of the inclusion process has not been fully explored. For example, how does this immersion into the urban labour market affect the rural migrant workers’ links with the rural community from which they originate? Does this connection affect their expectations and demands on the local administration in terms of protection, life chance or rights, thus constituting a different experience of inclusion? These are certainly topics for future research. Nevertheless, this well-articulated account should be of great interest to students of rural–urban migration, urbanization, modernization and social policy development.</p>
