<p>I firmly subscribe to this old adage: “Don’t assume anything.”</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>As diabetes educators, we are charged with making patient assessments, devising educational strategies, and instructing people with diabetes how to best care for themselves and their diabetes.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A thorough prescription and nonprescription drug history is an important part of the assessment. We try to determine a person’s drug-taking behaviors and look for “teachable moments.”</p>
<p>Most of us know that just because a patient can rattle off a list of drugs doesn’t mean they are aware of the optimal way to take them or that they are adherent with the regimen. Likewise, a patient may state emphatically that they know how to perform blood glucose monitoring or mix different insulin preparations yet fall short in actual practice.</p>
<p>If I have any concerns regarding the accuracy of the information I obtain during an assessment, I “test the waters.” In effect, I use this opportunity as a teachable moment. I strive to clear up any misconceptions, correct faulty procedures or techniques, and address nonadherent behavior.</p>
<p>Similarly, when providing written patient information, I routinely ask if the print size is adequate and request that the patient read a brief passage. This serves 2 purposes. It provides insight into any literacy issues or vision impairment, and it allows me to tap knowledge retention by asking a few questions at the end of the counseling session.</p>
<p>These techniques may seem intuitive or routine, but general busyness can get in the way of capturing every teachable moment—even for the most seasoned of us. Yet taking medications correctly is essential for patients to reach their target goals.</p>
<p>Remember, you can never assume anything in diabetes education. ■</p>
