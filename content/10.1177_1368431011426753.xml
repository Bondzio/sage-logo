<p>Routinely described as ‘one of the last great Central European polymaths’, Ernest Gellner (1925–1995) remains something of an enigma in the history of English intellectual life as well as in the histories of the many disciplines to which he contributed – philosophy, anthropology, sociology, intellectual history. He held chairs of Philosophy (‘with special reference to Sociology’) at the London School of Economics and of Social Anthropology at the University of Cambridge; towards the end of his life he was instrumental in setting up the Sociology Department at George Soros’s new Central European University in Prague, and in establishing and directing a vibrant Centre for the Study of Nationalism there. He had an intellectual presence that was at once somewhat intimidating and at the same time irresistible, often leading to a kind of hero-worship. Those who knew him well – and they include some of the brightest scholars of the past forty years, such as Perry Anderson, Patricia Crone, Christopher Hann, Steven Lukes, Michael Mann, Alan MacFarlane, Tom Nairn, Brendan O’Leary, Anthony Smith, and John Hall himself – testify to his penetrating intelligence and extraordinary breadth of knowledge. I too, as a graduate student at the LSE in the 1960s, fell under his spell; and though I did not get to know him well at the time, I was lucky enough to encounter him much later when we were both teaching at the Central European University in Prague. Warmed by his return to his childhood home, full of projects in connection with the vast changes then taking place in Central and Eastern Europe, Gellner was a wonderful and hospitable guide to the streets and sociable sites of Prague. Hall describes this last phase of Gellner’s life beautifully, making us all once more poignantly conscious of what we have lost by Gellner’s premature death.</p>
<p>And yet the question of Gellner’s legacy remains a puzzle. With his first book, <italic>Words and Things</italic> (1959), he scored a <italic>succès de scandale</italic>, excoriating the Oxford Wittgensteinians who had taught him as a philosophy undergraduate at Balliol (‘biting the hand that fed him’, as some of his former teachers resentfully saw it). This book, which was required reading among bright English sixth-formers of the day, brought him squarely to the attention of the public. But it is now little read, except by historians of recent British thought. Oxford philosophy itself sailed serenely on, irritated (Gilbert Ryle refused to have the book reviewed in <italic>Mind</italic>) but fundamentally untroubled by Gellner’s attack on what he presented as a sterile philosophy of gentility and triviality. <italic>Thought and Change</italic> (1964), his second book and one that Hall rightly sees as containing all the basic ideas of Gellner’s social philosophy and theory of modernity, made little impact when it first appeared and it too is rarely referred to these days. It was only with the appearance of Gellner’s much later work, <italic>Nations and Nationalism</italic> (1983), that the key chapter on nationalism in <italic>Thought and Change</italic> was recovered, though mainly for purposes of comparison with the later treatment. The recovery did not extend to a re-discovery or reconsideration of the book as a whole.</p>
<p>
<italic>Plough, Sword, and Book</italic> (1988) was an enormously ambitious book, its subtitle stating it to be no less than ‘The Structure of Human History’. Gellner had high hopes for it, and it was respectfully received, but was far from making it onto the list of everyone’s ‘must-read’. Hall himself says that it is ‘in the final analysis less than successful’, the result of overhasty writing and an attempt to cram too much into a relatively short space (a common feature of Gellner’s writing). Too many of its ideas can be found in Gellner’s other writings, and the presentation is not forceful or attractive enough to make this the commanding synthesis of his views that Gellner hoped it would be. Here too we have a work that seems to have fallen on stony ground.</p>
<p>Gellner’s writings on Islam, notably <italic>Saints of the Atlas</italic> (1969) and <italic>Muslim Society</italic> (1981), continue to be debated by some scholars of Islam, especially his frequently re-iterated view that Islam, in its high-culture, scripturalist version, was perfectly compatible with modernity, supplying a kind of equivalent of the ‘Protestant ethic’. Given the current widespread interest in Islam, it is possible that this may be one area where Gellner’s works will continue to be read and discussed. But beyond that, it probably has to be said that the only work of Gellner’s to have achieved lasting popularity is his <italic>Nations and Nationalism</italic>. Even here, at least if my students are any guide, there is a distinct tendency to find Benedict Anderson’s <italic>Imagined Communities</italic>, rather than Gellner’s book, the most stimulating introduction to what has become a burgeoning field of teaching and research. Gellner’s thoroughgoing functionalism, in his theory of nationalism, offends against the ‘cultural turn’ in the social sciences. But there is no doubt that any theoretical engagement with nationalism still has to deal with Gellner’s powerfully expressed position, one of the few to give a genuinely sociological explanation of the rise of nationalism (and why it was such a comparatively recent phenomenon).</p>
<p>But still one work, however arresting, seems rather a slender basis on which to build a legacy. Is nationalism really the only subject with which Gellner’s name will be associated in the coming years? It is noticeable that one of the early reviews of Hall’s book chose to deal almost exclusively with Gellner’s theory of nationalism, as if that were the only part of his work of continuing interest. The reviewer, Timothy Synder, justified this on the basis of the story, recounted by Hall, that Gellner presented a copy of <italic>Nations and Nationalism </italic>to his friend Anatoly Khazanov with the remark that the book contained his life. ‘The theory of nationalism itself’, says Synder, was ‘Gellner’s life’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1368431011426753">1</xref>
</sup> One sees the point: the theory of nationalism contains a view of modernity, and of the role of culture and cognition within it, that were indeed matters that preoccupied Gellner throughout his life. But it still seems incredibly narrowing to say that nationalism was the whole of Gellner’s life, on both the personal and the intellectual planes. For one thing, as Hall shows, Gellner was very ambivalent about nationalism, and uncertain about its future. Necessary as one of the initial conditions of a successful industrial society, nationalism might in the future become something of an obstacle to further development. Gellner hoped that prosperity might take the edge off nationalism’s frequently fierce and violent character. Back in Prague in his last years, Gellner found himself increasingly disenchanted with the narrowness and provinciality of Czech life, lacking now the Jews, Germans, and – with the ‘velvet divorce’ from Slovakia – the Slovaks who had added cosmopolitan spice to the Czech culture of his youth. His last work, posthumously published as <italic>Language and Solitude: Wittgenstein, Malinowski and the Habsburg Dilemma</italic> (1998), praised Malinowski as someone who had managed to square respect for national culture with an appreciation of the strengths of a multinational entity such as the Habsburg Empire. Hall sees Gellner’s later position as inclining towards what he calls an ‘ironic cultural nationalism’: acknowledging the need for an inclusive culture while rejecting the out- and -out cosmopolitanism of a Karl Popper, another Central European Jew from a former Habsburg province. (This was Popper’s solution to the ‘Habsburg dilemma’ for people like himself. Gellner’s own Jewishness does not appear to have been the cause of much agonized self-reflection.) But at the same time Gellner was passionate about the need to embrace rationalism, and rational organization, as a foil to the crudity of nationalism. He was not the sort of person to indulge in nostalgic longing for the Habsburg Empire; but – against his Russian friend, Khazhanov – he did express keen apprehension over the fall of the Soviet Empire, fearing an outbreak of destructive and self-defeating nationalism there (in Russia as much as among other former Soviet republics).</p>
<p>But, apart from this distancing from nationalism, there is another reason for refusing to see nationalism as ‘Gellner’s life’, even in the sense of a wholesale preoccupation with it. Isaiah Berlin once wrote memorably about Leo Tolstoy as a writer who aspired to be a hedgehog – to know and state one big thing about life – but who was actually a consummate fox, full of sly and subtle observations. I think that was true of Gellner as well. Certainly much of Gellner’s writing is synoptic. He does like large, comprehensive, views and his work is undoubtedly knit together by a certain general understanding of the underpinnings of modernity. But these are views that to my mind come out better in the many essays, articles, reviews, and lectures that he produced throughout his life – fortunately mostly collected in volume form – than in the single books where he attempted to lay out his ideas in treatise form. Like Tolstoy, Gellner was a fox masquerading as a hedgehog, though in Gellner’s case – unlike Tolstoy’s – I think he knew that perfectly well.<sup>

</sup>
</p>
<p>These works – many of them occasional, not least the scores of reviews he did for the <italic>Times Literary Supplement</italic> – show Gellner at his most characteristic: brilliant, witty, combative, sometimes caustic. Though personally immensely kind, as many former students in particular attest, Gellner was a formidable and sometimes crushing opponent in public debate (in a tribute marking Gellner’s death, Alan MacFarlane noted the ‘contradiction between the acerbic and often cruel debater, and the enormously kind and gentle human being’). He delighted in polemics and provocations. The spirit that had inspired <italic>Words and Things</italic>, in other words, never deserted him. This could lead to the famous public spats, as that between Gellner and Edward Said, and – less explosively – between him and Clifford Geertz. Hall also shows the existence of an extensive private correspondence between Gellner and Noam Chomsky, in which the lack of agreement and the sharpness of the exchange led the latter to feel that there was no further point in pursuing the correspondence. There were also times when Gellner’s characteristic combativeness and insouciance could wound, as when, in an LSE lecture, he remarked that the Holocaust was best seen as an unnecessary mistake of industrial society: a remark that deeply offended one of his most devoted students, Anthony Smith. On another occasion, at a meeting of the American Anthropological Association, where his book <italic>Plough, Sword and Book</italic> was being discussed, he upset the women in the audience with the comment that, though he very much liked women, they had nothing to do with historical development.</p>
<p>These things were the price to be paid for an irrepressible and spirited personality. The more lasting gains can be found in the essays collected in such volumes as <italic>Spectacles and Predicaments</italic> (1974), <italic>The Devil in Modern Philosophy </italic>(1974), <italic>Encounters with Nationalism</italic> (1994), and <italic>Anthropology and Politics</italic> (1995). These are the ones that Gellner’s friends and students should urge on others, these are the contributions by which Gellner is likely to be remembered. They show, in a way often obscured in the rather cavalier style of the books and the brevity of treatment there, the breadth of Gellner’s knowledge and his close engagement with some of the most important questions in history and society.</p>
<p>There are also things sadly not publicly available, not yet at least. Hall refers frequently to the ‘Gellner Archive’ at LSE, of which he has made extensive and illuminating use. He quotes in particular from something he calls ‘The Notes’ – a marvellous compendium of Gellner’s jottings, full of piercing aphorisms and insightful comments, many of them providing the leading themes of Gellner’s thought (‘“Know thyself” – an absurdity, presupposing a given determinate self’; ‘Being a Jew is also like the human condition, in that there is no correct solution’; ‘general prosperity is within reach; but liberty is precarious, and the connection between the two is not at all clear’). There is also an unpublished manuscript, ‘Conservatism and Ideology’, an attack on the anti-rationalist philosophy of his LSE colleague, Michael Oakeshott, which in passing he nicely links with a side-sweep at an earlier antagonist, Oxford linguistic philosophy: ‘[There is a parallel] between linguistic philosophy and Oakeshott: both invert: the one treats thought as something to be cured, and confusion a paradigm of health; the other, real knowledge as disease, fumbling as health.’ Hall compares ‘The Notes’ to Marx’s <italic>Grundrisse</italic>, but a better parallel might be Adorno’s <italic>Minima Moralia</italic>. In any case, these unpublished writings make one hope for an edited publication putting together some of this material, perhaps with some of the correspondence, where, again, many of Gellner’s best qualities are on display.</p>
<p>Gellner was a rationalist who saw the need for culture; an optimist who accepted the price to be paid for ‘progress’; a liberal who was nevertheless prepared to support authoritarianism if it contributed to the greatest happiness of the greatest number. Hall quotes from a letter to Perry Anderson, in which Gellner confesses:<disp-quote>
<p>As for myself, I am deeply Philistine, and that aspect does not bother me too much … All in all, I am prepared to pay the price of vulgarity for peace, reasonable diffused prosperity and equality. If God obliged me to choose for mankind, giving me the option of living in a universalized Vienna of 1975 or 1905, I think I would, albeit with some private bitterness, be obliged to opt for 1975.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>It is a highly revealing comment, telling us much about the man and the philosopher. Gellner would have little truck with the ‘humanist’ Marx rediscovered in the West in the 1960s (he once described it as romantic <italic>Schwärmerei</italic>), but he had great respect for the Marxism of Soviet anthropologists, whom he saw as keeping alive the great questions of historical change. His enthusiasm for modernity was disconcerting at times, but it was absolutely genuine. Postmodernists and others who questioned its undoubted benefits earned his contempt – memorably, if somewhat harshly, expressed in the mordant <italic>Postmodernism, Reason and Religion</italic> (1992).</p>
<p>All this can be found in Hall’s admirably clear, full, and well-crafted biography. It is the work of someone who knew Gellner extremely well, for virtually the whole of his professional life, and who has delved deep in his writings. Although it is fair to call this book a labour of love, in the sense that it expresses Hall’s obvious admiration and affection for Gellner, it is not a hagiography. Hall indicates his differences with Gellner vigorously and at length. But he gives us the material to make up our own minds. He has done the job superbly, ranging over the full range of Gellner’s life and thought. There will no doubt be other explorations of aspects of that ‘rutilant harlequinade of ideas’ that Gellner bequeathed us.<sup>
