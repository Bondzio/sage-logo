         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>Since its inception in 1997, the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) has developed standards for data models, study designs, and supporting clinical trial documents. Standards for data models include the Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) for clinical trial data obtained from case report forms (CRFs), questionnaires, and/or diaries; the Analysis Data Model (ADaM) for derived data that support the analysis tables, listings, and figures common in drug applications; and the Standard for Exchange of Nonclinical Data (SEND) to support the needs of toxicology and carcinogenicity studies.</p>
         <p>The SDTM model<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861512441101">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861512441101">2</xref>
            </sup> divides clinical trial data domains, a collection of logically related observations with a common topic, into a number of classes: events, findings, interventions, special purpose, and trial design. Events domains include adverse events, medical history, disposition, and protocol deviations. Examples of the findings domains are physical examinations, vital signs, ECG test results, laboratory tests, and questionnaires. Interventions domains describe concomitant medications, exposures to study treatment, and the use of substances such as alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine. Special purpose domains include demographic characteristics, general comments, and study visit attendance. Trial design domains include data describing the treatment arms, visits, and inclusion/exclusion criteria. Within each domain, variable names, labels, formats, and terms are provided, and the SDTM model states whether the inclusion of each variable in a domain is required, expected, or permissible.</p>
         <p>The goal of ADaM<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092861512441101">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092861512441101">4</xref>
            </sup> is to clearly and unambiguously communicate the data behind the statistical analyses so that minimal additional manipulation is needed to generate study results (ie, “one PROC away”). Furthermore, while SDTM typically comprises observed data separated into specific domains, ADaM can include complex derivations, such as imputation and windowing of measurements, on data spanning several domains. An additional goal of the ADaM model is traceability: providing sufficient details to allow the user to go from a tabulation to the ADaM data set to the corresponding SDTM data sets. The most important ADaM data set is ADSL, the subject-level data set. This data set provides definitions for study population flags and includes subgrouping and stratification variables, important dates such as first and last dose, and the planned and actual treatments used for each period of the study.</p>
         <p>The SEND model<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092861512441101">5</xref>
            </sup> is similar to SDTM in that data domains are divided into several classes. However, the specific domains and variables available are more appropriate for toxicology and carcinogenicity studies. For example, the findings domains include body weight, palpable masses and tumors, food and water consumption, and micro- and macroscopic findings. It is important to note that SEND maintains as much consistency as possible with SDTM.</p>
         <p>CDISC standards have made such gains that the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) strongly encourages their use and implementation for submission of drug applications as a key component of the Critical Path Initiative. Furthermore, in late 2010, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research began accepting submissions using CDISC standards. However, despite the advances and improvements in these standards over the years and the ever-looming threat that they may someday be a requirement for drug applications,<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0092861512441101">6</xref>
            </sup> many are skeptical of attempts to develop a single standard and fail to understand the far-reaching advantages of adopting it. Below we address these concerns and present numerous tangible benefits of CDISC standards.</p>
         <sec id="section2-0092861512441101">
            <title>The Advantages of a Single Data Standard</title>
            <p>Many sponsors may feel that a single data standard is unnecessary. After all, they are quite comfortable with the data standard they have been using for years. The difficulty lies in the submission of the data package to any regulatory agency. To expect the FDA to efficiently review submissions from a multitude of pharmaceutical company standards is unreasonable. Each standard requires new or revised tools to programmatically review the data, and the expertise to develop and implement these tools may be limited to a few key individuals. This can force many reviewers to rely on tables and listings submitted by the sponsor. While tables presenting summary statistics are generally straightforward to review, it is often difficult to process the differences in treatments over time. Furthermore, getting a clear snapshot of the data for a single individual is quite difficult. These profiles become increasingly important the more the safety of a compound is called into question. An example is provided below.</p>
            <p>Industry-wide adoption of SDTM and other CDISC standards levels the playing field for the regulatory agencies, allowing them to enjoy many of the same benefits that a sponsor does. The FDA can develop general tools to explore data interactively, and such tools can allow a greater number of reviewers the ability to examine data on their own. Furthermore, programs can be developed that provide easy access to cross-domain reviews. Eventually, the traceability emphasized in ADaM standards coupled with a fully hyperlinked submission will further streamline the review process. Reviewers can start at an analysis table and easily navigate through the submission documents to uncover the statistical methods and programming syntax used to derive the table, the data, and variables used for computation and the location on the CRF where the data originated. Finally, storage of all submissions in a central repository can facilitate the analysis of data across submissions to gain insight on drugs with similar mechanisms of action, with possible detection of safety signals earlier.</p>
            <p>A single data standard is also advantageous to sponsors. In a large pharmaceutical company, standards may arise that are specific to a particular therapeutic area or geographical location. However, for a company committed to CDISC, there is greater flexibility in allocating employees to projects in unfamiliar therapeutic areas as resource needs wax and wane. While SDTM supports therapeutic area domains (eg, oncology), an individual will be experienced with the more common data sets and will enjoy a reasonable understanding of the structure and content of the new domains. Furthermore, the amount of necessary training for new employees can be reduced, thus enabling them to explore data more quickly. Small pharmaceutical companies with limited resources to develop a standard can benefit by using a standard that, according to the mission statement of CDISC, is “vendor-neutral, platform-independent and freely available.”</p>
            <p>Employing a unified standard enables the development of tools to validate how well studies and data submissions conform to the standard itself. For example, SAS Clinical Standards Toolkit validates the contents of a study database for the current version of SDTM (Version 3.1.2). Without these programs, sponsors are left to implement their own checks to ascertain whether the database meets an internal standard. Since SDTM may be slower to change than an internal standard within the company, robust programs can be written for edit checks and data cleaning, analysis data sets, tables, figures, and listings. Competing-code validation is often used in the pharmaceutical industry to verify the correctness of data sets and study tables; it can be a time-consuming process. A second set of programs can be written for the purposes of validation. The ability to reuse everything from database design to reporting can shorten timelines and save money.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0092861512441101">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092861512441101">8</xref>
               </sup> Furthermore, tools for reviewing data will be available earlier in the lifetime of a study, allowing for quicker intervention, if needed.</p>
            <p>Many pharmaceutical companies rely on contract research organizations (CROs) to conduct some or all of the data management and statistics. Relying on CDISC standards is a means of maintaining consistency among the many vendors a sponsor may utilize. Furthermore, given that personnel changes in project teams are likely for long-term studies, incorporating CDISC standards is a means of maintaining consistency across time. The aforementioned benefits of regulatory agencies also apply to CROs.</p>
            <p>Despite the advantages heretofore discussed, a sizeable learning curve is required to institute CDISC methodologies. The current SDTM Implementation Guide<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861512441101">2</xref>
               </sup> is almost 300 pages, and its bulk can intimidate the new user. It is fair to say that not all domains will be used for every study; many of the same rules and concepts are repeated across each domain, and the guide contains many informative examples. As alluded to above, these standards can be ascertained at any time and will eventually apply to the data of a future employer. Another concern is that many tools still need refinement or additional development. For example, at the time of this writing, SAS Clinical Standards Toolkit does not currently support the SEND standard, although enterprising individuals can use the Toolkit to develop SEND standards themselves. A final issue is cost. Maintaining current data practices and remapping to CDISC standards only adds to the cost of doing business. The financial benefits of CDISC standards materialize when the standards are incorporated throughout the development process.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092861512441101">8</xref>
               </sup> So while implementing CDISC standards may require an upfront investment, savings will be realized over time.</p>
            <p>CDISC data standards are by no means complete, but they can and will be improved and revised over time. For example, current available ADaM data structures do not easily support multivariate analyses or the analysis of occurrence data such as adverse events,<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092861512441101">4</xref>
               </sup> and there is currently an amendment under public review, based on requests from CDER, for additional variables in SDTM to facilitate the analysis of sponsor submissions.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0092861512441101">9</xref>
               </sup> And though the word “standard” may conjure visions of something restrictive and immutable, there is still flexibility in how CDISC is interpreted and implemented. CDER provides guidance for its preferred interpretations on its submission website.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0092861512441101">10</xref>

         <sec id="section3-0092861512441101">
            <title>Examples</title>
            <p>CDISC standards will have an enormous impact on programmers and software developers. Understanding where data are located, how they are related to one another, and the requirements for formats, labels, and inclusion greatly simplifies the development of new and powerful programs. Such programs will facilitate analysis, review, and reporting so as to provide greater insight into the safety of therapies under study. Furthermore, these programs can utilize a straightforward user interface so that those less familiar with software are free to explore data on their own. Below, we present several examples that illustrate how a single data standard fosters the development of software that shortens the path to discovery and reporting of clinical safety findings.</p>
            <sec id="section4-0092861512441101">
               <title>Patient Profiles</title>
               <p>An important task of any clinician at a pharmaceutical company is the frequent review of data to ensure the safety of the subjects under study. Up to now, this has been a difficult task. To gain a complete picture of the subject, data from several domains or listings need to be combined in a clear and meaningful way to highlight any irregularities. Attempts to summarize results are cumbersome and often difficult to customize. Many times out of frustration, clinicians resort to flipping through mountains of printed paper data listings.</p>
               <p>Data standards simplify the task of summarizing data in a meaningful way (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0092861512441101">Figure 1</xref>). In a single panel, the reviewer can understand a subject’s demographic information and medical history, review the severity and duration of adverse events and their overlap with medications, and determine whether the subject experienced any laboratory abnormalities or outliers in vital signs or electrocardiograms.</p>

            <sec id="section5-0092861512441101">
               <title>Adverse Event Narratives</title>
               <p>When a subject has a serious adverse event (SAE) or other significant adverse event (AE), such as those leading to the discontinuation of the study, a narrative is written for the clinical study report. These narratives summarize the details surrounding the event to enable understanding of the circumstances that may have led to the occurrence of the AE and its subsequent management. Such details may include the dose of the study drug at the time of the event, the duration of this dose prior to the event, concomitant medications taken at the time of the event and those used to treat it, and other AEs that may have recently occurred. Other details include demography and medical history, the severity of the event, and whether the AE was related to study medication.</p>
               <p>Narratives are typically written from the original SAE report faxed from the clinical site in combination with data listings that are generated as part of the study deliverables, and these sources of information often require reconciliation for consistency. Information contained in the typical narrative requires the review of many data sources. This is often time-consuming and, as is true for any manual effort, can require additional review and quality control. In contrast, the narrative in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0092861512441101">Figure 2</xref> was written by a software program. Various options permit the user to tailor the narrative to specific needs and, once generated, allow for further nuancing. Allowing a program to generate narratives initially can give the writer an idea of common themes, and for therapeutic areas where multiple SAEs per subject are the norm, can hasten the writing process.</p>

               <title>Adverse Event Incidence</title>
               <p>Analysis of AEs, like many safety domains, suffers from the problem of dimensionality. It can be impossible to predict what AEs will occur on study, and there are often numerous events by study’s end. Typically, the incidence of AEs is summarized in tables, with events coded by a medical dictionary, such as MedDRA. These preferred terms are grouped by body system or system organ class and presented in order of descending frequency. Many times, statistical testing is not performed because of the high likelihood of committing multiple Type I errors.</p>
               <p>Incidence analyses can be straightforward to present graphically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0092861512441101">Figure 3</xref>) to highlight differences among the treatments. Color is used to indicate the treatment with higher incidence, while bubble size represents the total number of events on study. Adjustments for multiple comparisons can be performed and presented in a manner to clearly indicate which events exhibit statistically significant treatment differences between the groups (ie, those events above the dashed red line). In addition, with a graphical display, the study can easily be broken into multiple distinct time periods, and animation can present changes in AE risk over time. This presentation can emphasize early differences across treatments that may eventually disappear, or highlight events that could approach significance given a longer study duration.</p>

         <title>Conclusions</title>
         <p>There are many benefits to adopting CDISC standards, including gains in efficiency, flexibility in resourcing, shortened timelines, and financial savings. The standards enable more powerful and standardized analysis and reporting, providing more straightforward review and a better understanding of the safety characteristics of new medications. Furthermore, they empower a larger group of individuals to explore data on their own.</p>
         <p>At their core, CDISC standards are a means to streamline communications across the various parties involved in drug development. This is true for the functional teams—biostatistics, data management, clinical, programming, medical writing, and regulatory—within a pharmaceutical company, as well as the many vendors and regulatory bodies with which the sponsor will collaborate to bring new therapies to market. Given the rising costs of drug development, the complexity of innovative clinical trial designs, and the need to reach globally to study orphan diseases, embracing CDISC standards will enhance communication and generate efficiencies for the sponsor. In turn, submissions employing CDISC standards should experience minimal delay for the appropriate regulatory review. Ultimately, the consumer will benefit by having earlier access to much-needed therapies.</p>
