<p>Given the continuing need to make outpatient mental health services more available, Slive and Bobele’s (Editors) book, <italic>When One Hour is All You Have: Effective Therapy for Walk-In Clients,</italic> is a welcome resource for mental health policy makers, administrators, and practitioners. Too often lengthy waiting lists or hard to get appointments exist in our communities. One possible solution is the implementation of the walk-in, single-session model. Slive and Bobele, long time practitioners of the model and university teachers, have now put together in their words, “. . . the first book that comprehensively addresses the topic of walk-in, single-session therapy.” They remind us that we live in a world where consumers want fast services - think drive in-banks, fast food restaurants, minor emergency clinics, walk-in hair stylists. Why not walk in mental heath services? While the book doesn’t argue for walk-in, single-session therapy to replace traditional regularly scheduled appointments, they make a convincing case for walk-in, single-session counseling to be added to a community’s array of mental health services.</p>
<p>The book is divided into two parts. Part one describes walk-in, single-session counseling and addresses frequently asked questions or concerns about implementing this approach. For example: “Isn’t this a superficial band-aid approach?” The Editors unabashedly accept this question as a compliment given the long history of the band-aid as a low-tech solution to encourage healing and limit the spread of infection. The book presents an overview of the research behind the walk-in, single session model, its effectiveness and current use among various populations. For practitioners, Chapter three is particularly useful as it gives a detailed outline or “how to’s” for conducting walk in sessions, including types of questions to ask a client. The chapter provides a case example (transcript) of a session with accompanying comments describing the steps of the session using a solution-focused paradigm. As both Editors have taught and provided supervision to graduate level students, chapter four is devoted to several of their students sharing their experience of having seen walk in clients for one session.</p>
<p>Part two provides six examples of walk-in counseling at various locations in Canada and the United States, with the last chapter describing its use in the aftermath of a hurricane in the southern United States. In conclusion, this book offers a good mix of both the rationale and operating principles for walk-in single session clinics as well as useful practical advice for conducting these sessions along with numerous vignettes. The editors aptly conclude their book with the 70s pop song lyrics, “Now everybody’s talkin’ ‘bout your new way of walking’, do you wanna lose your mind? Lord, walk right in and sit right down, daddy, let your mind roll on.”</p>
