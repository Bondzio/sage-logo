<p>The successful management and protection of animals rely on a basic understanding of their distributions, many of which have altered significantly over the last 10,000 years as a result of environmental changes and the influence of anthropomorphic impacts. With increasing pressure on the remaining natural habitats, and the current global threat to biodiversity, it is imperative that conservation biologists have a full understanding of the ecological requirements of species in order to conserve them successfully. This ground-breaking book bridges significant gaps in knowledge by linking ecological and anthropological perspectives on the historical ranges and abundance of seals, sea lions, and sea otters in the northeastern region of the Pacific, and explores the impacts of humans and climate change on these past population patterns. The range of subject matter covered in this volume is impressive. Braje and Rick have succeeded in bringing together a range of disciplines including archaeology, anthropology, conservation biology, ecology, and many more, which clearly highlights the value and benefits of zooarchaeological research to modern-day conservation biology and ecology.</p>
<p>The data analysed in each chapter are impressive, and there are a number of different analytical tools and methods employed to interpret each species’ population trends. This should act as a stimulus for readers to explore new approaches to study ecology and climate change-related subjects. Each chapter is well introduced and well discussed, although the quality of figures differed between chapters. Sadly, none of the figures, images and maps is in colour which does detract from the visual interpretation of some of the data. The typeface is quite small, and the text is set up in two columns which, due to the close spacing between sentences, makes the flow of the text difficult to follow. Apart from these minor grumbles, this is an excellent book of significant utility, and is highly suitable for academics, postgraduates, and undergraduates from a range of disciplines. Indeed, this book should be core reading for many university degree courses. The subject matter discussed is relevant to those involved in the study of sustainability, past climates, and the impacts of environmental change on natural systems, biodiversity, and human society. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this inspirational book, and truly hope that the multidisciplinary approach stimulates new research directions and collaborations to further our collective understanding of the ecologies and conservation of many more animal (and plant!) species.</p>
