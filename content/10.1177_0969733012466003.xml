<abstract>
<p>The aim of this study is to examine the current profile of bioethics education in the nursing curriculum as perceived by nursing students and faculty in Korea. A convenience sampling method was used for recruiting 1223 undergraduate nursing students and 140 nursing faculty in Korea. Experience of Bioethics Education, Quality of Bioethics Education, and Demand for Bioethics Education Scales were developed. The Experience of Bioethics Education Scale showed that the nursing curriculum in Korea does not provide adequate bioethics education. The Quality of Bioethics Education Scale revealed that the topics of human nature and human rights were relatively well taught compared to other topics. The Demand for Bioethics Education Scale determined that the majority of the participants believed that bioethics education should be a major requirement in the nursing curriculum. The findings of this study suggest that bioethics should be systemically incorporated into nursing courses, clinical practice during the program, and during continuing education.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The rapid advancement of biotechnology has raised many new ethical concerns, such as human cloning, genetic engineering, and organ and tissue transplantation. In response to these new concerns, bioethics was created and developed to address “the ethical issues at both the heart and the cutting edge of technology in health care and the life sciences” (p. 4).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733012466003">1</xref>
</sup> Nurses have a professional responsibility to advocate the good of their patients in the midst of development of biotechnology. Ethics education helps nurses to become better patient advocates. Being an advocate is a way for nurses to express the moral imperative to do what they believe is the right thing to do for patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733012466003">2</xref>
</sup> Thus, it is significant for nurses to have knowledge of bioethics and its influence on their patients in order to successfully fulfill their roles in bioethics mediation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733012466003">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Nurses who receive adequate and systematic bioethics education will be better prepared to deal with expected and unexpected ethical problems in nursing care practice.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733012466003">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733012466003"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733012466003">6</xref>
</sup> For the last three decades, various efforts to teach bioethics to nurses and nursing students have been made in the United States;<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733012466003">7</xref>

</sup> however, bioethics education is not well implemented in nursing schools in Korea. In Korea, most nursing schools deal with only four principles of biomedical ethics and some relevant ethical issues, such as artificial insemination, abortion, and euthanasia in their curricula.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733012466003">11</xref>
</sup> There is no systematic in-service bioethics education program for nurses even in clinical settings. In the arena of research, bioethics education for nurses and nursing students has not received much attention in Korea. Some bioethics research in nursing mainly focuses on ethical theories, issues, attitude, and dilemmas in nursing practice rather than on education itself.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733012466003">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0969733012466003">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>With this lack of research on the subject, it is difficult to discuss future directions for bioethics education for nursing students. Therefore, it is highly imperative to examine the current status and future requirements of bioethics education in the nursing curriculum in Korea. The aims of this study were to examine (a) the current profile of bioethics education in the Korean nursing curriculum, (b) the quality of bioethics education as perceived by nursing students and faculty, and (c) the demands of nursing students and faculty for further bioethics education. This study will provide fundamental data for designing and implementing a nursing curriculum for bioethics in Korea.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0969733012466003">
<title>Design</title>
<p>This study used a descriptive cross-sectional survey design. Data collection was conducted by self-reported questionnaires via mail or email.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0969733012466003">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Inclusion criteria were any nursing students and faculty in nursing schools in Korea. No specific exclusion criteria were identified. A convenience sampling method was used to recruit 1223 undergraduate nursing students and 140 nursing faculty in Korea. Power analysis was not performed since this study used a descriptive survey design. Recruitment materials were sent to the deans of 38 nursing schools, and 12 of them agreed to participate in this study. The respondents received monetary rewards for participating in the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0969733012466003">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>The data were collected in 2011. In total, 1500 questionnaire packages were mailed out and 1223 (return rate = 81.5%) were used for data analysis. A trained nursing faculty conducted the data collection in each school from all levels of students. In total, 1370 e-mails were sent to nursing faculty, and 140 (return rate = 10.2%) eventually responded to the survey.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0969733012466003">
<title>Ethical considerations</title>
<p>To ensure confidentiality, all collected information, from which all names had been omitted, was stored in a locked filing cabinet in the principal investigator’s office. The participants were assured that they could withdraw from the study without fear of reprisal or denial of service. The purpose and procedures of the study were explained to the participants before the study took place.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0969733012466003">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 19.0 was used for the data analysis. Descriptive statistics were performed to summarize the sample characteristics and the subjects’ answers regarding the current status of bioethics education. The current status of bioethics education was explored using frequency and percentage. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and <italic>t</italic>-test were conducted to explore demographic differences in education experience, quality, and demand. In addition, Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated to examine the relationships among the three scales for bioethics education experience, quality, and demand. For all analyses, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 was considered statistically significant.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0969733012466003">
<title>Instruments</title>
<p>An extensive literature review of bioethics was conducted to identify the major topics of bioethics education in nursing curriculum from books, and professional and scholarly articles from 1980 to 2012 using the keywords “ethics,” “bioethics,” “bioethics mediation,” “ethical issues,” and “nursing.” A total of 11 bioethics topics were discussed in more than six books and thus were considered essential components for bioethics education. The content validity of 28 topics was assessed using a 3-point rating scale (0 = not relevant, 1 = somewhat relevant, and 2 = very relevant) by a panel of 17 nursing faculty with expertise in nursing ethics. The assessment resulted in the elimination of eight topics with low levels of validity, which included topics with low levels of adequacy (<italic>M</italic> &lt; 1.0), such as animal ethics, environmental ethics, ethical issues in health-care systems, and attitudes toward illness, and topics for which the raters’ opinions differed greatly (standard deviation (SD) &gt; 0.7), such as suicide, child abuse, nursing ethics in the future, and substance abuse.</p>
<p>A total of 31 topics were then processed to merge topics with overlapping themes. For example, “fetal diagnosis and fetal rights” and “the beginning and definition of life” were combined into one topic. A panel of experts finalized and classified 24 topics into the following five categories: ethical knowledge, ethical attitude, beginning-of-life issues, end-of-life issues, and ethical issues in nursing practice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0969733012466003">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Three scales, namely, Experience of Bioethics Education Scale, Quality of Bioethics Education Scale, and Demand for Bioethics Education Scale, were developed based on the 24 topics. Experience of Bioethics Education Scale assessed the extent to which nursing students or faculty had been educated on bioethics. Quality of Bioethics Education Scale measured the adequacy of bioethics education that the nursing students and faculty received. Demand for Bioethics Education Scale examined the need of the nursing students and faculty for bioethics education. These scales were 5-point Likert scales. The response options were “1,” indicating “not at all” or “extremely disagree,” to “5,” indicating “extremely” or “extremely agree.”</p>
<p>The reliabilities of the three scales were high. The same Cronbach’s level (α = .96) was recorded for Experience of Bioethics Education for both nursing students and faculty. For Quality of Bioethics Education Scale, Cronbach’s α in students was .99 and that in faculty was .94. Both groups demonstrated a high level of reliability on Demand for Bioethics Education Scale (students, α = .96; faculty, α = .95).</p>

<p>Age of the nursing faculty ranged from 29 to 63 years (<italic>M</italic> = 45.6, SD = 8.1). There were 47 respondents (33.6%) aged from 41 to 50 years, and 46 (32.9%) aged from 51 to 60 years. Of the faculty, 99.3% were female. Of these, 82.1% held a doctorate, and 17.1% held a master’s degree. More than half (52.1%) were working in bachelor’s degree-granting institutions. The average working experience of faculty was 11.6 years (SD = 9.1). Regarding the field of specialty, 29.7% specialized in medical–surgical nursing, followed by psychiatric nursing (12.9%), nursing management (12.1%), maternity nursing (11.4%), and fundamental nursing (10.7%).</p>

<title>Experience of bioethics education</title>
<p>Less than a quarter of the nursing students (23.6%) reported receiving bioethics education in the past year in nursing schools. Less than half of the faculty respondents (49.3%) reported receiving education on bioethics. Of those who did, only 8.7% reported that they received it at undergraduate level, 47.8% at graduate level, and 46.4% after they became educators. Most (69.6%) received their education through special lectures or workshops rather than through the nursing curriculum.</p>
<p>Bioethics education was implemented in one course (students = 89.6%; faculty = 59.4%) and a core course (students = 63.3%; faculty = 62.5%). Lectures focused on theories and case studies were the most commonly used teaching strategies (students = 32.8%; faculty = 30.8%), followed by lectures focused on theories (students = 24.1%; faculty = 20.5%), debates focused on theories and case studies (students = 16.2%; faculty = 17.9%), and case studies (students = 13.6%; faculty = 10.3%). The least used teaching method was debates focused on theories (students = 3.2%; faculty = 5.1%).</p>
<p>The average score on the Experience of Bioethics Education Scale for students was 67.7 (SD = 16.7), with a range of 24–120. Human rights, patient rights, and patient autonomy was the item with the highest mean (<italic>M</italic> = 3.32, SD = 1.04), and fair and just allocation of medical resources was the item with the lowest mean (<italic>M</italic> = 2.56, SD = 0.89). For the faculty, the average score of the Experience of Bioethics Education Scale was 67.9 (SD = 21.7), with a range of 24–118; human rights, patient rights, and patient autonomy was the item with the highest mean (<italic>M</italic> = 3.74, SD = 1.10), while concept and history of bioethics was the item with the lowest mean (<italic>M</italic> = 2.34, SD = 1.27).</p>

<title>Quality of bioethics education</title>
<p>Of those who received bioethics education in the past year, the majority of the respondents in both groups stated that bioethics education in the current nursing curriculum was inadequate (students = 74.7%; faculty = 97.2%); more than half from both groups expressed the sentiment that such education was helpful for enlightening ethical consciousness (students = 69.9%; faculty = 50.7%). Regarding the answer that current bioethics education was not helpful, both groups described it as being due to insufficiency of educational contents and available textbooks (students = 41.4%; faculty = 68.1%) and unhelpfulness for resolving actual ethical problems in nursing practice (students = 36.8%; faculty = 40.6%). However, the two groups differed in their choice for the next reason: students selected inappropriateness of the evaluation methods (9.2%), whereas faculty members chose incompetence of the educators (33.3%).</p>
<p>Students obtained an average score of 65.3 (SD = 13.0) on the Quality of Bioethics Education Scale, with a range of 29–112. Human rights, patient rights, and patient autonomy was the item with the highest mean (<italic>M</italic> = 3.11, SD = 0.88), and fair and just allocation of medical resources was the item with the lowest mean (<italic>M</italic> = 2.49, SD = 0.80). For faculty, the average score was 55.7 (SD = 11.8), with a range of 24–96; humanity and human nature was the item with the highest mean (<italic>M</italic> = 2.74, SD = 0.84), while cloning was the item with the lowest mean (<italic>M</italic> = 1.96, SD = 0.73).

<title>Demand for bioethics education</title>
<p>Both students and faculty answered that bioethics education should be worth two credits (students = 69.2%; faculty = 67.9%), part of a major (students = 83.0%; faculty = 72.1%), and required (students = 85.8%; faculty = 75.0%). Both chose debate based on theories and case studies as the most appropriate teaching strategy for bioethics education (students = 50.5%; faculty = 72.1%). However, the two groups differed in their choices for the second and third most appropriate teaching strategies: students chose lecture based on theories and case studies (27.7%) and debate based on case studies (19.7%), whereas faculty chose problem-based learning or action learning (26.4%) and lecture based on theories and case studies (22.1%).</p>
<p>The respondents were asked to prioritize the following seven elements for improving bioethics education: enhancement of educators’ quality and competence, development of adequate curriculum and contents, improvement of teaching strategies, making bioethics education a required course, moral education for developing respect for life, social consensus on the importance of bioethics, and multidisciplinary approach to bioethical issues. The students’ top three choices were social consensus on the importance of bioethics (31.1%), moral education for developing respect for life (26.9%), and improvement of teaching methods (14.0%). The faculty chose moral education for developing respect for life (34.3%), social consensus on the importance of bioethics (23.6%), and enhancement of educators’ quality and competence (18.6%).</p>
<p>The students obtained an average score of 94.2 (SD = 12.9) on the Demand for Bioethics Education Scale, with a range of 24–96. Induced abortion was the item with the highest mean (<italic>M</italic> = 4.20, SD = 0.77), and concept and history of bioethics was the item with the lowest mean (<italic>M</italic> = 3.52, SD = 0.90).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>There is no previous study that has comprehensively surveyed the current status of bioethics education in the nursing curriculum in Korea. Therefore, it was difficult to make meaningful direct comparisons with the results of this study. However, the results of this study raise some important points by themselves for the development of a Korean nursing curriculum for bioethics education.</p>
<p>The findings of the current study show that the nursing curriculum in Korea does not provide adequate bioethics education. More than half of the faculty respondents in this study had not received systematic bioethics education. This implies that the majority of the nursing faculty in Korea may not be prepared to fulfill the responsibility of enhancing students’ moral development. It is necessary to develop and provide adequate and systematic bioethics programs for nursing faculty as well as nursing students.</p>
<p>Identifying the essential elements of bioethics education is important for its development.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733012466003">13</xref>
</sup> This study revealed that the topics of human nature and human rights are being relatively well taught, as well as highly regarded as important and necessary compared to the topics of cloning, history of bioethics, and allocation of medical resources among both nursing students and faculty. The finding from a previous study<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0969733012466003">12</xref>
</sup> supports our findings. This result reaffirms the fact that issues relating to justice are not a main concern of nursing education in Korea.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733012466003">11</xref>
</sup> In addition, it indicates that students and faculty members lack education and interest in ethical knowledge as compared to ethical attitude and beginning-of-life issues. These aspects of bioethics education need to be strengthened in the development of bioethics education in the nursing curriculum in Korea.</p>
<p>Regarding teaching methods, while students and faculty members selected debate as the most appropriate and desirable teaching strategy for bioethics education, lectures are the most commonly used method in current bioethics classes, and this lecture-centered education has not changed in the last decade in Korea.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733012466003">11</xref>
</sup> This gap is attributed to the Korean culture. Korean students are not familiar with debates as they have been educated to conform to the instructions given by the teacher. Although students and faculty members agreed on debate as the first desirable teaching strategy, they differed in their second choice: students selected lecture, while faculty members chose problem-based learning/action learning. This difference indicates that students tend to be accustomed to teacher-centered learning, whereas faculty members prefer to conduct student-centered learning. Therefore, the implementation of debate-based bioethics education and examination of its effects on students’ ethical problem-solving skills and on students’ capabilities in advocacy role will be needed for the development of bioethics in nursing education.</p>
<p>The respondents who answered that current bioethics education is not helpful attributed this to insufficiency of relevant educational resources, such as textbooks and unhelpfulness of the education for resolving actual ethical problems in nursing practice. Future endeavors to improve bioethics education should focus on developing educational content and methods that enhance students’ problem-solving abilities.</p>
<p>Bioethics education helps students enhance moral reasoning and the ability to make ethical judgments and decisions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733012466003">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733012466003">6</xref>
</sup> The majority of the students and faculty answered that bioethics education should be a major requirement in the nursing curriculum. This finding showed that they consider knowledge of bioethics important and necessary for nursing. Most students and faculty in this study who received bioethics education found that their experiences with bioethics education helped to improve their ethical consciousness even though their bioethics education was not sufficient.</p>
<p>Students in both associate and bachelor’s degree programs agreed on the need for bioethics education as being quite high, but the students in associate degree programs had less educational experience with bioethics than students pursuing bachelor’s degrees did. This result is consistent with the previous finding.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733012466003">14</xref>
</sup> Bioethics education in associate degree nursing programs needs to be improved in terms of its quantitative as well as qualitative aspects.</p>
<p>The results of the relationships among the three scales of bioethics education experience, quality, and demand showed that the more bioethics education students and faculty received, the more they perceived demand for education in bioethics. This study has a limitation that might affect the validity of the results. During the instruments development stage, only the content validity of the three scales was assessed. Confirmatory factor analysis needs to be used to confirm construct validity.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The study is the first comprehensive research that discusses specific aspects of bioethics education in the nursing curriculum in Korea. The findings of this study will provide a foundation for developing and improving bioethics education for nursing students. Bioethics should be systemically incorporated with nursing courses and clinical practice during the program and during continuing education.<sup>

</sup> Hospitals need to develop and provide in-service bioethics programs for their nurses. Such in-service education programs may help nurses to deal better with the various ethical problems they face in patient care. In addition, ethical manuals based on clinical cases will serve as a useful resource for nurses. Hospitals are strongly advised to develop and distribute these manuals to enhance their ethical nursing practices.</p>
<p>This study has implications for nursing education, research, and practice. For the purpose of education, bioethics education could use these findings in ethics curriculum planning, particularly for the education content and teaching methods. Nurse educators’ knowledge of bioethics content and their ability to teach bioethics should be explored. It is imperative to develop a compulsory, stand-alone bioethics course in the curricula of nursing schools. It is necessary to develop and implement debate-based bioethics education for nursing students. The appropriate textbooks also need to be developed.</p>
<p>In research, studies that examine and measure the educational effects of the developed (debate-based) bioethics education are required. In particular, attention should be given to changes in students’ critical thinking abilities and overall ethical qualifications. Studies also need to examine whether the education enhances students’ actual ability to resolve ethical problems in nursing practice. Furthermore, it is necessary to develop more instruments to measure the effects of bioethics education in nursing. For practice, the reinforcement of continuing education is pivotal in order to keep up with the latest controversial topics in bioethics. The applicability of theoretical bioethics knowledge in practice would be important to the development of continuing education.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the findings of this study suggest that bioethics education can be taught as a subject incorporated widely throughout the curriculum to prepare more teachers to teach nursing ethics. Nurse educators need to participate in postprofessional training ethics education on a regular basis to expand their knowledge base on bioethics.</p>
