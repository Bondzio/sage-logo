<abstract>
<p>“Partnership for Patients: Better Care Low Costs” and “Meaningful Use of HIT” are HHS initiatives designed for shifting control and power from caregivers to patients, to make care truly “patient-centered.” There is a pressing need to develop methods of inviting/engaging/enabling patients to increase the quality and frequency of reports to help improve health care quality. We propose a Visual Learning and Communication System (VLCS) to meet this need. Embedded in VLCS is a Visual Error Reporting System (VERS). The objectives are to (a) help prevent adverse events in the first place, (b) detect errors, (c) ameliorate their effects, and (d) empower patients to propose interventions for safety improvement. Visualization has the potential to be an excellent conduit for seamless flow of meaningful information to and from other stakeholders and to foster a common culture of quality and value and make information useful for patients and providers at the point of care.</p>

<title>Context</title>
<p>“Thirteen years after <italic>To Err Is Human:</italic> are we listening to patients and their families?”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1084822312465748">1</xref></sup> For all practical purposes, the answer is no. The US Consumers Union takes the view that preventable adverse events are kept secret from consumers. At the same time, the Nation has made insufficient progress in reducing adverse events (AEs). Medicare and Medicaid patients, many of whom are African American and other minorities of low income, seem to be at higher risk. The third leading cause of death in America is health care harm, after heart disease and cancer. The value of lost lives and disabilities caused by AEs in 2006 was estimated to range from 18% to 45% of total US health care spending.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1084822312465748">2</xref></sup> “Current methods of detection of AEs are far from adequate and risk misdirection of present efforts to improve safety-based quality.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1084822312465748">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1084822312465748">3</xref></sup> According to the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1084822312465748">4</xref> 1 in 7 Medicare beneficiaries was harmed in 2010. Dr. Daniel R. Levinson, the HHS Inspector General, has shown concern about the inadequacy of current, staff-oriented, reporting systems to Patient Safety Organizations (PSOs).</p>
<p>Reports are, in any case, just the “tip of the iceberg.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1084822312465748">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1084822312465748">6</xref></sup> The size of this “tip,” that represents the retrospective approach to safety management, can be significantly increased if we acknowledge and take advantage of the abilities of patients, advocates, and families to perceive adverse events. Recent literature clearly shows that they can report accurate observations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1084822312465748">7</xref></sup> The investigators’ own experience<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1084822312465748">5</xref></sup> concurs with that of Frey and Schwappach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1084822312465748">8</xref></sup> [2010] who have found that patients are sensitive observers of care they receive and can accurately identify AEs and incidents. One in three patients say they have experienced errors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1084822312465748">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1084822312465748">3</xref></sup> These are errors of omission and commission, including undertreatment, overtreatment, mistreatment and fraud.</p>
<p>“The Partnership for Patients: Better Care, Lower Costs”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1084822312465748">9</xref></sup> initiative that aims to create an affordable and consumer-centered quality health care system must not miss the opportunity to further enhance consumers’ knowledge and perceptions and to capture consumer memory and knowledge to help learn lessons and help design interventions for improvements. We need to invite, enable, and engage patients to become central team members. Current methods of capturing and learning from “Never Events” do not provide a structured, comprehensive view of safety in health care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1084822312465748">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1084822312465748">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1084822312465748">11</xref></sup> Phillips et al., Kuzel et al., and Weingart et al. express the need for developing methods of inviting, engaging, and enabling consumers, creating a common vision that is <italic>clearly understood by all</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1084822312465748">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1084822312465748">6</xref></sup> Current and projected advances in health information technology (Meaningful Use of HIT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1084822312465748">12</xref></sup> as well as the associated rapid advances in social networks open up a huge avenue for creating effective partnerships. Not only will the size of the “tip” of the iceberg be increased but also it will be seen with greater fidelity.</p>

<p>Also shown are the corresponding actions that the health care system should take or be proactive about. Despite the fact that <italic>patients are a major source of knowledge about the state of health care safety</italic>, attempts to engage and elicit their input and error reports have had very limited success due to a variety of factors, particularly the health literacy gap and provider-centered care system. Little is known about how best to take advantage of the valuable knowledge and experience of patients and their caregivers. We need to create a <italic>common vision</italic> that is clearly understood by patients/families, advocates, and providers, thus creating team spirit between them. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) draws attention to this need in its Patient Safety Primer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1084822312465748">13</xref></sup></p>

<title>Patient centered culture of safety</title>
<p>Formation of a culture of safety is widely accepted as the most effective management strategy in the war against medical errors. There are eight major contributors to the formation of a patient-centered safety culture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1084822312465748">14</xref></sup> These contributors are the awareness of the value of quality, creation of a learning environment, accurate and timely information, nonhierarchical teams, engaging patients in a holistic approach, safety as a priority, patient-designed recovery system, and patient monitoring and responsibility. All these contributors interact with each other as if part of a web with the patient at the center. The goal of many of the contributors is to keep the patient at foremost priority and to engage the patient in her or his own care, thereby giving value to safety. Trust and collaboration are at the core of these factors, emphasizing how patients and providers must work together to be diligent to preserve a culture of safety that encourages error reporting in a confidential and accessible way, provided with universal visual language.</p>
<p>Creation of a “learning environment” through error reporting and of awareness of <italic>value</italic> of quality, <italic>as perceived by patients</italic>, are two of these major contributors, which are mutually reenforcing. Advantage needs to be taken of the cybernetic loops between these contributors to the formation of a culture of safety.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1084822312465748">
<title>Past efforts</title>
<p>The IOM’s report, “Patient Safety: Achieving a New Standard for Care,”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1084822312465748">15</xref></sup> called for the development of an event taxonomy. Numerous error taxonomies have been, and are being, developed to organize and classify error reports. The World Health Organization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1084822312465748">16</xref></sup> is working to establish a common international system for classification. The International Primary Care Patient Safety Taxonomy Steering Committee has set itself the important and necessary task of developing, <italic>a primary care taxonomy for patient safety, embedded in the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC-2) and in an episode of care structure, that can operate across settings and vendors, and that maps to other standards and data structures.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1084822312465748">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>These taxonomies are essentially alphanumeric codes that are used to classify error data and summarize it (whether at local, regional, national, and international levels) for various purposes. The codes are used to estimate frequencies and trends of various error types.</p>
<p>These current taxonomies, as alphanumeric codes, have a number of limitations:</p>
<list id="list1-1084822312465748" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>They do not readily meet the <italic>point-of-care</italic> needs of patients and health providers to understand, within their own unique micro-systems, the causes and consequences of the reported errors.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The coding systems are complex and prone to ambiguity.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>They often differ in the way they define, count, and track events, and they use different terms, data, and coding methods and analysis. This makes it difficult to compare data that have been collected or coded using different taxonomies.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>They do not fully capture the “story.” By reducing an incident to a series of codes, the flavor of the event is lost. It is the “story” that has the greatest potential to contribute to safety improvements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1084822312465748">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1084822312465748">19</xref></sup></p></list-item></list>
<p>Even the health care providers of care express dissatisfaction with the current reporting systems. It is therefore clear that the patients and their caregivers are bound to encounter even greater barriers to reporting. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1084822312465748">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the conceptual model for error reporting and barriers faced by all stakeholders, especially patients, which the authors consider helpful for developing a new approach described in the Method and Results sections.</p>

<title>Need for a new approach</title>
<p>The US IOM<sup>15</sup> states that a comprehensive National Health Information Infrastructure must provide information flow across three dimensions: (a) personal health, to support individuals in their own wellness and health decision making; (b) health care providers, to ensure access to clinical decision support systems; and (c) public health, to address and track public health concerns and health education campaigns. Items (a) and (b) correspond to the micro-system level while item (c) is at the macro-system level. Use of a consistent error taxonomy across these levels is imperative.</p>
<p>This presents a challenge and an opportunity to harness the benefits of computer visualization and enrich “meaningful use of HIT.” Our objective is to build a knowledge web base for meeting the <italic>needs of consumers, of diverse groups</italic>, so as to enable them to play key roles in assessing and improving safety-based quality as well as value. This needs to be advanced by developing a prototype system designed to <italic>enhance or sharpen consumers’</italic> (a) willingness to <italic>become central members</italic> of the health care team, (b) awareness of the <italic>complexity</italic> of the system of care, (c) perception of <italic>untoward incidents</italic>, (d) ability to articulate their experience in a universal language <italic>conveniently and safely</italic>, (e) ability to <italic>suggest interventions</italic> for improvement, (f) ability to receive and <italic>understand</italic> meaningful feedback and evidence of <italic>improvements in quality and value</italic>, (g) understanding for reduction of <italic>risks associated with transitions</italic>, (h) ability to maximize <italic>community awareness</italic> and understanding of consumer <italic>roles</italic>, (i) <italic>satisfaction</italic>, and any others identified by consumers in specific settings.</p>
<p>In view of the importance of human factors and the potential of IT, we propose a Visual Learning and Communication System (VLCS) to advance the above stated aims for meeting the <italic>consumer’s needs and engagement</italic>. Embedded in VLCS is a visual error reporting system (VERS). Use of the universal visual language has the potential to be an excellent conduit for seamless flow of meaningful information to and from other stakeholders and to foster a common culture of quality and value and make information useful for patients and providers at the point of care, as called for by the AHRQ. A very rapid rise in consumer-focused web services and the number of users of smartphones and tablets must not only be acknowledged but leveraged to empower and engage patients.</p>

<sec id="section9-1084822312465748">
<title>Why visualization</title>
<p>The authors take the view that visualization is a universal tool that furnishes a natural common “language.” For instance, it is used effectively for international road signs. It respects and aids inductive, as opposed to linear, perception and decision making. It can provide</p>
<list id="list3-1084822312465748" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>A fast path to fully engaging the minds of individuals and their teams including patients;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Insight to causes, cascades, and consequences of errors;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A common vision for teamwork, with the potential for improved outcomes;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Aid for coping with the complexities, fragmentation, and decentralization of the health care system; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Aid for mapping across<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1084822312465748">20</xref></sup> different taxonomies and data structures.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The authors have developed and successfully applied visual models at the macro-system and micro-system levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1084822312465748">5</xref></sup> for the purposes of <italic>proactive</italic> safety management.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1084822312465748">
<title>Policy implications</title>
<p>The general purpose of our work is to develop and test a concept for visual medical error taxonomy, built on visual reporting, that can provide for both macro-system and micro-system level needs. This is a retrospective safety management approach.</p>
<p>Error reporting at the micro-system (e.g., in a primary care office) level is used internally for safety improvement as well as being fed seamlessly to a regional (e.g., PSO), national, or international database (WHO). These databases use the data to study the epidemiology of errors, to generate alerts, and help form national and international policies for health care management.</p>
<p>While tracking error rates over time or among different institutions or regions is a commonly perceived goal of an error reporting system, caution is needed when interpreting such rates because of data underreporting. According to IOM estimates, only about 5% of known errors are ever reported, and they are almost always reported by providers. As stated earlier, the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act (2005)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1084822312465748">9</xref></sup> was introduced in the United States to stimulate increased error reporting through the creation of the PSOs.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that creating more user-friendly and intuitive reporting tools, such as the one described here, will help increase reporting rates and provide more opportunities to learn about common medical errors and what can be done to reduce their number and harm to patients.</p>

<title>Pilot test of computer simulated interface</title>
<p>This approach has been presented at a number of conferences attended by various stakeholders and has received very enthusiastic responses. Our preliminary experiences of engaging lay persons with this visual system have also been very encouraging. These experiences have led us to pursue future designs with touch screen technology.</p>
<p>Our patient-centered holistic approach has resulted in development of a number of tools for wider engagement of all stakeholders as described below:</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1084822312465748">
<title>Development of macro-model of patient engagement for safe care</title>
<p>We constructed a conceptual “stage” for a never ending cycle of building knowledge base, engagement, and empowerment of patients with information technology (IT).</p>
<p>The stage is designed to meet patients’ needs for better safety-based quality and value. Overall, the stage aims to maximize consumer and community understanding and awareness through IT and media. On the center stage, with six backdrops of health care reform, are the key diverse members of the health care team performers. They need to be enabled and empowered to deliver their parts. The backdrops on the stage include partnerships for patients, primary care medical home, patient protection and Affordable Care Act, consumer operation oriented planning, meaningful use of HIT, and seeking value. Acting on the stage are several factors. “Central characters” on this stage are shown in communication with “audience” and surrounding community. An accessible database will be formed, and the “audience” of providers and other stakeholders will engage patients as team members, inviting reports on experiences of incidents. Prompt acknowledgement and description of intervention proposed for safety improvements will compel an understandable report to be sent back to consumers about safety improvements.</p>
<p>In short, patients and families are placed on the center stage with the backdrops, such as the Affordable Care Act. Engagement and feedback is provided, which causes improvement intervention design and progress tracking. Finally, IT and media are used to maximize consumer and community awareness and understanding.</p>

<sec id="section14-1084822312465748">
<title>Development of micro-models of health care settings</title>
<p>These micro-models portray (a) all the entities (e.g., doctor, patient, and her or his home) and (b) interactions between them (e.g., communication between patient and doctor). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1084822312465748">Figure 3</xref> shows an example of a primary care office micro-model. Each interaction is shown as an arrow. Errors or safety problems can originate at any or at multiple points within the system. This illustration of the system is an aid to greater understanding of the details and complexity of health care for patients. This approach has led to development of comprehensive lists of possible errors that can occur in each entity and interaction. Micro-models for other health care settings can easily be created.</p>

<title>Interactive patient-friendly and interactive reporting interface</title>
<p>This tool is called the Visual Error Reporting System (VERS). The macro-system and micro-system diagrams can be computerized to contain “hyperlinks” that can be used for dynamic links within databases.</p>
<p>For example, any point on the micro-system model can be linked electronically to a table containing relevant data about errors that are known to occur at that point in the system with details of frequency and consequences of these errors as well as corrective action recommended or used. These system models can also provide various other functions that the authors have described elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1084822312465748">5</xref></sup> The patient clicks on the appropriate item on the screen to indicate where the error occurred. Lists of possible errors in each of the links and entities are made available to patients to choose the appropriate one. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1084822312465748">Figure 4</xref> illustrates what the patients see and how they are helped with understanding the scope of reporting as well as choosing the appropriate error(s) throughout the system.</p>

<p>Furthermore, patients and all stakeholders need to understand the patterns of errors in the system. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1084822312465748">Figure 5</xref> shows the format developed for summarizing multiple errors using visual models—in this case, the micro-model of primary care is annotated to show the frequencies of errors reported at each point in the system.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Based on preliminary experiences, the VERS embedded in Visual Learning and Communication System (VLCS) concept appears to have potential for identification and reporting of errors as well as meaningful compilation and dissemination. The authors believe that the concept has great potential for patients to (a) help prevent adverse events in the first place, (b) detect errors, (c) ameliorate their effects, and (d) empower patients to propose interventions for safety improvement. It can be particularly helpful in reducing the age, income, ethnicity, race, and related disadvantages through its use of a universal “language,” which in turn should lead to greater patient satisfaction. The VERS should contribute to enriching meaningful use of HIT in other health care settings as well.</p>
<p>The VERS reminds the error reporter of the processes that are in place, his or her role in them, problems that may occur, contributors that might be present, and consequences that can occur, thereby improving situational awareness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1084822312465748">21</xref></sup> and aiding narration of the “story.” In other words, the visual models and associated drop-down lists have the potential to help create a common vision of the system. Furthermore, the authors suggest that a visual format can facilitate information sharing with team members and other stakeholders (especially patients and families) and has the potential to enhance the understanding of events, thus facilitating the development of preventive strategies.</p>
<p>Another practical benefit is that this visual reporting approach allows the user to code the error while reporting it. This contrasts with conventional reporting systems using existing taxonomies, which require considerable time and effort to dissect written error reports and code them. Individual health care settings wishing to collect and understand local error data generally cannot afford the time and effort required to manually code errors using alphanumeric taxonomies, nor are they likely to have the expertise to do so.</p>
<p>Further work is needed to fully “operationalize” the concepts described here and to evaluate the usability of the visual interface and its potential benefits. In order for the process to be used across all health care settings and internationally, it would be necessary to create visual diagrams of other systems. The authors are beginning to create standardized icons for the whole range of entities in the various settings of the health care system. A touch-screen aided visual reporting system and taxonomy has a great potential that needs to be implemented. Formal comparative effectiveness studies of VERS versus traditional text-based patient reporting systems need to be carried out. The authors aspire to acquire financial support for advancing this important work in hand.</p>
