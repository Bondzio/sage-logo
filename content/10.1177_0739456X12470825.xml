<p>“In the 1960s and early 1970s,” Clarissa Rile Hayward and Todd Swanstrom contend in their introduction to <italic>Justice and the American Metropolis</italic>, “social justice concerns [indignation over existing racial inequalities and residential segregation] were central to debates about urban policy in this country” (p. 3). Today, however, although residential segregation stubbornly persists (and is increasing, particularly along economic lines), and although residential segregation makes it harder to address other problems “like poverty, unemployment, crime, and educational disadvantage,” the public discourse is largely silent on issues of justice (p. 223). As Richard Thompson Ford argues in his chapter (“The Color of Territory: How Law and Borders Keep America Segregated”), “anyone with an ounce of compassion deplores this situation. But most people have pretty much given up on trying to fix it” (p. 224).</p>
<p>Why? The editors suggest this stems, to a certain degree, from shifting national attitudes—from a more socialist mindset to a more individualistic or market-oriented one. More importantly, though, it reflects the fact that injustice today is “<italic>thick injustice</italic>: . . . deep and densely concentrated, as well as opaque and relatively intractable . . . difficult to see and difficult to assign responsibility for it—and hence difficult to change” (p. 4). More than ever, <italic>place</italic>—the communities in which we live, through which we receive local services (most importantly educational services), and from which we access employment—“powerfully shapes what [we] can do and what [we] can be” (p. 15). And while where we live appears to be the result of our own personal choices and preferences, because these decisions are filtered through “faulty institutional structures” (the legacy of the overtly discriminatory practices of the past and several seemingly race-neutral discriminatory practices of the present), the decisions only reinforce segregated residential patterns and the unjust distribution of resources and opportunity (p. 42).</p>
<p>This conclusion is reinforced by a collection of thoughtful essays, which describe the (local, state, and federal) government programs and policies that shape our communities; the groups (residents, nonresidents, developers, business coalitions, etc.) who hold sway over government officials; how political clout is divided between those groups; and shifting popular expectations of and for public spaces and the built environment. Several chapters grapple with the ongoing effects of the explicitly discriminatory practices of the past, including unequal access to homeownership, home financing, quality schools, and economic opportunity. And several chapters describe the current generation of seemingly race-neutral (but in effect discriminatory) practices: land use policies, the practice of paying for local services out of locally raised tax revenue, and residency requirements for accessing and voting for local services.</p>
<p>This shift—from directly discriminatory rules and regulations to indirectly discriminatory ones—is exactly what has <italic>thickened</italic> injustice in American metropolitan areas. As a result, the book dedicates a lot of room to shedding light on the linkages between these apparently benign practices and residential segregation. To summarize, municipalities, empowered to determine which land uses (small-lot or large-lot single-family homes, multifamily residences, etc.) are permissible within their borders, can establish a price of entry (the cost of local housing) into their community, and make it out-of-reach for lower-income (or even moderate-income) households. Since municipalities must ensure that their residents provide sufficient tax revenue to cover necessary services, they have “an overwhelming incentive” to attract higher-income households (likely to increase property values and require few public services) and to exclude lower-income households (considered likely to depress property values and require more public services) (p. 234). And the uneven playing field between lower-income households, who have little ability to move, and higher-income households, who have substantial ability to “shop” the municipal marketplace for a locality likely to provide only the goods and services they need, only exacerbates this tendency (pp. 44–45).</p>
<p>These “background rules,” then, “are a fail-safe recipe for racially [and economically] segregated neighborhoods” (p. 231). They largely escape the blame for doing so, though—to such a degree that these rules have consistently been <italic>reinforced</italic> (rather than overturned) by the courts and public officials. Economic segregation makes the plight of the poor far less visible to higher-income households; our decentralized approach to service delivery makes the needs of the poor someone else’s problem. Even more challenging, these rules simultaneously build their own (witting and unwitting) base of support along the way. Any efforts to redistribute resources will run right into the “stakeholders in inequality,” those suburban homeowners who are “hugely invested in separate schooling and the other advantages that flow from class sorting,” regardless of their political or moral beliefs (pp. 41, 53). It is not surprising, then, that Thad Williamson, in his case study of Richmond (Virginia), found that “challenging fundamental structural inequalities is simply off the political table” (p. 193).</p>
<p>While this would seem to make fixing the situation a hopeless cause, <italic>Justice and the American Metropolis</italic> should nevertheless be required reading for planners and planning students for two important reasons. First, the authors are right to point a finger at planning and planners as at least partly to blame for today’s thick injustice. The field’s thinking of place in largely physical terms (with redevelopment schemes emphasizing the layout and design of buildings but typically underplaying the importance of residents’ upward mobility and access to opportunity), but thinking of neighborhood strength in largely social terms (with “slums” and “blighted neighborhoods” identified as much, if not more, by their residents than the condition of their housing), has doubly hurt poorer and minority individuals.</p>
<p>Second, on a positive note, planners are likely the best suited to insist that social justice be the lens through which policies and programs be evaluated; to make justice “a touchstone for policy initiatives” (p. 170). Doing so would likely run counter to our current political culture that strives for immediate and tangible results and prioritizes individual autonomy over collective responsibility. And doing so would likely run counter to the motivations of local officials, who are too often “seeking the glory of bringing in a team or cutting the ribbon before the new convention facility” at the expense of investments that would improve the lives and neighborhoods of lower-income and minority residents (p. 165).</p>
<p>So what can planners do to meaningfully change the status quo? For one thing, we can act “as subversives—that is, as agents fighting against the dominant logic of the existing political-economic system” (p. 186). For another, we can challenge the conventional wisdom around structural inequalities, an excellent example of which is Douglas Rae’s chapter (“Two Cheers for Very Unequal Incomes: Toward Social Justice in Central Cities”). Standing up for cities with extreme income inequality (which are routinely criticized), Rae argues that “it is good to have inequality <italic>within</italic> the central city because it would otherwise fall <italic>between</italic> that central city” and its suburbs (p. 105). The “champions of income inequality” happen to be the nation’s most dynamic cities and, even more importantly, are the best equipped “to achieve specific success in pursuit of social justice” and “to manage the city-suburban coalitions so important to legislative success at the state level” (p. 119).</p>
<p>Also, planners can work to ensure that the field’s own initiatives and approaches meaningfully achieve social justice ends. Susan Fainstein and Loren King both explain how urban redevelopment too often “exacerbates inequalities, marginalizes vulnerable residents, and largely excludes from political influence a range of residents and organizations” (pp. 70, 149–50, 157–58). King also quotes David Harvey’s critique of New Urbanism, an approach he sees as largely ignoring the needs (and communities) of the poor. And Margaret Kohn describes how far the field has fallen in our approach to public spaces—once celebrated for their inclusivity and diversity and as essential building-blocks for a democratic society, now proposed and designed “usually to attract tourist dollars” instead (p. 98).</p>
<p>Why are issues of social justice so important <italic>now</italic>? <italic>Justice and the American Metropolis</italic> comes at a time when the gap between the haves and have-nots is larger than ever, and when this gap is increasingly reflected in the places we live. (The percentage of American families living in either mostly low-income or mostly affluent neighborhoods has increased significantly since the 1970s, while the percentage living in middle-income neighborhoods has declined.) The “demographic and economic changes of the past two decades have not tempered the inequalities of the older political-spatial system: in important respects, they have exacerbated those problems” (p. 252). The evolving “geography of need”—a reflection of how most poor people and most minority individuals now live in suburbs rather than cities and how the Great Recession and housing market collapse have brought property disinvestment and abandonment to boom towns—has “altered the nature of the problems associated with inequalities and, as such, calls for new kinds of solutions” (pp. 238, 252).</p>
<p>It will take planners’ expertise to understand and quantify and map this new distribution of strengths and weaknesses and to solicit feedback from area residents (particularly those most marginalized by the political process), and to design solutions. This is probably as big a challenge for the field, and as much of what will shape its next chapter, as attempts to help legacy cities right-size themselves or create sustainable regions.</p>
