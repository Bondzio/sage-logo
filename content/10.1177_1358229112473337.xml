            <p>Since the founding of the United Nations in 1945, the human rights normative framework pertaining to persons with disabilities has expanded exponentially. In terms of international public policy, it is now recognised that discrimination against persons with disabilities is a violation of the inherent dignity and worth of the human person. This paper proposes to examine those human rights which such persons now enjoy specifically in relation to the human right to education. The first part of the paper will provide a historical overview of the systematic development of the recognition of the educational rights of persons with disabilities under the auspices of the United Nations, with particular emphasis upon the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1358229112473337">Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989</xref> and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1358229112473337">Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 2006</xref>. Brief mention will also be made of the recognition of such rights under regional human rights systems. Other non-binding UN instruments such as the World Programme of Action concerning Disabled Persons 1982 and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1358229112473337">Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities 1993</xref> will also be analysed. The second part of the article will then consider how these international standards have been adopted and applied in Australian law and policy. It will specifically consider the relevant provisions of the Commonwealth of Australia’s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1358229112473337">Disability Discrimination Act 1992</xref> and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1358229112473337">Disability Standards for Education 2005</xref> which have been enacted thereunder as well as case-law of Australian courts.</p>
            <p>The aims of this article are threefold: (i) to identify and discuss impediments to the fuller realisation of the educational rights of persons with disabilities; (ii) to compare and contrast the extent and impact of the international and national legal recognition and protection afforded to persons with disabilities in the educational context; and (iii) to identify strategies for securing more effective implementation of the right to education of persons with disabilities. While the UN has excelled in formulating relevant and noble treaty obligations and aspirational principles in this area, the author argues that the next developmental stage must systematically address practical measures which can deliver meaningful and objectively verifiable progress in the monitoring and implementation of these rights. While international human rights law has long influenced legislative initiatives and policy development in UN Member States, it is the author’s contention that, in this particular field, UN treaty-monitoring bodies can equally and reciprocally be informed by relevant State practice including that offered by the Australian experience.</p>
            <p>[T]he physical and mental handicaps which affect millions of children all over the world ought also to be given particular attention, for it is essential, both for moral and for economic reasons, that such children, to whom fate has been unkind but who are perfectly capable of overcoming their handicaps, should not be excluded from the life of society; they have a right to an education adapted to their situation.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>It is estimated that there are 500–650 million persons with disabilities (approximately 10% of the world’s population), 150 million of whom are children. Sadly, many of the causes of disability, such as armed conflict, illness, disease and poverty, are preventable. More than 80% live in developing countries with access to very limited services. The majority of children with disabilities residing in developing countries remain out of school and are functionally illiterate. Often the extent of the disability is aggravated and the period during which it is suffered is prolonged because of a lack of early/timely intervention.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1358229112473337">1</xref>
            </sup> The United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has observed that ‘The effects of disability-based discrimination have been particularly severe in the fields of [<italic>inter alia</italic>] education’.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1358229112473337">2</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>The term ‘disability’ encompasses a significant number of different functional limitations. People may suffer disability through physical, intellectual, mental or sensory impairment or through medical conditions, either transitory or permanent in nature, resulting in hearing, sight or speech problems. Various international human rights instruments have attempted to define the term ‘disability’. For example, Paragraph 1 of the <italic>Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons </italic>proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly in Resolution 3447 (XXX) of 9 December 1975 defines the term ‘disabled person’ as ‘any person unable to ensure by himself of herself, wholly or partly, the necessities of a normal individual and/or social life, as a result of deficiency, either congenital or not, in his or her physical or mental capabilities.’<sup>
               <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1358229112473337">3</xref>
            </sup> For the purposes of the United Nations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1358229112473337">
               <italic>Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 2006</italic>
            </xref>, ‘persons with disabilities’ is defined in Article 1 thereof ‘to <italic>include</italic> those who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.’<sup>
               <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1358229112473337">4</xref>
            </sup> Indeed, preambular paragraph (e) of the <italic>Disabilities Convention </italic>recognises disability as a dynamic and ‘evolving concept’ and that ‘disability results from the interaction between persons with impairments and attitudinal and environmental barriers that hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.’</p>
         <p>The concept of education can be variously defined. Education occurs in its widest sense in the interaction of the individual with the social and natural environment to which he or she belongs. Education can be defined in the broad sense to encompass ‘all activities by which a human group transmits to its descendants a body of knowledge and skills and a moral code which enable that group to subsist’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1358229112473337">M’Bow, 1979</xref>: 11). In this sense, then, education is primarily concerned with the transmission to the younger generation of the skills necessary to effectively undertake the tasks of daily living and with the inculcation of the social, cultural, religious and philosophical values held by the particular community.</p>
         <p>Education can, in turn, be more narrowly defined to refer to formal or professional ‘instruction imparted within a national, provincial or local education system, whether public or private’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1358229112473337">M’Bow, 1979</xref>: 11). It is generally the case that the term ‘education’ is used in international instruments to refer to formal institutional instruction. For example, the General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has defined the term ‘education’ for the purposes of its <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1358229112473337">
               <italic>Convention against Discrimination in Education 1960</italic>
            </xref> to mean ‘all types and levels of [formal] education, and includes access to education, the standard and quality of education, and the conditions under which it is given’.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1358229112473337">5</xref>
            </sup> The European Court of Human Rights has distinguished education in its wide sense from education in its narrow sense in the following terms:</p>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>[education in the wider sense refers to] the whole process whereby, in any society, adults endeavour to transmit their beliefs, culture and other values to the young, whereas teaching or instruction refers in particular to the transmission of knowledge and to intellectual development.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1358229112473337">6</xref>
               </sup>
            </p>
         </disp-quote>
         <p>For the purposes of this paper, ‘education’ will refer to state-sponsored and taxpayer-funded formal teaching or institutional instruction, as well as private sector education, comprising the pre-primary, primary (elementary), secondary and tertiary levels of education as well as adult education. Education in both its wider and narrower meanings is particularly important for laying the foundations for the meaningful participation of persons with disabilities in society throughout their lives. Indeed, Article 13(1) of the United Nations <italic>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1358229112473337">International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 1966</xref>
            </italic>
            <sup>
               <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1358229112473337">7</xref>
            </sup> explicitly acknowledges that one of the key outcomes of education is to ‘enable <italic>all</italic> persons to participate effectively in a free society’ (emphasis added).</p>
         <p>This article will begin by tracing the recent historical development of the human right to education as it has been applied to persons with disabilities under international human rights law, particularly under United Nations auspices since 1945. The normative framework contained in both legally binding international treaties and non-binding aspirational or programmatic principles found in various international declarations will be examined and compared with, and contrasted with, the manner in which the Commonwealth of Australia has attempted to proscribe disability-based discrimination in education through the enactment of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1358229112473337">
               <italic>Disability Discrimination Act 1992</italic>
            </xref> and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1358229112473337">
               <italic>Disability Standards for Education 2005</italic>
            </xref>. Specific concepts such as ‘reasonable adjustment’ and ‘unjustifiable hardship’ will be analysed in this context. Various obstacles to the fuller realisation of the educational rights of persons with disabilities will be identified and relevant issues discussed. This will include whether the apparent trend towards greater integration and inclusion of persons with disabilities in the educational process can ever be displaced and, if so, in what limited circumstances, without infringing such rights. The concluding section will consider how the educational rights of persons with disabilities may be better implemented, as well as the potential for the Australian law and policy in this area to inform and shape the pronouncements of UN treaty monitoring bodies which deal directly with these issues.</p>

Article 25(1) provides in part that ‘[e]veryone has the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control’. Nevertheless, Article 26(1) proclaims that ‘[e]veryone has the right to education’, which must be read in conjunction with Article 2, which prohibits discrimination in the enjoyment of the rights recognised in the <italic>Universal Declaration </italic>on the grounds of ‘race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth <italic>or other status</italic>’.<sup>

Article 13(1) thereof recites that ‘[t]he States Parties to the present Covenant recognize the right of <italic>everyone </italic>to education’, that ‘education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and the sense of its dignity’ and that ‘education shall enable all persons to participate effectively in a free society’.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1358229112473337">13</xref>
               </sup> That the right to education extends to persons with disabilities is made clear not only by the use of the word ‘everyone’ but by the reference in Article 2(2) of the <italic>ICESCR</italic> to the guarantee undertaken by States Parties concerning the enjoyment of the rights contained in the <italic>Covenant </italic>without discrimination on several enumerated grounds including ‘or other status’. Nevertheless, the United Nations and various non-governmental organisations were not content with such broadly stated principles, which lacked a specific contextual application to persons with disabilities. At its 1968 International Congress in Jerusalem, the International League of Societies for the Mentally Handicapped proclaimed a <italic>Declaration of General and Special Rights of the Mentally Retarded. </italic>A consensus emerged among non-governmental organisations that specific declarations should complement universal and general declarations and conventions. Specifically defined and tailored rights of persons with disabilities contained in the former were in addition to, and not in lieu of, general human rights contained in the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1358229112473337">Herr, 1980</xref>). This appears to have been the driving force behind the promulgation by the United Nations of the <italic>Declaration on the Rights of Mentally Retarded Persons</italic>, proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly in Resolution 2856 (XXVI) of 20 December 1971, and the <italic>Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons</italic>, proclaimed by the General Assembly in Resolution 3447 (XXX) of 9 December 1975.</p>
            <p>Although the 1971 and 1975 <italic>Declarations </italic>were not legally binding as a matter of international or municipal law, they did have powers of moral and political suasion, which were used effectively by lobby groups in the 1970s and 1980s to secure important national policy changes.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1358229112473337">14</xref>
               </sup> Both the 1971 and 1975 <italic>Declarations </italic>were underpinned by a desire to assist mentally retarded and disabled persons to develop their abilities in various fields and to promote their integration as far as possible in normal life and society. Both <italic>Declarations </italic>sought to elaborate upon earlier human rights standards in the form of a set of minimum guidelines to inform national policy-making, and to provide a firmer foundation for the international evolution of even more detailed (and eventually binding) standards. Paragraph 2 of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1358229112473337">
                  <italic>Declaration on the Rights of Mentally Retarded Persons 1971</italic>
               </xref> stated that ‘[t]he mentally retarded person has a right to such education, training, rehabilitation and guidance as will enable him to develop his ability and maximum potential’. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1358229112473337">
                  <italic>Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons 1975</italic>
               </xref> builds upon the 1971 <italic>Declaration. </italic>It prescribes in somewhat more detail the entitlements of disabled persons to measures that will ‘enable them to become as self-reliant as possible’ (Paragraph 5). Paragraph 6 of the 1975 <italic>Declaration </italic>recognises the right of disabled persons to ‘education, vocational training and rehabilitation, aid, counselling, placement services and other services which will enable them to develop their capabilities and skills to the maximum and will hasten the processes of social integration or reintegration’.</p>

            <title>The post-declaratory framework of programmatic and aspirational principles</title>
            <p>The importance of the integration of the disabled person within the community was reaffirmed by the Conference on the Legal Protection of the Rights of the Child held in Warsaw, Poland, in January 1979. Principle 7 of the <italic>Official Statement of Principles </italic>adopted by the Conference articulated the view that, ‘[a]lthough it is desirable to provide special educational facilities for children who are exceptional either in their talents or in their handicaps, it is important that their education should, so far as possible, be integrated with that of other children’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1358229112473337">Stone, 1979</xref>). This approach reflected that taken by UNESCO in its adoption of the <italic>Revised Recommendation concerning Technical and Vocational Education 1974</italic>, which suggested that vocational and technical education should be available to disadvantaged and disabled persons in a manner which caters for their needs and facilitates an easier integration into society.<sup>

            </p>
            <p>The 1980s witnessed a renaissance in the development of the rights of persons with disabilities, including their educational rights. In 1976, the United Nations General Assembly had designated 1981 as the International Year of Disabled Persons (IYDP). The authorising resolution<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1358229112473337">16</xref>
               </sup> declared ‘full participation and equality’ as the year’s central theme. It set down a number of objectives to be carried out during the IYDP, including the promotion of ‘efforts to provide disabled people with proper assistance, training, care and guidance’, the education of the public concerning the rights of disabled persons, and the implementation of the 1971 and 1975 <italic>Declarations. </italic>The Advisory Committee on the IYDP issued recommendations on measures that UN Member States might adopt, and urged the review of existing legislation ‘to eliminate possible discriminatory practices regarding the education and employment of disabled persons’.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1358229112473337">17</xref>
               </sup>
            </p>
            <p>The most important outcome of the IYDP, however, was the adoption of the <italic>World Programme of Action concerning Disabled Persons </italic>(WPA) by the United Nations General Assembly in its Resolution 37/52 of 3 December 1982. The purposes of the WPA included, <italic>inter alia</italic>, the realisation of the goals of full and equal participation of disabled persons in social life and development. General Assembly Resolution 37/53 of 3 December 1982 proclaimed the period 1983–1992 as the United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons – a long-term plan of action to implement the WPA. The WPA is essentially a global strategy directed towards the equalisation of opportunities for persons with disabilities, emphasising the need to approach disability from a human rights perspective. In the educational context, the WPA observed that, although persons with disabilities had the same right to education as non-disabled persons, numerous problems prevented the former group from more fully realising such right, including:<list list-type="bullet">

               </list>The WPA also addressed the finely balanced question of integrated instruction within a regular school setting versus individualised instruction through intensive special education programmes. A ‘presumption of integration’, however, dominates the observations and recommendations of the WPA, as is evidenced in the following passage:</p>
            <disp-quote>
               <p>Societies sometimes cater only to people who are in full possession of all their physical and mental faculties. They have to recognize the fact that there will always be a number of people with impairments and disabilities, and that societies have to identify and remove obstacles to their full participation. Thus, whenever pedagogically possible, education should take place in the ordinary school system. (See the second paragraph of the section entitled ‘Equalization of Opportunities’).</p>
            </disp-quote>
            <p>Accordingly, in order to achieve a policy of striving towards equalising educational opportunities available to persons with disabilities, their education should, as far as possible, take place in the general school system,<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1358229112473337">18</xref>
               </sup> and laws concerning compulsory education should include children with all ranges of disabilities, including the most severely disabled.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1358229112473337">19</xref>
               </sup> Significantly, however, the WPA acknowledged that, if, for some reason, the facilities of the general school system are inadequate for some uniquely or severely disabled children, schooling for these children should then be provided for an appropriate period of time in special facilities and programmes which can offer a quality of education equal to that of the general school system. Whether within an integrated or individualised and specialised teaching environment, the WPA urged the development of ‘individualized’ educational services ‘based on the assessed needs mutually agreed upon by authorities, administrators, parents and disabled students and leading to clearly stated curriculum goals and short term objectives which are regularly reviewed and where necessary revised’ (See the third paragraph of the section entitled ‘Education and Training’ in ‘Proposals for the Implementation of the World Programme of Action concerning Disabled Persons’).

That Meeting recommended that the UN General Assembly convene a special conference to draft an international convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against persons with disabilities, to be ratified by States by the end of the Decade in 1992. Despite two attempts by the General Assembly at its forty-second and forty-fourth sessions to settle on a draft of the proposed convention, no consensus could be reached on the suitability of such a convention.<sup>

            </sup> and requires States Parties to take special measures to ensure the rights of children with disabilities. The first three sub-articles of Article 23 relate specifically to children with disabilities and read as follows:</p>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>States Parties recognize that a mentally or physically disabled child should enjoy a full and decent life, in conditions which ensure dignity, promote self-reliance, and facilitate the child’s active participation in the community.</p>
         </disp-quote>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>States Parties recognize the right of the disabled child to special care and shall encourage and ensure the extension, subject to available resources, to the eligible child and those responsible for his or her care, of assistance for which application is made and which is appropriate to the child’s condition and to the circumstances of the parents or others caring for the child.</p>
         </disp-quote>

         </disp-quote>
         <p>Like the previous instruments already referred to, Article 23 emphasises social integration and individual development. It does succeed in enhancing the legal protection of the rights of disabled children as, prior to the adoption of the <italic>Convention on the Rights of the Child</italic>, there existed relatively few binding international standards in this area.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1358229112473337">25</xref>
            </sup> Nevertheless, several deficiencies can be identified. First, the combined effect of sub-articles (2) and (3) of Article 23 is such that the disabled child’s right to education is subject to available State resources and shall be provided free of charge ‘whenever possible, taking into account the financial resources of the parents or others caring for the child’. A revised Polish draft of what is now Article 23, supported by Canada and the USSR, had unsuccessfully proposed that the special educational needs of disabled children should be provided free of charge.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1358229112473337">26</xref>
            </sup> Second, as one leading commentator in the children’s rights field has observed, it is unfortunate that the <italic>Convention on the Rights of the Child </italic>fails to impose on States Parties a legal obligation either to promote or to deliver pre-school educational services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1358229112473337">Van Bueren, 1995</xref>: 359). Through the combined operation of Articles 2(1) and 28(1) of the <italic>Convention</italic>, a disabled child has an equal right of access to education only as from the primary school level.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1358229112473337">27</xref>
            </sup> As the same commentator has pointed out, pre-school education is important for children with disabilities, as it can be used for the early identification of impairment or learning difficulties and as a method for involving parents in the educational process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1358229112473337">Van Bueren, 1995</xref>: 359). Likewise the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the treaty-monitoring body operating under the <italic>Convention on the Rights of the Child</italic>, has recognised the importance of early childhood education in the following terms:</p>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>Early childhood education is of particular relevance for children with disabilities as often their disabilities and special needs are first recognized in these institutions. Early intervention is of utmost importance to help children to develop their full potential. If a child is identified as having a disability or developmental delay at an early stage, the child has much better opportunities to benefit from early childhood education which should be designed to respond to her or his individual needs.<sup>

               <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1358229112473337">29</xref>
            </sup> Article 28 essentially ensures to all children, on the bases of non-discrimination and equality of opportunity, the right to education, which includes a compulsory and free primary education, access to general and vocational secondary education, and access to higher education on the basis of capacity. Pursuant to Article 29, the child’s education is to be directed to, <italic>inter alia</italic>, the development of the child’s personality, talents and mental and physical abilities to their fullest potential as well as the child’s preparation for responsible life in a free society.<sup>

            </sup> The Committee has further advocated that education for career development and vocational skills should also be included in the school curriculum for children with disabilities during the years of compulsory education. In the Committee’s view, the development of career awareness and vocational skills as early as possible enables children to make better choices later in life in terms of employment. In those countries where compulsory education does not go beyond the elementary school years, vocational training beyond elementary school should, in the Committee’s view, be mandatory for children with disabilities.<sup>

         <p>The specific objectives of the <italic>Convention </italic>are the further equalisation of opportunities for persons with disabilities and the elimination of all forms of discrimination against them.

It is clear that the use of the phrase ‘which has the purpose or effect’ in that definition is intended to catch both direct discrimination and indirect discrimination whereby, in relation to the latter, the policy or practice, although neutral on its face and not blatantly discriminatory, is nonetheless discriminatory in its effect and/or application. The term ‘reasonable accommodation’ is defined in turn in Article 2 to mean ‘necessary and appropriate modification and adjustments not imposing a disproportionate or undue burden, where needed in a particular case, to ensure to persons with disabilities the enjoyment or exercise on an equal basis with others of all human rights.’<sup>

            </italic>, implementation of the human right to education for persons with disabilities is progressive in nature and requires positive State action. States Parties to the <italic>ICESCR </italic>are also obligated to improve the existing conditions concerning education to the maximum of their available resources. This is made clear by Article 2(1) of the <italic>ICESCR</italic>, which provides that ‘[e]ach State Party undertakes to take steps, individually and through international assistance and co-operation, to the maximum of its available resources, with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights recognized in the present Covenant by all appropriate means.’ These treaty provisions have particularly in mind the economies of developing States, whose financial resources and revenue are comparatively limited. In conceding a margin of appreciation, as it were, the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the <italic>ICESCR</italic> monitoring body, has rejected the notion that the implementation of these rights, including the right to education, may be deferred indefinitely. The Committee has insisted that the obligation to ‘take steps’ is a serious and solemn one and that the poverty of States is not a valid reason for inaction, since diligent governments should solicit resources from the international community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1358229112473337">Thornberry, 1994</xref>: 10, 11).

Principle 23 provides that ‘[t]he obligation of progressive achievement exists independently of the increase in resources; it requires effective use of resources available’. Principle 25 acknowledges that ‘States parties are obligated, regardless of the level of economic development, to ensure respect for minimum subsistence rights for all’. It is arguable that fundamental education – literacy, numeracy and basic life skills – would be considered a minimum subsistence right and, as such, must be given sufficient priority in terms of the governmental allocation of finite resources. It is submitted that these observations of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and <italic>The Limburg Principles </italic>should apply with equal force and relevance to persons with disabilities in the educational context and to the resource-dependent obligation assumed by States Parties under Article 4(2) of the <italic>Disabilities Convention. </italic>This is critical in light of the fact that the majority of persons with disabilities reside in developing countries.<sup>

         <p>The clear thrust of Article 24 is towards an inclusive education system for persons with disabilities as well as reasonable accommodation of their individual requirements. During the deliberations of the Working Group, different approaches were taken in articulating the relationship between the provision of specialist education services and the general education system. Some members of the Working Group considered that the education of children with disabilities in the general education system should be the rule, and the provision of specialist education services the exception. Other members considered that specialist education services should not only be provided where the general education system is inadequate, but rather be made available at all times without a presumption that one approach was more desirable than the other. The overall intent appears to be to ensure that the general education system and specialist education services are not mutually exclusive options, and that there is a range of intermediate options available. Some members of the Working Group, for example, emphasised the need for deaf and blind children to be allowed to be educated in their own groups and there was general support at the Sixth Session that children with particularly debilitating disabilities, such as blind, deaf and deafblind children, may need to commence their learning in an environment that is more specific and tailored to their needs in order to allow them to subsequently gain maximum benefit from a fully inclusive general education system.<sup>

         <disp-quote>
            <p>Inclusiveness in education is a rights-based approach to education, i.e. the right of a student to have equal access to education. Its proponents argue that inclusion is concerned with the protection of human rights for all students. Inclusion represents a philosophical shift from related practices such as ‘mainstreaming’ and ‘integration’ where the focus is on placing students with disabilities in mainstream settings with the aspiration that all students would benefit from the experience. Inclusion places a focus on the quality of the participation of the student with disabilities and involves welcoming students with disabilities as full members of the group and values that student for their contribution. In the context of disability discrimination, inclusiveness embraces the notion that separation of students by reason of differences arising out of their disability is detrimental not only to the student with a disability but also to all other participants in the education institution as well.</p>

         <p>The Committee on the Rights of the Child has essentially taken a ‘functional capacity’ approach to inclusive education for disabled children. The form and degree of inclusion are to be determined by the educational needs of each individual child, since the education of some children requires support and resources which may not be readily available in the regular school system.<sup>

         <p>The views of the Committee on the Rights of the Child on the provision of inclusive education to disabled children were published in 2006 and were no doubt significantly influenced by both the <italic>Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities </italic>which were adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1993 and by the then imminent adoption of the <italic>Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities </italic>by the General Assembly, which occurred on 13 December 2006. Rule 6 of the <italic>Standard Rules </italic>generally espouses a philosophy of ‘integrated education’ of persons with disabilities. Sub-rules (8) and (9) of Rule 6 of the <italic>Standard Rules </italic>deal specifically with special education, respectively providing as follows:</p>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>In situations where the general school system does not yet adequately meet the needs of all persons with disabilities, special education may be considered. It should be aimed at preparing students for education in the general school system. The quality of such education should reflect the same standards and ambitions as general education and should be closely linked to it. At a minimum, students with disabilities should be afforded the same portion of educational resources as students without disabilities. States should aim for the gradual integration of special education services into mainstream education. It is acknowledged that in some circumstances special education may currently be considered to be the most appropriate form of education for some students with disabilities.</p>
         </disp-quote>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>Owing to the particular communication needs of deaf and deaf/blind persons, their education may be more suitably provided in schools for such persons or special classes and units in mainstream schools. At the initial stage, in particular, special attention needs to be focused on culturally sensitive instruction that will result in effective communication skills and maximum independence for people who are deaf or deaf/blind.</p>
         </disp-quote>
         <p>Sub-rules (8) and (9) thus establish integration as the rule rather than the exception. Special education is considered as preparing students at an early stage for mainstream education and as a temporary and transitional expedient pending economic and material restructuring. The trend, however, is towards the gradual integration of special educational services into mainstream education. There may be one exception, however. Pending the development of new technologies and techniques, special education may continue to be the only viable option for the most severely disabled, including the deaf and the deaf/blind.<sup>

As the Committee on the Rights of the Child has observed, it is crucial that education of a child with a disability includes making sure that the child feels that he or she is respected by others as a human being. Inclusion of the child with a disability in a group of classroom children can show the child that he or she has a recognised identity and belongs to the community of learners.<sup>

In general terms, an education provider is required to make admission, enrolment and participation decisions on the basis that ‘reasonable adjustments’ will be made where necessary to enable the student with disability to be treated on the same basis as a student without the disability. Nevertheless, only an adjustment which is reasonable in the circumstances is required to be made.

            <p>The <italic>Education Standards </italic>have foreshadowed that a detailed assessment by an independent expert may be required in order to determine what adjustments are necessary for a student.<sup>

               </sup> There is no requirement under the <italic>Standards</italic>, therefore, to make any adjustment which is assessed to be ‘unreasonable’ through an application of the above-mentioned criteria. If deemed unreasonable, that is the end of the matter and the education provider need take no further action. If, however, the adjustment has been assessed to be reasonable, it is open to the education provider to then raise the defence of unjustifiable hardship. As we shall later see, Paragraph 10.2 of the <italic>Standards </italic>provides that it is not unlawful for an education provider to fail to comply with a requirement of the <italic>Standards </italic>if, and to the extent that, compliance would impose unjustifiable hardship on the provider. The concept of unreasonable adjustment is therefore technically different, both temporally and substantively, from the concept of unjustifiable hardship, although some of the criteria used to determine the reasonableness of the adjustment, as listed above, overlap somewhat with the criteria used to determine the issue of unjustifiable hardship under Section 11 of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1358229112473337">
                  <italic>Disability Discrimination Act 1992</italic>
               </xref>. Guthrie and Waldeck have explained in the following passage the operative contexts of the concepts of ‘reasonable adjustment’ and ‘unjustifiable hardship’ and their possible overlap:</p>
            <disp-quote>
               <p>[I]f there is non-compliance with an Education Standard the unlawful discrimination provision may be reactivated, so that the defence of unjustifiable hardship may also be relevant. In other words, consideration of these issues is a two-step process. Firstly, does the student with a disability require some form of adjustment to be made to facilities or services from an education provider, and if so is that adjustment reasonable. Secondly, if the adjustment is reasonable but the education provider has not made the adjustment, the provider may have a defence of unjustifiable hardship … [D]espite the apparent separation of these concepts there is likely to be some overlap between the two, particularly as the obligation for reasonable adjustment does require consideration of the cost of any adjustment, which is also a consideration for the defence of unjustifiable hardship.<sup>

            <p>Another important issue concerning the making of reasonable adjustments arises in the context of the retention of the academic integrity of the education provider’s courses and programmes. Paragraph 3.4(3) of the <italic>Standards </italic>provides that, in assessing whether an adjustment to the course or programme is reasonable, the provider is entitled to maintain the academic requirements of that course or programme. As an explanatory note to this provision states, a provider may continue to secure the integrity of its courses and programmes and assessment requirements in order to ensure that those on whom it confers a degree or award can present themselves as having the appropriate knowledge, experience and expertise implicit in the holding of that particular degree or award.<sup>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>Over the past 40 years or so, the United Nations has pursued a trinity of aims in evolving international standards on behalf of persons with disabilities: promoting their independence, equalising opportunities available to them, and ensuring their full participation within the wider community. These standards – both legally binding and aspirational – are primarily sourced in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1358229112473337">
               <italic>Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989</italic>

            </italic>. Noble and aspirational principles remain largely symbolic in value, however, unless and until they can be meaningfully translated into the delivery of tangible benefits for the intended beneficiaries.</p>
         <p>Such is the reality that the prosecution of these aims is highly resource-dependent in terms of both human and material resources. Indeed, the United Nations General Assembly has identified the ‘inadequate allocation of resources’ as ‘foremost’ among the major obstacles to the pursuit of these aims.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn124-1358229112473337">124</xref>
            </sup> The problem is compounded when one considers that the vast majority of persons who suffer from some form of serious impairment live in developing countries<sup>

In the context of children with disabilities, Article 23(4) of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1358229112473337">
               <italic>Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989</italic>

         <disp-quote>
            <p>States Parties shall promote in the spirit of international co-operation the dissemination of and access to information concerning methods of rehabilitation education and vocational services, with the aim of enabling States Parties to improve their capabilities and skills and to widen their experience in these areas. In this regard, account shall be taken of the needs of developing countries.</p>
         </disp-quote>
         <p>Article 32 of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1358229112473337">
               <italic>Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 2006</italic>
            </xref> is more prescriptive in articulating the obligation of States Parties to engage in international co-operation in meeting its obligations thereunder. Such co-operation extends beyond inter-State co-operation to also include partnership arrangements with international and regional organisations and civil society (particularly representative disability organisations). The modalities of such co-operation comprise, <italic>inter alia</italic>, exchange of information, training programmes and best practices, the provision of technical and economic assistance, and the sharing of accessible and assistive technologies. It is to be hoped that the States Parties to both Conventions, under the general co-ordination of UNESCO, UNICEF and the World Health Organization in consultation with leading non-governmental organisations working in the education and health care fields, and with appropriate guidance from the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, will strive to fulfil this obligation conscientiously and in good faith.</p>
         <p>Contemporary problems experienced by developed and developing States alike in the delivery of special education programmes for students with disabilities include an insufficient number of adequately trained special education teachers, lack of appropriate support staff, resource materials and facilities, inappropriate school placements and a failure to allocate the resources necessary to give disabled children opportunity within the educational system equal to that provided for non-disabled children. This may be counter-intuitive, bearing in mind the acknowledged untapped productive potential of persons with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1358229112473337">M’Bow, 1979</xref>: 1, 12, 13) and Rule 6(8) of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1358229112473337">
               <italic>Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities 1993</italic>
            </xref> which requires that ‘[a]t a minimum, students with disabilities should be afforded the same portion of educational resources as students without disabilities’. Even when enlightened legislatures have legislated to proscribe discrimination on the ground of impairment, they have left in place exemptions when admission of a disabled child to an educational institution would require provision of additional services or facilities which, in the circumstances, cannot reasonably be provided. Such exceptions to the operation of anti-discrimination legislation, if interpreted too generously and deferentially from the provider’s standpoint, provide scope for the denial of the disabled student’s right to education on the basis of such considerations as cost–benefit analyses and non-justiciable allocation of public resources (which generally have fallen beyond the scope of judicial review in many common law jurisdictions) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1358229112473337">Hayes and MacAlpine, 1986</xref>: 36). The concept of undue burden/unjustifiable hardship should be interpreted purposively in light of the preambular aims and objectives of the international instruments so that this concept is narrowly construed and strictly applied in order to avoid undermining the educational rights of persons with disabilities. Although <italic>realpolitik </italic>constrains the full realisation of economic, social and cultural rights generally, the <italic>Limburg Principles </italic>indicate that a lack of public resources should not be readily invoked as an excuse or expedient to explain away slow progress in meeting the educational rights and needs of persons with disabilities.</p>
         <p>Nevertheless, the interpretation and application of human rights do involve a balancing process between competing interests and considerations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1358229112473337">Hodgson, 2003</xref>). It is self-evident that the costs involved in setting up some special education programmes will have the effect of withdrawing funds from other educational programmes, thereby constituting a detriment to the intended student beneficiaries of those programmes. The drafters of both the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1358229112473337">
               <italic>Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 2006</italic>
            </xref> and the Australian <italic>Disability Discrimination Act 1992 </italic>have respectively acknowledged this through the explicit recognition of the distinct but related concepts of reasonable accommodation/reasonable adjustment and undue burden/unjustifiable hardship. One of the first challenges for the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities will be to strike the appropriate balance, in the course of its interpretational observations on the provisions of the <italic>Disabilities Convention </italic>and the interaction of these concepts, between the right of the disabled student to education and the extent of the obligations placed on educational providers and the State. While UN development of an international human rights normative framework has influenced legislative reform and policy development in many UN Member states over a long period, the experiences of some of these States in this particular area may well prove useful in turn in informing debate and influencing future thinking on how UN treaty-monitoring bodies elaborate upon the meaning of the substantive content of, and obligations inherent in, the standards and protections prescribed in the <italic>Disabilities Convention.</italic> The Committee can potentially be assisted in this task by the detailed promulgation of the rights, obligations and compliance measures propounded in the Australian <italic>Disability Standards for Education 2005. </italic>It is to be hoped that States Parties and the Committee will keep in mind the solemn obligation assumed by the former under Article 4(2) of the <italic>Disabilities Convention </italic>to take measures ‘to the maximum of [their] available resources’ and ‘within the framework of international cooperation’ with a view to progressively achieving the ‘full realization’ of the educational rights of persons with disabilities.</p>

               <p>One US case well illustrates such situation. In <italic>Daniel R R v State Board of Education </italic>874 F 2d 1036 (Fifth Circuit 1989) the court took into account the efforts which the state had made in accommodating a child who suffered from severe mental disability (due to Down’s Syndrome, which left him speech-impaired and with mental retardation), the benefit which the child would receive from attendance in a regular classroom, and what effect the child’s presence would have on the other students. The US court held that there was no discernible benefit to the child in being included in the regular classroom as he was unable to meaningfully participate in activities. Despite the possibility of association with the other children, the court found as a fact that the child was exhausted by those interactions.</p>

As play has been recognised as one of the best sources of learning social skills, children with disabilities and those with no disabilities should be allowed to play together. Likewise, a child with a disability who is able to compete in sports activities with children with no disability should be encouraged and supported to do so. However, it may be necessary in some circumstances (such as particular physical demands) to have exclusive sporting activities where children with disabilities can compete fairly and safely.

                  <italic>Purvis </italic>involved a foster child who was enrolled in a mainstream junior high school class. The child had multiple complex disabilities due to a severe brain injury received as an infant. After having disciplined and suspended him on several occasions for verbal and physical abuse of teachers and other students, the school recommended his placement in a special education unit. After an unsuccessful appeal to the Department of Education, the foster parents made a disability discrimination complaint to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The High Court held that the child’s abusive conduct was part of his disability for the purposes of the definition of ‘disability’ as listed in (g) because it was ‘disturbed behaviour’ as set out therein. It was an error of law to distinguish between a condition or disorder and its behavioural manifestations since ‘to focus on the cause of the behaviour, to the exclusion of the resulting behaviour, would confine the operation of the [<italic>Disability Discrimination Act 1992</italic>] by excluding from consideration that attribute of the disabled person (here, disturbed behaviour) which makes that person different in the eyes of others’; (2003) 217 CLR 92, 157. On the comparator issue, the proper comparator was deemed to be a non-disabled student who exhibited similar misbehaviour, and whether or not the latter would have hypothetically been treated in materially the same way as the foster child based on the evidence.</p>

It was held that the approach utilised by the provider in making this assessment was incorrect inasmuch as the school’s administration had merely made enquiries about the requirements of children with spina bifida generally. The administration should have instead considered the needs of the individual student in consultation with her parents. Having failed to adopt the correct assessment approach, the defence of unjustifiable hardship accordingly failed.</p>

               <p>Indeed, there appears to be an element of circularity in the definition of ‘reasonable adjustment’ in Section 4 of the <italic>Disability Discrimination Act 1992</italic>, which considers an adjustment to be reasonable unless making the adjustment would impose an unjustifiable hardship, and such hardship is defined in turn by Section 11 thereof to include the estimated amount of expenditure required to be made on the adjustment.</p>

The Tribunal refused to order her reinstatement on the grounds that the respondent had made all reasonable adjustments in assisting the student to pursue her studies and that it did not have to confer a degree on a student who could not satisfy the academic requirements of the degree programme.</p>
