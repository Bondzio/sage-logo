<abstract>
<p>Minarets are spread across urban nuclei. Their structural weakness could result in failures with heavy consequences. However, the retrofit solutions are limited due to their simple cantilever scheme. The use of metallic pre-stressed wires/cables is a rather consolidated technique. The use of shape memory alloy (SMA) wires has been recently investigated. In view of such an application, a series of reduced-scale tests was planned and realized. This paper synthesizes the full report on an experimental work performed to study the effect of SMA wires on the dynamic behavior of a single degree of freedom model built in laboratory to represent a 1/16th of a minaret actually built in Cairo, Egypt. The model was tested under free vibration for different values of the axial force, before and after adding SMA wires. The results showed enhancements in the stiffness when the SMA wires were added and when the axial force increased, while a decrease in damping ratios was detected when increasing the applied axial force or after providing SMA wires.</p>

<p>Minarets are all around Islamic religious centers, that is, in the middle of old urban nuclei as well as new residential areas. Owing to their simple structural conception (the minaret is just a vertical cantilever), they are often complicated by changes along the height in the section geometry and material density. Structural problems occurring during their lifetime are sometimes solved by their full replacement. Indeed, the consequence of a failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077546311399946">Casciati and AlSaleh, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077546311399946">Casciati and Faravelli, 2010</xref>) can be serious, resulting in lost human lives and damages to the surrounding properties.</p>
<p>The attempted retrofit solutions span from base isolation in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077546311399946">El-Attar et al. (2004)</xref>, to energy dissipation by dampers in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077546311399946">Bennati et al. (2005)</xref>, from adding an internal (steel) skeleton in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077546311399946">Ballio (1993)</xref>, to tensioning by external metallic cables in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077546311399946">Castellano et al. (1999)</xref>. Actually the last reference has already introduced the adoption of shape memory alloy (SMA) wires, in Nickel-Titanium. A recently ended research project funded by the European Union (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077546311399946">Casciati and Van der Eijk, 2008</xref>) identified the adoption of a Cu-based alloy as the basis for an effective sustainable and cost-effective retrofit technology for non-invasive rehabilitation of massive limestone/masonry structures. Targeted laboratory tests were carried out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077546311399946">Casciati and Hamdaoui (2008)</xref>, and an application to a real structural system is reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077546311399946">Chrysostomou et al. (2008)</xref>. See also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077546311399946">Gentile and Saisi (2007)</xref> for the structure identification and damage assessment process.</p>
<p>In view of an application to the retrofit of minarets, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077546311399946">El-Attar et al. (2008)</xref> introduced a model to be tested. It was assumed to represent a 1/16th scale of the actual Qusun minaret in Cairo, Egypt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077546311399946">Figure 1</xref>). The Qusun minaret is one of the Mamluk era minarets that were constructed in the 14th century. It is currently separated from any surrounding building and is directly resting on the ground. Field investigations were conducted to obtain several characteristics of the minaret, and then ambient vibration tests were performed to determine its modal parameters (i.e. natural frequencies and mode shapes). The Qusun minaret was constructed by the prince Seif Eldin Qusun Al-Saki for teaching Islamic rules, and it is located now in Al-Suyuti cemetery. It has a rectangular stone shaft carrying an octagonal second story with a stone Mabkharah on top. The total height of the minaret is 40.02 m, with the first balcony at 16.80 m from the ground level, the second balcony at 24.40 m, and the third one at 31.85 m. The base rectangular shaft is about 5.42 m × 5.42 m and it extends to the first balcony. A survey study was conducted to determine the minaret cross-sections and wall thicknesses along its height, and the results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077546311399946">Figure 1</xref>. An examination of the minaret walls indicated that the minaret body is constructed of two layers of flat-faced limestone blocks, each layer composed of blocks of different dimensions connected together by mortar. A filling material consisting of cohesive and cohesionless materials, highly chaotic with limestone, is placed between the external and the internal layers. Starting from the second balcony up to the top level, a single layer of limestone blocks is used. The material properties of the minaret limestone and the filling material are listed <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077546311399946">Table 1</xref>.

<p>The complicated shape of the real minaret was simplified in the laboratory into a cantilever-type model (single degree of freedom [SDOF]) that faithfully reflects the main aspects of the minaret conditions regarding: (a) geometry; (b) stress level; and (c) dynamic response. The experimental model was then utilized to perform an experimental work aimed mainly at investigating the effect of adding SMA wires to the SDOF system. A series of free vibration tests was conducted on this model before and after adding the SMA wires. The sensitivity to variations in the axial load upon the system is also investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077546311399946">El-Habbal, 2008</xref>). This paper provides a full report on the results of the experimental tests carried out.</p>

<p>The model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1077546311399946">Figure 2</xref> consists of a reinforced concrete base firmly connected to the rigid floor by means of four steel anchors of 45 mm diameter. It has a square base of scale 1.5 m and the height is 0.5 m. The concrete base supports a limestone hollow-square column with outer width of 40 cm and inner width of 20 cm. The clear height of the column is 2 m. 10 cm × 10 cm × 20 cm limestone bricks were used in the column construction. Brick rows were glued together by Portland cement mortar with a cement to sand ratio of 1:3. On the top of this column a lumped mass that simulates the SDOF system is placed; it is a reinforced concrete block with dimensions of 1.2 m × 1.2 m × 0.75 m and total of weight of 25 kN. A 30 mm diameter steel rod was fixed at the center of the concrete base, passing through the hollow column up to the top level of the concrete block to be utilized as a pre-stressing bar, in order to vary the applied vertical load upon the system.</p>
<p>The model was designed and constructed inside the Concrete Research Laboratory in the University of Cairo. The concrete mix used to cast both the base and the top block was with minimum compressive cubic strength of 25 MPa, as measured seven days after casting. The concrete mix contained the following proportions: 1:2.75:1.5:0.475 of cement, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, and water, respectively. Grade 36 steel bars were used in the concrete reinforcement. Limestone bricks with dimensions 10 cm × 10 cm × 20 cm were used to construct the hollow-square section limestone column. Four steel wires of 4 mm nominal diameter were fixed on the base and the top blocks to be used to connect four SMA bars between the two concrete blocks. The SMA bars were 3.5 mm nominal diameter and 60 cm length. They were provided by the University of Pavia from the same stock used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077546311399946">Casciati and Hamdaoui (2008)</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1077546311399946"><title>2.2. Test specifications</title>
<p>The testing schedule was divided into two steps; the first stage investigates the overall behavior of the reference specimen under free vibration, while in the second stage the specimen was equipped with the SMA wires after all the tests of the first stage, and the same free vibration tests were repeated on the retrofitted specimen in a reversed order in terms of the external applied axial force.</p>
<p>For each step, three sets of free vibration testing were carried out, varying the applied vertical load through three values: 25, 75, and 125 kN. From the first value (directly induced by the mass) one jumps to the others through a hydraulic jack subjected on the central pre-stressing bar, and monitored by a 100 kN capacity load cell. The overall structural behavior under free vibration was recorded in the two perpendicular plan directions <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic>, the bending plans being first (<italic>x</italic>, <italic>z</italic>) and then (<italic>y</italic>, <italic>z</italic>).</p>
<p>Free vibration was induced in the specimen by applying a gradually increased horizontal displacement on the top point of the concrete block until the required initial displacement is obtained. This step was repeated four times with different initial displacement values (1, 2, 3, and 5 mm) for each value of vertical loading. The applied initial displacement was monitored by means of one LVDT (linear variable differential transducer).</p>
<p>In the second stage of the test, the SMA bars were initially strained to 1% as an initial strain after being subjected to the specimen. The used SMA bar device was previously tested in the WIND-CHIME (Wide Range Non-INtrusive Devices toward Conservation of HIstorical Monuments in the MEditerranean Area) European project.</p>
<p>The results of each test were recorded for one minute with sampling rate of 200 p.p.s. (points per second), using three tri-axial force balanced accelerometers produced by Kinemetrics with ±0.25 <italic>g</italic> range. The accelerometers were connected, through dedicated cables, to a 16-channel signal conditioning unit, type Kinemetrics VSS-3000; which in turn was connected to a laptop computer equipped with a high-speed ‘input/output (I/O) Tech’ data acquisition card.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077546311399946">Table 3</xref> summarizes the parameters that characterize each test. There are four attributes, with 4, 3, 2, and 2 specifications, respectively. They result in 48 different tests, that is, set of signals. The sequence of obtaining these signals (namely, performing the corresponding test) is clarified in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1077546311399946">Table 4</xref>, where the signal label summarizes the parameters applied in that test; for example, in the case of signal (1-0-X-C): 1 means 1 mm of initial displacement, 0 is the value in tons for the extra applied axial force, X is the direction of excitation, and the last character distinguishes between control specimens (C) and specimens equipped with SMA wires (S).

<p>It must be clarified that only a few signals were fully reliable in the intermediate step characterized by 5 tons of extra load. This is why the focus in this paper is on the 0 and 10-ton specifications.</p>
<p>For each considered test, the response of the specimen to the free vibration in the three directions (<italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic>, and <italic>z</italic>) was measured by the three accelerometers. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1077546311399946">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1077546311399946">4</xref> show a sample response in two directions (<italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic>) for the same case of initial displacement and axial load, but without the SMA wires in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1077546311399946">Figure 3</xref> and with the SMA wires in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1077546311399946">Figure 4</xref>, acquired by the three accelerometers (A, B, and C). The figures prove a lower response in the magnitude value of acceleration in the signals obtained after adding the SMA wires. The differences are clearer in the transversal direction of excitation (i.e. along the <italic>y</italic>-direction in this case). This is because the maximum value in the direction of excitation is controlled by the provided initial value of displacement, which is the same in both cases before and after adding the SMA wires.

<p>Periodograms are also drawn for the signals sequenced from 1 to 8 (excluding no. 4 which is disregarded) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1077546311399946">Figures 9</xref> (signals 1–3) and 10 (signals 4–8). In general it is noticed that the correspondent values of the fundamental frequencies are lower than those of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1077546311399946">Figure 8</xref>. This is due to the decrease in the applied axial force, which decreases the total stiffness and hence the frequency corresponding to the peak. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1077546311399946">Figure 10</xref>, in particular, plots the periodograms of the signals recorded in the direction transversal to that of the excitation. The largest intensity case shows an evident progressive deterioration of the structural behavior.

<p>After performing all the planned tests for the control specimen, the four SMA wires were erected on the specimen and the same tests were performed again. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1077546311399946">Figures 11</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1077546311399946">15</xref> show the frequency content of the signals in the direction of the excitation for all the cases in the series of signals obtained after adding SMA wires, except the ones obtained in the direction <italic>y</italic> with an extra load of 50 kN, since they would not add any specific remark to the ones discussed hereafter. The values of the calculated fundamental frequency are listed also in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1077546311399946">Table 5</xref>, from which the different behavior of the specimen with SMA wires could be noticed. Generally, the curves are moving left in each single figure, which indicates the decrease of the frequency corresponding to the peak. Moreover, a larger value in the fundamental frequency is detected than those of the control specimens. This latter evidence is mainly due to the further pre-stressing force added to the specimen by the previously strained SMA wires.

<sec id="sec9-1077546311399946"><title>4. Damping calculations</title>
<p>In order to study the effect of the varied parameters on the resulting damping of the SDOF system, damping is calculated from each time-history signal for every case. The adopted method in calculating damping depends on the logarithmic decrement technique (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-1077546311399946">Equation (2)</xref>) that is used to obtain the damping ratio associated with the first mode of vibration:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-1077546311399946"><label>(2)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1077546311399946-eq2.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>F</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) is the acceleration at time <italic>t</italic>, <italic>A</italic> is the acceleration at time 0, <italic>ω</italic> is the circular frequency in radians, and <italic>ζ</italic> is the damping ratio.</p>
<p>An example of a damping calculation is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1077546311399946">Figure 16</xref>, where the time history of the test 1-10-X-C is plotted, together with the exponential fitting curve.
<fig id="fig16-1077546311399946" position="float"><label>Figure 16.</label><caption><p>Time history of 1-10-X-C with the fitted curve adopted for the damping calculation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1077546311399946-fig16.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>An alternative approach was also adopted in order to avoid misleading conclusions. The so-called half-power (–3 dB) method from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077546311399946">Avitable (2001)</xref> suggests identifying the two pulsations <italic>ω<sub>a</sub></italic> and <italic>ω<sub>b</sub></italic> around the peak at <italic>ω</italic>, where the ordinates decrease at 3 dB. Then:

</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1077546311399946">Table 6</xref> includes the values of damping calculated for some of the collected signals. The method of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-1077546311399946">Equation (3)</xref> is reported in the last two columns, after the values obtained following <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-1077546311399946">Equation (2)</xref>. It is seen from the table that the damping generally increases with the initial displacement, that is, the excitation intensity. In addition, for the same value of initial displacement, the damping decreases with the increase of the axial load.

<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1077546311399946">Table 6</xref>, the cases where the two methods show discrepancies, which are marked in bold, require a further explanation as follows.</p>

On one hand the approach of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-1077546311399946">Equation (2)</xref> is unreliable and on the other the damping when the excitation is along the <italic>y</italic>-direction is much higher than the values estimated when the excitation is in the <italic>x</italic>-direction.</p>
<p>The first remark is once again justified by the progressive damage, while the second confirms the need to replace the SMA wires after they have undergone cycles of loading–unloading, if the benefit of their installation has to be preserved. Without this replacement the differences summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-1077546311399946">Figures 17</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-1077546311399946">18</xref> have to be emphasized.

<p>The main objective of this study is to investigate experimentally the effects of different parameters (namely, axial compression, initial displacement, and direction of application) on a SDOF masonry model before and after rehabilitation using Cu-based SMA wire devices.</p>
<p>In this investigation, a total of 48 free vibration tests were performed on the 1/16th scale model of the Qusun minaret at Cairo University Concrete Research Laboratory, varying the aforementioned parameters. The overall structural behavior under free vibration was recorded in two perpendicular directions to detect the actual testing conditions. Acceleration time histories were obtained by means of three accelerometers, then the acquired data were processed and the fundamental frequency and damping ratio values were calculated from the signals obtained by each test.</p>
<p>The results showed a significant increase of the fundamental frequencies of the SDOF in the all performed tests when the axial force had been increased. A further noticed increase in the frequency was associated with the addition of SMA wires, which proves higher stiffness imparted to the SDOF model by the SMA wires.</p>
<p>In general, damping ratios were increasing as the initial displacement increased, caused by the gradual increase in damage induced in the system. A decrease in damping ratios was noticed when increasing the applied axial force, as well as after providing the SMA wires. This is mainly due to the larger mass and higher stiffness gained by the extra axial load and SMA wires, respectively.</p>
