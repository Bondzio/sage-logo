<p>Chemoprevention is a novel approach to study the anti-initiating and anti-tumor-promoting efficacy of medicinal plants and their active principles. The present study investigated the chemopreventive potential of <italic>Aegle marmelos</italic> fruit extract in 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-induced skin carcinogenesis and its influence on oxidative stress and the antioxidant defense system. The oral administration of <italic>A marmelos</italic> at 100 mg/kg body weight/day during peri-initiational, postinitiational, and peri- &amp; postinitiational phases of papillomagenesis showed significant reduction in tumor incidence, tumor yield, tumor burden, and cumulative number of papillomas when compared with carcinogen-treated control. The average latent period significantly increased (7.88 weeks; control group) to 9.45, 11.11, and 11.54 weeks in different <italic>A marmelos</italic> extract (AME) experimental groups. Enzyme analysis of skin and liver showed a significant elevation in antioxidant parameters such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione, and vitamin C in AME-treated groups when compared with the carcinogen-treated control. The elevated level of lipid peroxidation in the positive control was significantly inhibited by AME administration. These results indicate that AME has the potential to reduce chemical-induced skin papillomas by enhancing the antioxidant defense system.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cancer is a major public health problem, being the second highest cause of death in both men and women in developed as well as developing countries. Skin cancer is one of the most common of all human cancers, and its incidence is increasing rapidly worldwide. It contributes approximately 30% of all newly diagnosed cancers in the world, and solar ultraviolet radiation is an established cause of approximately 90% of all skin cancers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534735411417127">1</xref></sup> Human beings are exposed to a multitude of carcinogens in their environment, and the majority of cancers are considered to be chemically induced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534735411417127">2</xref></sup> Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are environmental carcinogens present in the atmosphere from combustion sources such as diesel exhaust, cigarette smoke, residential heating processes, refuse burning, industrial coke production, volcanic eruption, and oil contamination by effluents and oil spills.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534735411417127">3</xref></sup> 7,12-Dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA), the site-specific and organ-specific carcinogen, is commonly employed to induce skin cancer in experimental models. DMBA-induced skin cancer is therefore ideal to test the chemopreventive efficacy of medicinal plants and their constituents.</p>
<p>Free radical–mediated oxidative stress can cause structural and functional abnormalities in cells, making them weak and defenseless.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534735411417127">4</xref></sup> Overproduction of reactive oxygen species has been implicated in the etiology of several disorders, including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, and Alzheimer’s disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534735411417127">5</xref></sup> Antioxidant defense molecules fall into 1 o]f 2 categories: enzymatic or nonenzymatic. Mammalian cells possess elaborate enzymatic (superoxide dismutase [SOD], catalase [CAT], and glutathione peroxidase [GPx]) and nonenzymatic (reduced glutathione [GSH]) antioxidant defense mechanisms to detoxify the radicals.</p>
<p>Prevention is an effective strategy to control the incidence of cancer. Recent progress in molecular biology and pharmacology enhances the likelihood that cancer prevention will increasingly rely on chemoprevention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534735411417127">6</xref></sup> It has been observed that synthetic chemopreventive agents produce toxic side effects, which have limited their extensive use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534735411417127">7</xref></sup> Plants, vegetables, and medicinal herbs used in the folk and traditional system of medicine have been accepted currently as one of the main source of cancer chemopreventive drug discovery and development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534735411417127">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is a growing interest in evaluation of chemopreventive efficacy of plants used in Ayurveda, and one such plant is <italic>Aegle marmelos</italic>, commonly called <italic>bael</italic>, belonging to family Rutaceae. This plant is widely found in India, Bangladesh, Burma, and Sri Lanka. It is distributed mainly within the sub-Himalayan forest, in dry hilly regions. It is called <italic>Shivadume</italic>, the tree of lord Shiva. <italic>Aegle marmelos</italic> has an important place in the indigenous system of medicine. Its edible leaf, root, bark, seed, and fruit are valued highly in Ayurvedic medicine in India.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534735411417127">9</xref></sup> In fact, as per Charaka (1500 <sc>bc</sc>) no drug has been longer or better known or appreciated by the inhabitants of India than the <italic>bael</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534735411417127">10</xref></sup> The fruit is bitter, acrid, sour, astringent, aids digestion and stomach irritation, and is useful in treating diarrhea, dysentery, and stomachalgia. Aqueous <italic>A marmelos</italic> fruit extract exhibits antihyperlipidemic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534735411417127">11</xref></sup> and hypoglycemic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534735411417127">12</xref></sup> effects in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. The ripe fruits have been used in different formulations for the treatment of chronic diarrhea.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534735411417127">13</xref></sup> In view of the importance of this plant, the present study has been undertaken to evaluate the chemopreventive potential of <italic>A marmelos</italic>.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1534735411417127">
<title>Animal Care and Handling</title>
<p>The experimental procedure was approved by our institution and was done according to the guidelines set by the World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland, and the Indian National Science Academy, New Delhi, India. The inhibition of tumor incidence by <italic>A marmelos</italic> fruit extract was evaluated on 2-stage skin carcinogenesis induced by a single application of DMBA (initiator) and 2 weeks later promoted by repeated application of croton oil (promoter) thrice per week, following the protocol for 16 weeks. The study was conducted on random-bred, 6- to 7-week-old male Swiss albino mice with body weight 24 ± 2 g. Animals were maintained under controlled conditions of temperature (25 ± 2°C) and light (14 hours light–10 hours dark). The animals were fed a standard mouse feed procured from Aashirwad Industries (Chandigarh, India), and water ad libitum. These animals were housed in polypropylene cages containing saw dust (procured locally) as bedding material. As a precaution against infection, tetracycline hydrochloride water was given to these animals once each fortnight. The Departmental Animal Ethical Committee approved this study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1534735411417127">
<title>Chemicals</title>
<p>The initiator DMBA and the promoter croton oil were procured from Sigma (St Louis, MO). DMBA was dissolved at a concentration of 100 µg/100 µL in acetone. Croton oil was mixed in acetone to give a solution of 1% dilution.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1534735411417127">
<title>Preparation of Aegle marmelos Extract (AME)</title>
<p>The fruits of <italic>A marmelos</italic> L. were collected locally after their proper identification by a competent botanist (Voucher Specimen No: RUBL-20438) from the herbarium, Department of Botany, University of Rajasthan, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India. The pulp was removed from the fruit and shade dried; the pulp was powdered in a mixture and the hydro-alcoholic extract prepared by refluxing with double distilled water (DDW) and alcohol (3:1) for 36 (12 × 3) hours at 40°C. The liquid extract was cooled and concentrated by evaporating its liquid contents. The AME thus prepared was stored at low temperature until further use. The extract was redissolved in DDW prior for the oral administration in mice. The required dose for treatment was prepared by dissolving the extract in DDW at a dose level of 100 mg/kg body weight.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1534735411417127">
<title>Experimental Design</title>
<p>A total of 60 animals were randomly divided into 6 groups (10 in each) to evaluate the anticarcinogenic potential of AME against DMBA-induced skin papillomagenesis in mice. The dorsal skin of the animals in the back area was shaven 3 days before the commencement of the experiment, and only those animals in the resting phase of hair cycle were chosen for the study. The body weight of the animals was recorded weekly. The inhibition of the tumor incidence of the pulp extract of <italic>A marmelos</italic> was evaluated in 2-stage process of skin tumorigenesis using the following protocol.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1534735411417127">
<title>Group I: Vehicle Treated (Negative Control)</title>
<p>Animals belonging to this group received topical application of acetone (100 µL per mouse) on the shaven dorsal skin and DDW equivalent to AME (100 µL per mouse) by oral gavage for 16 weeks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1534735411417127">
<title>Group II: AME Treated (Drug-Treated Control)</title>
<p>Animals of this group were administered AME orally at a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight, dissolved in 100 µL of DDW as vehicle to each mouse, once a day for the 16-week study period.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1534735411417127">
<title>Group III: Carcinogen Treated (Positive Control)</title>
<p>These animals were applied topically with a single dose of DMBA (100 µg/100 µL of acetone) over the shaven area of the skin of the mice. Two weeks later, croton oil (1% v/v in acetone) was applied 3 times per week until the end of experiment. This group received DDW equivalent to AME (100 µL per mouse) by oral gavage for 16 weeks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1534735411417127">
<title>Group IV: Peri-Initiation Group</title>
<p>Animals of this group received the same treatment as for group III. AME (100 mg/kg body weight/animal/day) was administered by oral gavage starting from 7 days before and 7 days after DMBA application.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1534735411417127">
<title>Group V: Postinitiation Group</title>
<p>The treatment pattern of DMBA and croton oil was similar to that in group III. These animals also received AME (100 mg/kg body weight/animal/day) by oral gavage, starting from the time of croton oil treatment and continued until the end of experiment (ie, 16 weeks).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1534735411417127">
<title>Group VI: Peri- &amp; Postinitiation Group</title>
<p>Animals of this group were administered AME (100 mg/kg body weight/animal/day) by oral gavage starting from 7 days before DMBA application and continued until the end of experiment (ie, 16 weeks).</p>
<p>The following studies were performed in mice in groups III to VI.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1534735411417127">
<title>Tumor Study</title>
<p>During the 16 weeks of experimentation, mice were observed daily and weighed weekly. Papillomas appearing on the shaven area of the skin were examined and recorded at weekly intervals in all the groups. Only those papillomas that persisted for 2 weeks or more, with a diameter greater than 2 mm, were taken into consideration for final evaluation of the data. Skin papillomas that regressed after 1 observation were not considered for counting. The following parameters were taken into consideration: tumor incidence, tumor yield, tumor burden, diameter, weight, body weight, average latent period, and inhibition of tumor multiplicity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1534735411417127">
<title>Biochemical Study</title>
<p>Biochemical alterations were studied in the animals of all the groups at the time of the termination of the experiment (ie, 16th week). At the end of the 16th week, the animals were killed by cervical dislocation. The dorsal skin affected by tumors and liver of mice were quickly excised and washed thoroughly with chilled saline (pH 7.4). It was then weighed and blotted dry. Ten percent tissue homogenate was prepared from the part of the skin in 0.15 M Tris–KCl (pH 7.4), and the same was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes. The supernatant thus obtained was taken for estimation of lipid peroxidation (LPO) and GSH. The following biochemical parameters were estimated in the liver and skin of mice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1534735411417127">
<title>Lipid Peroxidation Assay</title>
<p>The level of LPO was estimated spectrophotometrically by the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) method, as described by Ohkhawa et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534735411417127">14</xref></sup> Briefly, thiobarbituric acid (0.6%), sodium dodecyl sulfate (0.1%), and trichloroacetic acid (20%) were added to 200 µL of the tissue homogenate (10%) prepared as described above. This mixture was heated for 60 minutes, cooled, and extracted with N-butanol–pyridine (15:1); the optical density was recorded at 532 nm, and the contents were expressed as nmol/mg of tissue.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1534735411417127">
<title>Reduced Glutathione Assay</title>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Most tumor-initiating chemicals including DMBA undergo metabolic conversion to become carcinogens, and covalent binding of a chemical carcinogen to DNA is considered a critical step in the initiation of chemical carcinogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534735411417127">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534735411417127">21</xref></sup> Skin tumor initiation by chemical carcinogens such as DMBA appears to be an irreversible stage that probably involves a somatic mutation, mainly in the Ha-ras oncogenes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534735411417127">22</xref></sup> Another important aspect of carcinogenesis, especially during the tumor-promotional stage, is that carcinogens and tumor promoters generate (directly or indirectly) free radicals such as superoxide and hydroxyl radicals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534735411417127">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Skin carcinogenesis, the most common of all cancers, has been increasing in recent years worldwide. Skin is the most common site of malignancy and represents 55% of all human cancers with tremendous impact on health and morbidity. DMBA-induced mouse skin carcinogenesis is commonly used to test chemopreventive efficacy of medicinal plants and their constituents. In recent years, profound interest has been focused on the identification of nontoxic natural products that are capable of reducing the tumorigenicity of the environmental carcinogen.</p>
<p><italic>Aegle marmelos</italic>, one of the most versatile traditional medicinal plants, has been known to posses a wide spectrum of medicinal properties and is used in Ayurveda to cure several ailments including cancer. In this study, an attempt was made to evaluate the chemomodulatory effects of <italic>A marmelos</italic> against DMBA-induced skin tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are widely generated in biological systems either by normal metabolic pathways or as a consequence of exposure to chemical carcinogens leading to oxidative stress that may further result in membrane dysfunction, protein inactivation, and DNA damage, ultimately leading to carcinogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534735411417127">24</xref></sup> For protection against the deleterious effects of these ROS, organisms have developed a sophisticated antioxidant defense system that has enzymatic as well as nonenzymatic components. The antioxidant defense system include enzymes such as CAT, GSH, and SOD, whereas nonenzymatic components include nonprotein thiol GSH, some trace metals, and certain vitamins such as ascorbic acid and α-tocopherol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534735411417127">25</xref></sup> Any natural compound with antioxidant properties may help in maintaining health when continuously taken as components of dietary food, spices, or drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534735411417127">26</xref></sup> The increase in the levels of antioxidant profile, that is, GSH, SOD, and CAT, by <italic>A marmelos</italic> extract may be attributed to have biological significance in eliminating reactive free radicals that may affect the normal functioning of cells. Oral administration of AME (100 mg/kg body weight/animal/day) at the peri-initiational, postinitiational, peri- &amp; postinitiational stages exhibited a reduction in tumor incidence, tumor burden, tumor size, and cumulative number of papillomas as documented in experimental groups.</p>
<p>During oxidative stress, MDA and/or other aldehydes are formed in biological systems. These can react with amino acids and DNA and introduce cross-linkages between proteins and nucleic acids, resulting in alterations in replication and transcription, leading to tumor formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534735411417127">27</xref></sup> Significant decrease in MDA levels by AME administration indicates reduced oxidative stress due to increase in GSH and the antioxidant enzyme CAT, thus indicating the ameliorative potential of such a plant extract against skin carcinogenesis.</p>
<p>Similarly, the findings of the present study also exhibit depletion of GSH with concomitant increase in TBARS level in group III by DMBA/croton oil alone treatments. In the experimental groups (IV-VI), oral administration of AME significantly elevated the level of GSH in skin and liver of mice. Furthermore, decrease of GSH with enhanced LPO was observed in DMBA/croton oil–treated mice, which suggests that cells deficient in thiol groups undergo fast LPO, as GSH is one of the guarding factors against oxidative stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534735411417127">28</xref></sup> Such inhibition of tumorigenesis owing to similar factors with the use of other plant extracts such as palm oil,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534735411417127">29</xref></sup> <italic>Emblica officinalis</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534735411417127">30</xref></sup> and <italic>Tribulus terrestis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1534735411417127">31</xref></sup> has been reported by others.</p>
<p>SOD plays an important role in the antioxidant enzyme defense system as it converts superoxide radicals into hydrogen peroxide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534735411417127">32</xref></sup> SOD and CAT protect cells by catalyzing the harmful ROS such as O<sup>2−</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, respectively. Lowered activities of these enzymes were reported in several cancerous conditions, including skin carcinogenesis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534735411417127">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534735411417127">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534735411417127">33</xref></sup> as observed in the present study also.</p>
<p>Experimental studies have demonstrated that vitamin C can inhibit the formation of nitroso-compounds both in vivo and in vitro.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534735411417127">34</xref></sup> Several low-molecular-weight compounds isolated from <italic>A marmelos</italic> such as vitamin C, polysaccharides are capable of inhibiting the generation of ROS and may protect tissues from excessive oxidative damage caused by free radicals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1534735411417127">35</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Aegle marmelos</italic>, used in various medicinal systems, and a rich source of proteins, polysaccharides, calcium, phosphorous, potassium, vitamins C and B, has been found to have anti-inflammation, antiulcer, and antidyslipidemic properties. Polysaccharides are given to cancer patients because of their direct effects on cancer cells and indirect improvements on the immune system. The current study demonstrates that <italic>A marmelos</italic> extract can activate the defense system, following exposure to the carcinogen, by elevating the level of antioxidant enzymes.</p>
<p>Since most of the phytochemicals having chemopreventive properties occur in low concentration in vegetables and fruits, it may be possible that selective interactions among these dietary constituents may be a long-lasting, potent, and effective modality for cancer chemoprevention. Several phytochemical constituents such as aegelin, alloimperatorin, marmelide, marmeline, marmelosin, marmesin, psoralen, skimming, tannic acid, xanthotoxol, and β-sitosterol are reported to be present in <italic>A marmelos</italic> fruit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534735411417127">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534735411417127"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1534735411417127">38</xref></sup> Such phytochemicals might be responsible for reducing the carcinogen-induced lipid peroxidation in skin and liver as observed in the present study.</p>
<p>From the results obtained, it may be concluded that <italic>Aegle marmelos</italic> is a source of many anticarcinogenic agents and antioxidants that may be useful for the prevention of chemical-induced skin carcinogenesis. Further studies are suggested to evaluate the efficacy of this well-known plant in different tumor models.</p>
