<abstract>
<p>This article explores the changing worldview of a new generation of learners and the threat that this poses to the future of experiential learning (EL). Initially the differing characteristics of three generations of learners, X, Y, and Z, are outlined, along with key educational reforms they have been subject to, particularly in the United Kingdom, the case study location. Following this, a series of ethnographic EL snapshots, collected between 1991 and 2010, are used to develop a continuum of learner disengagement. This continuum includes academically challenged, ambivalent, and formulaic learners. Of these, it is the formulaic learner who presents the greatest threat to EL. This is a discerning and discriminating learner who wishes to be in control of his or her own achievements and who sees EL activities as a threat to his or her success. Practical ways of responding to the changing EL landscape are proposed. These proposals include moving away from a linear learning experience, embracing EL projects that capitalize on learner technological capabilities, and reviewing the timing and conditions within which EL activities are situated.</p>

<p>Experiential learning (EL), which “usually involves the integration of either simulation based exercises or a more generic form of workshop, which allows students to actively engage in an ‘event’ in a safe and supportive environment” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0273475311430801">O’Malley &amp; Ryan, 2006</xref>, p. 199), represents a powerful pedagogical tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0273475311430801">Billett, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0273475311430801">Gremler, Hoffman, Keaveney, &amp; Wright, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0273475311430801">Karns, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0273475311430801">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0273475311430801">Morrison, Sweeney, &amp; Heffernan, 2006</xref>). Experience may be lifelong and not merely episodic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0273475311430801">Dewey, 1938</xref>) and is influenced by many factors. These factors include the learner, their learning styles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0273475311430801">Honey &amp; Mumford, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0273475311430801">Illeris, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0273475311430801">Mann, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0273475311430801">Reynolds, 1997</xref>), the type of experience (primary, secondary, actual, recalled, real, artificial), and the subject matter involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0273475311430801">Jarvis, Holford, &amp; Griffin, 2003</xref>). EL has a long history of recognition. While varying interpretations of the approach exists (see, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0273475311430801">Weil &amp; McGill, 1989</xref>), the landmark work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0273475311430801">Kolb (1984)</xref> into the learning cycle is recognized as the forerunner in this area. It was heavily influenced by the earlier writings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0273475311430801">Lewin (1951)</xref>, a social psychologist and ambassador for action research; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0273475311430801">Dewey (1938)</xref>, an educational philosopher interested in lifelong learning; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0273475311430801">Piaget (1970)</xref>, a cognitive development psychologist.</p>
<p>Literature and practice show that EL has a considerable amount to offer marketing education. It provides one vehicle for business and management schools to meet the needs of different stakeholder groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0273475311430801">Li, Barnett, Greenberg, &amp; Nicholls, 2007</xref>). It equips corporations with more savvy and skilled future employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0273475311430801">Pfeffer &amp; Fong, 2002</xref>). It provides learners with a more stimulating educational experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0273475311430801">Ueltschy, 2001</xref>). Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0273475311430801">Karns (2005)</xref> goes as far as to claim that EL represents part of the bedrock of the sustained development of marketing education, a claim further endorsed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0273475311430801">D. J. Lincoln’s (2008)</xref> editorial on the same subject. Multiple attempts have been made to understand the different facets of the learning experience, particularly why learners respond in the way they do. This has given rise to a considerable learning styles literature base, which has introduced us to the learning styles inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0273475311430801">Kolb, 1984</xref>) and learning styles questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0273475311430801">Allinson &amp; Hayes, 1988</xref>), differential learner types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0273475311430801">Honey &amp; Mumford, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0273475311430801">Illeris, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0273475311430801">Marton &amp; Saljo, 1976</xref>), and categorized the learning experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0273475311430801">Mann, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0273475311430801">Petkus, 2000</xref>). Common throughout the literature is a widespread acceptance that this vehicle offers an inspirational form of learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0273475311430801">Fallows &amp; Ahmet, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0273475311430801">Gremler et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0273475311430801">Reynolds, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0273475311430801">Richards, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The EL toolkit used by faculty varies widely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0273475311430801">Gremler et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0273475311430801">Petkus, 2000</xref>). It includes group-based and individual projects and client based, that is, working on a business problem for a public, private, or not-for-profit sector client, and non-client based. The project may be hypothetical, simulated, or real. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0273475311430801">Parsons and Lepkowska-White (2009)</xref> provide a detailed review of the literature covering the advantages and disadvantages to both the learner and faculty of EL engagement. Advantages to the learner include opportunities for real life, interesting, and at times challenging project work and developing skills that will help them secure and succeed in employment, skills that might include report writing, group work, communication, critical thinking, collaboration, and problem solving. Disadvantages to the learner include ambiguity in project content; imbalance in knowledge content between the client and learner, leading the learner to feel overwhelmed by the project; frustration linked to the speed of client response to questions; and indeed access to client information.</p>
<p>Implicit within much of the extant literature is an assumption that the learner is an integral actor helping to coauthor the EL experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0273475311430801">Reynolds, 2009</xref>). Yet alongside the EL literature is an increasing literature base that questions learner educational engagement more generally. Quoting the findings of a U.S. Higher Education Research Institute study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0273475311430801">Bauerlein (2006)</xref> observes high levels of ‘academic disengagement’. Students say that they feel bored in class, submit assignments that underexercise their talent, and do minimal homework. These claims have sparked considerable debate over where the “fault” for this disengagement lies, fault that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0273475311430801">Essid (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0273475311430801">Arum and Roksa (2011)</xref> both attribute to the low priorities academic institutions attach to undergraduate teaching. Although this article does not seek to apportion blame, it does aim to contribute further to the learner disengagement debate, this time specifically within the context of EL and generational theory. Using a set of ethnographic snapshots, the article argues that, in the context of EL, disengagement is also linked to a change in the worldview of the learner population embedded within their generational association.</p>
<p>To present the argument, initially the differing characteristics of three generations of learners, X, Y, and Z, are outlined along with key educational reforms they have been subject to, particularly in the United Kingdom, the case study location. Next, the methodology details the distinct chapters in EL ethnographic data collection. The findings introduce us to a continuum of learner disengagement that is cross-referenced to generational theory within the discussion and conclusions. The article concludes with practical suggestions for encouraging engagement, which include moving away from a linear learning experience, embracing technological EL projects and reviewing the timing, and conditions within which EL activities are situated.</p>

<title>Theoretical Framework</title>
<p>Generational theory views society as consisting of consecutive “generations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0273475311430801">Strauss &amp; Howe 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0273475311430801">1998</xref>). A generation is a grouping of individuals who share birth years and thus share life stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0273475311430801">Bickel &amp; Brown, 2005</xref>). They are identified by peaks and declines in birth rates. Although not homogenous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0273475311430801">Bartlett, 2004</xref>), each generation has its own distinctive character shaped by key forces that existed during its formative years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0273475311430801">Kaye &amp; Jordan-Evans, 2008</xref>). The three generations that have the most impact on this study are Generation X, Y particularly, and Z. Generation X, also known as the Baby Busters, includes the population born broadly between the 1960s and 1982 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0273475311430801">Bickel &amp; Brown, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0273475311430801">Roberts &amp; Manolis, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0273475311430801">Solomon, Bamossy, Askegaard, &amp; Hogg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0273475311430801">Strauss &amp; Howe, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0273475311430801">1998</xref>). Generation Y, also known as the Digital Generation, Digital Natives, Baby Busters, I Generation, Net Generation, Netizens, and Gaming Generation, includes the population born broadly between 1977 to 2001 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0273475311430801">Bakewell &amp; Mitchell, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0273475311430801">Bartlett, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0273475311430801">Dalton, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0273475311430801">Navvar, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0273475311430801">Noble, Haytko, &amp; Phillips, 2009</xref>). Generation Z, also known as the Dreamer Generation, Generation I, Generation @, Generation 9/11, and Homeland Generation, includes the population born broadly between 1991 and 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0273475311430801">Howe &amp; Strauss, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0273475311430801">Table 1</xref> summarizes the characteristics of Generations X, Y, and Z. Each generation has been socialized into a society increasingly dominated by a consumer culture that positions them as consumers from an early age (see, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0273475311430801">Cook, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0273475311430801">Ekstrom, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0273475311430801">Guber &amp; Berry, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0273475311430801">Gunter &amp; Furnham, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0273475311430801">McNeal, 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0273475311430801">1999</xref>). For Generation X this has resulted in mixed consumer aspirations, some upbeat and optimistic about the future, others nonmaterialistic and influenced by the values of the 1960s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0273475311430801">Roberts &amp; Manolis, 2000</xref>). For Generations Y and Z, this has prompted grand ambitions and an optimism and self-confidence absent in earlier generations. Technical literacy has increased with each successive generation too: from the home computer, videogames, and cable television of Generation X, through to the multiple technical platforms Generations Y and Z engage in today, the Internet, text messaging, MP3 players, mobile phones, and YouTube, the tip of the iceberg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0273475311430801">Prensky, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0273475311430801">Tapscott, 2008</xref>).</p>

<p>The extent to which these generational characteristics present particular challenges to marketing educators is currently uncertain. If we accept the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0273475311430801">McCrindle (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0273475311430801">Palfrey and Gasser (2008)</xref>, then this suggests that traditional forms of teaching delivery and assessment are likely to be met by learner hostility. These authors argue that Generation Y, the majority of today’s undergraduate population, have a reduced learner attention span, reduced work ethic, and an inability to connect with traditional forms of media, books, and other printed material. But really these characteristics are only one part of the equation. Recognizing and making sense of the changing worldview different generations hold and the implications this has for the learning process is also important. For Generation Y, and Z, in the United Kingdom, alongside important world events mentioned in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0273475311430801">Table 1</xref>, this worldview has been influenced by two reforms to their compulsory education, alongside reforms to their higher education opportunities too.</p>
<p>The first reform to hit Generation Y in the United Kingdom was the introduction in 1989 of a compulsory National Curriculum (NC) into government-funded primary schools. U.K. primary schools cover the age range of 5 to 11 years. The idea behind the reform was to establish a common educational entitlement to children regardless of background or ability, with common standards for learning and attainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0273475311430801">The Stationery Office, 2009</xref>). Twenty years on the framework remains intact, although successive reviews (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0273475311430801">The Stationery Office, 2009</xref>) have resulted in a slimmed down version of the original skill areas. This testing system is by no means unique to the United Kingdom, however. In the United States for instance, the 2002 No Child Left Behind Act, under review with the current administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0273475311430801">UPI, 2011</xref>), was introduced to improve educational standards, testing learners in basic skills areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0273475311430801">Peterson &amp; West, 2003</xref>). Although linked to federal funding, achievement standards are state rather than nationally determined, the focus on rote learning and testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0273475311430801">Peterson &amp; West, 2003</xref>), a focus that echoes the NC approach too.</p>
<p>The second major reform in the United Kingdom is linked to how learners are assessed at the critical ages of 16 and 18 years, just prior to university entry. Testing for 16 year olds was traditionally completed through sitting an Ordinary Level (O’level) or Certificate in Secondary Education (CSE) examination. These qualifications were designed for a time when the minority progressed into higher education. They “provided an assessment of children at the end of their compulsory education and they told an employer something about that student’s ability” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0273475311430801">Blair, 2009</xref>). They ordinarily took the form of one or two examination papers, often 3 hours in length, sat on one occasion. “Grades were awarded primarily according to statistical rules which measured each candidate’s performance relatively against those of competing candidates” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0273475311430801">BBC, 1984</xref>). Aimed at only the top 40% of the population, criticism of the system was rife with more than half of young people leaving school with no qualifications. In 1984, the O’Level and CSE system was replaced with the General Certificate in Secondary Education (GCSE) qualification. This qualification is designed to test absolute standards of knowledge and understanding across a cohort at a national level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0273475311430801">BBC, 1984</xref>). The process has also been rolled out in the testing of 18 year olds too. Initially welcomed by the academic community, the modular nature of the GCSE qualification, the continuous assessment in “bite-sized” chunks over a 2-year period, and the ability to re-sit components to improve marks has led to increasing criticism regarding rote learning and concern over grade inflation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0273475311430801">Blair, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Educational reform in the U.K. Higher Education (HE) sector, particularly linked to learner fees, has also hit Generation Y, and will hit Generation Z too. The 2004 Higher Education Act altered the structure of HE funding, for the first time requiring students to pay a fee upfront for their university education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0273475311430801">Callender &amp; Jackson, 2008</xref>). The recent publication of the Independent Review of Higher Education Funding and Student Finance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0273475311430801">Browne, 2010</xref>) and the U.K. Coalition Government Comprehensive Spending Review 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0273475311430801">HM Treasury, 2010</xref>) add a further level of uncertainty to the HE sector. Both reports recommend a shift away from traditional public sector funding support into a free market economy, alongside encouraging further HE competition. Although focused principally on the English HE sector, the ramifications of these changes are likely also to affect the international HE arena too as future learners, facing escalating HE costs, compare competitor offerings, home and abroad, in their institutional decision-making process.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>This study uses ethnographic data to examine learner disengagement linked to EL. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0273475311430801">Willis and Trondman (2000)</xref> describe ethnography as “a family of methods [which allows for] the disciplined and deliberate witness-cum-recording of human events” (p. 5). These methods encourage the collection of data that are <italic>culturally located, entrained</italic> within a time delineated landscape and <italic>internally sprung</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0273475311430801">Willis &amp; Trondman, 2000</xref>). Put another way, this means that data collection is not staged, but rather unstructured, with collection occurring in environments naturally frequented by the research population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0273475311430801">Atkinson, Coffey, Delamont, Lofland, &amp; Lofland, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, data were collected from multiple academic research environments through a process of journaling. This process may take many forms ranging from a formal learning log, through to a simple notebook capturing ad hoc comments in scratch notes, that is, keywords, phrases, quick pointers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0273475311430801">Lofland &amp; Lofland, 1995</xref>), as and when they arise. The author used all forms in the data collection process. Literature coverage of this tool has been extensive (see, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0273475311430801">Cunliffe, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0273475311430801">Haigh, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0273475311430801">Pavlovich, Collins, &amp; Jones, 2009</xref>), with authors commonly agreeing that it offers a clear opportunity to become a reflective practitioner, more equipped to identify, respond, and solve problems. Interestingly, the focus invariably is on the individual learning experience. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0273475311430801">Locke and Brazelton (1997)</xref> put it, it involves a private process whereby the author flirts with self-indulgence to focus on “me” and develop self-awareness. In this study, data are drawn specifically from the <italic>author’s learning journal</italic>. These data provide insights into the individual and collective EL learner experiences albeit from the author’s perspective. The focus on the learner excludes client feedback, a study limitation.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0273475311430801">Table 2</xref> summarizes the EL projects central to the discussion. They are separated into three stages reflecting different educational contexts. The projects are not unique. Their value lies in the insights they provide into <italic>learner disengagement in EL</italic>. The project central to Chapter 1, <italic>A Lady of Leisure (1991-1997)</italic>, was integrated into the delivery of a 10-credit, final year, undergraduate course “Recreational Management,” taken by 25 business studies learners. The 1992-1993 cohort organized “Football Crazy,” a “live event” for the general public with all monies raised donated to a local children’s charity. These were the days before Event Management had gained any real academic prominence, in the United Kingdom at least (results coded Project 1). In Chapter 2, <italic>A Hospitable Interlude (1997-2005)</italic>, the author moved to the “flamboyancy and exuberance” (Author Journal entry: November 22, 1997) of a Department of Hospitality and Tourism Management and the role of academic placement tutor. The term <italic>tutor</italic> or <italic>lecturer</italic> in the United Kingdom refers to the academic staff member primarily responsible for delivering the course. The term equates to an American <italic>professor</italic>. The role of placement tutor involved overseeing the 48-week field placement period for undergraduate learners, which occurred in year 3 of a 4-year undergraduate program (results coded Project 2).</p>

<p>Chapter 3, <italic>Back to Business (2005-present)</italic>, involved a move into a Management School environment and responsibility for one 15-credit MBA course (co-taught with another tutor) and one 10-credit undergraduate course (second and final year business learners) with EL components. Five client-based projects have been completed, coded accordingly. In Project 3a, MBA learners were required to research and report on a customer strategy for a private sector operator (2006-2007). In Project 3b, MBA learners were required to develop a marketing strategy for a not-for-profit organization (2007-2008). In Project 3c, undergraduate learners were required to develop a marketing strategy for an independent preparatory school (2007-2008). In Project 3d, undergraduate learners were required to explore the effectiveness of predetermined marketing messages for a HE institution (2008-2009). In Project 3e, undergraduate learners were required to report on the market potential of a new customer base for a leading travel company (2009-2010). Projects 3a to 3e followed a similar format. The tutor negotiated the project with the client. Both then introduced the project to the learner cohort. The learner was expected to research and deliver on the project within a specified period of time.</p>
<p>Commenting specifically on auto-ethnographic work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0273475311430801">Kempster and Stewart (2010)</xref> argue that approaches within this research family challenge the “traditional positivistic epistemological tenets of reliability, validity and generalization” (p. 209). The earlier work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0273475311430801">Y. Lincoln and Guba (1985)</xref> into naturalistic inquiry addresses this in detail, suggesting the central tenet of such research to be fundamentally framed by the need to establish trustworthiness. Here, “the basic issue in relation to trustworthiness is simple: How can an inquirer persuade his or her audience (including self) that the findings of an inquiry are worth paying attention to, worth taking account of?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0273475311430801">Y. Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985</xref>, p. 290). Questioning aspects of truth, value, applicability, consistency, and neutrality lead the authors to conclude that researchers should seek credible, transferable, dependable, and confirmable results in their pursuit of trustworthy data. In line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0273475311430801">Y. Lincoln and Guba’s (1985)</xref> suggestions, credibility is sought in this study through prolonged engagement with the research population, transferability through the collection of thick descriptions, dependability, and confirmability through auditing the data. The use of a reflexive journal underpins each of these criteria and helps facilitate an “iterative and reflective process to building the narrative” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0273475311430801">Kempster &amp; Stewart, 2010</xref>, p. 210).</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>This study uncovered a number of positive outcomes and recurring problems linked to the administration of EL activity, which echo the findings of earlier studies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0273475311430801">Parsons &amp; Lepkowska-White, 2009</xref>). As these outcomes and problems are not the focus of this study, they are not discussed in detail here, but rather they are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0273475311430801">Table 2</xref> to provide the broader context to the study.</p>
<sec id="section4-0273475311430801">
<title>A Continuum of Learner Disengagement</title>
<p>At the heart of this study was a questioning of learner engagement, or otherwise, with EL. A number of patterns emerged within the findings. These patterns are not reviewed chronologically here but rather on a problem basis. They are illustrated through the following four examples that are drawn from projects completed in Chapter 3. These are not isolated examples, but they are chosen specifically as they illustrate fundamental patterns emerging in the wider research data. These examples provide evidence not only of learner disengagement but also of the complexity and different forms this disengagement might take. They are located on a continuum of learner disengagement (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0273475311430801">Table 3</xref>). At one end of the continuum, the learner is disengaged through an inability to comprehend the EL exercise. This is the academically challenged learner in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0273475311430801">Table 3</xref> (see Example 1). At the other end they choose to disengage. This is the formulaic learner in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0273475311430801">Table 3</xref> (see Examples 2 and 3). The ambivalent learner represents the middle ground (see Example 4). Initially, the four examples are introduced and then explained through reference to generational theory in the discussion and conclusions that follow.</p>

<title>Example 1</title>
<p>Visiting Joe (Project 2), a Chinese undergraduate student on an industry placement year, the author discovered he had spent 4 months working in the hotel pot wash. Exploring why he had not questioned this (in)activity, the journal entry notes,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>According to Joe, they [hotel management] asked him to work there, told him it was an important function and good for his training!!! He told me that his upbringing in China had taught him to be respectful of authority . . . he didn’t feel able to question their request [hotel management] of him. He kept making the point that for him the placement was about appreciating management practices . . . he also was very clear that in China it was simply not acceptable to question authority. It was considered rude and disrespectful. (Author Journal Entry: September 22, 1999)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Through this encounter the author began to empathize with earlier arguments that learners may be insufficiently equipped to know what to look for in experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0273475311430801">Green &amp; Taber, 1978</xref>) and that “experience is subjective and a form of thought, but these thoughts are constructed and influenced both by our biography and by the social and cultural conditions within which they occur” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0273475311430801">Jarvis et al., 2003</xref>, p. 54). Whether his (in)activity was entirely linked to cultural differences is questioned by a further postexamination board journal entry however, “He’s failed pretty much everything . . . must be something fundamentally wrong here” (Author Journal Entry: June 22, 2000).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0273475311430801">
<title>Example 2</title>
<p>Prior to the start of Project 3c, the author met with four learners to discuss the requirements of the Market Research course. All were final year learners and were able to select the course as an option. An outline of the project was given and the opportunities it presented to develop skills, research skills particularly, which could be transferable within different work-based contexts outlined. There was some uncomfortable shuffling around and then one learner commented “to be honest we’re not that interested . . . we just want to achieve the best marks possible . . . is this going to be possible, or would you suggest taking a course with a normal assignment?” (Author Journal Entry: October 4, 2007). Normal in this context meant the production of an individual essay.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0273475311430801">
<title>Example 3</title>
<p>Project 3e began as any other: the tutor and client introduced the project and outlined the aims and expected outcomes of the work. Paul, Chloe, and Matthew approached the author at the end of the class. They wanted to “fire” the fourth member of their group as they felt this member did not have a suitable skill set for the work. The assessment requirements were explained to the group, including the fact that part of the assessment activity was the ability to work in groups and overcome such limitations. They would not be able to fire fellow employees in the workplace so easily. They remained unconvinced, one of the group subsequently leaving the course for another with an essay-based assessment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0273475311430801">
<title>Example 4</title>
<p>Project 3b involved analysis of customer databases. The learner was given access to these, but within a clearly defined timescale, confirmed at the outset of the activity. One group approached the author after their access had been denied. Their registration had expired as they had exceeded the set timescale. Only the client could reinstate their access and the client was unable to do so. The group became unhappy when their access could not be simply reinstated and argued that their assessment mark would be jeopardized as a consequence. They failed to appreciate that their lack of attention to time management had created the problem in the first place.</p>

<sec id="section9-0273475311430801" sec-type="discussion|conclusions">
<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>To make sense of these examples, we return to examining the role generational association and differences play in learner disengagement. Joe, in Example 1, was born into the final years of the Generation X birth cohort. This is of little significance in Joe’s case though: his limited academic competence is not a by-product of generational characteristics but rather reflective of his level of cognitive development. As an international learner, this development will be influenced in part by cultural factors, not least language differences. As different as cultural nuances might be though, these factors alone do not reduce the academic capacity of an individual. Consequently, they cannot be relied on to entirely explain Joe’s academic shortfalls. In Example 1, Joe is not critical of the EL activity. He is insufficiently equipped to maximize its potential. He lacks what Bruner, a social constructivist, describes as the “scaffolding: [a] supportive technique used to offer verbal or non-verbal guidance to children in the process of gaining a new skill or understanding . . . once the child feels competent, this particular bit of scaffolding support can be removed” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0273475311430801">Lindon, 2005</xref>, p. 41) necessary to engage with the activity.</p>
<p>Examples 2, 3, and 4 are quite different however. All learners are members of the Generation Y cohort. In Examples 2 and 3, the learner is discerning, discriminating, and strategic in the EL participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0273475311430801">Casey &amp; Goldman, 2010</xref>). The learner demonstrates their criticality by either opting cautiously into the EL exercise or, indeed in a number of instances, opting out of the course altogether <italic>because of</italic> the EL exercise. This is the <italic>formulaic learner</italic> in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0273475311430801">Table 3</xref>. Examples 1, 2, and 3 present extreme scenarios; in effect, they represent opposite ends of a continuum of disengagement (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0273475311430801">Table 3</xref>). The picture is less clear-cut however. There is considerable evidence to suggest that a degree of learners may be located in the middle of this continuum. That said, even being in the middle does not necessarily provide a satisfactory experience for the learner as Example 4 illustrates. In this example, there is a sense of learner dissatisfaction, but a resignation to the task in hand. This is the <italic>ambivalent learner</italic> in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0273475311430801">Table 3</xref>. But do all learners fit into the category of being disengaged? The answer is no, but the findings suggest that increasing numbers of undergraduate learners are likely to. Generational theory can help explain why.</p>
<p>Project 1, the early years of Project 2, and MBA learners in Projects 3a and 3b were populated in the main by Generation X learners, a generation experiencing variable academic and career success. Author journal entries corresponding to these projects show little learner questioning of EL activities per se, rather a questioning of particular features of the projects, how to access sponsorship, and advertise events, for instance. That EL was a part of learning activity and “messy” was taken for granted at this point. The experience provided by the project was considered important as the comments of an MBA learner illustrate: “an MBA is an MBA, I mean employers aren’t interested in your marks, just that you have an MBA . . . being able to work on real-life projects will be really important to talk about with future employers” (Project 3a). In the United Kingdom, Generation X is the generation educated before state testing in compulsory education became so formulaic. Equally learners engaged on Projects 1 and 2 entered HE in the United Kingdom before changes in HE funding shifted a greater financial burden on the learner cohort. This is the generation whose formative years were only beginning to be influenced by consumerism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0273475311430801">McNeal, 1999</xref>). This is the generation within which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0273475311430801">Kolb’s (1984)</xref> influential EL work was published. It is likely that the research process and development of the EL framework was influenced by the characteristics of Generation X too.</p>
<p>Contrast this with the latter years of Project 2 and Projects 3c, 3d, and 3e, which were largely populated by Generation Y learners. To remind us of the characteristics of these digital natives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0273475311430801">Prensky, 2001</xref>), they are thought to be civic minded, connected 24/7, self-confident, service-minded, optimistic, environmental, educated, entrepreneurial, bored by routine, opinionated, success-driven, diverse, lifestyle-centered, and goal orientated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0273475311430801">Deloitte, 2005</xref>). They have been socialized into a consumer driven society. Generation Y learners have arrived in higher education in greater numbers than earlier generations. The personal financial burden of HE is also greater than experienced by previous generations. Many of them are used to education being delivered in a highly structured manner and tested continuously in bite-sized chunks. The opportunity to continually enhance marks through resubmissions in compulsory education has fed their ambitious nature and raised their expectations of their educational “rights” in higher education. These “rights” play out in how they chose to engage, or otherwise, in the academic environment. Ethnographic data profiles them as wanting to follow tried and tested assessment formula, discriminating accordingly. They are less prepared, or even able, to be flexible and accommodating of other learners in case this has a negative influence on their overall mark. They want to be in control of their own achievements and are <italic>formulaic</italic> in achieving this.</p>
<p>Final year undergraduate learners in Projects 3c, 3d, and 3e illustrate this particularly well. These learners were particularly competitive and demonstrated <italic>both</italic> surface and strategic learner tendencies:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>surface</italic> characterised by a focus on rote learning, memorisation and reproduction, a lack of reflection and a preoccupation with completing the task . . . <italic>strategic</italic> characterised by a focus on assessment requirements and lecturer expectations, and a careful management of time and effort, with the aims of achieving high grades. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0273475311430801">Mann, 2001</xref>, p. 7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Their primary concern was achieving the best possible mark for the course. The EL activities included were not appreciated by these learners; indeed, in some instances, they were perceived to present barriers to success. They simply saw data collection as instrumental, a means to an end. They discriminated between courses on the grounds of the assessment process and were more inclined toward courses following “traditional” pedagogical formulae, essays, report writing, and the “passivity [of] lecture-based classroom education” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0273475311430801">Raelin, 2009</xref>, p. 403). Their primary motivation was to achieve the best degree classification possible so as to compete most effectively within the job marketplace.</p>
<p>With this mindset and worldview, EL projects become a threat to Generation Y. The innovative nature of EL may be perceived as a “wild card” (Project 3d). Group work reduces individual control. Constraints placed on access to clients and their information conflicts with the usual 24/7 connections of Generation Y and their expectations of immediate information access. Examination of the project, often through application measures, does not sit comfortably with the rote learning and examination this generation is used to. The financial burden of education is high. The learner need for results to outweigh this burden is equally high. This mindset threatens the future EL horizon. Not only may future learners be increasingly influenced by it, faculty and clients from other generations despair of it, but these <italic>are</italic> the leaders and faculty of tomorrow. Whether they will demonstrate the engagement and sensitivities toward future EL practices previous generations have remains to be seen. And this is also only the beginning of the story. Generation Z are being brought up in a similarly formulaic educational context. They are even more technically literate than Generation Y, retain individualistic tendencies, and are facing an even greater financial burden for HE. The oldest members of this generation will be entering HE in the near future. The question that we should now devote our attention to is how can we respond to this (r)evolution?</p>
<sec id="section10-0273475311430801">
<title>Practical Advice for Educators</title>
<p>We can simply ignore these changes and argue that learners gain from EL whether they like it or not. Adopting this stance might jeopardize the chance of learners appreciating the full benefits of EL however, to say nothing of the poor course feedback faculty will have to endure. The ethnographic data suggest that there is an appetite for EL. Learners do wish to be actively part of the “coauthored learning” experience, but so too they need academic and subsequent career success to offset the increasing costs attached to HE. There are a number of strategies we might employ to encourage learner buy-in. We could look closely at our selection of EL projects and match the project to the stage of study. Given the competitive nature of the learner cohort, particularly as they reach the final stages of their programs, using projects that are narrower in scope and have clear client terms of reference may reduce concerns. We could also move away from viewing coauthored learning as a linear process, that is, the facilitator presents the learner with the EL activity, the learner accepts and undertakes the work, to encouraging the learner to actually coauthor the experience from the outset. Making more of the project set-up process, and involving learners in project decision making, would allow us to move toward managing the expectations of the learner prior to the activity and including their expectations within the planning process.</p>
<p>We could also give more thought to matching projects to take account of the learner educational skill set as they enter HE and their wider generational learner characteristics. The call for integrating concurrency into team projects by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0273475311430801">Skilton, Forsyth, and White (2008)</xref> provides a possible direction here. Current (and future) generations of learners enter HE with high technical literacy. We need to question whether EL projects match this skill set or even use them in any discernible way. Although our institutions, even clients, may fall short in widespread access to technology our learner population does not. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0273475311430801">Prensky (2001)</xref> argues,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Our students have changed radically. Today’s students are no longer the people our educational system was designed to teach. . . . We need to invent Digital Native methodologies for <italic>all</italic> subjects, at <italic>all</italic> levels, using our students to guide us. (pp. 1, 6)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Projects linked to social networking, the use of smartphone technology, and other forms of social media would be a useful starting point. Alongside this, and recognizing that Generation Y learners are equally influenced by the ambitious characteristics of their peer generation, we could also seek ways of adding value to the project. Negotiating a certificate of completion from the client that could be used in job searches, for instance, could offer more tangible evidence of client-based experiences, so often a job selection discriminator, particularly in the early days of career development.</p>
<p>These suggestions are controversial and may be criticized as pampering to an already spoon-fed learner cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0273475311430801">Raelin, 2009</xref>). Why should faculty adjust their practices to accommodate the learner? These suggestions are not intended, or designed, to compromise academic standards. Really, they offer practical ideas as to ways in which we can tinker with the architecture of EL in a measured way. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0273475311430801">Essid (2006)</xref>, commenting on education more generally, observes, “If we cherish our discipline’s survival, we should consider how to meet students halfway by encouraging active learning, multigenre projects, and writing for real-world audiences.” As faculty, we know that EL projects are time consuming to run yet can be incredibly beneficial experiences to be involved in. Our challenge now is to continue to articulate these benefits alongside facilitating learner engagement in such a way that the meaning and contribution of the EL experience to the learning process will stand a greater chance of being fully appreciated by future generations of learner cohorts too.</p>

<title>Future Research</title>
<p>There are many limitations to a study of this nature however. It is possible that the differences observed are influenced by the different subject areas (hospitality management, tourism management, marketing) contributing to the study. They may in fact provide further evidence of a discipline divide discussed in the seminal work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0273475311430801">Becher (1989)</xref> and critiqued more recently by Neu<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0273475311430801">mann (2001)</xref>. Equally there may be a tutor or client effect too, neither of which has been thoroughly investigated here. Ethnographic work is influenced heavily by the author, experiences are selected for inclusion, perhaps because they make the work appear more interesting. Observations are all treated as if they hold some hidden meaning when this may not necessarily be the case. This article does not look at ongoing experiences through everyday studies but rather selects particular case studies, snapshots, where there is a clear experiential element as its focus. Educational ethnographies are equally subjective and provide us with insights into particular environments at particular points in time. Can the findings be transferred elsewhere? That said, the ethnographic framework has allowed us an insight into the “complex and multi-layered practices and meanings” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0273475311430801">Gordon, Holland, &amp; Lahelma, 2007</xref>, p. 199) of the learning experience. It has raised some important questions about the learner of tomorrow, the implications of which are worthy of further research.</p>
