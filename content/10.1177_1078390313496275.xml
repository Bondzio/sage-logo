<abstract>
<p>Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States. Approximately 90,000 psychiatric mental health (PMH) nurse generalists work in hospitals in the United States, mostly on inpatient psychiatric units where the most acutely suicidal patients are hospitalized. Although competencies have been developed for mental health clinicians in assessing and managing suicide risk, there are no standard competencies for PMH nurse generalists. Widely accepted nursing practices do not meet suicide-specific standards of care or evidence-based criteria. Although both the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education Essentials for Baccalaureate Education and the Quality and Safety Education for Nurses competencies stress the necessity for comprehensive assessment, safe clinical practices, patient-centered care, evidence-based interventions, and interprofessional communication and collaboration, there are no specific requirements for suicide prevention training in educational and clinical programs. The American Psychiatric Nurses Association has an opportunity to provide leadership in developing, implementing, and evaluating competency-based training for nurses and partner with the national effort to increase the competencies in suicide prevention in the behavioral health workforce.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Safety issues surrounding the care and treatment of persons at risk for suicide continues to be a concern for advanced practice and generalist psychiatric mental health (PMH) nurses in both community and hospital settings. In addition, health care accrediting bodies prioritize suicide prevention, identification, and treatment as a priority. Death as a result of suicide seriously affects multiple survivors and is believed to be mostly preventable if a person at risk for suicide is properly screened and identified, and competent mental health professionals intervene promptly. Suicide has repeatedly ranked in the top 5 most frequently reviewed sentinel event categories since 1995 and was the 4th most frequently reviewed sentinel event in 2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1078390313496275">The Joint Commission, 2012</xref>). In addition, when analyzing root cause information, assessment and communication were the top two factors contributing to the suicides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1078390313496275">The Joint Commission, 2013a</xref>). It is for this reason that The Joint Commission emphasizes that hospitals identify patients at risk for suicide by specific patient characteristics and environmental features and include strategies for meeting immediate safety needs in the most appropriate treatment setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1078390313496275">The Joint Commission, 2013b</xref>). Approximately 90,000 psychiatric nurses work in the hospitals in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078390313496275">Hanrahan, 2009</xref>). Psychiatric mental health nurse generalists are the consistent providers in the inpatient setting who assess, monitor and intervene with the most vulnerable patients. By providing evidence informed interventions for patients at risk for suicide, adequately trained PMH nurse generalists can help prevent suicide and improve outcomes for hospitalized patients. This article provides the rationale for the American Psychiatric Nurses Association (APNA) to advance the development of competencies and a competency-based, consumer centered curriculum in suicide risk assessment, prevention, and intervention for PMH nurse generalists working in inpatient settings.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="section3-1078390313496275">
<title>Epidemiology</title>
<p>Suicide was the tenth leading cause of death in the United States in 2010, with 38,364 persons committing suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1078390313496275">McIntosh &amp; Drapeau, 2012</xref>). The highest rates of suicide were in men (20.0 per 100,000), Whites (14.1 per 100,000), and persons aged 44 to 54 years (19.6 per 100,000). The primary methods used were firearms (50.5%) and suffocation/hanging (24.7%). Approximately 5% to 6% of all suicide deaths each year in the United States occur in hospital settings with prevalence between 0.1% and 0.4% of all psychiatric admissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1078390313496275">Simon &amp; Hales, 2006</xref>). The primary method of completed suicide within inpatient psychiatric units is hanging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1078390313496275">Mills, King, Watts, &amp; Hemphill, 2013</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section4-1078390313496275">
<title>Historical Perspectives</title>
<p>Establishing a foundation for understanding and preventing suicide in the United States began in the 1950s, and in 1966 the National Institute for Mental Health established the Center for Studies of Suicide Prevention. In the early 1980s, the Center for Disease Control identified the alarming increase in youth suicide rates, and suicide prevention became part of the CDC Injury Prevention Center initiative. In response to national consumer advocacy efforts, Surgeon General Satcher issued his <italic>Call to Action to Prevent Suicide</italic> in 1999 that provided the framework of “Awareness, Intervention and Methodology” (AIM) for addressing suicide prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1078390313496275">U.S. Public Health Service, 1999</xref>). These and other efforts culminated over time with the release of the 2001 National Strategy for Suicide Prevention. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration established the Suicide Prevention Resource Center, and has developed multiple strategies in training, identification of best practices, and the development of resources in suicide prevention. Finally, in 2010, the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention called for the formation of the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention to help guide the implementation of the goals and objectives recommended in the National Strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1078390313496275">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2012</xref>). Nurses need to participate through APNA in the National Strategy to represent the largest workforce that provides care for patients at risk for suicide.</p>

<title>Review of the Literature</title>
<sec id="section6-1078390313496275">
<title>Systematic Reviews on Inpatient Suicide</title>
<p>Inpatient psychiatric patients are at high risk for suicide and discharge from a psychiatric inpatient unit is strongly associated with death by suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078390313496275">Knesper et al., 2010</xref>). Three international reviews of suicides occurring in inpatient units or shortly after discharge indicate that inpatient suicide was associated with affective disorders, depressive symptoms, schizophrenia, anxiety, previous self-harm, the first week of psychiatric admission, immediate days postdischarge, elopement, authorized absence off the unit, and associated with specific methods, such as hanging and jumping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078390313496275">Bowers, Nijman, &amp; Banda, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078390313496275">Combs &amp; Romm, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078390313496275">Large, Smith, Sharma, Nielssen, &amp; Singh, 2011</xref>). The authors identified poor risk assessment and ineffective patient monitoring as causative factors.</p>
<p>Most systematic reviews of suicide interventions have focused on community interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1078390313496275">York et al., 2013</xref>). In an internationally based systematic review, suicide experts reviewed the efficacy of 91 suicide prevention interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1078390313496275">Mann et al., 2005</xref>) and concluded restriction of access to lethal methods and education of physicians were interventions that reduced suicide rates.</p>

<title>The Need for Suicide-Specific Health Education for Providers</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078390313496275">The Annapolis Coalition on the Behavioral Health Workforce (2007)</xref> identified the need for focused core competencies and competency-based curricula. Although for decades community and workplace settings included suicide training of gatekeeper, consumer, and peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1078390313496275">Suicide Prevention Resource Center [SPRC] &amp; American Association of Suicidality [AAS], 2008</xref>), there is a gap in suicide-specific intervention training in educational programs for mental health professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1078390313496275">Lyons et al., 2005</xref>). As an exemplar, the Veterans Health Administration (VA) provides national leadership in suicide prevention including training mental health providers in suicide prevention and implementing evidence-based suicide-specific interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078390313496275">Department of Veterans Affairs, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078390313496275">Knesper et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1078390313496275">Matthieu, Cross, Batres, Flora, &amp; Knox, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1078390313496275">National Action Alliance, 2011</xref>). There remains a need for randomized trials that examine provider adherence and patient outcomes post training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078390313496275">Hawks et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078390313496275">Institute of Medicine, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The 2012 National Suicide Prevention Strategy goals include the following: promoting suicide prevention as a core component of health care services, promoting and implementing effective clinical and professional practices, and assessing and treating those identified at risk for suicidal behaviors. At the core of training in suicide prevention is training in best practices, evidence-based practice, and guidelines.</p>

<title>Studies of Inpatient Interventions to Reduce Suicidality</title>
<p>Environmental safety is the mainstay of inpatient suicide prevention and is consistent with the Institute of Medicine’s focus on a culture of safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1078390313496275">Mills et al., 2010</xref>). The VA tested the Mental Health Environment of Care Checklist in 113 facilities and identified 7,642 hazards. In abating 76.3% of those hazards within a year, the authors recommended eliminating structures capable of supporting a hanging object, including structures close to the floor, and reducing strangulation devices and access to dangerous objects and sharps, and opportunities for defenestration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1078390313496275">
<title>Reviews of Best Practice Interventions to Reduce Suicidality</title>
<p>There has been little research evaluating the effectiveness of inpatient psychotherapeutic interventions to reduce suicidality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078390313496275">Ellis, Green, Allen, Jobes, &amp; Nadorff, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1078390313496275">Jobes, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078390313496275">Knesper et al., 2010</xref>). A few studies specific to inpatient care underscored continuity of care, chain of completed care, follow-up interventions, combination therapy and pharmacotherapy, and multicomponent interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078390313496275">Department of Veterans Affairs, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078390313496275">Fleischman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078390313496275">Knesper et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1078390313496275">Motto &amp; Bostrom, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1078390313496275">Shoenbaum, Heissen, &amp; Pearson, 2009</xref>). The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and the Suicide Prevention Resource Center conducted a federally funded systematic review of suicide prevention programs and developed the Best Practices Registry (BPR). The BPR lists few best practices relevant to inpatient care, other than dialectical behavior therapy and means restriction education for families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1078390313496275">Kruesi, York, &amp; Hirsch, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding Brown’s handbook of measures of suicidality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078390313496275">Brown, 2002</xref>), systematic reviews have asserted there is limited evidence available on the effectiveness of measures for the identification of those at risk for self-directed violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1078390313496275">National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2011</xref>). Few studies focus on therapeutic relationships, a dimension critical to nursing assessment and monitoring in the inpatient unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078390313496275">Bagley, Munjas, &amp; Shekelle, 2010</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section10-1078390313496275">
<title>Suicide-Specific Clinical Guidelines</title>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078390313496275">American Psychiatric Association (2003)</xref> developed guidelines for the assessment and treatment of patients with suicidal behaviors and mostly focus on outpatient interventions. However, the authors acknowledge that (a) hospitalization per se is not necessarily treatment but rather a safe, therapeutic environment where conditions can be treated and managed while ultimately reducing the risk for suicide and (b) data are not available to substantiate that inpatient hospitalization is effective in preventing suicide.</p>
<p>The Joint Commission National Patient Safety Goal 15.01.01 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1078390313496275">The Joint Commission, 2013b</xref>) requires behavioral health care organizations, psychiatric hospitals, and general hospitals treating individuals for emotional or behavioral disorders identification of individuals at risk for suicide. Elements of performance include (a) conducting a risk assessment identifying individual and environmental risk factors, (b) addressing the individual’s immediate safety needs and appropriate treatment setting, and (c) providing suicide prevention information at discharge.</p>
<p>The Care in Systems Framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1078390313496275">National Action Alliance, 2011</xref>) proposed that behavioral health organizations must create an organizational culture and manage a care environment around this cultural shift to make suicide a never event. In this framework, critical elements are associated with successful, novel approaches and positive outcomes in suicide prevention, including core values, systems management, and evidence-based practice.</p>

<sec id="section11-1078390313496275">
<title>Outcomes of Suicide Prevention</title>
<p>Central to the evaluation of suicide intervention (including training) are issues such as direct versus indirect outcomes of suicide prevention interventions. Direct outcomes (morbidity and mortality) include suicidal behavior such as ideation, attempts, and completed suicide as defined in the revised nomenclature of suicidality. In fact, multiple suicide attempters are uniquely different from suicide ideators or single attempters in terms of greater pathology. Past suicide behavior distinctly predicts future suicidal behavior, but predicting first attempts has perpetually posed problems in risk assessment. The duration of risk can be a few hours to days or even years in chronic suicide, thereby hampering accurate prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078390313496275">Bryan, Johnson, Rudd, &amp; Joiner, 2008</xref>). Intermediate outcomes (also referred to as indirect outcomes, variables, or proxies) occur in the causal pathway between a determinant and the final health outcome. These outcomes can include increases in knowledge, changes in attitudes, skill building, (identification of at risk persons), referrals, and decreases in depression, anxiety, and hopelessness in at-risk persons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1078390313496275">York et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1078390313496275">
<title>The Consumer Perspective</title>
<p>The consumer movement in the 1990s included primarily those who had experienced a loved one’s suicide and subsequently those who survived a suicide attempt. They were and continue to be a powerful force in the national attempt to raise awareness of the experience of surviving a suicide attempt and the effects of suicide on others. In conjunction with the Recovery to Practice initiative, funded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the consumer movement has cultivated safe, trusting, and empathic relationships between clinicians and patients. However, what is still lacking is public and professional elucidation of the inpatient experience of those hospitalized (frequently against their will) on locked units after suicide attempts. The unique experience of hospitalized suicidal patients needs to be addressed to aid nurses in their compassionate assessment of risk for patients. The patient’s experience is marked by despair, anguish, hopelessness, and isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078390313496275">Arauz, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Often the person deemed a threat to self, to the public, or the property of another is removed from his home, family, and community. While deeply symptomatic, he is placed on a hospital ward, where freedoms are taken away, and he is not involved in any of the decisions that affect his daily life: when to bathe, when to eat, when to go outside, where to live, whom to live with, and when to be finally released. Many times he is given medications that he has not chosen and is forced to tolerate side effects that come with these, potentially robbing him of his physical senses while his active mental illness creates thicker walls between him and reality. His life becomes something he can no longer control or understand. The psychic pain is constant and his hope wanes as each day passes with involuntarily commitment to a hospital he never chose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078390313496275">Arauz, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The person feels alone yet sees the staff working together in their familiarity with each other. They are a team but the patient does not feel a part of that team. He feels watched without conversation, like an animal in a zoo. He wants and needs for someone to reach out to him, touch his shoulder, and break the concrete block of his mind. He wants and needs a connection because he cannot connect, even with himself. He wants someone to tell him it will get better. He wants someone to talk with him about who he is and not about his disease. The staff is all he has at that moment, and he yearns to know they care about him. His mind races with self-recrimination and thoughts that he should die and life will never get better. He fears that the staff hates him as much as he hates himself. Finally, he wants the staff to guide him toward recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078390313496275">Arauz, 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Areas of Contention</title>
<p>Goal 7 of the 2012 National Action Alliance Care: Critical Intervention Task Force seeks to provide training to clinical staff in suicide prevention and related issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1078390313496275">Office of the Surgeon General &amp; National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention, 2012</xref>). Currently, there are no standard competencies for PMH nurse generalists even though the American Association of Suicidology (AAS) and the SPRC (revised 2007) developed evidence-based competencies and competency-based training (applicable for Advanced Practice Registered Nurses [APRNs]) in the mid-1990s. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078390313496275">AAS (2013)</xref> also recently published a policy paper targeting psychiatrists, social workers, psychologists, and counselors but not nurse generalists. Efforts to include inpatient nurses remain unheeded, even though PMH nurse generalists in the hospital have the greatest contact with suicidal patients.</p>
<p>The American Association of Colleges of Nursing and its subsidiary the Quality and Safety Education for Nurses (QSEN) have published standards used by schools of nursing to establish essential competencies for nurse generalists. Although the Essentials for Baccalaureate Education have four areas that can be interpreted to include suicide assessment and intervention, there is nothing specific to direct schools of nursing to include this content. Similarly, the six QSEN competences are all vaguely requiring the nurse generalist to be competent in suicide assessment, however, there is no specific directive for training in this area. In fact, an actual reference to suicide is absent in all the documents critical for curricular development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078390313496275">American Association of Colleges of Nursing, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078390313496275">Cronenwett et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>An important theme related to nursing education and training emerged in the findings from one qualitative study with 12 PMH nurse participants. The education of the participants ranged from associate to graduate degrees in nursing. The experience level varied from 2 to 33 years. All were direct care nurses in inpatient psychiatric settings. The settings ranged from public institutions to private hospitals across nine states. Not one participant believed their education prepared them for working with suicidal individuals. They described their orientation within work settings as “baptism by fire” or the equivalent with few exceptions. More than half of the participants indicated continuing education related specifically to inpatient nursing care of suicidal patients was limited at best. Of note, participants expressed a sense of inadequacy when caring for anyone with a substantive suicidal risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078390313496275">Greene, 2004</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section14-1078390313496275">
<title>Position</title>
<p>APNA believes that ultimately the individual nurse is responsible to practice competently, based on research and evidence and within his/her scope, to assist persons with mental illness in his/her process of recovery. This is supported by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1078390313496275">Institute of Medicine’s (2010)</xref> report on the future of nursing, which states that nurses should practice to the full extent of their education and training. Reduction of suicidality is a critical dimension of recovery and essential for quality of life. Thus, APNA supports a sustained commitment for the development of guidelines/competencies/standards of care for PMH nurse generalists who care for persons at risk for suicide. Moreover, we recognize the need to collaborate with other mental health professionals, consumers/clients, families, advocacy groups, and regulatory bodies to ensure that PMH nurse generalists are competent to assess and manage the care of people at risk for suicide.</p>
<p>Therefore, APNA</p>
<list id="list1-1078390313496275" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Acknowledges that there are serious gaps in nursing education specifically in the area of suicide risk assessment, prevention, and intervention.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Recognizes that despite the development of suicide prevention therapeutic frameworks, core competencies, guidelines, and standards of care for psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and advanced practice nurses, none have been developed specifically for inpatient PMH nurse generalists.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Identifies that although generalist nurses represent the largest professional workforce in inpatient psychiatric units with 24-hour accountability for the care and safety of the most vulnerable persons with mental illness, they have limited training in the assessment and management of persons at risk for suicide.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Recognizes that there are no developed structures and processes for the education and training of generalist nurses who provide care and treatment to people at risk for suicide in psychiatric settings.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Therefore, APNA Board of Directors will convene a task force to address these issues for psychiatric mental health nursing.</p>
