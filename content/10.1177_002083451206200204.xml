<p>62.1947 ACHTERBERG, Peter; HOUTMAN, Dick; DERKS, Anton — <bold>Two of a kind? An empirical investigation of anti-welfarism and economic egalitarianism [in the Netherlands].</bold> <italic>Public Opinion Quarterly</italic> 75(4), Winter 2011: 748–760.</p>
<p>The literature on welfare state legitimacy generally views economic egalitarianism and support for the welfare state as closely related phenomena that can be measured by means of scales that are considered highly interchangeable. This research note argues that economic egalitarianism does not necessarily coincide with support for the welfare state. Moreover, especially among those with the lowest levels of education, economic egalitarianism is related to anti-welfarism — a highly critical view of the welfare state. Based on an analysis of recent Dutch representative survey data (2006), this article [examines] whether there are in fact two ideological dimensions: support for the welfare state and economic egalitarianism. Moreover, both dimensions can be explained differently. Although both are rooted in economic security, support for the welfare state also is rooted in feelings of anomie. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.1948 ADAMS, James; VRIES, Catherine E. De; LEITER, Debra — <bold>Subconstituency reactions to elite depolarization in the Netherlands: an analysis of the Dutch public's policy beliefs and partisan loyalties, 1986–98.</bold> <italic>British Journal of Political Science</italic> 42(1), Jan. 2012: 81–105.</p>
<p>During the 1980s and the 1990s, the elites of the two largest Dutch parties converged dramatically in debates on income-redistribution, nuclear power and the overall Left-Right dimension, paving the way for the Dutch party system's polarization on immigration and cultural issues. Did the Dutch mass public depolarize along with party elites, and, if so, was this mass-level depolarization confined to affluent, educated, politically engaged citizens? Analysis of Dutch Parliamentary Election Study respondents' policy beliefs and partisan loyalties in 1986–1998 shows that the mass public depolarized during this period, and that this extended equally throughout the electorate. These conclusions mirror previous findings on Britain, but differ from those on the US, and have important implications for political representation and for parties' election strategies. [R]</p>
<p>62.1949 AGUILAR FERNÁNDEZ, Susana — <bold>El movimiento antiabortista en la España del siglo XXI: el protagonismo de los grupos laicos cristianos y su alianza <italic>de facto</italic> con la Iglesia católica (The Spanish 21st c. anti-abortion movement: the leadership of Christian lay groups and their de <italic>facto</italic> alliance with the Catholic Church).</bold> <italic>Revista de Estudios políticos</italic> 154, Oct.-Dec. 2011: 11–39.</p>
<p>One of the new traits of the antiabortion protest over the last decades is that it has been led by social groups and experts, not connected with the church, who emphasize scientific, rather than moral or religious arguments. Unlike other religious institutions, the Spanish Catholic church has clearly played the role of an adversarial interest group and has been <italic>de facto</italic> an important ally of Christian social groups.

<p>62.1950 AKÇALI, Pinar; MURZAEVA, Dinara — <bold>Political leadership in Kyrgyzstan: perceptions and expectations of citizens.</bold> <italic>Orta Asya ve Kafkasya Araştirmalari</italic> (<italic>Journal of Central Asian and Caucasian Studies</italic>) 12, 2011: 22–37.</p>
<p>This article [examines] the concept of political leadership, a topic of utmost importance in understanding the dynamics of the process of post-Soviet political transition in the region, in terms of perceptions and expectations of the ordinary citizens of Kyrgyzstan. Kyrgyzstan remains the only Central Asian country in which two presidents, A. Akaev and K. Bakiev, were ousted by popular uprisings in 2005 and 2010 respectively. As such, it seems important to understand the opinions of the ordinary people of the country about political leadership in general and what they expect from a “good” political leader in particular. The article also clarifies the perspectives of the led rather than the leader, an obvious tendency dominating the literature on political leadership. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.1951 ALBERT, Isaac Olawale — <bold>Violences électorales au cours de la IVe République nigériane (Electoral violence in Nigeria's Fourth Republic).</bold> <italic>Afrique contemporaine</italic> 239, 2011: 105–118. [Résumé en français]</p>
<p>In 1999, Nigeria returned to electoral democracy after a long period of military rule. Since then, three elections have taken place, in 2003, 2007 and 2011 — each accompanied by a continuous escalation of violence. However, the 2011 elections presented an interesting paradox. While new forms of terror tactics marked the pre-electoral season, the elections themselves were free and fair — and without violence. But immediately after the presidential election, on 16 April 2011, rioters burned for three days some areas of northern Nigeria, killing several hundred victims.

<p>62.1952 ALBRIGHT, Jeremy J.; MAIR, Peter — <bold>Does the number of parties to place affect the placement of parties? Results from an expert survey experiment.</bold> <italic>Electoral Studies</italic> 30(4), Dec. 2011: 858–864.</p>
<p>Expert surveys are frequently used in comparative politics to measure the ideological locations of political parties. However, it is possible that increasing the number of parties to place systematically biases results as experts try to fit more actors onto a common space. We test this possibility with an experiment embedded in an “expert” survey — with graduate students serving as our pool of experts to ensure an adequate sample size — by varying the number of parties to be placed in the UK and Germany. We find some tendency for the variance of Labor and SPD placements to diminish when more parties are present, and for SPD placements to move toward the center given more parties. However, we find no consistent evidence that the number of parties systematically affects mean or median party placements. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.1953 ALKAN, Haluk; EROĞLU, Müzeyyen — <bold>Türk Cumhuriyetlerinde siyasal partiler: Kazakistan ve Özbekistan siyasal parti sisteleri üzeine karşilaştirmali bir analiz (Political parties in the Turkic Republics: a comparative analysis of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan political party systems).</bold> <italic>Orta Asya ve Kafkasya Arastirmalari (Journal of Central Asian and Caucasian Studies)</italic> 12, 2011: 68–87.</p>
<p>Political parties are one of the most important criteria in the analysis of a country's democratization process. Post-Soviet Turkic Republics took over structures of the local Communist Party from Soviet system. Traditional party structures of these countries played a significant role in the establishment of the post-independence party system. This article analyzes Kazakhstan, where dominant-custodian party system with limited space for opposition parties has been institutionalized and Uzbekistan, where a corporatist system with no room for opposition parties has emerged. For this analysis, the political parties' law of the two countries is explained and the differences between these countries are dealt with. [R]</p>
<p>62.1954 ALLEN, Nicholas; BIRCH, Sarah — <bold>On either side of a moat? Elite and [UK] mass attitudes towards right and wrong.</bold> <italic>European Journal of Political Research</italic> 51(1), Jan. 2012: 89–116.</p>
<p>This article develops a cognitive institutionalist account of mass and elite evaluations of political ethics, which is tested on a new dataset from the UK. The analysis explores the extent of contemporary disagreement among British political elites and those they represent by comparing responses to questions asked in a representative survey of the public with similar questions asked of incumbent MPs and parliamentary candidates. There are systematic differences between members of the public, candidates and MPs at both aggregate and individual levels — differences which can be accounted for with reference to the framing effects of Parliament as an institution.

<p>62.1955 ANCELOVICI, Marcos — <bold>In search of lost radicalism: the hot autumn of 2010 and the transformation of labor contention in France.</bold> <italic>French Politics, Culture and Society</italic> 29(3), Winter 2011: 121–140.</p>
<p>This article asks whether the wave of protest in the fall of 2010 in France can be interpreted as evidence of persisting radicalism. It argues that, despite appearances, the French labor movement is no longer radical. Industrial conflict is disappearing: strong legacies and institutional processes still feed conflict in the workplace and often push workers to use contentious, extra-institutional means; but industrial conflict is not what it used to be, being reconfigured and transformed. Labor contention is no longer driven by an offensive agenda and has become essentially defensive. If there is radicalism left in France, it might be best described as a “radicalism of tradition”. The article discusses the relevance of “radicalism” as an analytical category to make sense of labor contention in contemporary France. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.2179]</p>
<p>62.1956 ANDERSON, Cameron D.; ROY, Jason — <bold>Local economies and national economic evaluations [in Canada]</bold>. <italic>Electoral Studies</italic> 30(4), Dec. 2011: 795–803.</p>
<p>This work examines the effects of three types of factors influential to the formation of national economic evaluations: predispositions (such as age, gender, income, partisanship), information and attentiveness, and objective local economic conditions (local unemployment rates). Our findings broadly confirm the influential role each set of factors plays in shaping national economic perceptions. We then extend the literature, demonstrating that the impact of the local economic environment is conditional on attention to media, political information and education. Using a combined dataset of the 2006 Canadian Election Studies with neighborhood level economic indicators drawn from Canadian Census data (2006), our findings show that, in developing perceptions of the national economy, more attentive, more informed and more educated individuals are less influenced by local economic conditions than their less attentive, less informed and less educated counterparts.

<p>62.1957 AUSTIN, Leila — <bold>The politics of youth bulge: from Islamic activism to democratic reform in the Middle East and North Africa.</bold> <italic>SAIS Review of International Affairs</italic> 31(2), Summer-fall 2011: 81–96.</p>
<p>This article looks at how the problematic category of Muslim youth is constructed and how the culture and politics of this group leads to new trajectories, conditions, and choices that have dramatically shifted the nature of politics in the region. Moreover, the demographic policies that have fueled the youth bulge in this region have had the paradoxical effect of creating a highly educated and increasingly politicized young female population that has become a political force in its own right, working to transform the politico-religious landscape of the Muslim Middle East.

<p>62.1958 AYEE, Joseph R. A. — <bold>Manifestos and elections in Ghana's Fourth Republic.</bold> <italic>South African Journal of International Affairs</italic> 18(3), Dec. 2011: 367–384.</p>
<p>Debate continues over the factors that influence electoral outcomes or voter behavior and alignment in elections all over the world. Several factors have been noted, including the manifestos of political parties. Despite the potential influence of the party manifesto, several comparative and empirical studies on elections in Ghana have paid little or no attention to manifestos in determining the electoral outcomes of political parties in the Fourth Republic. This paper contributes to the debate by examining how manifestos have influenced the electoral chances of the two main political parties which have been in and out of government in Ghana since the inception of the Fourth Republic: the National Democratic Congress and the New Patriotic Party. Analysis covers the five elections held in 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004 and 2008. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.1959 AZMANOVA, Albena — <bold>After the left-right (dis)continuum: globalization and the remaking of Europe's ideological geography.</bold> <italic>International Political Sociology</italic> 5(4), Dec. 2011: 384–407.</p>
<p>This article examines the status of globalization as a causal factor in political mobilization and proposes a research agenda for diagnosing the impact of global socio-economic dynamics on ideological orientation in national polities. Focusing on Europe's established democracies, the article outlines recent shifts in Europe's ideological landscape and explores the mechanisms generating a new pattern of political conflict and electoral competition. It advances the hypothesis that the knowledge economy of open borders has brought about a political cleavage intimately linked to citizens' perceptions of the social impact of global economic integration. In this context, the polarization of life chances is determined by institutionally mediated exposure to both the economic opportunities and the hazards of globalization. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.1960 BACCARO, Lucio; HOWELL, Chris — <bold>A common neoliberal trajectory: the transformation of industrial relations in advanced capitalism.</bold> <italic>Politics and Society</italic> 39(4), Dec. 2011: 521–563.</p>
<p>Based on quantitative indicators for fifteen advanced countries between 1974 and 2005, and case studies of France, the UK, Germany, Italy, Sweden, and Ireland, this article analyzes the trajectory of institutional change in the industrial relations systems of advanced capitalist societies, with a focus on Western Europe. In contrast to current comparative political economy scholarship, which emphasizes the resilience of national institutions to common challenges and trends, it argues that despite a surface resilience of distinct national sets, all countries have been transformed in a neoliberal direction. Neoliberal transformation manifests itself not just as institutional deregulation but also as institutional conversion, as the functions associated with existing institutional forms change in a convergent direction.

<p>62.1961 BAFUMI, Joseph; PARENT, Joseph M. — <bold>International polarity and America's polarization.</bold> <italic>International Politics</italic> 49(1), Jan. 2012: 1–35.</p>
<p>There is a growing consensus that the US is undergoing a period of political polarization, particularly among elites. The causes of this polarization remain under-researched. We argue that shifts in the international distribution of power influence America's polarization. To demonstrate the argument, this article analyzes changes in power and polarization quantitatively and qualitatively from 1945 to 2005. A key finding is that greater relative power on the world stage substantially increases polarization and some of its correlates, like income inequality. The argument also measures the extent of international influence on domestic polarization and makes novel predictions on when and why polarization will fall. [R]</p>
<p>62.1962 BALBI, Carmen Rosa; PALMER, David Scott — <bold>Elecciones en Perú 2011: una polarización inesperada (The 2011 [presidential] elections in Peru: an unexpected polarization).</bold> <italic>Cuadernos americanos</italic> 138, 2011: 11–40.</p>
<p>The article aims to analyze the presidential elections held in Peru between April and June 2011. It examines the configuration of the political options for the presidential elections, in particular the confrontation that arose during the second round of said electoral process, characterized by the defeat of the center. In this second round, the presidential election was defined, and a confrontation ensued between Fujimorismo — which rules in the nineties taking the form of a dictatorship — and the candidate Ollanta Humala who, representing the amalgamation of the left, came our triumphant, consolidating a center-left government in Peru as a product of the alliances.

<p>Scholarship on [US] congressional elections typically analyzes either the sum or the division of the major party vote at the district level. Our main innovation is to model the votes received by each candidate as a separate dependent variable, utilizing statistical methods developed to analyze multiparty elections. Because we are dealing with a substantive area in which endogeneity problems are rampant, we synthesize an instrumental variables approach with a “compositional data” model. This approach allows one to study the mobilizing and persuasive effects of congressional campaigns at the aggregate level. [R]</p>
<p>62.1964 BEHREND, Jacqueline — <bold>The unevenness of democracy at the subnational level: provincial closed games in Argentina.</bold> <italic>Latin American Research Review</italic> 46(1), 2011: 150–176.</p>
<p>Democratization studies initially focused on processes at the national level, but in recent years, there has been a growing interest in the spatially uneven nature of democracy at the subnational level. This article draws on examples from Argentina and develops an analytical framework of closed games to analyze the functioning of subnational democracy. It argues that the less democratic provinces or states of nationally democratic countries are not necessarily authoritarian and that the concept of subnational authoritarianism prevents us from seeing political dynamics that may arise in the context of a reasonably well-functioning electoral democracy and may result in subnational closed games. The article takes into account the role of political families, media-ownership, control of access to business opportunities, and control of the provincial state. [R]</p>
<p>62.1965 BEITH, Malcolm — <bold>A broken Mexico: allegations of collusion between the Sinaloa cartel and Mexican political parties.</bold> <italic>Small Wars and Insurgencies</italic> 22(5), Dec. 2011: 787–806.</p>
<p>The Mexican drug war has now claimed more than 40,000 lives. Dozens of high-level cartel operatives have been captured or killed, yet the leadership of one cartel, from Sinaloa in northwestern Mexico, has remained apparently untouched. The apparent lack of a crackdown on the Sinaloa Cartel has spurred criticisms of the F. Calderón administration: some critics contend that the Sinaloa Cartel has enjoyed protection from the authorities. The Sinaloa Cartel's history of protection and collusion by authorities goes back a long way. But mounting evidence — captures and deaths of high-level operatives from Sinaloa as well as arrests of relatives of the leadership — suggests that the claims of collusion against the current Mexican administration are false.

<p>62.1966 BELLUCCI, Paolo; HEATH, Oliver — <bold>The structure of party-organization linkages and the electoral strength of cleavages in Italy, 1963–2008.</bold> <italic>British Journal of Political Science</italic> 42(1), Jan. 2012: 107–135.</p>
<p>No consensus exists on the causal mechanisms underpinning declining voting based on social cleavages — religion and class — in Europe. Previous research has emphasized two main factors: social change within the electorate (bottom-up) and parties' policy polarization (top-down). This article presents a third level of analysis that links parties and cleavage-related social organizations, producing a factor capable of reinforcing group identity and interest representation. This hypothesis was tested for Italy in 1968–2008, where changes in the party system provided a natural experiment to assess the impact of changing structural alternatives at the party-organizational level. The level of cleavage voting in Italy then responded primarily to changes in the structure of party-organization linkages, while the impact of policy mobilization and social change was negligible.

<p>62.1967 BENNION, Elizabeth A.; NICKERSON, David W. — <bold>The cost of convenience: an experiment showing e-mail outreach decreases [US] voter registration.</bold> <italic>Political Research Quarterly</italic> 64(4), Dec. 2011: 858–869.</p>
<p>Lower transaction costs have shifted voter-registration activities online and away from traditional modes of outreach. Downloading forms may impose higher transaction costs than traditional outreach for some people and thereby decrease electoral participation. A randomized, controlled experiment tested this hypothesis by encouraging treatment participants via e-mail to use online voter-registration tools. The treatment group was 0.3 percentage points less likely to be registered to vote after the election. A follow-up experiment sent reminders via text message to randomly selected people who had downloaded registration forms. The treatment increased rates of registration by 4 percentage points, suggesting that reminders can ameliorate many of the negative effects of directing people to downloadable online registration forms.

<p>62.1968 BENSON, Brett V.; MEROLLA, Jennifer L.; GEER, John G. — <bold>Two steps forward, one step back? Bias in the 2008 [US] presidential election.</bold> <italic>Electoral Studies</italic> 30(4), Dec. 2011: 607–620.</p>
<p>The candidates running during the 2008 presidential campaign were the most diverse in America's history. Prior to this historic election, female and minority candidates had little success in pursuing the presidency. B. Obama's victory signals a decline in those barriers. Yet some groups, especially religious ones, continue to face barriers, including Atheists, Mormons and Muslims. The paper takes a close look at bias in presidential voting. This examination provides an opportunity to consider new hypotheses about why barriers remain, shedding light on the nature and extent of bias within the American public. We consider social desirability, ideology, social contact, and group threat explanations. To test our ideas, we rely on list experiments using national representative samples in 2007 and in 2008.

<p>62.1969 BERNAUER, Julian; BOCHSLER, Daniel — <bold>Electoral entry and success of ethnic minority parties in Central and Eastern Europe: a hierarchical selection model.</bold> <italic>Electoral Studies</italic> 30(4), Dec. 2011: 738–755.</p>
<p>The paper examines determinants of electoral entry and success of ethnic minority parties in central and eastern Europe. The application of a hierarchical selection model shows that the strategic entry of minority parties depends on their expected electoral success due to both observed and unobserved factors. Drawing on formal models of electoral entry, the electoral success of new (or niche) parties is expected to be influenced by the costs of entry (determined by electoral thresholds) and the potential for electoral support. The latter depends on the reactions of political competitors and electoral demand, measured here as the size of ethnic groups and the saliency of ethnic issues. In line with these expectations, parties run only if they can expect electoral support sufficient to pass the electoral threshold. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.1970 BERTI, Benedetta — <bold>Armed groups as political parties and their role in electoral politics: the case of Hizballah [Lebanon].</bold> <italic>Studies in Conflict and Terrorism</italic> 34(12), Dec. 2011: 942–962.</p>
<p>In recent decades, armed groups have shown an increased interest in creating political parties to take part in institutional politics. By using these political wings to participate in elections and win public office, some of them have gained enormous political power. However, despite the important real-world implications of this trend, the existing literature on the topic is still underdeveloped. This article contributes to a better understanding of this subject by examining the factors that motivate armed groups to set up a political wing and compete in elections and by assessing how political participation affects an armed group's strategic outlook. The hypotheses on political wing-formation and development are tested by analyzing the decision-making patterns of Hezbollah. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.1971 BEST, Heinrich — <bold>Does personality matter in [German] politics? Personality factors as determinants of parliamentary recruitment and policy preferences.</bold> <italic>Comparative Sociology</italic> 10(6), 2011: 928–948.</p>
<p>This article inquires into the impact of personality factors on the selection and self-selection of parliamentary elites. I compare personality profiles of German MPs and the German population obtained through survey research, and for some comparisons I utilize elite and mass samples matched for education, gender, and age. I ask further if MPs' personalities have an impact on their preferences for expansionist or restricted government budgets and welfare state benefits, the extension or limitation of civic rights, and several other policies. Party affiliations of MPs are used as a control variable. I find that MPs' personality traits differ strikingly from those of the German population and from those of followers in most of the parties with which MPs are affiliated.

<p>62.1972 BINDERKRANTZ, Anne Skorkjaer — <bold>Interest groups in the [Danish] media: bias and diversity over time.</bold> <italic>European Journal of Political Research</italic> 51(1), Jan. 2012: 117–139.</p>
<p>A prominent presence in the news media is important for interest groups. This article investigates the development in the diversity of interest group media attention over time. The analysis draws on a dataset of 19,000 group appearances in the Danish news media in the period 1984–2003. It demonstrates how diversity has risen continually over time, leading to a media agenda less dominated by labor and business and more by public interest groups and sectional groups. This development is related to the increasing political importance of the news media and the decline in group integration in public decision-making processes. The article also shows how the development of group appearances is closely related to changes in media attention towards different policy areas. [R]</p>

<p>This paper analyzes the community party-building program in urban China. Community party building represents an effort of the Communist Party of China to transform itself from a “revolutionary party” to a “governing party”. The party-building program involves the expansion of the party's organizational presence and the various mechanisms to reorganize and integrate party-members. It shows that the CCP is concerned about its organizational erosion at the base level, and is taking measures to remedy the situation. The paper also discusses the relationship between the party organization and local democratic development. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.2776]</p>

<p>There is a steady tendency in the development of contemporary Western Europe towards the growth of rightist conservative parties, employing radical right slogans and nationalistic rhetoric, and their electoral success in Italy, France, Austria, Belgium, Netherlands, Sweden, and Germany from the 1970s to 2010. “Extreme Right” is often used in relation to non-parliamentary parties as well, which complicates the political situation in these countries. The best criterion for discriminating between various movements within the European right is therefore ideology. The majority of “Extreme Right” parties reject liberal values and differentiate themselves from “traditional right” powers. Populist nationalist parties, on the contrary, avoid distinguishing themselves from other right movements and often borrow some of their slogans.</p>

<p>This article focuses on two kinds of scandals: the political scandal that concerns a minister's or a politician's transgressions in the realm of politics, and the norm scandal that concerns a minister's or a politician's personal transgressions either in the role of minister/politician or as a private person. The article concludes that there has been a dramatic rise in the number of political scandals from 2000 and onwards, but also that this rise — with some exceptions — may be viewed as a sign of Denmark as a healthy liberal democracy.

<p>62.1976 BLEICH, Erik — <bold>What Is Islamophobia and how much is there? Theorizing and measuring an emerging comparative concept.</bold> <italic>American Behavioral Scientist</italic> 55(12), Dec. 2011: 1581–1600.</p>
<p>Islamophobia is an emerging comparative concept in the social sciences. Yet there is no widely accepted definition of Islamophobia that permits systematic comparative and causal analysis. This article explores how the term Islamophobia has been deployed in public and scholarly debates, emphasizing that these discussions have taken place on multiple registers. It then draws on research on concept formation, prejudice, and analogous forms of status hierarchies to offer a usable social scientific definition of Islamophobia as indiscriminate negative attitudes or emotions directed at Islam or Muslims. The article discusses the types of indicators that are most appropriate for measuring Islamophobia as well as the benefits of concept-development for enabling comparative and causal analysis.

<p>The article deals with the question of whether self-reported reasons for vote-choices can help to identify heterogeneous sub-electorates which place different weights on certain criteria in their voting decision. Based on the Michigan model, the respondents are coded into groups according to their answers to open-ended questions about their voting motives. These groups differ in terms of political attitudes and electoral behavior just as expected. By including theoretically plausible interactions between group membership and the corresponding predictors we can significantly improve the explanatory power for all parties. Self-reported reasons for respondents' vote may not be an independent explanation of voting behavior, but they contribute to the refinement of existing models.

<p>An opinion poll on a representative sample of Italians suggests that it does. We focus on reforms increasing retirement age or cutting pension benefits. We find that individuals who are more informed about the costs and functioning of the pension system are more willing to accept reforms. We do not find that exposure to media coverage of pension issues significantly improves information. We perform a controlled experiment asking a random subsample of individuals to read a descriptive note on the Italian pension system before answering the questionnaire, finding that citizens reading the note are more willing to support pension reforms.

<p>The electoral implications of conditional cash-transfer programs have been widely debated in recent years. In the particular case of Brazil, analysts have argued that the social policies that President L. da Silva's first government implemented enabled the Workers' Party to broaden its electoral clientele from middle-class and highly educated voters to low-income and poorly educated individuals from the Northeast. The conditional cash-transfer program known as <italic>Bolsa Família</italic> (BF) is said to have played a key role in this shift of electoral support and to have worked as a powerful clientelist tool for Lula. Using survey data, this article challenges this view by showing that, despite changes in the profile of Lula's supporters, the BF program cannot account for them. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article analyzes the interplay between religious and political discourse in Argentina, departing from a case study located in the transition towards democracy in April 1987, and conveying military, political and religious discourse within the conflicts that surrounded the government of President R. R. Alfonsín (1983–1989). It involved a well-established discourse genre, the homily, within an historical social practice, the Catholic mass; but it also included the violation of one of its main features, namely the monopoly of talk by priests. By challenging Bishop [Medine]'s monologue, questioned by the homily, President Alfonsín settled a different ground, neither religious nor political, an <italic>événement</italic> that required urgent recontextualization. In both cases, the actions and actors involved were consistently opposite, responding to different ideological motivations and with different strategic goals. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>News bias is supposed to play an important role during election campaigns. This study deals with the effects of news bias on voting decisions. It considers two different types of news bias and assesses (1) the degree to which there is an association between objective and subjective news bias, and (2) whether these different forms of bias affect changes in voting decisions. The results show that the association between objective and subjective bias is marginal. Furthermore, whereas subjective news bias has no systematic effect on voting behavior, both the visibility of political parties in the media and the tone of coverage relate to changes in voting behavior over the course of the campaign.

<p>The article identifies the factors behind a series of center-left electoral victories in the 2002 and 2006 state elections, which indicate the decay of state political machines in Brazil's poorest regions. Vertical competition between the federal and state governments in the provision of public policies works as a constraint on state bosses' strategies of political control. The withering of state political machines may be understood as an indirect consequence of the national political shifts, represented by the rise of Brazil's most important left-wing organization — the Workers' Party (<italic>Partido dos Trabalhadores</italic>) — to the presidency in 2002 and 2006. The article explores the interlinking of national and subnational electoral dynamics by developing statistical models for state- and municipal-level data. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Major campaign donors are highly concentrated geographically. A relative handful of neighborhoods accounts for the bulk of all money contributed to [US] political campaigns. Public opinion in these elite neighborhoods is very different from that in the country as a whole and in low-donor areas. On a number of prominent political issues, the prevailing viewpoint in high-donor neighborhoods can be characterized as cosmopolitan and libertarian, rather than populist or moralistic. Merging Federal Election Commission contribution data with three recent large-scale national surveys, we find that these opinion differences are not solely the result of big-donor areas' high concentration of wealthy and educated individuals. Instead, these neighborhoods have a distinctive political ecology that likely reinforces and intensifies biases in opinion. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>What does the creation of sub-national legislatures entail for the work of MPs, and by what guidelines does the cross-level relationship evolve? This article considers the issue in the context of British devolution, relating the analysis of MPs to the question of how parties adapt. The empirical analysis, drawing on interviews with Assembly Members (AMs) and MPs from Labour, the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats, shows that the infrastructure for communication between AMs and MPs differs considerably between the parties. Moreover, there are also key differences between parties with regard to how relations between individual representatives are resolved. The paper argues (1) that the creation of sub-national legislatures challenges party cohesiveness and (2) that how this challenge is met by the parties is guided by their distinct ideational and organizational legacies with regard to devolution.

<p>This article illuminates the unanticipated but intense waves of xenophobia that have swept through Western Europe over the last decade. I use a unique dataset and diffusion models to simultaneously investigate the geographical and temporal development of waves of racist violence in the Netherlands during the turbulent period 2001–2003, when the country lost its reputation as a multicultural paradise. The results provide evidence for the fact that previous riots enhance the legitimacy of violence elsewhere, especially if they are visible in the mass media, resonate with public debates on immigration and take place in nearby regions. The analysis suggests that proxies for ethnic competition, deprivation and political opportunity structures are not significantly related to the outbreak of violence; only population size adequately predicts where violence starts.

<p>Democracy affords citizens the ability to influence policy through participation in elections and through direct political action. Though previous scholarship evaluates the impact each strategy has on outcomes, little if any work examines how one strategy, direct action, affects success in the other, elections. This study analyzes the relationship between land-occupations and the electoral success of the Workers' Party [PT] in Brazil between 1996 and 2006. It finds that the relationship varies in presidential and mayoral elections depending on income inequality and incumbency. Once the PT captured the presidential office in 2002, these effects disappear, suggesting that the effect of political protest also depends on who is in office. [R]</p>

<p>The personalization of politics and a voting mechanism based on party-group ballots (Indiana type) enhanced the voting power of an elite group of “popular candidates” that have the capacity of electoral traction to their parties. And the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution created a new electoral cycle of general and mid-term elections. Together, they were the conditions for the emergence of a new behavioral pattern: the successful “heads of lists” give up their seats early to “leapfrog” into another electoral race, usually the next executive election to come. They do so to benefit their political careers or protect the interest of their parties. The paroxysm of this behavior is the “testimonial candidate,” who gives up before even taking the seat. Changing patterns and their consolidation through time trigger a particular political culture that causes a conflict with the formal electoral institution and its original spirit. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Policy positioning has received a great deal of attention from scholars of British politics. While numerous studies emphasize the positions taken by the Labour and Conservative parties, and how the positions of these parties have shaped citizens' electoral behavior, few studies explore policy positioning at the candidate-level. We conduct the first quantitative study that examines the relative policy positions of British candidates during a general election. Building on findings from the study of American elections, we argue that two factors explain variation in candidate positioning in Britain: constituency-level electoral competition and a disparity in candidate quality. Using data from the 2001 British Representation Study, we find evidence that both factors are associated with a decrease in the policy contrast between candidates. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The number of possible coalitions in the German five-party system is rising. Coalition signals become consequently more important for the decision-making process of voters. In order to model individual vote choices adequately, the impact of coalition signals must therefore be taken into account. Taking the case of the 2009 federal election, we provide evidence for these assumptions using several data sources of the German Longitudinal Election Study (GLES). We show that coalition signals can change individual vote-intentions. Due to the increasing complexity of coalition-formation, such behavior does not always maximize voters' expected utility. Instead, coalition signals may lead voters astray. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.1567]</p>

<p>It is well-known that events influence the standing of the governing parties. Still, important questions remain unanswered: Which characteristics are necessary for an event to have an impact? Why should voters care about events and which role does the mass media play? How are other influences on government popularity affected by the occurrence of events? To answer these questions, a model of German government popularity containing the economic situation and events, selected by addressed criteria, will be advanced and tested by means of time-series regression. The results show that events have an impact on government popularity and are able to repress real-world influences. This effect is rather short-lived and does not cover all events which are normally perceived as influential. [R]</p>

<p>This article looks at ideological convergence within party families in thirty European countries. It assesses the degree of left-right convergence over time between national political parties and their electorates within the same family. The analysis concentrates on seven major party families, and within-family convergence is used to assess the degree to which functional oppositions prevail over territorial ones as an indicator of Europeanization. Ideological convergence is measured through quantitative indicators on the left-right axis at two levels. First, at the elite level the article measures within-family convergence since 1945 with manifesto data. Second, at the electorate level the article measures convergence of voters of a same family since 1970 with survey data. Economic and cultural left-right dimensions are distinguished. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>A sizeable scholarly literature has generally uncovered weak, statistically trivial connections between social capital and political support, despite its logical appeal. Much of this research, however, has adopted an overly restrictive research design. It has overwhelmingly focused on the impact of social trust on political trust, from which broad inferences about the utility of the social capital perspective have been made. Rarely, however, has the impact of social capital been systematically assessed on indicators of political support which are more diffuse in character. Using data drawn from the German General Social Survey (ALLBUS), the study analyzes the impact of different measures of social capital on political support in the Federal Republic of Germany. The results strongly support the conclusion that social capital influences diffuse support. [R]</p>

Theoretically, this study builds upon the analysis of the “domestic support for wars” from three mainstream theories of public opinion concerning the use of force: the “principal policy objectives,” “ends and means calculus,” and the “leadership effect”. It also offers a multidimensional approach by introducing a number of variables such as risk, halo effect, multilateral participation, legitimacy, escalation, and self-defense concerning wars.

This includes an explanation of the controversy about some parliamentarians who were elected whilst under arrest or being subject to criminal proceedings. Other than that, our analysis focuses particularly on previous and planned constitutional reforms, developments in the area of freedom of expression and Turkey-EU relations. [R]</p>

<p>Many attribute the demise of the solid [US] South, and changes in party attachments outside the South, to elite-level changes in the parties' positions on racial issues and an issue evolution of the party system. Support is also growing for the notion that, as the Republican Party became an acceptable alternative to the Democratic Party for racial issues in the South, a resurgence of class-based partisanship further fueled the exodus. By investigating whether political awareness mediates responsiveness to changes in the political environment, evidence that partisan evolution is concentrated among more aware citizens is uncovered, and the implications are examined.

<p>The French Socialist Party has maintained a deeply ambivalent relationship with political radicalism. This article identifies three levels of analysis as heuristics to facilitate a study of the French Socialist Party over the long term. From the perspective of the party as a whole, the party evolves according to its own eco-system, and is shaped by deeply embedded cultural and political traits. A different level of analysis frames the question of political radicalism organizationally, in terms of relations within and beyond the party. Finally, one can also understand the party's relationship with political radicalism instrumentally and strategically, in terms of electoral alliances. Though there is a tension between these three approaches, each contributes to understanding why the French Socialist Party is sometimes considered a European exception.

<p>In late 2010, the leaders of the major British political parties were the most inexperienced of the post-war era. This short article discusses this development. It shows how unusual this is, comparing the leaders of 2010 to their post-war predecessors. It demonstrates that this development is unlikely to be some fluke, before considering the causes of the transformation, which it suggests can be attributed to two things: the changes in the election methods used by the political parties — which seem to have led to less experienced candidates being elected — as well as the changing nature of political “experience,” with career politicians gaining political experience before entering the Commons.

<p>Following the first leaders' debate, the Liberal Democrats poll rating surged and remained high throughout the election campaign. There was an expectation that the party would perform much better than in 2005 and bridge the “credibility gap”. The reality proved to be much different. We explore the factors that shaped the Liberal Democrat vote in the 2010 election. Using seemingly unrelated regression models, we identify continuity with the past: importance of local election success, first-time incumbency and Liberal Democrat incumbents building a personal vote. We also provide evidence that the Liberal Democrats failed to advance in those new types of area that proved so fruitful in 2005. Using the 2010 BES, we also show that party identification mattered and N. Clegg proved to be a valuable asset to the party. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The onset of the Great Recession raised hopes among union supporters that organized labor would be able to use the downturn to gain greater political influence and new members. But despite Democratic Party victories in 2008, unions found it quite difficult to take advantage of the crisis. No revival of union organizing occurred, and membership continued to decline. Moreover, unions were unable to effectively present themselves as defenders of a larger public interest in equitable economic policy. Instead, many in the public turned against unions, viewing them as labor market “insiders” who benefited from government largesse in the form of bailouts to the auto industry and excessive salaries and pensions granted to public employees. Resentment of union privileges grew more common than solidarity with union workers. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.1851]</p>

<p>Since 2000, elections have been organized in almost every African country. The existence of formal electoral processes has not, however, prevented certain family dynasties from continuing.

<p>This article tests two alternative hypotheses: the individualization hypothesis of political behavior, which states that the impact of long-term factors like belonging to a social group, on voting behavior is declining while attitudinal factors are becoming more relevant for the decision-making of voters over time; and the hypothesis that importance of predictors varies according to the thematic emphases of election campaigns. The analysis revels that belongingness as well as ties to specific social groups are still of importance for voting behavior in Germany, while there are at best scarce indications of an increasing importance of attitudes for vote-choices. Moreover, there is no evidence that the thematic profiles of election campaigns are relevant for the varying impact of attitudinal predictors of voting behavior.

It then examines the public policy networks that have emerged at the local and national level. Although these networks have not produced a new political actor, they show novel forms of local political action. These networks are however still limited in their impact, due to three main obstacles: (1) endogenous factors; (2) the fact that they are relatively disconnected from current political practices; (3) the failures of the institutional design of the prevalent agendas for social participation.

<p>Prime ministers have been crucial figures in British politics for nearly three centuries and the media now give them more prominence than ever. Polling data on prime ministerial popularity suggest that there has been an increasing tendency for voters to take a negative view of the incumbent prime minister. Moreover, almost every post-war premier has left office less popular than when he or she took over. [Although] they dominate media coverage of British politics, voters' reactions to prime ministers are less good predictors of party preferences than appraisals of the general competence of the government. This suggests that while valence theorists are right to draw attention to the role of party leaders as a means of providing voters with a “shortcut” in decision-making, the importance of leader evaluations should not be exaggerated.

<p>Some scholars have found that mass immigration fuels the success of anti-immigration parties, whereas others have found that it does not. We propose a reason for these contradictory results. We advance a set of hypotheses that revolves around a commonly ignored factor: crime. To test these hypotheses, we examine a setting where an anti-immigration party, the LPF, participated in simultaneous elections in all Dutch municipalities, which form a single constituency. According to our results, the impact of immigration rates on the individual vote for the LPF only manifests itself among those voters who are very “tough on crime”. In addition, we demonstrate that high local crime rates make an anti-immigration vote more likely, but only among voters who are very “tough on immigration”. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article investigates the psychological basis for the dramatic improvement in the Canadian public's evaluations of the US following President B. Obama's inauguration. It attributes this change to a media priming effect triggered by Obama's increased visibility in Canadian news coverage of the US in 2008 and 2009. A survey experiment conducted on a sample of undergraduate students at a Canadian university is used to illustrate this priming effect. Mentioning President Obama in an unrelated question leads participants to evaluate the US more positively than in a control group. This assimilation effect is particularly strong when compared to a condition in which former President G. W. Bush is mentioned instead of President Obama.

<p>Much of the scholarly debate over Islam and democracy has centered on what has been referred to as the “inclusion-moderation hypothesis,” and whether democratic institutions are capable of incorporating hostile religious actors. To build on this debate, the concept of inclusion and the expectations about its political effects should be broadened to include the interaction between religion-state relationships and democratization processes in predominantly Muslim societies. Inviting ambivalently democratic religious actors into the public democratic space produces dynamics of both political moderation and religious change.

It explores the emergence of the pro-democracy opposition in Macao since the end of the colonial era and the self-perception of pro-democratic opposition groups in the MSAR regime, and argues that the majority of opposition groups perceive themselves as ‘loyal’ opponents to the current regime. The groups aim at checking the authorities in the scope of the constitution as loyal constituents. Their assumption of this role is the result of several environmental factors, including a relatively weak civil society, a lack of resources and a pro-government media. [R]</p>

The instrument established jointly by the government of Kenya and international organizations to investigate what went wrong and what should be done to remedy the situation was IREC, the Independent Review Commission. The article demonstrates how international organizations were involved during the electoral process and that the considerable international assistance before and during the election was of almost no avail, while it was more useful after the election.

<p>The governments of H. Chávez (Venezuela), E. Morales (Bolivia), and R. Correa (Ecuador) share strategies, policies, and discourses that contrast with those of the center-leftists in power in Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay as well as the social democratic, socialist, and classical populist experiences of the past. All three governments have triumphed at the polls with large majorities, rely on the ongoing mobilization of their followers, and embrace radical democracy based on a strong executive branch and direct popular participation in decision-making as opposed to corporatist mechanisms. The three governments have been characterized by steady radicalization, their movements consist of multiclass alliances, and their economic policies have diversified commercial and technological relations. They have also established close ties with neighboring center-left governments and have promoted unity arrangements in the continent to resolve political disputes that exclude the US.

<p>After the highly contested 2007 elections, President Goodluck Jonathan started to reform Nigeria's electoral system to improve the April 2011 elections' credibility. That is when a reform committee was set up, a new team appointed to head Nigeria's Independent National Electoral Commission, and a partial reorganization cleaned up the main police and security agencies. This article examines the reforms' effects on the 2011 election process, looking at electoral abuses in particular. In contrast with other elections that have occurred since Nigeria's return to democracy, the results of elections on the 9th and 26th April 2011 were generally applauded; this suggests they were relatively free and fair and that — most importantly — observed abuses declined sharply.

<p>Low turnout and the prevalence of national arena motivation in sub- and supranational elections are claimed to be due to voters perceiving that less is “at stake” in second-order national elections. The article asks whether voters' differential assessments of election stakes when confronted with elections to different representative institutions are evidence of electoral sophistication. In the context of Norwegian elections to county and municipal councils, the standard approaches based on aggregate and survey data are juxtaposed with results from content-analysis of local-level politicians' argumentative behavior, as they are exposed in readers' letters published in local newspapers. We find that voters' differential assessment matches well with the message indirectly conveyed by campaigning politicians at the respective levels, suggesting that voters make adequate assessments of how much is at stake in elections to sub-national government.

<p>Analyses of by-elections traditionally focus on explorations of electoral behavior, rather than on patterns of political recruitment. However, who the parties select is important, as the candidate essentially constitutes the temporary face of the party. Furthermore, each party adapts [its] selection rules during by-elections to facilitate a greater role for the center in the process. Combining qualitative research with selection and election data, this article explores intra-party tensions regarding the candidate-selection process by focusing on the success rates of three specific groups of candidates: political insiders, women and locals. Focusing on by-election political recruitment provides an opportunity to assess the various tensions that arise over candidate-selection between central strategists and local party activists, during intense and high-profile campaigns.

<p>Why has the association between class and party declined over time? Contrary to conventional wisdom that emphasizes the fracturing of social structures and blurring of class boundaries in post-industrial society, we argue that class divisions in party preferences are conditioned by the changing shape of the class structure and the effect of parties' strategic ideological responses to this transformation on the choices facing voters. This thesis is tested using British survey data from 1959 to 2006. We demonstrate that increasing class heterogeneity does not account for the decline of the class-party association, which occurs primarily as a result of ideological convergence between the main parties resulting from New Labour's shift to the center.

<p>Political parties use policy radicalism as a means of attaining electoral success. Differentiation from other parties and ideological renewal after a period of incumbency or prolonged opposition are valid reasons for policy innovation, but excessive radicalization has a number of detrimental effects, including mismanaging voter expectations. This article analyzes a number of examples of policy radicalization under the French Fifth Republic. It starts from concepts taken from policy-mood and spatial competition models, and examines how French political parties of both Left and Right have overreached in their ideological stances, and thereby exacerbated political disenchantment among the French public. The article looks at the notion that mainstream politicians may not be acting in their own best interests when they radicalize the political agenda by misreading electoral competitive cues.

<p>Through a comparison of three periods of health and pension reform in Chile, this article develops an explanation for the incremental form of social policy change that some Latin American nations have witnessed in recent years, despite the dramatic rise of left governments. It describes “post-retrenchment politics,” a realignment in the way politics plays out in countries that have undergone social policy retrenchment. In post-retrenchment politics, the strengthened position of private business interests, combined with political learning legacies and lock-in effects generated by reforms, results in incremental political change, despite renewed efforts by left parties to address inequality. Global capital also plays an important contextual role, and may influence post-retrenchment politics. In post-retrenchment politics, newly reformed systems may achieve greater equity, but they do so in fragmented form. [R]</p>

<p>This article looks at how political expertise conditions the ideological implications of the authoritarian predisposition. Although theories of authoritarianism imply that it is a constraint mechanism for the uninformed, research on the role of expertise in the formation of ideology suggests otherwise. In line with this, examination of the 2000 and 2004 American National Election Studies revealed that the relation between the authoritarian predisposition and conservatism was stronger among experts; that relations between the authoritarian predisposition and two components of conservatism — opposition to equality and support for traditionalism — were also stronger among experts; and that the tendency for the authoritarian predisposition to be more strongly related to traditionalism than opposition to equality was stronger among experts as well.

<p>This article examines the importance of retrospective pocketbook voting, i.e., that voters reward an incumbent party for an improvement in their own economic situation, in the Norwegian 2005 general [parliamentary] election. The article utilizes a dataset with extensive tax-register information on income and tax payments in 2004 and 2005, which makes it possible to examine how changes in tax burdens affect the probability of voting for an incumbent party. The results show that a reduced tax burden is not significantly correlated with vote-choice, a finding that questions the reward/punishment logic of retrospective pocketbook voting. The article does, however, find some evidence of retrospective sociotropic voting, as the county-level unemployment rate is significantly correlated with vote-choice. [R]</p>

<p>This article establishes a model of likely campaign effectiveness, before examining the intensity of constituency campaigning at the 2010 general election in Britain and its subsequent impact on electoral outcomes, using both aggregate and individual level data. It shows that constituency campaigning yielded benefits in varying degrees for all three main parties and that Labour's constituency campaign efforts were effective despite the electoral context, and ultimately affected the overall outcome of the election. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the circumstances under which campaigns are likely to be more or less effective, and provide further evidence that a carefully managed campaign stands the most chance of delivering tangible electoral payoffs.

<p>In their competition for the 2008 Democratic nomination, B. Obama and H. Clinton developed distinct demographic bases of support. This study analyzes the demographic divides in the 2008 [US] Democratic presidential primaries, focusing on the “gaps” that emerged in the support of Obama. Obama's demographic bases of support were African-Americans, younger voters, educated voters, those with no religion affiliation, wealthier voters, males, political independents, and ideological liberals. Despite the considerable amount of attention given to the gender gap, a number of demographic gaps were more significant. Race was by far the most important gap and a key component of Obama's victory was his tremendous support from African-American voters. [R]</p>

<p>Radical-right parties have become effective electoral competitors in many parts of Western Europe yet failed to achieve success in others. Much recent scholarship seeks to understand variation in radical-right support. Here, we argue that local social cohesion boosts these parties' vote-shares. We use Swiss census data at the municipal level to measure local cohesion, drawing on indicators of residents' commuting patterns, linguistic similarities and home-ownership. Regression analysis shows that social cohesion is a positive predictor of local-level support for the Swiss People's Party, but not for any other major party. Hierarchical logit models combining aggregate cohesion measures with survey data demonstrate this contextual effect on individuals' vote-choices. [R]</p>

<p>Compared with past generations, it takes longer for youth today to attain various markers of adult status. This protracted period of transition to adulthood has implications for their civic engagement. In addition, an institutional lacuna — a dearth of opportunities to practice civic skills and get recruited into civic life — exists for youth who do not go on to college. A growing class divide in civic participation may be the consequence for democracy in the US. New social inventions to address the delayed transition to adulthood and the class divide in civic participation are called for. We draw from two studies (in-depth interviews with young adults and a national longitudinal study of participants in AmeriCorps) to bolster our arguments.

<p>Despite a large literature on voter-turnout around the world, our understanding of the role of labor union membership remains muddled. We examine the relationship between union membership and voting. Using individual level International Social Science Program (ISSP) data from thirty-two countries, we find that union members are more likely to vote and that the substantive effect rivals that of other common predictors of voting. This relationship is also largely invariant across an array of demographic factors, indicating that unions tend to be “equal opportunity mobilizers”. We also find that unions have “spillover” effects: controlling for a variety of other factors, even non-union members are more likely to turn out to vote in countries with higher union densities. Labor unions have a consistent political influence across a wide set of countries. [R]</p>

Regardless of their apparent weaknesses, political parties in Ghana are generally important institutions that grease the wheels of the country's democratic governance in the post-transition era.

<p>This paper examines local newspaper issue-coverage of House members after the campaign season has ended. While research on news coverage of campaign issues has been thorough, considerably less attention has been placed on issue coverage outside of campaigns. This is particularly the case for the local news media. Using an extensive content-analysis of House member local newspaper coverage over a one-year period, I examine the nature of local and national issue coverage. I find that local issues are covered slightly more than national issues in reporting on House members. Further, members' strategic use of press releases and the presence of newspapers' Washington bureaus help explain whether a story will cover a local or national political issue. [R]</p>

<p>This paper draws on the 2009/2010 British Election Survey to explore the political engagement of young people in Britain in the context of social change. Focusing on political involvement, attitudes and priorities, we examine contrasting generational perspectives in the context of an election centered on a range of issues that had the potential to stimulate the interest of younger voters. While clear generational differences in engagement exist, there are also age-related similarities in attitudes towards involvement. In terms of political priorities, differences suggest a conflict of interests in which generations construct political agendas in ways that reflect an interest in securing personal advantage of their own segment of the electorate at the expense of others.

<p>Political parties are central to democracy, but according to some arguments their capacity to discharge their functions is weakening in many countries. Moreover, the institution of the referendum is sometimes perceived to pose particular problems for political parties, impinging on their centrality in political life and on their internal cohesion. Ireland is one of Europe's heaviest users of the referendum, so in that light it may be expected that parties in Ireland are weaker than those in most other countries. Consideration of the available evidence produces a mixed picture, however, with Irish parties conforming to expected trends in some respects but not in others.

<p>This article analyzes the role of Peronist presidents and governors in the formation of dissident Peronist lists competing against the <italic>Partido Justicialista</italic> (PJ) official structure in national legislative elections. Much of the literature analyzing the PJ organizational features argues that Peronist governors are the major political actors assembling of candidates' lists for congressional elections and that intra-party competition within the PJ decreases in Peronist districts. However, empirical evidence from the systematic study of Peronist dissidence indicates that these proposals do not tell the entire story. The evidence hereby presented reveals that the president also plays a role in designing legislative tickets challenging the power of either governors or provincial party bosses, and that dissidence is more frequent in district run by Peronist governors than in provinces ruled by other parties.

<p>If voters punish elected officials who adopt incongruent policy positions, then representatives should take popular positions to avoid electoral sanction. Yet, scholars have noted gaps between citizen preferences and the behavior of elected officials. One important source of this gap is that individual citizens believe they are sometimes not well qualified to evaluate policy. Our analysis of a series of experiments shows that citizens' stated confidence in their own ability to evaluate a policy proposal substantially affects their willingness to reward or punish a representative for their votes on that policy. Our results hold both across individuals (within policy areas) and within individuals (across policy areas) and suggest that, rather than a failure of representation, gaps between citizen preferences and policy may reflect citizen deference to “expert” legislators.

Islamic political movements actually take a wide range of positions on democracy and have diverse approaches to participation in elections. This stems from their unique relationship with the regime and the state. [R]</p>

<p>In a well-known model of electoral developments in newly emerging democracies, C. Flint and P.J.

The experience of Romania over its first six elections since its 1989/90 transition to democracy fits the first part of that model: no party elected to power won the subsequent election and there has been considerable change in the structure of the party system. This has not been paralleled by comparable volatility in the country's electoral geography, however, which remained remarkably stable over the first five of the six elections. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Qualitative studies of vote buying find the practice to be common in many Latin American countries, but quantitative studies using surveys find little evidence of vote buying. Social desirability bias can account for this discrepancy. We employ a survey-based list experiment to minimize the problem. After the 2008 Nicaraguan municipal elections, we asked about vote-buying behavior by campaigns using a list experiment and the questions traditionally used by studies of vote buying on a nationally representative survey. Our list experiment estimated that 24% of registered voters in Nicaragua were offered a gift or service in exchange for votes, whereas only 2% reported the behavior when asked directly. This detected social desirability bias is nonrandom and analysis based on traditional obtrusive measures of vote buying is unreliable. We also provide systematic evidence that shows the importance of monitoring strategies by parties in determining who is targeted for vote buying. [R]</p>

These results should be of great interest to researchers concerned with market reaction to election cycles, public policy, and the overall role of election uncertainty in financial markets. [R]</p>

We use teenagers' narratives about their own youth-led political socialization to extend the existing theorizing on youth civic engagement, rethink some of its core tenets, and elucidate the roles that young people themselves play in the processes of political socialization.

Furthermore, the desire for at least a partial change of government was very high. The Greens benefited from both factors, tripling their share of the vote. Although a majority has been satisfied with the government of the Social Democrats, its various policies were also held negatively against Prime Minister K.

<p>Using Swiss data from the 2003 International Social Survey Program, this multilevel study combined individual and municipality levels in the explanation of nationalism, patriotism and exclusionary immigration attitudes. On the individual level, the results show that nationalism increased exclusionary immigration attitudes, while patriotism was related to greater tolerance towards immigration. On the municipality level, urbanization, socio-economic status and immigrant proportion (and their interaction effects) were found to affect nationalism, patriotism and immigration attitudes. Nationalist and patriotic forms of national attachment were stronger in German-speaking municipalities than in the French-speaking municipalities.

<p>The radical component is still alive in French socialism, [e.g.,] in the anti-liberal economic perspective that the international financial crisis has recently reawakened, [or] in the critique of the institutions of the Fifth Republic that N. Sarkozy's “hyper-presidency” has revived. The tendency toward radicalization, however, is also heavily constrained. The Socialist Party has become a party of government. The centrality of the presidential election in the French system and the presidentialist character that the Socialist Party has taken on make a presidential victory a top priority for the party. Too radical a discourse can become, for such a party, counter-productive. The economic environment, moreover, makes less credible the large-scale, state-led redistribution that has traditionally been how French socialism has translated its radicalism into a program of government.

<p>What is the electoral significance of constituency candidates in German parliamentary elections? This paper stresses the importance of constituency candidates' campaign strategies for individual vote-choices. Particularly, voters are influenced by the campaign strategies of candidates and hypothesize an increasing electoral impact of constituency candidates with increasingly personalized election campaign's voters are willing to cast personalized votes if they are asked to do so. We examine this hypothesis in theoretical as well as empirical ways, combining voter and candidate survey data from the German Longitudinal Election Study (GLES) 2009. Our results suggest that candidates do make a difference for individual voting behavior. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.1567]</p>

<p>This article offers a political economy-based understanding of the limitations of Islamic party politics in Indonesia, connecting these to Indonesian class development and social interests. It gathers insights from comparisons with the Turkish case, long considered the most prominent example of a successful democracy in the Muslim World. The contrasting experiences of the PKS [Indonesian Justice and Prosperity Party] and the AKP [Turkish Justice and Development Party] reveal some of the conditions influencing the success of electoral strategies advance notionally more inclusive ones. More generally, the Indonesian and Turkish cases suggests a more complex relationship between electoral politics and Islamic political parties than is recognized in approaches mainly concerned with democracy's purported ideologically “moderating” outcomes.

<p>This article draws on two research strategies to analyze the radicalizing effects of “Sarkozyism” in France. The first uses the ALCESTE computer program to compare systematically the presidential campaign discourses of J. Chirac and N. Sarkozy as a way to evaluate how Sarkozy has altered the ideology of the French Right. This analysis shows that a radicalization of the French Right has in fact taken place with regard to questions of immigration, national identity, and <italic>sécurité</italic>. The second strategy makes use of the sociology of labeling to analyze expressions of “anti-Sarkozyism” on the internet. A cartographic study of the web sheds light on the variety and dynamism of this anti-Sarkozyism, and helps us take the full measure of Sarkozyism's strong polarizing effects.

<p>This article examines the relationship between public opinion and foreign policy-making in Australia by turning to the findings of a national survey of Australian public opinion on the Israel-Palestine conflict. The survey findings suggest that the Australian government's policy on the Israel-Palestine conflict is inconsistent with public opinion, and such disparity is explained here in terms of the lack of public attachment to the conflict, the limited media and the absence of any notable public advocacy for policy change. This explanation is informed by in-depth interviews conducted with current and former MPs and senior public servants. The article also explores the implications of the survey's findings in relation to the significant political changes taking place across the Middle East region. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>R. Putnam's work suggests social capital is compatible with social equality, while R. Hero argues the two are inversely related. Hero and Putnam, however, are limited in their arguments because they have only cross-sectional data and their theoretical arguments imply dynamic relationships over time. We create a state-level social capital index and a measure of racial diversity that varies over time and across states. We use multivariate models to determine whether social capital or racial diversity better predicts levels of policy equity. We find that social capital detrimentally affects policy equity and racial diversity is positively associated with policy equity. [R]</p>

<p>The drawing of congressional district lines can significantly reduce political participation in US House elections, according to recent work. But such studies have failed to explain which citizens' voting rates are most susceptible to the dislocating effects of redistricting and whether the findings are generalizable to a variety of political contexts. Building on this nascent literature and work on black political participation, we show that redistricting's negative effects on participation — measured by voter roll-off in US House elections — are generally strongest among African Americans, but that black voters can be mobilized when they are redrawn into a black representative's congressional district. Our findings, based on data from 11 postredistricting elections in five states from 1992 through 2006, both expand the empirical scope of previous work and suggest that redistricting plays a previously hidden role in affecting black participation in congressional contests.

<p>This paper illuminates the role of political language in a peace process through analyzing the discourse used by political parties in Northern Ireland. What matters, it seems, is not whether party discourses converge or diverge but rather how, and in what ways, they do so. In the case of Northern Ireland, there remains strong divergence between discourses regarding the ethos of unionist and nationalist parties. As a consequence, core definitions of identity, culture, norms and principle remain common grounds for competition within nationalism and unionism. There has, however, been a significant shift towards convergence between unionist and nationalist parties in their discourses on power and governance, specifically among the now predominant (hardline) and the smaller (moderate) parties.

<p>We consider the results from an online national survey of 1025 British 18-year-olds conducted in 2011, and compare these with the results from a similar study conducted by one of the authors in 2002. We assess the extent to which young people's levels of political engagement have changed over the course of the intervening years, and if so, how they have changed. The results indicate that, contrary to popular wisdom, today's generation of young people are interested in political affairs, and they are keen to play a more active role in the political process.

<p>Analysis of political regionalism and regionalist parties has traditionally neglected the case of Germany. We argue that this is a curious omission. This article redresses this balance by applying frameworks created for understanding the determinants of regionalist party success to the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) and the eastern Germany Party of Democratic Socialism (1990–2005, PDS). Although very different in terms of their politics, both parties have been successful as they have followed strategies and tactics evident in the broader regionalist parties' literature. This article therefore deepens our knowledge of regionalism in Germany, while also testing regionalist literatures in a new country-context. [R]</p>

<p>Political discussion matters for a wide array of political phenomena such as attitude-formation, electoral choice, other forms of participation, levels of political expertise, and tolerance. Thus far, research on the underpinnings of political discussion has focused on political, social, and contextual forces. We expand upon this existing research by examining how individual personality traits influence patterns of political discussion. Drawing on data from two surveys we investigate how personality traits influence the context in which citizens discuss politics, the nature of the relationship between individuals and their discussion partners, and the influence discussion partners have on respondents' views. We find a number of personality effects and our results highlight the importance of accounting for individual predispositions in the study of political discussion. [R]</p>

<p>Using Machiavelli's metaphors, V. Pareto theorized that over time psycho-social propensities of ruling elites — manifested by predominant personality traits, mentalities, beliefs, and actions — are those of “foxes” or “lions”. Either propensity renders a ruling elite, especially its leaders, prone to bias, closure, and cumulating blunders. This degenerative process leads to a severe economic-political crisis and wide elitecirculation, during which groups and persons disposed toward the opposite propensity gain power. Pareto's theory has much intuitive appeal, but its breadth and elasticity, together with the empirically elusive qualities of elites, risk tendentious applications. Taking this risk, we examine what through Pareto's lens appear to be cycles of circulation and degeneration among American and British elites since shortly after World War II.

<p>The 2000 US presidential election resulted in one of the closest and most controversial outcomes in US history. Green Party candidate R. Nader had little chance of winning, but nevertheless impacted the race in several close states and arguably swung the race from A. Gore to G.W. Bush. This research examines Nader's “urban strategy” to win 5% of the vote for president and the bases of his electoral support. It uses the METRO_2000 data-set, which contains a variety of publicly available variables for 276 US metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the year 2000. The analysis uses OLS regression to examine the determinants of the percentage of the vote for Nader in each MSA. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The recent regional elections in Saxony-Anhalt showed more continuity than change: the proportions between the three greater parties, that is CDU, Left Party and SPD, remained by and large stable. And the swift agreement made by Christian Democrats and Social Democrats to prolong the black-red governmental coalition reflects the preference of a majority of the electorate that did not opt for change. More turbulence could be seen in the field of small parties: the Liberals failed to return to the state parliament, failing to achieve the required vote percentage.

<p>This article focuses on the national and transnational strategies of five European Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender civil society organizations (CSOs). We present three modes of interaction between CSOs and their political environment. The first mode we label “morality politics”. Arcigay in Italy and the Campaign against Homophobia in Poland are seemingly locked in this mode because they are confronted with a hostile and organized opposition, both in terms of public opinion and elite opinion. A second mode of interaction we label an “incremental change” mode and is the strategy pursued by Stonewall in the UK and the Hatter Society in Hungary, marked by discreet elite-level lobbying. Finally, “high-profile politics” is marked by highly visible public events, coalition-seeking, cooperation with government, and transnational activity at the European level and abroad. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Prior work on political effects of personal asset-ownership in the UK has found a causal link between home- and share-ownership and conservative political preferences and voting. These estimates appear to confirm the “ownership society” thesis tying privatization and asset-ownership to improved prospects for conservative parties. This paper proposes a new identification strategy for testing this causal connection that improves on earlier research designs. I exploit temporal variability in panel data to better specify the definition of home-ownership and control for unobserved confounders associated with ownership. Under this design, home-ownership is found to have no or very weak effects on voting in the 1997 and 2001 General Elections. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>How do the features of a rebel group and the external political environment interact to affect the internal dynamics within a rebel group after it transforms into a political party? We combine literature on organizational change in parties in new democracies with the emerging literature on rebel group-to-party transformation, to develop a framework by which to understand these dynamics. Using the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) as a case study, we find that the legacies of the conflict, the organizational legacies of the rebel group, and the post civil war incentives for electoral gain, create political cleavages within parties that generate considerable organizational centripetal pressures, pressures that will need to be accommodated in new party organizational structures.

<p>Existing research has focused primarily on the extent to which close elections affect turnout. While turnout is important, campaigns can also serve a social function by cultivating cognitive engagement. This article thus focuses on the extent to which close elections stimulate cognitive engagement among citizens. Observational data-analysis suggests that close elections have a positive effect on cognitive engagement in [US] Senate campaigns. Experimental data-analysis suggests that when close-election reminders appear in campaign discourse, citizens respond with greater cognitive engagement, as measured by a cognitive-response task and an information-seeking task. When reminded that a race is close, subjects think more about the candidates. They also seek more issue-based information, less group-based information, and read more about the election. Altogether, the results demonstrate that close elections increase citizen engagement. [R]</p>

<p>Research spurred by the widespread adoption of new voting technology has largely neglected the issue of privacy. Using data from a field experiment, we find that a treatment intended to increase a sense of privacy is able to alter poll-worker and voter behavior, but has little direct effect on voter attitudes. More importantly, we find that concern about privacy is concentrated among an identifiable group: those who go against their community's descriptive political norm or majority. This “political minority” is more sensitive to issues of privacy and harder to reassure that voting conditions will safeguard the confidentiality of their choices. Data from the 2008 Cooperative [US] Congressional Election Study confirm that privacy is a concern for voters nationwide who feel out of step with their locality's political majority. [R]</p>

And I observe the difficulties and dangers of pursuing the third of these strategies, while pointing to the potential significance for liberals of the first two. I allude to the difficulties that the political theory of recognition faces from the proliferation of claims to recognition among groups in contemporary democratic society. [R]</p>

It argues that the evidence suggests a common framework for citizenship education across the four home nations based on four key principles — political literacy, experiential learning, appropriate institutional structures and supply-side measures — would help promote active involvement by citizens in forms of political participation.

<p>Hungary, the former “laboratory of socialism,” has become a “laboratory of democracy”. Some observers fear that achievements such as the rule of law and democracy are up for negotiation.

<p>Although many scholars agree that social interactions within traditional social groups build social capital, there is less consensus on the benefits of virtual interactions for political engagement. Our research examines how interpersonal social group activity and virtual activity contribute to two dimensions of social capital: citizen norms and political involvement. We rely on data collected in the 2005 Citizenship Involvement in Democracy survey conducted by the Center for Democracy and Civil Society at Georgetown University. This survey provides unique detail on participation in both social groups and virtual interactions. Our findings suggest that social group activity and virtual interactions both foster many of the same positive aspects of social capital. [R]</p>

<p>Studies of parliamentary elite-circulation should pay attention to the circulation that goes on below the surface, i.e., circulation of longstanding and senior MPs — what might be termed the “depth” of parliamentary elite-circulation. I develop an analytical tool for measuring the depth of circulation and use it to test the hypothesis that at “critical” parliamentary elections the pattern of parliamentary circulation is concentrated on seniors as well as newcomers. I then use this tool to analyze circulation of the Danish parliamentary elite during the past 150 years. If only gross turnover rates are studied, it appears that the elite has become increasingly open. But trends in the depth of circulation reveal a more complex pattern, requiring a more nuanced assessment of parliamentary elite dynamics. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.2119]</p>

<p>V. Orbán is Hungary's prime minister and chairman of the ruling party <italic>Fidesz</italic>. He unveils his political goals and worldview in speeches and publications. According to Orbán, Hungary is threatened politically and economically by enemies at home and abroad. The small country is downtrodden, but, in an emergency, it will take on the whole world. This image is popular because it combines victimization with megalomania. Orbán's worldview contains all the elements of romantic, revolutionary nationalism and cultural pessimism, which were widespread at the end of the 19th and the start of the 20th c. They were the starting point of Italian Fascism and German National Socialism. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.2731]</p>

<p>This study of the transformation of the Croatian and Serbian party systems [shows that] the prospect of EU accession has led to a reconfiguration of party systems.

The emphasis on national interests and state sovereignty subordinated not only EU integration, but also democracy, to this larger goal.

<p>In many western democracies, the number of partisans is steadily declining, a trend that particularly affects young adults. This article investigates whether partisan dealignment in Germany is due to changes in the transmission of party identification form one generation to the next. The analysis, which draws on data emanating from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP), compares the effect of parental political views on the acquisition of party identification of young adults between the birth cohorts 1968 and 1993. The analysis shows that particularly partisan families are increasingly less successful in passing their political views on the next generation. The article considers the role of social mobility, educational expansion, value-change, the politicization of families, and the consistency of parental political views for this end.

<p>This article builds on previous findings that border residents are less prone to be Euroskepitc. First, it enhances measurement by using a more exact distinction between border and core districts. Second, it extends theory by arguing that the lower propensity towards Euroskepticism among border residents is the result of their greater involvement in transnational networks and interactions. Third, the article adds to the interest-or-identity discussion in Euroskepticism research by distinguishing between goal-oriented and sociable forms of transnational interactions and testing their impact on Euroskepticism. Multilevel analyses of Eurobarometer data for France and Germany show that (1) the border effect holds only in Germany, (2) it is mediated by individual transnationalism, and (3) sociable forms of interaction are key to structuring attitudes towards European integration.

<p>This paper examines the permanence of differences in the psychological underpinnings of ideological self-identifications. Previous research has suggested that conservatives differ from liberals insofar as their self-identifications as such are best explained as the product of a negative reaction rather than a positive embrace. However, this paper demonstrates that the dynamics underlying the formation of [US] ideological self-identifications are not static reflections of inherent differences in liberal and conservative psychologies but rather evolve in response to changes in the political environment. Whereas feelings (positive or negative) toward liberalism played a decisive role in shaping individuals' ideological self-identifications during the New Deal/Great Society era of liberal and Democratic political hegemony, the subsequent resurgence of political conservatism produced a decisive shift in the bases of liberal and conservative self-identifications.

<p>According to numerous politicians, reforming the welfare state in aging societies has become increasingly necessary despite the growing influence of advocacy groups that have made reforms more difficult to realize. Studying the preferences of seniors' organizations is therefore crucial to comprehending future welfare state policies. I examine recurrent variables that researchers working on seniors' organizations study in order to explain the type of framing or political discourse that these organizations use. Using FARES/VASOS, the largest seniors' organization in Switzerland, as a case study, I show how common explanations (especially the ones that refer to the importance of the context or of the political opportunities structure), if they work, can also be seen as too incomplete or limited.

<p>The Justice and Development party (AKP) has won, for the third consecutive time since 2002, the 12 June 2011 elections. Thanks to the economic boom, the AKP obtained 49.95 percent of the voters, a gain of 3.3 percent over the 2007 results. Founded in 2001 by Recep Tayyip Erdogan, still undisputed charismatic leader, it is a moderate Islamic party. The third conservative homogeneous government led by Erdogan must meet three challenges: that of a new liberal Constitution, which depends on a political and cultural reconciliation with the Kurdish community, and support to the Arab population in the various “Springs,” especially in Syria, while maintaining stability at its borders. Erdogan must achieve reconciliation with the Kurdish deputies, who have been boycotting the operation of the new parliament. [R, transl.]</p>

The most important forms of right-wing extremist violence are identified as ad hoc hate crimes, local ethnically motivated conflicts, activities of organized gangs, the existence of paramilitary units and terrorist tendencies. Political reactions to this violence in Russia are described. The authors conclude that the threat of extreme-right violence will remain an important element of Russia's future security development.

<p>The authors measure a phenomenon they name “exit talk”: the under-theorized pressures that second-place contenders for presidential nominations face to exit the race. Content-analysis of media exit talk from the 2008 H. Clinton candidacy compared with that of key comparators from other modern presidential campaigns suggests that Clinton experienced greater levels of exit talk than her historical comparators, though less explicit pressure to exit than was exerted on R. Reagan in 1976. The authors also find that a higher percentage of Clinton exit talk was unattributed to its source. They investigate the potential causes for these findings and recommend further study of whether this heightened pressure to exit constitutes an unexamined hurdle for female presidential contenders.

<p>Is the FARC (<italic>Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia-Ejército del Pueblo</italic> [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia-People's Army]) merely a terrorist organization involved in narcotrafficking and the predatory tactics of survival, or does it represent a legitimate political movement or alternative? Should the Colombian Left sever any ties to the FARC, or should it attempt to integrate it into the political process? These questions are particularly salient now because the political left in Colombia is arguably emergent, whereas the FARC's military strength has been eroded by the vigorous military and political attacks of the A. Uribe administration and its tactics have made it an unattractive political option. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.2162]</p>

Although the polls show that the Socialist Party has a high probability of winning the presidency, using our model we argue that their likely suecess can be strongly affected by which candidate wins the October two-stage Socialist Party primaries. Our one-dimensional model allows us to estimate how the removal of D. Strauss-Kahn from the set of candidates shifted votes among the other candidates. We also provide insights into the strategic calculations of President N. Sarkozy in his 2007 campaign and in anticipation of the 2012 election. [R, abr.]</p>

This paper [examines] the nature of PAS's mobilization by studying the party's youth wing. Through the conceptual framework of resource-mobilization theory and a detailed study of milestone events in the party's recent history, the paper argues that the youth wing has played a pivotal role in defining the party's identity as well as its political triumphs.

<p>In debates about promoting civic and political engagement in America, political scientists are often skeptical about the role of nonprofit organizations offering health and social services in the US because they are constrained by the tax code and grant agreements. However, I argue that by focusing on what I term social movement-borne nonprofits, we can see how these organizations may engage (marginalized) communities and participate in political activities. To illustrate, I consider the California Prostitutes Education Project (CAL-PEP) and the St. James Infirmary (SJI), two San Francisco Bay-area nonprofits created by prostitute-rights activists that offer HIV/AIDS and other health services to sex workers. I argue that social movement-borne nonprofits engage in political activities through a process of radical institutionalization, whereby they incorporate and advance activist goals within their organizational practices.

<p>The social contract in Soviet and post-Soviet Russia has concerned not classical political rights but socio-economic issues. Loyalty is accorded to the powers-that-be partly from fear of repression, but also in return for new opportunities of advancement — whether resulting from social upheaval or from educational expansion-and for modest improvements in living standards. The Soviet era ended when such benefits could no longer be delivered, on account of lower oil prices, arms-race burdens and lagging productivity and innovation. After the turmoil of the 1990s, the contract was re-established under V. Putin in the early 2000s. Public opinion accepts relatively authoritarian rule if economic stability appears guaranteed in return. Moreover, world events from 2008 onwards have dampened economic expectations. [R, abr.]</p>

While the change from dictatorial regimes to a multiparty political system has enhanced civil society participation in Malawi's social, economic and political issues, the CSO-government relationship is still fraught with suspicion and mistrust.

We link the 2007 PEW survey data on justification for suicide terror and opinions in sixteen countries of the Middle East, Africa and Asia on nine regional powers, to the NCTC data on international terrorist acts between 2004 and 2008. We find that justification in public opinion for suicide terrorism increases terror attacks on people in countries that are unfavorably regarded. There is a robust positive relationship between the share of the population in a country that at the same time justifies suicide bombings and has an unfavorable opinion of another country, and terrorism originating from the former country.

<p>African-Americans routinely have lower levels of political trust compared with whites. Explanations of their political trust remain rather unexamined. Using data taken from the 1996 National Black Election Study, this analysis examines three models to test how demographic characteristics, the media, and social capital and social networks influence political trust among African-Americans. The results show modest support for the models. However, social location as measured by demographic characteristics is most important for explaining the political trust of African-Americans. [R]</p>

<p>We examine a curvilinear effect of the proportionality of election outcomes on political trust using data from the European Social Survey (2006–2009). The findings show that political trust is indeed highest in countries with very proportional as well as in countries with very disproportional election outcomes and lowest in countries that fall in between. Election outcomes that are more fully inclusive and those that provide more accountability can both lead to higher levels of political trust. Next to the proportionality of the translation of votes into seats, this study investigates a broad range of election outcomes that are associated with (dis)proportionality — i.e., the effect of the number of parties in elections, parliament and government, voting for the winning or losing party under different levels of proportionality and the clarity of responsibility.

<p>Patriarchal practices and understandings, especially those based on religious teachings, are seen as serious hindrances to women's access to political power, greatest in countries where Islam is the dominant religion. This study offers preliminary insights regarding how the sex of political candidates affects voting perceptions and behavior in Turkey, one of the few democratic countries with a Muslim majority population. We designed an experiment in which university students read speeches by candidates from the two major parties (AKP and CHP), randomly varying the sex of the candidates. We find that candidate sex influences respondents' evaluations of areas of competence and perceptions of individual characteristics. When it comes to voting, party support and policy stands are vastly more important than candidate sex, even for religiously observant voters. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Focusing on electoral support for the extreme Left and the extreme Right on the eve of the 2007 French presidential election, this article refutes the “convergence of the extremes” theory. It draws on data from the 2007 CEVIPOF French Electoral Panel to compare the profiles of voters for J.-M. Le Pen and O. Besancenot. Combining sociological, psycho-political, and economic models for explaining voter choice, it shows how different Le Pen and Besancenot voters are in their partisan and ideological attachments, as well as their social affinities and their positions on candidates and issues. Divergent social and political logics explain the electoral support for these two candidates: their voters do not occupy the same political space, they do not have the same social background, and they do not hold the same values.

<p>A 2008 poll of 430 Ottawa Muslims found predominantly negative views of the US war on terrorism, including the war in Iraq and the war in Afghanistan. This poll also assessed approval of Western powers (US, Canada, Israel, UN) and challengers of Western power (Al-Qaeda, Hamas, Hezbollah, government of Iran). Surprisingly, attitudes of Ottawa Muslims toward militant Muslim groups were unrelated to their attitudes toward Western governments. Discussion suggests that this pattern, if confirmed in other Muslim polls, would mean that the war of ideas against radical Islam must address not one target but two: favorable opinions of militants and unfavorable opinions of the US Muslims who come to like the West more may not like Muslim militants any less.

<p>Party politics in the European Parliament (EP) consists of competition between transnational party groups, each consisting of multiple national member parties from the 27 member states of the EU. Identifying the policy space that these parties inhabit and their ideological positions is both practically and conceptually challenging. We characterize this policy competition by tracking EP political groups from three separate, original expert surveys taken in 2004, 2007 and 2010. We look at the relative positioning of the groups on multiple dimensions of policy, as well as changes in party group policy since 2004. Additionally, we characterize the policy cohesion of party groups by examining the relative positions of each group's constituent parties, using independent national-level expert surveys. The results reinforce previous findings that EP party groups occupy the entire range of the left-right spectrum and, moreover, that their national party makeup consists of parties that are broadly cohesive in terms of their policy locations.

Using both aggregate and survey data, the issues of incumbency advantage, the electorate's attitudes and the candidates' differing experiences of the political process are explored.

Although commentators speculated about the possible repercussions of this event for Obama's candidacy, no one has actually tested these claims in practice and positioned the episode within a larger narrative of American racial politics. Using national survey data, I discuss differences between Blacks' and Whites' perceptions of the videos and their effects on citizens' attitudes. Among Whites, individuals who are bothered by Wright's assertions feel negatively toward Obama and express apprehension about his ability to unite people around common goals. Blacks' familiarity with African American religion provides a context for understanding the messages and they are not distracted by the controversy.

Using the pre-election and post-election panel component of the 2005 British Election Study and the 2002–03 European Social Survey, the author shows, after controlling for other predictors of trust in politics, that concerns about the impact of immigration significantly affect political trust. In addition, in 2005 the perception that government had not handled the issue of immigration effectively also significantly affected political trust, with both linear and interactive effects.

<p>Do business contributions to political parties convey different messages in different countries, and, if so, why? This article presents a pioneering cross-national study of firm behavior in political finance. It argues that motivations for contributions to parties are either ideological or pragmatic. The author infers motivation by quantitatively relating the payments of 960 firms to various political parties in Australia, Canada, and Germany over periods of between seven and seventeen years. In coordinated market economy Germany, a small number of firms made ideological payments; in liberal market economy Australia and Canada, large numbers of firms made pragmatic payments. Australia's Left/Right party system creates an awareness of policy risk, which motivated ideological payments, but in Canada's unusually nonideological party system no ideological bias in business financing of politics was found.

<p>Latvia's highly distinctive proportional electoral system owes its origins to Latvia's 1922 Constitution and the new democracy's electoral legislation of 1919 and 1922. Latvia's unique feature lies in its preference system, offering the voters the opportunity to judge each candidate on [a] party's list. Although the system appears to maximize responsiveness to voters' preferences, in practice this promise remained unfulfilled and the representative quality of parliament was questionable. This was in large measure because of the capacity of candidates to stand in multiple constituencies. In 2009 amendments to the electoral law altered this key provision. This change clearly made a difference, but it could not resolve fundamental problems of Latvia's political process in general and its political parties in particular. [R]</p>

<p>In a recent article, J.E. Riggs, <italic>et al</italic>. [“Electoral College winner's advantage,” <italic>PS</italic> 42(2), 2009: 353–357] aim to measure the “Electoral College winner's advantage” — in particular, the extent to which the winner's electoral vote margin of victory is magnified as a result of (1) the “two electoral vote add-on” given to each state and (2) the “winner-take-all” mode of casting state electoral votes. Their results are based on two sets of one million simulated two-candidate elections. This note first demonstrates that RHR's simulation estimates can be calculated precisely using the theory of voting power measurement. Second, it corrects several flaws in RHR's analysis, the most substantial of which pertains to the effect of the two electoral vote add-on, which actually has a negative effect on the winner's advantage.

<p>Can terrorist attacks be timed to change the outcome of democratic elections? We analyze the electoral impact of the terrorist attacks of 11 March 2004, in Madrid.

Since the bombings took place only three days before the 2004 [parliamentary] elections, we can find a control group of individuals who cast their vote before the terrorist attacks. The results indicate that the attacks had an important electoral impact, rejecting the hypothesis that the identity of the winner was unaffected by the terrorist attacks. [R]</p>

<p>In the past few years, Argentine labor unions have regained some of the leadership role they lost when they became strategic allies of the government, moderating their wage demands and supporting the government in disputes with other strong social actors. The new landscape created by N. Kirchner's taking office in 2003 provided a favorable context for a revitalization of unions grounded in principles of union democracy. The experience of the subway workers of Buenos Aires, which is paradigmatic for the depth of the changes in internal practices, their persistence over time, and the strong connection between the form of organization and the results achieved, contributes to an understanding of this revitalization. The involvement of members in formulating and implementing policies produces a program more representative of their demands and [offers] experience, skills, knowledge, self-confidence. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>There is no agreement in the literature on popular support for the EU about the direction of the relationship between trust in national and European institutions. Some scholars argue that both are positively related, others have proposed the opposite hypothesis: low levels of trust in national institutions lead citizens to higher levels of support for the EU. We argue that both hypotheses are true but operate at different levels: whereas more trusting citizens tend to be so in both the national and the European arenas, we also find that at the country level the relationship is negative: living in a country with highly trusted and well-performing institutions hinders trust in the EP. We test our hypotheses using data from the European Social Survey and Hierarchical Linear Modeling. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Young people populate a uniquely strategic position within society in general and particularly in party political debate about the future development of citizenship and the national community. UK political parties have however been historically reluctant to engage with young people or represent their interests in the formulation of policies, instead prioritizing older voters. However, the political resonance of issues linked to youth citizenship and democratic engagement has risen recently as political parties have sought to address steep declines in levels of civic and civil activism and the preparedness of young people to vote in elections. This paper explores the emerging party politics associated with such shifts, assessing the extent to which political parties have sought to reform how they engage with young people or reassert traditional modes of citizenship and political participation.

<p>Norway's parliamentary elite has [seen a] dramatically increasing proportion of young, highly educated, and professional politicians, whose previous careers have been almost wholly in party work. The financial support parties receive from the Norwegian state has increased and enabled parties to hire more people to work for them. Consequently, the pool from which professional politicians can be recruited to parliament has expanded. There are, however, other important bases of parliamentary elite circulation in Norway: quotas for female candidates and MPs in some parties; geographic representation; strong controls on candidate-selection by county and local party branches. I assess these patterns longitudinally in parliamentary elections during the past 60 years and comparatively as regards relevant changes in other Nordic parliaments.

<p>The 2010 general elections in Brazil were not expected to be “change elections”.

The article focuses on the elections to the Chamber of Deputies of the Brazilian Congress and on the presidential election. It pays special attention to political parties and their relations within the party system. Despite the relatively stable party alliances both on the left and on the right, the party system does not express a tendency to greater polarization and reduction of the very high number of relevant political parties.

<p>This research investigates whether leftist and rightist citizens make their electoral choices in line with their ideological position and how this relationship changed since unification in Germany. We can expect the ideological polarization of political parties to affect levels of ideological voting. Further, we hypothesize that a pluralization of the meaning of these ideological labels — which is demonstrated by a special analysis — may make it more difficult for parties to summarize their policy positions with a simple shortcut and hence help citizens to make their vote choices. Moreover, it is assumed that the saliency of the left-right dimension differs between East and West Germans. The longitudinal analysis shows relatively constant global patterns of ideologically consistent electoral choices over time, but changing relationships at the level of single parties.

<p>Political consumerism is the intentional buying or abstention from buying specific products for political, social, or ethical purposes.

Analysis of survey data shows that similar to voting, education, political interest, and citizen duty promote political consumerism. Akin to protest behavior, political consumerism is enhanced by political distrust and general discontent. In contrast to turnout, political consumerism significantly decreases with age. Given the extra-electoral and self-initiated nature of political consumerism, citizen initiative and a proclivity for individualized forms of activism are significant sources of political consumerism.

<p>People categorize themselves and others, creating ingroup and outgroup distinctions. In American politics, parties constitute the in- and outgroups, and party leaders hold sway in articulating party positions. A party leader's endorsement of a policy can be persuasive, inducing co-partisans to take the same position. In contrast, a party leader's endorsement may polarize opinion, inducing out-party identifiers to take a contrary position. Using survey experiments from the 2008 presidential election, I examine whether in- and out-party candidate cues — John McCain and Barack Obama — affected partisan opinion. The results indicate that in-party leader cues do not persuade but that out-party leader cues polarize. This finding holds in an experiment featuring President Bush in which his endorsement did not persuade Republicans but polarized Democrats. Lastly, I compare the effect of party leader cues to party label cues. The results suggest that politicians, not parties, function as polarizing cues. [R]</p>

<p>The German electoral system facilitates a regionalization of the electoral behavior in federal elections because the votes are cast for party list in each state (<italic>Land</italic>).

In addition, by analyzing the differences in the party system structure between the states, one can determine the extent and nature of regionalization of the party system. The chapter focuses on the theoretical conceptualization and operationalization of this topic of research. In addition, it empirically demonstrates how the theoretically possible regionalization has developed for German federal elections from 1949 to 2009.

Studying the changes of leadership reveals differences in the leadership culture. While the tenures of the leaders and the competitiveness of their elections are somewhat simple to sort out, the party leader's abdications are more challenging. First, there may have been several factors undermining the leader's authority before the resignation. Reasons for resignation are also not necessarily complementary. Second, the background of the decision to exit sometimes remains hidden from public. Therefore, resignations need to be examined with some subtlety as they do not always fit elegantly into a table format. [R]</p>

An affective dimension of social identity can be measured with good internal consistency. Moreover, the indicators for social identity are systematically related to the intensity of party identification, as well as to external measures, such as political interest. Our empirical analyses indicate that social identity with regard to a party may in fact be one of the foundations of party identification in Germany. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.1567]</p>

Moreover, the political campaign significantly reduces (and possibly eliminates) the direct effect of sex on political knowledge. While the political campaign decreases the number of incorrect answers provided by both men and women, the number of correct answers provided by women increases. Our findings highlight the importance of the political campaign in determining relative levels of political knowledge for men and women. [R]</p>

<p>Scholars recognize a worldwide increase in decentralization as well as the prevalence of multilevel governance in Europe. This article examines the advantages and disadvantages that meso-level institutions present for women's political representation in three EU member-states that are decentralized, unitary states. Using the framework of the triangle of women's empowerment, we ask whether women are represented in meso-level legislatures, women's policy agencies, and women's movements in Italy, Spain, and Poland. We find that gains in meso-level legislatures are slow, but meso-level women's policy agencies and movements provide important access for women to politics. Like scholars studying women and federalism, we conclude that decentralized institutions in unitary states offer both opportunities for and impediments to feminist policy and activism. [R]</p>

<p>This article takes over, from an empirical perspective, one of the classic concerns of normative theories of democracy: political community size and citizen participation. Although it focuses on voter turnout, it asks a simple question: why and how a political body size can influence the political behavior of its residents. We examine, through an aggregate approach, the relationship between size and turnout in various types of elections in Andalusia (1999–2011). Our ecological analysis of participation, by using multi-regression techniques, shows that population size is the main “civic” characteristic of localities. Other characteristics of local contexts, such as income and subsidized agrarian population, are positively related to participation. The data suggest that individual theories of voting behavior should also take into account the contextual factor when offering their conclusions. [R]</p>

Our main results are the consistently higher visibility of the two larger parties, the Green Party at the perceptual forefront concerning new politics issues and the breakthrough of <italic>Die Linke</italic> in 2009 towards average visibility, even in West Germany.

<p>This paper explores the faltering and disorganized implementation of primary elections in Italy, mainly, but not only, for public office at the municipal level. It provides a preliminary assessment of their “functions” and consequences. The author tries to answer the question of what kind of institutional change the primaries “Italian-style” really are. Their impact has been limited and distorted both by the Italian institutional arrangement and especially by the existing electoral law. The overall lesson is that, to be successful, both institutional imitations and innovations require an appropriate institutional environment. [R]</p>

The study analyzes print media reporting on anti-dam protests in Minas Gerais between 1998 and 2005, and shows how, at different moments and in different political contexts, representations of social protest have changed and newspaper reports have either ignored, criminalized or provided visibility to MAB in this region.

<p>The index of electoral volatility has been used as the principal indicators of institutionalization of party systems in recently democratic countries. However, comparative studies usually analyze the index at a highly elevated level of aggregated data, evaluating the variation only in national terms. We analyze Brazilian electoral volatility by taking the twenty-seven federal units as units of aggregation of the electoral data for the Chamber of Deputies. We first show that there is great variability in the index between the states and between the successive elections; [then] we run a statistical test of the explanatory impact of political, economic, and social variables in the variation of electoral volatility in two dimensions: temporal (between elections) and spatial (between states).

<p>Media freedom strongly inhibits corruption and promotes good governance, but what leads to media freedom? Do economic development and higher advertising revenues tend to make media outlets independent of political groups' influence? Using data on 19th c. American newspapers, I show that places with higher advertising revenues were likelier to have newspapers that were independent of political parties. Similar results hold when local advertising rates are instrumented by regulations on outdoor advertising and newspaper distribution. In addition, newly created newspapers were more likely to enter the market as independents in places with higher advertising rates. I also exploit the precise timing of major changes in advertising rates to identify how advertising revenues affected the entry of new newspapers. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article reviews the literature on youth engagement in politics. It argues that much of the research in this area is not set within the commonly understood and widely accepted political science literature on the determinants of voting behavior in the UK. It critiques the methodological approach which underpins much of this research, suggesting that in order to gain a real understanding of the dynamics of contemporary youth engagement an understanding of generational influences and differences is essential. I argue that explanations for youth disengagement tend to emanate from two schools of thought: the traditional political science understanding of youth turnout based on life-cycle explanations, or what I term the “anti-apathy” approach, which fails to situate young people's political activity within the context of the political life-cycle.

<p>The share of late-deciding voters is rising steeply in Germany. With regard to the 2009 German federal election, this article explores how late-deciders reach their final voting decisions. Using longitudinal data, we show that the bulk of late-deciders, especially the politically involved, already had decided on a pre-selection of eligible parties at the very beginning of the election campaign, and, therefore, no longer was susceptible to other parties' persuasive communications. The commonality of those parties considered eligible for late-deciders was the similarity of their policy positions. Ideological or policy considerations thus played a major role in preselecting political parties, whereas decision-making during the election campaign with regard to the ultimately chosen party was guided by evaluations such as those towards candidates which were easier to compare.

<p>Previous important studies examine the role of “risk” propensity in shaping vote choices in Mexico. However, none of these studies determine the degree to which short and long term factors influence a traditionally risk averse respondent's enthusiasm to vote for an opposition party. Using data from the 2000 election, a campaign where risk played a significant role, we evaluate whether various effects mitigate the role of risk in voting for an opposition candidate. We find that risk propensity has a deterministic impact on vote choice and no amount of campaign effects (short term) or negative image of the PRI (long term) mitigated that role. Yet, we uniquely show that this deterministic impact can vary over the campaign period and across the electoral alternatives. [R]</p>

<p>This paper examines whether electoral motives and government ideology influence short-term economic performance. I employ data on annual GDP growth in 21 OECD countries over the 1951–2006 period and provide a battery of empirical tests. In countries with two-party systems, GDP growth is boosted before elections and, under left-wing governments, in the first two years of a legislative period. These findings indicate that political cycles are more prevalent in two-party systems because voters can clearly punish or reward political parties for governmental performance. My findings imply that we need more elaborate theories of how government ideology and electoral motives influence short-term economic performance. [R]</p>

<p>In the last 20 years, extreme-right parties have gained a substantial share of electorate in a number of Western European countries. Despite of substantial research interest, the reasons for the popularity of the extreme-right parties presented in the studies are often contradictory. Our study has a two-fold contribution to the topic. (1) We show that studies based on aggregate data analysis may yield biased results that are not confirmed when contextual and individual-level data are fitted together using the growth-curve analysis. (2) We argue that the analysis of extreme-right vote based on one election suggests a constant effect of contextual variables on the outcome variable. We demonstrate that the effects of local context vary over time, and hence should be modeled using the multilevel (growth-curve) approach. [R]</p>

<p>Confronted with a divided and quarreling opposition, the SPD-Green coalition achieved an overwhelming victory in the Bremen regional election and won a two-thirds majority of seats. The opposition parties (CDU, FDP, and The Left), on the contrary, lost altogether 11.6 percent of the votes. For the first time in German state elections, the Greens left behind even the CDU, while the Liberal Party failed to cross the five-percent hurdle. The victory of the governing parties can be traced back not only to the disastrous condition of the opposition parties but also to the positive evaluation of their competence in all relevant policy fields and of their government performance by the voters, and this despite of rather considerable financial and social problems in the state of Bremen.

<p>Changes in political representation and leadership have generated new forms of political mediation and communication.

Exposing suffering is a shame mobilization strategy, and so becomes a political act. Through the discursive and visual aesthetics of the proximity account, citizens and political leaders are inserted into one political community. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This study examines voter-turnout in the American states in US presidential and House elections from 1920 through 2008. A model predicts turnout as the sum of the national campaign context, state autonomy, and electoral continuity. The national campaign context encompasses conditions that prompt turnout to shift similarly across states. State autonomy involves state-specific factors that prompt turnout to vary across states. Electoral continuity involves people voting in successive elections, regardless of other influences. Testing the model finds that national campaign context effects have increased, but they vary by year, election type, and region and have been mixed since the 1970s. [R]</p>

<p>Using representative samples, this paper examines the relationship between authoritarianism and political preferences in thirteen ex-communist Eastern European countries.

We survey whether authoritarian persons in Eastern European countries might be a possible threat for the transition to democracy. We demonstrate that in general the Eastern European population seems to hold a positive opinion on democracy. However, it becomes also clear that authoritarian persons in the ex-communist countries are significantly less positive towards democracy. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>From an interdisciplinary framework anchored theoretically in Critical Discourse Analysis and using analytical tools from Systemic Functional Linguistics, this article accounts for a crucial use of language in society: the process of legitimization. It explains specific linguistic ways in which language represents an instrument of control and manifests symbolic power in discourse and society. Taking into account previous studies on legitimization, this particular work develops and proposes some key strategies of legitimization employed by social actors to justify courses of action. This study explains the use of these discursive structures and strategies through examples of speeches given by leaders with differing ideologies, specifically G.W. Bush and B. Obama, in two different armed conflicts, Iraq (2007) and Afghanistan (2009), to underline their justifications of military presence in the notorious “War on Terror”. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The development of the pattern of territorial organization established by the Spanish Constitution of 1978 has created non-statewide institutions with legislative powers, and regional elections are held in order to choose non-national deputies. Turnout in these contests is usually lower than that registered in the national parliamentary elections. The paper shows that some groups of voters are particularly prone to vote in national but not in regional elections. This differential turnout is studied in the 2005 Basque Country and 2006 Catalonia regional elections. Econometric models show a relationship between voters' judgments on the performance of the regional incumbent government and the quality of non-national candidates, on one side, and the differential turnout propensity, on the other.

Two trends are particularly important: the younger generations include higher percentages who view themselves as Taiwanese, not Chinese.

<p>Dating back to H. Truman, a number of presidents and prominent political leaders have tried, in some way or another, to reduce the reliance on nuclear weapons in US foreign policy. Such attempts have prompted countless international debates and spawned a cottage industry of security research related to the eventual elimination of nuclear arms. However, aside from the occasional foray, this research paradigm generally overlooks the domestic political obstacles that policy-makers should expect to encounter if national security policy continues down the path toward nuclear zero. In pursuit of this goal, this article empirically examines public attitudes concerning the continued pursuit of nuclear abolition. We highlight the beliefs and perceptions that inform public preferences concerning the importance assigned to retaining nuclear weapons today. [R]</p>

<p>This article examines the collective action frames that civil societal actors in Argentina have used while engaging in advocacy. It argues that by devising effective framing strategies, members of civil society organizations increase their chances of participating in the agenda-setting, formulation and adoption phases of policy-making. The relationship between framing and participation is supported by a comparative analysis of two cases of advocacy: the campaign for a freedom of information law and the struggle for child protection legislation. The evidence suggests that civil societal actors often rely on the strength of their ideas and their persuasive power to achieve political relevance, which is analytically distinct from political outcomes.

But what is crucial today is the sophistication of such a project, made possible by the ideological domination of media together with new surveillance and social control technologies that allow it to rely more on selective than generalized repression.

<p>In decentralized European parliamentary democracies, future governing elites often acquire political experience and attain top positions by passing through sub-national political institutions. In doing so, elites circumvent and reduce the importance of national parliaments. Previous research has advanced several explanations for this pattern: Europe's tradition of bureaucratic government; parties with open methods for selecting parliamentary candidates; the “presidentialization” and Europeanization of national political systems. Since its transition to democracy in 1977, Spain has had an exceptionally small proportion of former MPs in its national cabinets.

<p>The debt crisis in the Euro-zone has caused the governments of several EU countries to collapse. In Slovakia, Prime Minister I.

<p>Many of the pre-election polls published in 2010 that centered on the elections for governor in Mexico were incorrect. This has strengthened many of the misgivings that already existed about public opinion polls that bring into question the effectiveness of the methods used to measure preferences or the honesty of the pollsters. For 2010, there is no systematic evidence that suggests that the discrepancies between the polls and the election results are due to election effects. On the other hand, there is evidence of polling house effect. In this note, I explore several hypotheses based on the available data from pre-election polls published for the twelve entities with elections for governors during 2010. I also mention other determinants that, because of the absence of any public data, cannot be substantiated at this time and thus must be left for future research. [R]</p>

<p>The paper examines whether and how the CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic party/Chistian-Social Union] succeeds in mobilizing its core voters in the context of an increasingly secularized society. It [examines] secularization processes in Germany and their long-term effects on denominational and religious voting. The ensuing in-depth analysis of the federal elections 1998 to 2009 shows considerable variability with regard to the readiness of Protestant voters with strong ties to the church to support the CDU/CSU. This suggests a temporary re-denomination of voting at the 2002 and 2005 elections that contradicts the expectations of the so-called transformation thesis. The paper explains these shifts by reference to the supply-side, i.e., symbolic mobilization strategies of parties that focus on candidate attributes. The results suggest that the religious affiliation of candidates provides cues that may mobilize, but also demobilize core voters. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.1567]</p>

Hypotheses are tested using an original dataset collected during the 2008 Democratic primary. The results suggest that although some superdelegates made their decision based on personal, idiosyncratic factors, for many superdelegates, Democratic voters played the most important role in their commitment process.

<p>This article draws attention to the multiple uses of the term “civil society” by political actors in Europe. Since the end of the 1990s, there has been in literature a shift from interest groups to civil society. Social actors are not any more considered as a significant contribution to the European construction process but as a means for the legitimation of European institutions. The term civil society can indeed be easily used for political advertising as it integrates diverse (and even contradictory) world views. However, European political leaders in their daily practice insist on a pluralist conception, inspired by liberal views. Civil society is then synonymous with interest group society. This use of the term is not shared by the voluntary sector which considers that it deserves a specific treatment based on its value-based behavior. European political and administrative actors impose the specific semantics that suits them best, but they may not have considered that by using the term civil society, they contribute to the legitimation of universal values out side the political realm. Ambiguity in politics is an art full of risks. [R]</p>

<p>B. Obama's successful campaign for president renewed both scholarly and popular interest in understanding the extent to which race remains a barrier for African-American candidates in American elections. Despite a substantial body of work that indicates that African-Americans do face significant barriers to winning White votes, initial interpretations suggest that the Obama vote was not depressed because of his race. I introduce a relatively unobtrusive measure of racial salience to examine whether these initial interpretations are correct. I find that when race was a more salient factor for White voters, they were substantially less likely to vote for Obama and were more likely to think that Obama was focusing attention on African-Americans during the campaign. Thus, even in Obama's historic 2008 campaign, African-American candidates continued to face barriers to winning White support. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.2106]</p>

<p>The Democratic Party of Japan's major victory at the 2009 Lower House election ended more than half a century of almost uninterrupted rule by the Liberal Democratic Party. Based on former party affiliations, the DPJ is divided into eight factions, each headed by party heavyweights. We have to ask whether the factions are motivated by ideological concerns or primarily driven by material concerns. Using surveys on policy positions of party members, I found evidence that the policy diversification within the DPJ is wider than within other parties and that the factions are mainly based not on different policy positions [but] on material (self-interest. [Like] the LDP factions, the factions of the DPJ may become “parties within the party,” posing a major threat to the unity of the party if factionalism within the DPJ is intensifying. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>That voters' party preferences are influenced by the political orientations of their everyday interaction partners is well proven. Taking the example of the 2009 German federal election, this article explores the conditions on which such influences depend. By means of cross-sectional and panel analyses, it is shown that interpersonal influence on voting intentions or decisions is moderated by attributes of discussants (political expertise and trust-worthiness, clarity of political positioning); by attributes of their relationship to the influenced voters (intimacy, frequency of political conversations) and by attributes of the social network to which they both belong (autoregressive effects of other discussants' voting intentions). Findings overall suggest that interpersonal influence is rather a phenomenon of political learning than of social conformity. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.1567]</p>

Dalton's hypothesis of cognitive mobilization [“Cognitive mobilization and partisan dealignment in advanced industrial democracies,” Journal of Politics_46(1), Feb. 1984: 264–284; <italic>Abstr</italic>. 34.4270] explains partisan dealignment by voters' improved cognitive skills and extended information resources. This substitution assumption is however contradicted by the fact that even after recent expansions of the media system, exposure to political information is still positively associated with party attachment. There are also theoretical reasons for assuming, in accordance with the “classical” involvement hypothesis, that party identification motivates and guides voters' political information seeking. This is supported and specified by an analysis of survey data from the 2009 German parliamentary election showing that strength of partisan attachment is a good predictor of voters' information-seeking and political knowledge.

The social backgrounds and careers of all ministers in thirteen cabinets (1991–2009) and all members of the State Duma during its five terms after 1993 are studied. Especially during V. Putin's presidency (2000–2008), a shift toward super-presidentialism altered the circulation and composition of ministerial and parliamentary elites. Cabinets in Moscow consisted increasingly of ministers recruited from state bureaucracies, while the State Duma more and more contained businessmen, party politicians, and celebrities who appeared to treat MP service as simply an episode in their wider careers.

<p><italic>Public Opinion Quarterly</italic> at its outset focused heavily on the influences on public opinion, predicated on the assumption of its strong impact on politics and policy-making. Has this assumption been borne out? This essay reviews the research on the influence of American public opinion on policy-making that began to use survey data first to examine the legislative representation and then national-level and state-level policies. POQ's assumption has been confirmed by a substantial connection, overall, between public opinion and policy-making in the US. Although this general finding is striking, there are limits to what we can conclude from it about American democracy. This raises important questions for future research and in ongoing debates about major issues before the nation, for which the public holds its leaders accountable.

<p>N. Kinnock expressed skepticism about G. Brown's likely showing in the 2010 election debates, suggesting that the Labour leader had a “radio face”. We report an experiment in which students were split randomly between audio and video conditions for the third debate. As Kinnock predicted, Brown was more often proclaimed the winner by listeners. N. Clegg, not D. Cameron, benefited most from television. These differences were statistically significant despite a small sample. We test three explanations for Clegg's advantage: (1) that television boosts the salience of certain traits (notably attractiveness); (2) that television boosts the importance of “style” over “substance;” (3) that listeners form judgments based on performance throughout the debate, while viewers are disproportionately influenced by memorable incidents or remarks. There is evidence supporting all three explanations. [R]</p>

<p>The ebb and flow of radical aspiration featured regularly in French politics, before the failure of the “socialist experiment” in the early 1980s brought about a paradigm shift: political leaders and parties tempered their appeals to radical solutions and conspired, not least through recurrent power-sharing, to vacate mainstream political discourse of much of its former radicalism. Since the presidential election of 2007, however, there has been a marked return to promises of radical change as the common currency of political discourse across the full Left-Right spectrum in France. This article introduces a special issue that brings together scholars from France, Britain, and Canada to discuss some of the meanings, expressions, and prospects of political radicalism in France today.

<p>This article examines the <italic>Front National</italic> (FN) in relation to its core policy issue of immigration. To what extent has FN immigration policy been defined from the outset by its radicalism? Has that radicalism been constant or variable over time? And how far can a reciprocal influence be detected between the FN and the center Right in immigration policy-formulation? Focusing on election campaigns, manifestos, and key moments in the FN's evolution, the article assesses how the party has tailored its radicalism to contextual factors and tactical considerations. It reveals an FN less bound to a fixed policy and more ready to seek accommodation than is generally acknowledged. Conversely, it also assesses how the FN's mobilization of strong support on the immigration issue has had radicalizing effects on the center Right.

<p>The author challenges the dominant view about the deep roots of anti-Americanism in the Russian mentality.

<p>If candidates sometimes seek to distinguish themselves from their parties and are ambiguous about their policy positions, to what extent do the policy platforms of parties affect individuals' perceptions of presidential candidate positions? Using data from the American National Election Study and the Comparative Manifesto Project from 1972 to 2000, we show that citizens are able to use party platforms in their assessments of presidential candidates. We also demonstrate that an individual's level of education is important in the process of linking Republican Party platforms to Republican presidential candidates. Our findings have important implications for the role of parties in presidential elections. [R]</p>

<p>Studies linking election outcomes to economics frequently assume that the economy's salience is constant. This study shows that the economy's salience systematically fluctuates. The number of voters focused on economic issues shifted dramatically throughout the 2008 campaign as the recession worsened and this change occurred well before the financial markets collapsed in September 2008. However, even during the recession, [many] individuals said their vote was based on non-economic issues; for them, there was no relationship between their assessment of the economy and their electoral choice. Consistent with extant theories of issue-attention, citizens who were the hardest hit by the recession and those who had the most anxiety about suffering a financial dislocation in the future were most likely to consider economic performance electorally important while secure voters were less likely to be economic voters.

<p>The Conservative Party came to power in May 2010 after the onset of the global financial crisis, and a central theme of Prime Minister D. Cameron's agenda is the “Big Society,” which aims to make citizens “feel both free and powerful enough to help themselves and their own communities”. It has provided the backdrop for concrete policy initiatives designed to decentralize power, further open up public services and create opportunities for citizens to get engaged at the local level. For it to succeed, the Big Society requires a cultural shift in civic and political engagement, for younger citizens (in particular) to embrace these new opportunities. This article evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of the Big Society in light of what we know about young people's politics in the UK and beyond.

<p>Based on voter survey from European election study 2009, we examine the impact of one individual-level motivational factor, i.e., interest in politics, and its interactions with institutional and contextual factors such as compulsory voting, electoral competition and the number of parties on participation in 2009 European Parliament [EP] elections and previous national elections. The results show that political interest is more closely connected to turnout in second-order elections which are usually considered less salient. Correspondingly, also the contingent effect of compulsory voting and competition is more evident in EP elections. While compulsory voting substantially decreases the turnout gap between the most and least politically attentive voters in both types of elections, the moderating effect of competitiveness is found only in EP elections.

Using the nearest neighbor match method to control for demographic and partisan variation among counties, this analysis of turnout in eight general and primary elections from 2004 to 2008 suggests that vote-by-mail has resulted in a modest boost in voter turnout during presidential election years and for special elections, but has little or no effect in congressional off-year elections.

After contrasting them with civil-society efforts to promote transitional justice and unofficial truth projects, it becomes evident that these unofficial disclosures were animated by revenge as much as the quest for unveiling the truth about communist repression.

<p>Employing an innovative multi-level design and data for the period between 1977 and 2007, this article asks which voters react most strongly to the economic situation in West Germany. First, we analyze how levels of education influence the transformation of objective economic information into subjective assessments of the economic situation. Second, we investigate which groups of voters react most strongly to the economy in casting their votes. The results imply that economic voting is stronger among citizens without party identification and those who are in the center of the ideological left-right spectrum. Education does not have any effect on the extent of economic voting and only weakly moderates the transformation of objective economic conditions into subjective perceptions of the economy.

<p>How and how well do different parties manage similar environmental changes? How do organizations shape parties' adaptation to change? In 1996, New Zealand replaced its Single Member Plurality (SMP) electoral system with a Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) system. MMP added an overriding proportional tier to national elections and compelled the major incumbent parties, Labour and National, to undertake new tasks: the creation of national lists of candidates and the construction of nationwide campaigns for the “party vote”. This paper compares how Labour and National organized candidate selection in response to MMP. It demonstrates how and why Labour possessed organizational capacities to meet these challenges that National lacked before the advent of MMP and for several years after it. [R]</p>

I challenge this latter proposition: (1)analyzing all EP elections since 1979, I first find that higher macro-level support for EU membership leads to higher turnout; (2) I discover that changes in aggregate EU support directly trigger changes in turnout rates; (3) a multilevel analysis of Eurobarometer data confirms these macro-level trends at the micro level and finds that citizens who consider their country's membership in the EU “a good thing” have a higher likelihood of voting in EP elections than those who reject it. These findings have both empirical and theoretical implications. Empirically, the low turnout in EU elections is directly linked to citizens' rejection of the EU project. Theoretically, the second-order national election thesis needs to be altered. Turnout in EP elections is driven by not only national-level factors but also citizens' satisfaction with the EU.

<p>Although some critics point to the potentially negative impact spending has in elections, most recent scholarly evidence indicates that spending may actually promote greater participation in the political process. However, most of this research has uncovered this relationship in races for more visible offices; few studies have focused on whether the same linkage is present in low-information elections. For a variety of reasons, it is not altogether certain whether this relationship would exist for such offices. To test this proposition, we examine the impact of campaign spending on voter rolloff in 172 contested races for intermediate appellate courts (IAC) between 2000 and 2008. In contrast to other types of elections, combined candidate spending in these races had no effect on ballot rolloff. [R, abr.]</p>

We scored the addresses for integrative complexity (IC), motive imagery (MI), and universal values. Obama's mean IC was second highest among recent presidents. His IC fluctuated in response to situational parameters, rising when he was negotiating and maneuvering his policies through Congress, falling when stress was high and a problem seemed amenable to a simple solution.

<p>There has been a broad consensus since the early 1990s that the core values of the British electorate can be represented by two dimensions, a “left-right” dimension and an “authoritarian-liberal” dimension. There has been a keen interest in how the electorate's position on these scales has changed over time. However, there has been little attention paid to how the core values themselves may have changed in composition and effect over the two decades since the measures were first developed. This article uses data from the British Social Attitudes series from 1986 to 2007 and Confirmatory Factor Analyses to trace the structure of these core values over time and to evaluate if the way in which core values interact with key social and political attitudes has changed during this period.

<p>This article analyzes the extent of international involvement in Malawi's electoral processes. Although progress has been made with regard to improving many aspects of the electoral process, many long-term objectives of strengthening the capacity of the Malawi electoral commission have not been reached. The article also offers some possible explanations why — despite extensive external financial support, combined with the donor's signaling of its importance — democratic progress has been limited, and even to some extent has regressed. Although Malawi depends on the international community, the donors also face the problem of “sunk cost,” they have multiple and partly competing objectives for development assistance and there is competition for influence. The Malawian authorities therefore do not face a cohesive donor community with one set of priorities. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Using 1996–2000 General Social Survey responses from non-Hispanic whites, we test claims of earlier researchers that conservative Protestant theology encourages adherents to prefer individualistic rather than structuralist explanations for racial inequality. Methodological issues are central to this research, as special attention is given to the comparisons on which conclusions rely. We use two alternate definitions of conservative Protestantism: one based on denominational preference, the other on self-identification and beliefs. Findings indicate the need for important qualification to claims about the influence of religion on attributions for racial inequality. Among the large group of denominationally defined conservative Protestants, attributions prove to be minimally different from those of other demographically similar Christians. The primary attitudinal divide is between Christian groups and the more racially progressive non-Christians-Jews, adherents of other faiths, and the unaffiliated. [R, abr.]</p>

It argues that the student protests were important in demonstrating the potential of new media for political mobilization, stresses the need to understand better the role of digital tools in political activism and suggests avenues for further research.

<p>According to R. Inglehart's postmaterialist theory, a process of value-change is taking place in Western societies, where people place increasingly more emphasis on self-expression and postmaterialist values rather than economic and physical security. Evidence shows that postmaterialists are young, affluent, well educated and strongly inclined to carry out extra-institutional political participation. Internet researchers have reported that internet users are mainly young, well educated and affluent, thus denoting a similarity to the demographic characteristics of postmaterialists. The profile of the average British internet-user is strikingly similar to those of extra-institutional activists and postmaterialists. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The political parties in the Senate are almost as polarized at they are in the House. Nevertheless, the explanations for party polarization work better in the House than they do in the Senate. We argue that the polarization in the House has directly contributed to polarization in the Senate. We find that almost the entire growth in Senate party polarization since the early 1970s can be accounted for by Republican senators who previously served in the House after 1978 — a group we call the “Gingrich Senators”. While our analysis indicates that part of this effect has its roots in the senators' constituencies, the experience of these representatives serving in the House continues to exert a real and substantial effect on their voting behavior in the Senate.

<p>Despite a long electoral history, Nigeria still maintains a perilous relationship with its elections. The current regime's fourth elections took place just one year after the death in office of President Yar'Adua; they must be put in context to appreciate the main issues. The author addresses questions surrounding the electoral campaign, using the example of the Action Congress of Nigeria; it became the leading opposition party in a country that has not always seen political change via the ballot box. The author presents an initial analysis of the elections' results to understand the changes and continuities they have brought. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.1839]</p>

<p>Do voters take into account position issues, i.e., issues where parties, with varying degrees of emphasis and ambivalence, offer different positions? This article contributes to the understanding of issue-voting by highlighting the so-far neglected question whether such issue-voting effects vary over the parties under consideration. We provide new hypotheses on the conditionality of party-specific issue-voting shedding new light on recent discussions. Taking advantage of the flexibility of conditional logit models, we test these hypotheses for the German federal elections of 2002, 2005 and 2009. We expect a relatively higher issue-reactivity for polar parties, for small parties and for opposition parties. The main result is that especially polar parties induce issue-voting in the sense of the spatial theory of voting. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.1567]</p>

<p>Over the past three decades, scholars studying the phenomenon of political scandal have mostly based their works on the premise that scandals can occur only in liberal democracies. Contradictory to this assumption, however, some of the most heavily discussed phenomena in contemporary semi-authoritarian Russia are scandals emanating from the new, vibrant sphere of social media thriving on a largely unfiltered internet. How are these “internet scandals” impacting politics in the semi-authoritarian political environment? To address this and related questions, I juxtapose two case-studies of police corruption scandals that erupted in the social media sphere in 2009/2010. Drawing on the findings, I argue that Russia's ruling elites are presently very much capable of managing these outbursts of public outrage. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>To understand the brotherhood's prospects in Egypt's upcoming elections, one has to understand the organization itself.

<p>This note first maps the strength and direction of gendered voting for the Australian House of Representatives drawing upon election survey data provided by the AES. Second, it shows that gender-differentiated political participation is not restricted to voting. In particular, evidence supportive of Sanbonmatsu's (2002) baseline effect is produced; women are more likely than men to evaluate female leaders positively, while very few gender differences are apparent in the evaluations of male leaders. Third, regression analyses demonstrate how the gender effects apparent in the 2010 Australian federal election are lessened substantially by controlling for voter evaluations of the major party leaders. These aims will be addressed following a description of the data and methods employed. [R]</p>

<p>The cleavage between generations is becoming increasingly important due to the unresolved environmental and demographic challenges. “Intergenerational justice” (IGJ) [as] a justice category, has moved up on the political agenda, [as seen in] debates in parliament, [which] reflect shifts in social values. The article evaluates if members of the German parliament referred more often to IGJ (and related terms) in the run-up to the elections 2009 than in 2005. A further analysis is made as to whether the concept of “social justice” (SJ) in the German Parliament was less often a subject of discussion. The results are broken down according to document type, political party and policy area. [R, abr.]</p>

The text is shown to treat in a highly biased and reductionist manner its material, which is shown to have been arbitrarily selected, since possible counterarguments concerning the party's resolutions and relevant research are not taken into consideration. The authors criticize that as a consequence, a distorted image of <italic>Die Linke</italic> is evoked, suitable for dubious political purposes and thereby trivializing anti-Semitism which remain a problem all to real in society.

<p>Economic sabotage has been a feature of the more radical parts of the animal rights and liberation movement in the western world for several decades. Rather than just underground, politically motivate actions from disenfranchised activists, economic sabotage should be seen as a selective, well-calculated strategy practiced by empowered activists. Using an analysis of Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty, this piece argues how “sabotage” — a repertoire of contentious actions which straddle legality — has more recently been facilitated by the proliferation and use of information communications technologies (internet, e-mail and mobile telephony). In view of this development, this article illustrates its role within the direct action domain of the UK animal rights and liberation movement, and examines some of the UK governments' responses.

<p>Throughout the 2008 [US] Democratic primary, Senator H. Clinton, her supporters and advocates, feminist groups, and commentators accused the media of sexist coverage. Was Clinton treated differently in the media because of her gender? The authors examine the forms of address that television newspeople use to refer to the Democratic primary candidates. The authors find that newspeople referred to Clinton more informally than her male competitors. This treatment stemmed from the gender of the broadcaster; males show gender bias in how they reference presidential candidates. The authors conclude with suggestions for addressing gender bias in news coverage. [R]</p>

<p>This paper analyzes the effects of citizen perceptions of democratic legitimacy in Latin America. In the aftermath of the electoral process, citizens who voted for losing candidates, or who cast blank or spoiled ballots, have less of an incentive than those citizens who backed the winning candidates, to support the government whose leaders they did not choose. based on data from the 2008 Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP) survey, that centers on ten countries in the region, it was possible to estimate two probit models. These models confirmed that individuals who belonged to the group of “losers” after the elections are less likely to legitimize democracy than those in the group of winners. However, this relation is mediated by political-institutional and attitudinal variables. [R]</p>

<p>This study explains why people voted differently in the 2009 regional and European elections in Belgium. By comparing loyal voters and voters who split their ticket, the article shows that a part of the electorate is driven by Euro-specific motivations. The proportion of people who truly vote ‘European’ depends on the political context, and more precisely on what parties offer the voters in terms of candidates and issues. However, the European dimension is not the only mechanism that underlies voters' electoral choices at the European level. In particular, uncertain voters, who lack a clear preference for one party at the national level, are likely to split their ticket between the regional and European elections. [R]</p>

<p>This article offers an overview of levels of party membership in European democracies [over] the past] decade and [examines] changes in these levels over time, comparing party membership today with figures from both 1980 and the late 1990s. While relying primarily on the direct and individual membership figures as reported by the parties, the fit of the data with survey data is explored and we conclude that the two perform well in terms of convergent validity. The differences between large and small democracies are examined, as well as old and new democracies, and we find that levels of party membership are related to both the size and age of the democratic polity in question. Finally, the implications of the patterns observed in the membership data are discussed. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Although media researchers, journalists and politicians across media systems agree that the mass media have the power to make or break politicians, types of scandals that are covered vary widely across countries. This article analyzes the particularities of Danish mediated scandals by comparing them to scandal coverage in the UK, Spain and Germany. Based on a survey among political journalists in the four countries, the article presents differences in journalistic culture between the four countries by describing the dominant role conceptions. We argue that different role conceptions (watchdog, entertainment and political partisan) can all lead to scandal coverage, but that types of scandals vary across journalistic cultures along the dimensions breach of rules vs. breach of norms and public life vs. private life.

Kaczyński's national conservative, Euroskeptic party Law and Justice from returning to power. The surprise was the success of the libertarian, anti-clerical Palikot movement, which attracted mainly young voters. Tusk must use his second chance to show a greater ability to deliver reform than in his first term. [R]</p>

<p>Using pooled regional election data for the period from 1981 to 2009, we explore the importance and stability of the two traditional cleavages of German politics (socio-economic and religious) [for] voting in favor of the CDU/CSU [or] the SPD. Using hierarchical modeling, both regional peculiarities and the passage of time are taken into account. Both cleavages appear important for electoral behavior at the level of states, although with some deviations from the typical pattern found at federal elections. The trend, found for federal elections, of a declining importance of traditional cleavage-based voting emerges also for state elections. It concerns workers' support for the SPD more than Catholics' support for the CDU/CSU. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.1567]</p>

<p>Candidate-centered politics plays a relevant role in public and scientific discourse. It is said that chancellor candidates can decide elections. On the basis of this debate we empirically test a theoretical model of vote-choice with three steps of decision-making: generalization of evaluations, preference-formation and decision process. results for the parliamentary elections from 1998 to 2009 show that information-processing follows the three steps defined by the model. We observe neither a personalization of politics in the sense of an increasing relevance of candidate-traits on vote-choices, nor a de-politicization by an increasing relevance of non-political personal characteristics of candidates.

<p>This article investigates methodologies for translating data from constituency betting markets in each of the UK's 650 constituencies into national-level predictions of parties' seat-shares for the 2010 House of Commons election. We argue that information from betting markets is highly disaggregated (offering candidate-level predictions), adjustable throughout the campaign, and free to access — meaning that such data should be a useful resource for electoral forecasters. However, we find that constituency-market gambling data from the site <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Betfair.com">Betfair.com</ext-link> proved to be a relatively poor basis for predicting party seat-shares, and we also find evidence suggesting that the data were systematically biased in several ways. Nonetheless, future research in this area should compensate for these biases to harness the potential of constituency prediction markets for electoral forecasting. [R]</p>

<p>Under D. Cameron's leadership, reforms have been made to the Conservative Party's parliamentary selection procedures and distinct women's policies developed, thus addressing both the descriptive and substantive representation of women. We examine party members' attitudes towards three types of gender issue: basic orientations towards gender roles and relations; specific policy measures relevant to the substantive representation of women; and the descriptive representation of women. Detailed empirical analysis reveals that there is significant support for progressive liberal feminist positions on each of these dimensions in the party, and that sex, age and basic ideological dispositions drive such attitudes to varying degrees. Even so, support for a liberal feminist position on the descriptive representation of women remains on the whole quite limited. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>While studies of Western Europe suggest that voters are happier than nonvoters, this relationship has not been explored in the younger democracies of the developing world, including those of Latin America. Using multilevel regression models to examine individual-level survey data, this study shows a positive correlation between voting and happiness in the region, noting, however, that the relationship is attenuated in those countries that have enforced compulsory voting. We then explore the causal direction of this relationship: while the existing literature points to voting as a possible determinant of individual happiness, it is also possible that happier individuals are more likely to vote. Three different strategies are used to disentangle this relationship. On balance, the evidence suggests that individual happiness is more likely to be a cause rather than an effect of voting in Latin America. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>On the basis of a telephone-survey in 2008/2009, a wide range in political knowledge of the population is shown. There are no significant differences between native-born Germans in West and East, but a lower level of knowledge exists among immigrants from Turkey, especially among those who do not have the German citizenship. Feelings of being personally affected, identification with the country, education, and access to the media are especially important factors influencing the individual level of political knowledge. Political knowledge itself is shown to be a relevant determinant of political attitudes and political participation, even when controlling for education and political interest. Therefore, it is a matter of some urgency that this neglected field of research be given more attention. [R]</p>

<p>Why people follow the incitement of powerful individuals to participate in collective violence remains one of the most intriguing questions in the study of conflict. By using process-tracing to analyze in detail a violent ethno-religious conflict in Indonesia, this study concludes that rioters are often not provoked by elite propaganda but rather are acting out of their own interest. However, their violence sets off a chain of events that causes large-scale communal conflict. This escalation is most likely in the presence of three causal mechanisms: the immobilization of local security forces; widespread sentiments of sympathy for innocent victims; and the creation of intense feelings of insecurity.

The author argues that the female sociopolitical subculture within individual states heavily influences whether or not female candidates will enter and win their respective primaries and general elections.

<p>Taking the example of Germany's 2009 general election, the paper explores the impact of immigration background on electoral participation and party-choice. The influence of the respective migration system, experiences with the political regime in the country of origin, contexts of reception and degree of integration, as well as changes from the first to the second generation, are systematically tested. While the electoral participation gap between immigrants and the native population proves to be mainly temporary, party-choice is rather permanently shaped by the reception of an immigrant group in the country and by the potential of being discriminated against.

<p>While various descriptive and prescriptive citizen participation models suggest ways to improve citizen participation, none has been subjected to large-scale empirical tests. This article develops and tests an organizational theory model that explores the conditions under which citizen involvement as a general strategy can improve administrative decision-making. The new model focuses on organizational variables that are more directly subject to managerial influence, such as political support, leadership, red tape, and hierarchical authority, as well as variables related to participant competence and representativeness. Hypotheses are tested with data collected from a national survey of [US] local government managers. The results suggest that public management matters for citizen participation. The conclusion calls for integrating quantitative designs with normative and qualitative citizen-participation research. [R]</p>

<p>This paper examines the permanence of differences in the psychological underpinnings of ideological self-identifications. Previous research has suggested that conservatives differ from liberals insofar as their self-identifications as such are best explained as the product of a negative reaction (both to liberalism generally and to the groups associated with it in particular) rather than a positive embrace. However, this paper demonstrates that the dynamics underlying the formation of ideological self-identifications are not static reflections of inherent differences in liberal and conservative psychologies but rather evolve in response to changes in the political environment. Whereas feelings (positive or negative) toward liberalism played a decisive role in shaping individuals' ideological self-identifications during the New Deal/Great Society era of liberal and Democratic political hegemony, the subsequent resurgence of political conservatism produced a decisive shift in the bases of liberal and conservative self-identifications.

<p>This study examines the role celebrity status may play in potential voters' evaluation of a political candidate presented in a newspaper article. Participants indicated greater intention to vote for a candidate who was a recognizable Hollywood actor than an unknown candidate in a political race, regardless of how substantive the political information provided about the candidate was. This suggests that familiarity with a celebrity can act as a heuristic in peripheral processing. [R, abr.]</p>
