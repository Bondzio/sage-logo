<sec><title>Background:</title>
<p>A randomized trial carried out by Shepherd et al. in patients with advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer showed statistically significant benefit of erlotinib over placebo in prolonging overall survival and progression-free survival.</p>
</sec>
<sec><title>Objectives:</title>
<p>The primary outcome was to compare overall survival of patients treated with erlotinib for non-small-cell lung cancer at Alberta Health Services – Cancer Care to the overall survival seen in the pivotal trial. Secondary outcomes included comparing progression-free survival, overall response rate, and duration of response between the two patient populations.</p>
</sec>
<sec><title>Methods:</title>
<p>A retrospective review of charts was conducted for patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer who received erlotinib therapy after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen between 1 August 2006 and 31 July 2009. Survival data was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method.</p>
</sec>
<sec><title>Results:</title>
<p>Median overall survival and progression-free survival were 5.19 months and 2.46 months, respectively, in Alberta Health Services – Cancer Care patients. The rate of response was 11% (median duration of response, 6.7 months). The likelihood of a response to erlotinib was higher among nonsmokers (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and those with response to prior chemotherapy (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0896). In multivariate analysis, good performance status (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0109) and response to prior therapy (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) were favorable factors for survival.</p>
</sec>
<sec><title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>In a clinical setting, erlotinib does not perform as well in terms of median overall survival as reported in the pivotal trial (5.19 vs. 6.70 months).</p>

<sec id="sec1-1078155212464087" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among men and women in Canada.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078155212464087">1</xref></sup> In advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), chemotherapy offers symptomatic relief and slight improvement in survival, but responses are brief, with a median time to progression of 3 to 5 months. Second-line chemotherapy with docetaxel can prolong survival after platinum-based therapy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155212464087">2</xref></sup> but until recently there was no defined alternative second-line or third-line therapy for NSCLC.</p>
<p>The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family of tyrosine kinases is part of a complex signal-transduction network that is vital to several critical cellular processes. EGFR signaling causes increased proliferation, decreased apoptosis, and enhanced tumour cell motility and neo-angiogenesis. It is expressed moderately or highly in a variety of human tumours of epithelial origin, so it is a rational target for anti-tumour strategies and new drug development. Since EGFR is often found in NSCLC, there is increasing interest to develop new agents that target the EGFR pathway. Erlotinib (Tarceva®) and gefitinib (Iressa®) inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR and have been studied at length. In a randomized phase 2 trial of gefitinib, 10% to 20% of patients previously treated with platinum-based regimens responded to therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078155212464087">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078155212464087">4</xref></sup> In a phase 2 trial of erlotinib among previously treated patients with NSCLC in which 10% or more of the cells expressed EGFR, the response rate was 12.3%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078155212464087">5</xref></sup> These rates were promising, but it was unknown whether treatment with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor prolongs survival. For this reason, the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trails Group conducted a randomized double blind study (BR21 clinical trial) in 17 countries and enrolled 731 patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. In this trial carried out by Shepherd et al. 49% of the patients had received two prior chemotherapy regimens and 93% had received platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients underwent a 2:1 randomization to receive erlotinib 150 mg orally daily versus placebo. The response rate was 8.9% in the erlotinib group and less than 1% in the placebo group (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001); the median duration of the response was 7.9 months and 3.7 months, respectively. Progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.2 months and 1.8 months, respectively (hazard ratio = 0.61, adjusted for stratification categories; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Overall survival (OS) was 6.7 months and 4.7 months, respectively (hazard ratio = 0.70; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), demonstrating the benefit of treatment with erlotinib.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078155212464087">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The benefit of erlotinib reported by Shepherd et al. in prolonging OS and PFS has resulted in it being extensively used in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. This drug was approved to be funded by the Alberta Health Services (AHS) Cancer Care Drug Benefit Program in August of 2006. The standard regimen used at AHS Cancer Care is erlotinib 150 mg orally daily until disease progression. The use of erlotinib in the second-line setting is in direct competition with the use of docetaxel, for the good performance status patient, with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) 0 or 1. It can also be used in the second-line setting in patients who otherwise would not have been treated with docetaxel (given their poor performance status or for whom docetaxel would be considered contraindicated). Furthermore, it can be used in the third-line setting after failure or intolerance to docetaxel. In the trial by Shepherd et al., patients with prior breast cancer, melanoma, or hypernephroma were ineligible, as were those with other malignant diseases (except basal-cell skin cancers) within the preceding 5 years. Other exclusion criteria were symptomatic brain metastases, clinically significant cardiac disease within 1 year, ventricular arrhythmias requiring medication, and clinically significant ophthalmologic or gastrointestinal abnormalities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078155212464087">6</xref></sup> Criteria for patients receiving erlotinib in AHS Cancer Care are less rigorous. The AHS Cancer Care Drug Benefit Program simply states that erlotinib can be used for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen and whose EGFR expression status is positive or unknown.</p>
<p>Efficacy is a measure of the capacity of an intervention to produce a desired effect. Efficacy assessments occur under the most ideal conditions in a controlled environment, as in a randomized controlled trial. Effectiveness is a measure of the actual effect of the treatment in clinical setting. Effectiveness assessments account for the variability of patient and environmental characteristics that occur in actual practice. Hence, efficacy of an intervention in a clinical trial may not be entirely reflected in its effectiveness in a clinical setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155212464087">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this retrospective chart review, past survival outcomes achieved in a clinical setting with erlotinib will be evaluated and compared to those obtained in the pivotal clinical trial. The patient population at the AHS Cancer Care will also be evaluated and compared to the trial patient population.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1078155212464087"><title>Objectives</title>
<p>The primary outcome of the study is to compare the OS of patients treated with erlotinib for NSCLC at AHS Cancer Care to the OS seen in patients who received erlotinib therapy in the trial conducted by Shepherd et al. Secondary outcomes include comparison of PFS, overall response rate (complete and partial response, progressive disease and stable disease), and duration of response between the above mentioned patient populations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1078155212464087" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title>
<p>A list of patients was generated from the pharmacy computer database at AHS Cancer Care. A retrospective review of electronic patient charts and pharmacy dispensing data was conducted. This study was approved by the Alberta Cancer Board Research Ethics Board. Because the nature of this research was retrospective and did not require patient contact, the board did not require patient consent.</p>
<sec id="sec4-1078155212464087" sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients</title>
<p>The study included patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose EGFR expression status was positive or unknown and who received erlotinib therapy after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen between 1 August 2006 and 31 July 2009. This study period was chosen to reflect when public funding of this intervention began, until a date which provided at least 450 patients for data analysis.</p>
<p>All patients who participated in a clinical trial prior to or while receiving treatment with erlotinib or who received erlotinib previous to August 2006 were excluded from the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1078155212464087"><title>Chart reviews</title>
<p>The primary outcome of the study was the comparison of OS, which was defined for the AHS Cancer Care patients as the time from the start of treatment with erlotinib, until the patient’s death or 31 December 2009, whichever came first. Secondary outcomes included the comparison of PFS, overall response rate (complete and partial response, progressive disease and stable disease), and duration of response. For the AHS Cancer Care patients, PFS was defined as the time from start of erlotinib until the time of discontinuation of erlotinib (due to documented disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death). Response rate including complete response (CR), partial response (PR), progressive disease (PD), stable disease (SD), and duration of response were defined according to RECIST.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078155212464087">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Other data to explore possible trends and comparison patterns was also collected. These included data regarding the patient’s disease state and prior management such as: diagnosis, histologic subtype of cancer (adenocarcinoma vs. others), number of prior chemotherapy regimens (one vs. two), exposure to prior platinum therapy (yes vs. no), and best response to prior therapy (complete or partial response vs. stable disease vs. progressive disease). Data regarding the patient’s treatment with erlotinib was also collected, including: initial erlotinib dose, dose reduction and delay and reason for the reduction or delay, and adverse effects. Other data collected included data specific to the patient such as: age at commencement of treatment with erlotinib (60 years or less vs. greater than 60 years), sex, ECOG PS, EGFR protein expression, smoking status (smoker vs. former-smoker vs. nonsmoker vs. unknown), presence of clinically significant cardiac disease, diagnosis of ventricular arrhythmias requiring medication, presence of clinically significant ophthalmologic or gastrointestinal abnormalities, presence of pulmonary diseases, and history of another primary cancer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1078155212464087"><title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>OS was calculated as the time from the start of treatment with erlotinib, until the patient’s death or 31 December 2009, whichever came first. PFS was calculated as the time from start of erlotinib until the time of discontinuation of erlotinib. Duration of response was calculated as the time from when measurement criteria were first met for response until the first date that progressive disease was objectively documented. Overall response rate was collected from patient progress notes, as assessed by the prescribing physician according to RECIST. Median survival was determined by the Kaplan-Meier method.</p>
<p>Patient demographics and baseline characteristics were evaluated using descriptive statistics and compared to those seen in the patients from the pivotal trial by Shepherd et al. The treatment variables were also evaluated using descriptive statistics. Fisher’s Exact Test was used to assess the significance of the impact of various factors on response to treatment. Multivariate analysis was used to assess the impact of various prognostic variables on survival outcomes.</p>

<p>A total of 450 patient charts were reviewed as part of this retrospective study. Of the patients reviewed, 307 patients were eligible for inclusion into the study, while 143 patients were ineligible. Eighty-nine patients were excluded as they had participated in a clinical trial prior to or while receiving treatment with erlotinib, whereas 54 patients were excluded because they had either received erlotinib as first line therapy for their NSCLC (no prior chemotherapy) or they had received erlotinib previous to August 2006. All 307 patients were included for safety analysis, and 257 patients were included for OS analysis (50 censored as they were still alive at the time of analysis). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1078155212464087">Table 1</xref> outlines the relevant baseline characteristics of the patients included in this study and the study by Shepherd et al.

<sec id="sec14-1078155212464087"><title>Survival</title>
<p>The survival outcomes of the more diverse clinical population are not equivalent to those seen in the pivotal clinical trial. OS of patients receiving erlotinib at AHS Cancer Care was found to be less than that reported in the pivotal clinical trial by Shepherd et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078155212464087">6</xref></sup> (5.19 vs. 6.70 months), whereas PFS was found to be slightly more (2.46 vs. 2.20 months). The values determined for survival were not statistically compared with those obtained in the pivotal trial.</p>
<p>In the varied patient population, which occurs in clinical practice, there are many factors that influence prognosis. These factors are controlled in clinical trials and without these controls, results are more likely to be biased. The median survival outcomes of this evaluation may have been less than that of the pivotal clinical trial for several reasons.</p>
<p>There were a number of clinical trials available to patients during the time period of this evaluation. This means the evaluated patients may have been ineligible, unwilling, or unable to participate in these trials. Patients ineligible for the trials may have been excluded for reasons that can impact survival, resulting in a patient population that may be more likely to have inferior OS outcomes. Also, inclusion and exclusion criteria in clinical trials have factors that affect patient outcomes. When patients who would likely be excluded from clinical trials are included in the effectiveness analysis in clinical practice settings such as one seen in this evaluation, the interventions do not do as well as anticipated. The baseline patient characteristics showed many differences between the two study populations, which may have resulted in differing survival outcomes. There were a greater percentage of patients over 60 years of age (68 vs. 57) in this retrospective review as compared to the pivotal clinical trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078155212464087">6</xref></sup> There were a higher percentage of patients with an ECOG PS score of 3 (20 vs. 9). Both of these differences may have resulted in lower median OS outcome. Also, the percentage of patients who had received two or more prior treatment regimens vastly differed between the retrospective study and the pivotal clinical trial (16.6 vs. 49.4).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078155212464087">6</xref></sup> During the time period looked at by the retrospective study, erlotinib was being used at AHS Cancer Care in the second-line setting in patients who otherwise would not have been treated with docetaxel (given their poor performance status or for whom docetaxel would be considered contraindicated) or in the third-line setting after failure or intolerance to docetaxel. The finding that more patients in the retrospective study received erlotinib in the second-line setting as opposed to the third-line setting after docetaxel may mean that more patients receiving erlotinib in the retrospective study were of poorer performance status and hence deemed inappropriate candidates for intravenous chemotherapy by their treating oncologists. This difference may again have resulted in lower median OS outcome.</p>
<p>Patients in clinical settings are not followed-up as strictly as those in clinical trials, and they may not undergo radiologic investigations as often. This may result in a lag period between the time the patient actually started to experience disease progression and the time that the progression is documented in clinic. This can account for the slightly increased PFS seen in the AHS Cancer Care patients compared to the trial patients.</p>
<p>In conclusion, erlotinib has a role as a palliative therapy in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC, but the survival benefit in the general population provided by this therapy is slightly less than that seen in the pivotal trial. As outlined earlier, one of the most probable explanations for the minor differences seen in the findings for survival rates may be the fact that the patient population who would have likely been excluded from the Shepherd et al. trial due to comorbidities or poor performance status was actually included in the retrospective study performed at AHS Cancer Care, and hence the intervention did not do as well as anticipated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-1078155212464087"><title>Prognostic Factors</title>
<p>In multivariate analysis, ECOG PS and response to prior therapy were the only variables to reach statistical significance as favorable factors for survival. It is likely that other prognostic factors that have shown an impact on survival in prior trials also have an impact on these patients. However, the patient population may have been too small to detect these differences.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-1078155212464087"><title>Limitations</title>
<p>The primary limitation of this study was that it was a retrospective review. Due to the nature of retrospective reviews, required information may be incomplete or absent. This limited the study to looking at survival outcomes predominantly. Other outcomes, such as quality of life or pain response, which are of particular interest in patients in whom treatment is essentially palliative, were not possible to evaluate. An evaluation of quality of life and pain measures in clinical practice would complement this trial.</p>
<p>Specific data from the Shepherd et al. trial was not available, hence statistical comparisons could not be performed for survival outcomes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-1078155212464087" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Erlotinib has a role as a palliative therapy in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC. However, the OS benefit in the general population provided by this therapy is slightly less than that reported in the pivotal trial.</p>
