<p>A biennial event, the MIT conference last year followed on from the 2009 <italic>Stone and Papyrus: Storage and Transition</italic> conference – which was concerned with questions of archiving in media contexts – with a theme that in a sense revisits ideas central to the 1999 inaugural meeting, entitled <italic>Media in Transition</italic>. Twelve years on, the 2011 call for papers also invited contributors to consider issues addressing the constant state of change that defines the contemporary media landscape. Now, however, in an era when the relationship between humans and technology has been changed by (among other things) the formation of social networks – such as Facebook and Twitter – and the process of planned obsolescence of digital systems has been accelerated through a business model developed by Apple’s iPad and iPhone product line, potential speakers were encouraged to more directly address both the pros and the cons of perpetual digital renewal and flux. Certainly, many contributors responded by presenting research on the growing amount of new media platforms, yet others sought to reclaim the importance of analogue media formats in the face of their seeming displacement by more efficient digital ones.</p>
<p>Under this mandate, the subjects that could be discussed become understandably broad, fitting perhaps for an academic community faced with the challenge of making sense of the seemingly infinite, and infinitely customisable, modes of digital interaction and consumption. In a sense, the chaos caused by an excess of new and updated systems and digital formats has been an issue for delegates during previous MIT events. Indeed, the 2009 conference on archiving issues did address questions of the potential loss of data held in redundant database formats, and the inherent challenges of migrating digital information as host technologies increasingly require updating.</p>
<p>Issues relating to the archive reappeared as a concern in MIT7, both as the framework for some panel sessions and the focus of at least one public forum. Yet within the larger conference theme of ‘Unstable Platforms’ the difficulties of choosing how to preserve archived data, when faced with diverse and competing formats, was accompanied by more fundamental questions about how to ascertain the worth of media objects themselves. While following on from the general discussion of media access and retrieval that characterised the MIT6 conference, MIT7 broadened the scope so that the 2011 panellists were examining issues of categorisation and dissemination in an effort to discover how digital media artefacts are assigned cultural value. Within this context, debates revolved around the desirability of creating digital narratives that are both sustainable and can be preserved for future research purposes. These potential narratives will be drawn from the raw data mediated through social networking platforms and official news sources. Yet this focus on narrative design was also identified as imposing a unifying theoretical approach to new media networks which have provided invigorating processes of empowerment and collaboration that cannot be so easily delineated. Much of this debate was in relation to Twitter, which was seen as a testing ground for how narratives are constructed in the digital era. Questions of how – and whether it is wise – to try and construct meaningful narratives out of individual pieces of virtual content, images and objects that emerge from the unremitting flood of data channelled across the world by multiple devices was therefore a significant point of interest.</p>
<p>But there were also specific avenues of research discussed that both complemented and enlarged these debates in ways useful for future research. These included work on analogue nostalgia and the interactive audience, as well as three panels dedicated to research undertaken at the University of Amsterdam on ‘Digital Methods’, in particular the distinction between those artefacts born digital and those that have been transferred from pre-existent ‘old media’ forms.</p>
<sec id="section1-1354856511433685">
<title>Narrative and the flood of media content</title>
<p>Conference discussions about the abundance of platforms, unstable media and archiving are themselves connected to the academic discipline of Comparative Media Studies. The opening speeches by conference directors William Uricchio and David Thorburn argued that Comparative Media Studies is often perceived by other branches of academia as a fundamentally undisciplined branch of learning. Certainly, when compared to disciplines such as art and literature, the conceptual boundaries over what is meant by ‘media’ are far more problematic and less clear-cut. At MIT7, ‘media’ was taken to include new formats such as video games, digital filmmaking and social networking, while also infringing on traditional scholastic fields such as art history and museum curatorship, literature, and book and periodical publishing. As ‘media’ infiltrates these classic academic disciplines, Thorburn noted that even for researchers and practitioners within Comparative Media Studies there is a sense of disorientation that will only be amplified in the future. He observed how unsettling and confusing a transformational phase can be, with its ceaseless hurricane of technological convergence and planned obsolescence, perpetuated by new modes of communication and facilitated by the global phenomenon that is the internet.</p>
<p>Faced with a bewildering array of endless data spread via often competing modes of digital transmission, many panellists argued that it is part of our condition as humans to construct narratives from the raw data we retrieve. This cultural impulse to construct intelligible stories was explored at MIT7 in the context of research into journalistic and creative practices related to Web 2.0, with particular reference to the hypertextual strategies of online writing, such as the blog and interactive fiction. Piret Viires’ research into the publication of digital blogs as printed books weighed the larger complex stories of print media against the disjointed and open-ended reportage of the blogosphere, and found the former somewhat limited, potentially unable to compete with the episodic, constantly evolving characteristics of online text. Speaking from a journalistic viewpoint, Joshua Benton noted that the stories told through digital media platforms have indeed become less contained and less complicated by virtue of their subjectivity and their brevity. This second point is particularly the case with Twitter, which restricts its users to 140 characters of text. But he added that the gatekeepers and distribution services such as the <italic>New York Times</italic> need better tools to capture these disconnected micro-narratives.</p>
<p>An example of the complexities of the asynchronous relationship between available, accumulated data and the reframing of that data as official narrative was demonstrated in Brian Johnsrud’s paper on the torture of detainees at Abu Ghraib, as perpetrated and photographed by their US captors. An examination of the digital photographs revealed a militaristic, investigative and governmental imperative to create a chronicle of events as a method of understanding them. Understanding in this context was a matter of reframing the events so that they were seen as anomalous. In other words they do not serve to portray the relationship between the USA and the Middle East as one of habitual victimisation and oppression. Military investigators, beginning with Brent Pack, were tasked by the US Army Criminal Investigation Command with plotting a coherent order of events from over 1400 digital photographs. Of these, 280 were chosen to establish a timeline of abuse, facilitated by the analytic powers of the forensic software programme Encase to single out which camera recorded which image, and when. To create an intelligible order of events, certain images were reproduced that supported the official narrative. The process of trying to understand these acts of torture through an official reconstruction served two contradictory impulses, explainable in psychoanalytic terms. The first is the compulsion to order and make sense of events as sequential. This has, however, been supplanted by the second, which is the urge to repeat events of trauma, either on a personal or a societal level. It is a condition that finds its parallel in the actions of cutting, copying and pasting that define the flexibility of digital software environments. The suggestion here is that the digital environment actually fosters this compulsion.</p>
<p>Other papers also raised this issue of the relationship between the fragment and the construction of narratives from those fragments, but in other ways. Daniel Faltesek found that, in the creative sphere, editors with access to (in particular) Apple’s Final Cut Pro are able to create fragmentation with ease, increasing the capacity for non-linear editing. This effectively changes the entire aesthetic of narrative construction that extends to documentary formats such as reality television and even sports programming. However, throughout MIT7, the most extensive examination of the possibilities, and the potential difficulties, of deciphering the accumulation of digitally captured data as intelligible stories was reserved for the aforementioned social networking service Twitter. This platform has gained popularity in the academic community by being chosen as the medium by which messages can be passed rapidly between delegates in conferences such as MIT7 (the Society for Cinema and Media Studies also used Twitter during their March 2011 conference). Launched in 2006, Twitter allows users to write ‘microblogs’ (‘tweets’). The requirement to be concise when constructing messages creates an as-it-happens, ‘hit-and-run’ approach to the dissemination of information.</p>
<p>Leandro Gejfinbein saw Twitter as a useful example of citizen journalism in action, with the user able to directly comment on unfolding events and transmit them to a potentially global audience. His research had initially concentrated on an analysis of new media platforms through which Brazilian soap operas could be promoted, with particular emphasis on Twitter. However, when authors of the tweets Gejfinbein was following began reporting on a particularly violent episode in the ongoing war on drug trafficking in Rio de Janeiro’s Alemão district, his focus switched to the details of these messages. Narrating the events over the course of several days in December 2010, these tweets also offered commentary on what were interpreted as instances of disinformation, as official reports contradicted eyewitness testimonies. According to Gejfinbein, Twitter can therefore have an invaluable role in elucidating and adding nuance to the official narratives of breaking and ongoing events of national importance. For him, in Brazil it certainly offered an example of an audience that is more participatory than passive, but perhaps more importantly, if viewed as a form of citizen journalism, it offers potential for users to actually influence the production of news. It is also worth noting that Gejfinbein’s initial interest in the use of Twitter to promote soap operas indicates the compelling characteristics of the Twitter platform for both reader and user. Indeed, figures provided by Gejfinbein and others based on statistics supplied by both the Nielsen Group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354856511433685">nielsenwire, 2010</xref>) and Twitter itself seem to confirm the success of the platform as a method of virtual discourse. In September 2010 a reported 95 million tweets were being transmitted daily, compared to a usage rate of 400,000 tweets per quarter in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354856511433685">Beaumont, 2010</xref>. Also cited by Leandro Gejfinbein in his conference paper).</p>
<p>However, the framing of Twitter as an important example of citizen journalism is as yet unfounded. According to the panellists in the ‘Unstable Platforms’ session, less than 1 per cent of tweets are filtered into the official national or international media channels. The Twitter network therefore retains far less sociological importance, despite being promoted as a platform for wider social change. The vast majority of tweets, in other words, remain localised, distributed only among small groups, rarely breaking into wider political or social discourses. Furthermore panellist Kathleen Fitzpatrick took issue with a communications platform whose design limits the amount of characters a user can input for each tweet. Joshua Benton on the other hand saw the real-time effectiveness of Twitter as an exciting example of the emergence of a new form of narrative with multiple points of entry, multiple voices and multiple points of view. He suggested that despite the limited character length of individual tweets, it is possible to learn a lot about individuals by following their Twitter feeds over a period of time. In the context of an increasing fragmentation of narrative in the wider digital realm, Twitter’s place in this progressive unravelling would appear to suggest that narratives are becoming far less complex and individual.</p>
<p>Adopting a more socio-historical overview of media in transition, Peter Walsh traced the relationships between media change and often violent social transformation, from the American Civil War to current states of unrest in the Middle East (and presumably North Africa). Walsh was, in part, responding to a paper he had presented at MIT in 1999, developing ideas about how the creation of any new media – from the alphabet, through the printing press, the telegraph and television to the internet and Twitter – is able to dismantle established political and societal paradigms (what Walsh calls ‘consensus narratives’). New media operate at a reduced cost, significantly broaden the geographical scope of analogue media and consequently reach wider, previously neglected, users. Given a platform to tell their own stories, these users reveal the conflicts between their own experiences and those narrated by the agents of the status quo. According to Walsh, there ensues a revolution in which the media plays an integral part. Media in these contexts allow ‘untellable stories’ to be revealed, so that the hitherto accepted consensus narrative is unalterably transformed. He therefore finds parallels between the establishment of a voice for disenfranchised people in the years following the American Civil War, the development of the penny press and the implementation of Twitter and Facebook as tools for commenting on, and even eliciting, the states of unrest currently witnessed across the world. These examples reveal the role of technology in narratives of often violent change which is not unique to any one period in human history. Walsh’s metatextual reading of social unrest and media instability became an analysis of the factors that contribute to the toppling of ‘consensus narratives’ – an interesting contrast to other papers at the conference that mostly commented on the microcosmic stories around current social and political fragmentation.</p>

<sec id="section2-1354856511433685">
<title>Analogue nostalgia</title>
<p>Certainly, some speakers were keen to suggest the prolongation of the life of analogue media, even as it is reframed in our digital era. Sarah Sweeney demonstrated how the digital manipulation of the ‘snapshot’ photograph can help to reinforce universal concepts of family and togetherness, despite the anonymity of the actual subjects of the photographs themselves. A digital media artist, Sweeney erases and duplicates sections of slides (purchased from eBay) depicting other people’s holidays and special occasions in order to prove her thesis that, in looking at a photograph, observers perceive such images as universal truths (Sweeney uses the term fabulation). We are connected by the tropes of the holiday tableau, such as the frontal pose of a smiling subject in front of a monument. What is created in the viewer’s mind is simultaneously imagined and remembered as part of their broader experiences.</p>
<p>Kim Knowles admitted to being emotionally touched by ‘old film celluloid’ and asked why this and digital modes of recording cannot coexist. Digital forms, after all, are not better than analogue ones, and indeed digital images are sometimes seen to emulate the aesthetic of celluloid. Through her knowledge of experimental film as programmer for the Edinburgh International Film Festival, she suggested that the challenge for the creative industries is working towards comprehending how to promote the diverse and homogenous facets of each form in a manner that enables them to coexist.</p>
<p>Daniel Faltesek discussed how he mourns the loss of the film strip as a method of recording images. As with Sweeney’s pre-digital photographs and Knowles’ observations about trends in experimental filmmaking, Faltesek’s concern for the projected obsolescence of analogue production methods has a haptic dimension. The tactility that exists as part of the physical cutting and splicing of film strips has been overtaken by the clean, ‘hands-off’ approach afforded by Final Cut Pro. Following on from this point, Knowles asked, somewhat tantalisingly, if the onset of digital modes of production will in fact give rise to a whole new celluloid aesthetic. This suggests at the very least that old media has a vibrant role in a utopian future. After all, as highlighted by the overarching theme of the MIT conference since its inception, technology is always in transition. There is, in other words, no stability or final version of media platforms.</p>
<p>Following this, other papers proposed a continuum, suggesting that new media is merely patterning itself on systems already existent in human society. This was an observation made by Robert Furze and Till Heilman, who discussed the term digital in contexts that pre-date and go beyond common definitions as related to new media. Furze extended the meaning of the word digital, noting its pre-existence as a term used to define our everyday use of written and spoken language. Heilman, meanwhile, perceived the role of the digital as a ‘fundamental cultural technique’ that describes the relationship between the ‘digits’ of the human hand and the push button, a basic means by which humans navigate their private and public worlds.</p>
<p>These papers as presented at MIT7 suggest – at least implicitly – the apparent cultural imprecision of media studies. They sought to engage in debates over how the instability of technological platforms defined culture even before our contemporary digital age, with the most assured commentators conceiving of digital media as authenticating certain long-established theories about the fragility of the human relationship with the perceptible, built environment. Xinghua Li, for instance, suggested that Microsoft’s Kinect, a gaming peripheral for the Xbox 360 that maps player movement without the aid of a traditional game controller, realises a long-held desire for users to be able to overcome the lack of proximity by enabling the virtual caressing another human form. As Li pointed out, this has implications for the development of pornographic games, such as the Kinect game <italic>ThriXXX</italic>. This idea of ‘action at a distance’ allows a reinvigorated discussion of certain 19th-century metaphysical debates over how necessary, or superfluous, physicality is to the concept of touch. Li concluded that the onscreen presence of a virtual hand that mirrors the user’s own movements actually destabilises the sense of immersion. While the desire to create haptic forms of pleasure and engagement in virtual environments is very strong (as mentioned earlier), there remain persistent barriers to the merging of human subject and digital object.</p>

<sec id="section3-1354856511433685">
<title>The interactive audience</title>
<p>The empowerment of individual users, given the opportunity to potentially make a mark on a global scale through social platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and the blogosphere, is of course tempered by the amount of ‘hits’ user-generated content receives. The example of Twitter has already been discussed here, but as Aymer Jean Christian added, the chances of independently produced videos uploaded on YouTube being selected for expansion by major corporations is small. Success stories such as Al Thompson’s ten-part web series <italic>Odessa</italic>, distributed through BET.com (Black Entertainment Television) is thus an exception; yet it also points the way to how conglomerates can experiment with new ideas and formats, potentially reaching out to niche audiences hitherto unrepresented. This post-industrial model does however engender concerns over a global environment in which the viewer may become producer, and narratives become further atomised. The perception that Comparative Media Studies may become an even more undisciplined field of academic endeavour is informed by its focus of study: an industry that has an indeterminate and ever-changing shape.</p>
<p>The pliability of media forms and their reception is also present in the realm of video games. The rising interest in video game studies has been complicated beyond earlier ludology versus narratology debates (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354856511433685">Frasca, 2003</xref>) to a classification of the video game audience itself. For Mia Consalvo, however, the Facebook platform has effectively blurred the distinction between types of player. Their implementation of browser-based games created by market leader Zynga – such as <italic>Farmville</italic>, <italic>Mafia Wars</italic> and <italic>Special Forces</italic> – has advanced the concept of the ‘casual’ game, exemplified by a lack of complexity in its rules and gameplay. Such games offer little or no demands on their users’ skills and can be played in very short sessions. After hearing the opinions of industry insiders at the Game Developers Conference in February–March 2011, Consalvo noted that the casual game has rapidly become a source of derision, seen merely as a business strategy cooked up by Facebook, Zynga and others to encourage players to part with their money in the form of ‘micropayments’ that are necessary to allow significant progression. This gameplay model is deemed to be the polar opposite of the ‘hardcore’ experience, which is characterised by progression earned through the development of skills and commitment to immersing oneself in the interactive world. Nonetheless, both kinds of gaming are being made, so that elucidating a hierarchy of gamers/users based on the casual-hardcore paradigm is becoming impossible. This is particularly evident as games developers themselves choose to jump ship from ‘real’ (that is hardcore) gaming to the fast food ethos of the Facebook platform. The casual game may well inhabit Dante’s Nine Circles of Hell (Consalvo’s analogy), but it is increasingly clear that the meaning of the term ‘casual’ is not inflexible or fixed when appertaining to the gamer identity.</p>
<p>Randy Nichols, in the discussion following his paper, suggested there be a re-evaluation of the terms casual and hardcore. He stated that the relatively narrow focus on the gaming habits of individuals needs to be considered alongside questions of how the wider political economy impacts upon identification of gamer types. Currently, the terms casual and hardcore do not function as objective definitions, they are instead very much <italic>self</italic>-definitions. By contrast, a broader focus on the dynamic between users, designers and researchers will allow a more thorough evaluation of the nuanced relationship between the terms casual and hardcore. From this idea Nichols offered the tantalising suggestion that in this way all gamers could be considered ‘casual’. Such a call for reappraisal of how gamers are classified can be seen to address ideas of the active audience and the potential perpetuity of stories mentioned elsewhere in the conference. On the one hand, as video game analysis calls for more complexity in its research, it offers further challenge to the idea that Comparative Media Studies is able to support singularly unproblematic and consistent narratives. Nonetheless, in moving beyond perceptions of the gamer as self-defining, atomised and discrete, it also advocates modes of study that prioritise top-down interpretations of the political economic forces that influence gamer habits. Complexity is therefore reserved for the empirical observations of research, not for the prejudices of individual gamers. Whether such an approach will galvanise definitions of gamers as part of a stronger narrative framework within Comparative Media Studies or fragment those roles further remains to be seen.</p>

<sec id="section4-1354856511433685">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>On the last day of MIT7 some speakers suggested that the conference offered a pessimistic overview of the current state of the media, and of media studies in general. There was, in other words, more peril than promise on the media horizon. Terms such as ‘fragmentation’, ‘instability’ and ‘disruption’ were used continually as synonyms for that key word, ‘transition’. As a result, recurring themes included the bewildering renewal of platforms, the unending stream of data, the fracturing of individual roles in the social network and the irresolution of narratives whose ongoing and fragmented nature make them undecipherable.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, as Thorburn and Uricchio observed in their comments on the variety of papers at MIT7, foregrounding the multiplicity and instability of digital media platforms may not be an entirely negative approach. There is some credibility in suggesting our new digital narratives are themselves neither stable nor universally coherent, but in continual flux, shaped by both the technology and the user’s interpretation of the world that technology mediates. The perception of media studies as undisciplined may therefore be regarded as the only honest response to the complexities of the modern world of politics, economics and society (in short, culture). Certainly many contributors seemed to welcome the idea of a more active engagement with the idea of an inherent instability as a necessary component of media studies in the digital age. At the very least, according to Janet Sternberg, the fact that the conference openly engaged with the idea of peril as being a facet of media transition was itself a positive move forward. Her paper on user ‘displacement’ and ‘distraction’ stated that it is no longer helpful to separate members of society into categories of those who embrace new media platforms and those accused of being Luddites. She concluded: ‘Trying to understand negative as well as positive effects, what technologies undo as well as what they do, we stand a better chance of stabilising our technological environments, decreasing the perils and increasing the promise of digital media’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1354856511433685">Sternberg, 2011</xref>).</p>
