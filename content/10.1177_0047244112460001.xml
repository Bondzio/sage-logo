<abstract>
<p>Claudio Magris is a writer of the frontier and of liminal places. This article explores the various dimensions that the border acquires in his work at a cultural, linguistic, philosophical and existential level. It focuses in particular on the image of the border as a barrier and a bridge, and on the poetics of ‘the other side’. Through an analysis of Magris’s major works of fiction and literary criticism, it individuates the relevance of geographical time, placed in dialogue and often in contrast to historical time, and investigates Magris’s geo-cultural, geo-literary, geo-historical and geo-linguistic approaches to his idea of culture. The last section of the article is devoted to the novel <italic>Un altro mare</italic> (1991; <italic>A Different Sea</italic>, 1993) and to the discussion of how the cultural heritage of the Hapsburg Empire reaches deeply, as a liminal cultural space, into the contemporary world.</p>

<p>Literary categories can be useful critical tools when suitably applied, although sometimes they may constrain authors within narrow boundaries. Writers, in fact, normally do not like to be classified, precisely because they would like to preserve a range that excludes any type of classification, in the name of artistic freedom and ambition. The prevalence of a subject or a sub-genre in someone’s production does not automatically exclude the intention and the ability to address a broader thematic target. Within the Italian literary tradition, for example, one could successfully argue that many of Leonardo Sciascia’s works belong to the detective story genre; but we all know that Sciascia’s fictional investigations – no differently from his non-fictional ones – dissect and uncover much more than the perpetrators of specific mafia-related crimes. From <italic>Il giorno della civetta</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0047244112460001">Sciascia, 1961</xref>; <italic>The Day of the Owl</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0047244112460001">2001</xref>) to <italic>Una storia semplice</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0047244112460001">Sciascia, 1989</xref>; <italic>A Simple Story</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0047244112460001">2010</xref>), they scrutinize and expose the unethical structures of the post-World War II Italian political system, which nurtured the lack of social reforms and the subsequent endemic corruption that had followed the unification of Italy. Sciascia’s novels, as much as his fact-finding essays, examine in depth the complex historical and anthropological reasons behind this political phenomenon, which affected, and in part still affects, Italian society. The mono-thematic insistence of his works, therefore, does not prevent him from depicting, in each of his books, a broad fresco of Italian society and its pervasive defects. And yet we cannot deny that these works, in good measure, have been conceived as part of a specific literary genre, according to precise strategies for plot and character development, and that, therefore, they reach their conclusions through a specific stylistic plan.</p>
<p>Naturally, the ability to overcome the limits of a literary genre occurs in many other authors, and it reminds us that we need to be mindful when applying literary categories. Nevertheless, in some instances, the label seems to match perfectly not only the works’ subject matter, but the whole aesthetic universe of the author in question. This seems to be the case of Claudio Magris, whose production can be identified as <italic>border</italic> literature without any fear of narrowing or diminishing its broad intent. This may seem an easy assumption, based on obvious biographical data (Magris was born and lives in Trieste) or on the topics of many of his books, centred on personal journeys or on literary émigrés. It would be enough to mention the titles of a couple of his collection of essays – <italic>Itaca e oltre</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0047244112460001">1982</xref>; <italic>Ithaca and Beyond</italic>) or <italic>L’infinito viaggiare</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047244112460001">2005</xref>; <italic>‘Infinite Travelling’</italic>) – or of some of the many scholarly works on Magris to put the topic to rest.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0047244112460001">1</xref></sup> But what is culturally obvious is not necessarily banal: with the expected association between Magris and border literature, I intend to stress his profound and continuous meditation, in <italic>any</italic> of his works, on the idea and essence of the frontier, of the border, as a vital spark of the act of writing itself. Writing for Magris is a constant reorganization of images and perceptions that rarely correspond to what he calls his ‘Italian syntax’:
<disp-quote>
<p>I often look at a world that is not very Italian at all, but I look at it, I perceive it and structure it according to a syntax (which reflects a vision of the world and its rhythm) that is Italian. This language is my homeland; it is as if, to use a metaphor, I were to adopt several words taken from other languages, a lexicon that is not always Italian, but incorporate and organize it within an Italian syntax. This implies an incessant crossing of borders at a conscious and an unconscious level; it implies above all the feeling of living on both sides of the border at once, of being always somehow also on the other side. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0047244112460001">Ciccarelli, 2004</xref>: 407)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0047244112460001">2</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The syntax reconciles his explorations with his own vision and rhythm of the world. Italian is a homeland (a <italic>Heimat</italic>, to use the German term dear to the Mitteleuropean authors that appear in his books) to which he needs to return to transfigure his intellectual gaze into writing: crossing borders and writing become one action. The intersection may be conscious or not, but it happens and sets the ambivalent tone (that feeling simultaneously on both sides) that unsettles the otherwise encoded order of one’s own syntax, which needs to accept, absorb, understand or reject the diverse sensations caused by being always also ‘on the other side’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0047244112460001">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Crossing a border means crossing a space, and space implies time: once on the other side, the former may be perceived very differently and the latter may have a different pace. In a writer, Magris insists, the verbal tenses tell the story: the past comes alive if its presence is still felt (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0047244112460001">Ciccarelli, 2004</xref>: 408). There are no doubts that Magris believes that, in several instances, many areas that belonged to the Austro-Hungarian Empire preserved their original cultural charge well beyond the political turnarounds.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0047244112460001">4</xref></sup> Magris is well aware that there is a historical time, but there is also a geographical time, perhaps a geological one<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0047244112460001">5</xref></sup> that – despite the continuous adjustments of history – changes almost imperceptibly. The geographical time affects the historical and cultural one much more than we may normally think: it forms and permeates languages, traditions, customs, ways of looking at life, history and space. Magris seizes the opportunity to cross the border, consciously sliding between the cracks left opened by the combination between these two different conceptions of time, in order to bring back to life what has survived the historical/external changes. This is the only way to avoid the perennial conflict – barrier or bridge –caused by facing a border.</p>
<p>The idea of the border as a crossing or a dividing point is inherent in all Magris’s writings, but perhaps the double image of the border as a barrier or a bridge is expressed at its highest potential in his poignant essay, ‘Dall’altra parte: considerazioni di frontiera’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047244112460001">1999a</xref> : 51-65): ‘On/From the other side: considerations about borders’).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0047244112460001">6</xref></sup> This article was written while the war was already ravaging former Yugoslavia, and was transforming into battlegrounds (once again in the twentieth century) places very familiar to Magris.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0047244112460001">7</xref></sup> The article assumes, therefore, a strong autobiographical connotation, which is fundamental to identifying Magris’s own aesthetic thought, revealed in full in this essay. In a sense, it is a sad occasion for Magris to revisit and reorder his own literary investigations, while acknowledging that the effects produced by the collapse of the Hapsburg Empire reach well into the end of the century. The brutal ethnic war between some of the former areas of the empire (together with the 1992 shocking division of Czechoslovakia, ratified at the very beginning of 1993)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0047244112460001">8</xref></sup> was additional proof that the geographic and cultural memory of the Habsburg Empire could not guarantee a (sense of) political unity to such a vast and fragmented territory. Nonetheless, before its collapse it had offered a sensibly conceived harmonic cultural image which allowed both a parallel and an intersecting artistic existence between regional and national experiences: ‘The Hapsburg art of government does not stifle dissidence or overcome contradictions, but covers and composes them in an ever-provisional equilibrium, allowing them substantially to go on as they are and, if anything, playing them off against one another’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047244112460001">Magris, 2001 [1986]</xref>: 243). On the one hand, there was a push for universalism, on the other for localism; and once the tension between a central orderly government and its peripheral interests disappeared, the system started erupting and collapsing. Many of the effects of this political and cultural ambivalence survived the traumatic shifts from 1918 to 1989, and were to some degree behind both the pre- and post-World War II ethnic conflicts in many parts of the former empire, including those in the former Yugoslavia, whose breakdown was generated, besides economic international pressures, by the inability to maintain, on a logical political level, the confederation as a viable democratic solution. In the absence of the mix of universalism and localism described above, a true democratic solution meant the definitive crumbling of what had existed, culturally and anthropologically, in much of Central Europe in spite of its politically contradictory and weak configuration.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0047244112460001">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Trieste offers open views towards the Adriatic and the Alps, as well as narrow or restricted sights that end up in an alley, against a wall, or in a steep tortuous street which prevents any other view.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0047244112460001">10</xref></sup> Border writers have an innate ability to concentrate on small and broad details at the same time, they live in a cultural environment that constantly negotiates the tendencies to embrace (as a bridge) as well as to reject (as a barrier), and they know that a panorama is made of many infinitesimal aspects that have their own vital and autonomous space and time. These are what Magris calls elsewhere ‘microcosms’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0047244112460001">11</xref></sup> that is, parcels of autonomous geo-cultural identities that have their own comprehensive cultural life, and yet also belong to a broader cultural entity, be it a region, a nation or an empire (such as the Austro-Hungarian one). These microcosms are simultaneously metaphysical and physical places where diversity of cultures, languages, visions and faiths take form, in spite of their belonging to a broader territorial unity. The endless crossing of internal borders becomes a tool to an in-depth understanding of any cultural activity within this context. Magris’s intellectual universe comes to exist precisely because of his investigation of <italic>the other side</italic>. A border writer knows that the cultural perspective may change entirely by simply crossing a river and sitting on a bench on the other side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047244112460001">Magris, 1999a</xref>: 51). And yet, a no-entry demarcation is also the beginning of a new territory; an arrival dock is also a departing point; a gate lets in or out. This is why, in <italic>‘Dall’altra parte</italic>’, Magris maintains that even if there is always another view, we should not fall into what he defines as the obsession of situating someone that we see as different from ourselves on the other side. A writer, who intends to witness and investigate the events that take place around a border and its dual or multicultural aspects, needs, no differently from a conscientious geographer, to conceive of literature as a voyage, a journey into the otherness in front of us, a journey whose ultimate goal is to eliminate the myth of the other side and explain that when we face a border we are all on both sides. Within this context, Magris views literature as a tool to understand diversity and respect multiculturalism; but he never sees it as an instrument to dissolve the actual differences among cultures into what he defines as an artificial melting pot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047244112460001">Magris, 1999a</xref>: 57–8).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0047244112460001">12</xref></sup> To the contrary, with the metaphors of the bridge and the barrier Magris invites us to appreciate diversity as part of a multifaceted interpretation of life. Borders, hence, exist and cannot be avoided precisely to value the diversity found on the other side; rather than a barrier they must be interpreted as an open invitation to cross over, at ease, into the other world, even if we know that we belong to the original departing point, to which we intend to go back. The multicultural solution cannot be unravelled by an adversative <italic>either/or</italic>, but rather by the conjunction <italic>and</italic>;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0047244112460001">13</xref></sup> it needs to be based more on additions than on subtractions. The awareness of belonging to (or feeling at home on) one side is, in fact, the first step in the direction of making the border a bridge and not a barrier. It is an essential component of a balanced view of culture and history. In other words, without denying the physicality of a border, Magris underscores also its metaphorical value, which we cross every time we face a situation that differs (or seems to differ) from our own intellectual background and experience.</p>
<p>The notion of the border as a bridge or a barrier is therefore at the core of Magris’s entire intellectual meditation and informs all his works. This is especially true of his books devoted to (or inspired by) the cultural developments of the former Austrian Empire, although it applies to the majority of his works. Almost all his fictional and critical works, in fact, are an analysis of the consequences of the collapse of the empire, even when they may seem remote from that event. Magris’s poetics and thought cannot be properly examined outside of this axiom, and he makes no secret that the escalation that brought about first World War II, and later the Cold War, depends in good measure on the effects caused by the collapse of the empire and the inevitable political claims of the newly formed nations.</p>
<p>It would be impossible to understand in depth any of Magris’s works without taking into account his geo-cultural, geo-literary, geo-historical and even geo-linguistic approaches to his fundamental idea of culture as being shaped mostly through the bridge/barrier metaphor. His idea of the border as a twofold and fluid entity allows him to explore the world at large that surrounded and made – and still makes – Trieste an exceptional observatory of a very special broad and composite area, which after World War I was transformed into a conglomerate of nation-states, only to be fragmented again by the many geographical landslides caused by the collapse of the Soviet universe. Magris’s microcosms – independent worlds that could be delimited by a geographical sign such as a river bend, a hill, a cornfield, a square, a market, a bridge – survive the political shifts and disruption of time.</p>
<p>The idea of literature as a perennial journey that needs to come to terms with its internal and external borders does not pertain only to the world of fiction or non-fiction – the latter to be understood according to Truman Capote’s definition (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047244112460001">Magris, 2005</xref>: xvi) – but it is engrained in Magris’s scholarly formation and interpretation of Austro-Hungarian literature and culture, as is already evident in his early works. The beginning of Magris’s fictional production is normally identified with the 1984 publication of <italic>Illazioni su una sciabola</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0047244112460001">1984</xref>; <italic>Inferences from a Sabre</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0047244112460001">1989</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0047244112460001">14</xref></sup> I must state right away that the distinction between fiction and non-fiction may not be as important in Magris’s case – in fact, it may not serve him well at all. This is unquestionably also due to his rare stylistic talent, which makes the subjects of his books accessible to non-specialists without losing any scholarly depth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0047244112460001">15</xref></sup> His style naturally complements his ability to frame historical and cultural facts in a broader context, following his belief that writing requires crossing (a) border(s) and inhaling the air breathed on the other side. This method may seem counter-intuitive, as broadening the canvas requires adding further information, and thus it may become even less congenial to a non-specialist reader. However, at the same time it also allows cultural digressions, which, in the case of Magris’s works, are always pertinent to the historical or critical topics analysed. These excursions permit him to focus on people, facts or cultural matters that – although collateral to the main discourse – actually help its comprehension, bringing additional life to the subject. In other words, his scholarly works, without losing any critical accuracy, offer intuitive narrative insights, and reconstruct in detail the ambience that surrounded the authors and fostered their works. Artistic and geographical sites, monuments, historical figures, common or legendary people come to life to explain the intellectual context.</p>
<p>The dialectic dilemma between inner and external borders, both as a metaphor engrained in the act of writing and as actual geographical entities, is already palpable in his 1963 book on the Hapsburg myth in modern Austrian literature (<italic>Il mito absburgico nella letteratura austriaca moderna</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0047244112460001">16</xref></sup> In this book, it is already evident that Magris’s concept of ‘Austrian’ literature goes well beyond the idea of the actual limits of the country, and stresses the multicultural backgrounds of writers who can be properly understood only if analysed, concurrently, both in their own specific cultural settings and in the broader environment represented by their sense of belonging to the Austrian Empire or its cultural legacy. Magris, in line with the title of his book, expresses his belief that this legacy is, in good part, a myth: both in the sense of an exaggerated image (the illusory inclusiveness of the last decades of the empire) and as something that, precisely because of its acquired mythical status, produces a melancholic longing. The authenticity of the Hapsburg intentions were questioned by the same authors who, in different measures, participated to the creation of the myth;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0047244112460001">17</xref></sup> it is a fact, however, that the dissolution of the empire after World War I contributed to a historical realization, or simply an idealized creation, of a special context made possible by the geographical and cultural uniqueness of the empire. This uniqueness materializes through the contrast between a strong centralized government that celebrated order and unity, and its tolerance, to some extent, for local and regional cultures as well as literary works that favoured a much more individualistic, nihilistic and definitively less harmonious view of imperial life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0047244112460001">18</xref></sup> This controlled freedom of cultural and linguistic action helped to preserve old unofficial internal borders within the empire, which corresponded approximately to the various cultural traditions and ethnic groups that populated the Hapsburg territory from Trieste to Greece, from Budapest and Prague to Transylvania. Whether this cultural dialectic took place mostly for uncontrollable historical reasons prompted by the deepening crisis of the political empire, or whether it was actually promoted by a universalism inherent to Franz Josef’s reign is, in a sense, irrelevant from a cultural point of view.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0047244112460001">19</xref></sup> What is important, Magris argues, is that once the empire disappeared, the effects of the myth of the locally tolerant, but supernationally watchful Hapsburgs permeated a large portion of Europe – possibly also encouraged by a hidden parallel with the ‘totalitarian barbarism’ that spread between the world wars (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047244112460001">Magris, 2001 [1986]</xref>: 29).</p>
<p>Despite the divergence between historians and literati about the veracity of this nostalgic interpretation, which is still partially alive today – ‘Writers almost always tend to see only the “hinternational” Danube, while historians also take account of the German-ness of Danubian Austria’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047244112460001">Magris, 2001 [1986]</xref>: 31)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0047244112460001">20</xref></sup> – after World War I the idea of always inhabiting a liminal position, of facing a perennial border, with its intuitive and unconscious representation of the <italic>other</italic>, became an instinctual fact of life for many intellectuals. This existential mechanism was, in fact, amplified by the estrangement caused by feeling like a foreigner in one’s own new country, as the artistic production became ambiguously <italic>national</italic> and <italic>international</italic> at the same time. Whereas national once would have stood for Austrian, after the war that connotation stood for any of the linguistic groups once united under the empire (Italian, Hungarian, Czech, Serbian, Croatian, Polish, etc.).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0047244112460001">21</xref></sup> Writing in German outside the natural German-speaking areas became almost the equivalent of writing from abroad in an international language, as German was no longer the official language of those regions. In these conditions, a writer who came of age in the old Austro-Hungarian domains and was now working outside an officially German-speaking zone was always facing a border, whether it was represented by the German of Vienna or by the various ethno-linguistic groups that from 1918 onwards had acquired the status of political nations.</p>
<p>These critical considerations are further developed in <italic>Lontano da dove: Joseph Roth e la tradizione ebraico-orientale</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0047244112460001">Magris, 1971</xref>; <italic>Far from Where: Joseph Roth and the Eastern Jewish Tradition</italic>), a book devoted to the eastern European Jewish writer, as well as to the idea of exile as a permanent condition in everybody who has suffered from being part of a diaspora.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0047244112460001">22</xref></sup> The latter is a historical status that in some instances is evident, as in the case of the Jewish diaspora, but that in some other instances, may be perceived only through anachronistic comparisons, as in the case of the Austro-Hungarian intellectuals, Roth included, who felt the absence of a homeland (<italic>Heimat</italic>) only after the collapse of an empire that, in retrospect, embraced cultural diversity more than most of the nation-states born from its ashes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0047244112460001">23</xref></sup> The title <italic>Lontano da dove</italic> (<italic>Far from where</italic>) conveys Magris’s idea that the border is like our baggage that we carry with us throughout the journey of life, not unlike a turtle that carries its house wherever it goes. The title derives from an eastern European anecdote: two Jews run into each other and, when one learns that the other is departing for South America, he comments on the distance of the journey (‘You will be so far away!’), provoking the astonished reaction of the other: ‘Far from <italic>where</italic>?’ The ironic and resigned question implies the perennial status of a Jewish émigré who can be at home only within her/himself and her/his inner cultural traditions and laws, no matter where s/he goes. But while the Jewish intellectual of the anecdote has a previous and firm knowledge of his status, the Austro-Hungarian intellectuals – who might not even have liked the empire as a political entity – have no conception of their new status caused by the sudden absence of those specific reference points that had allowed a spatial and cultural world to exist. That world has abruptly ended, only to be ruled by new borders and new (more or less forced) national identities. This title contains the essence of Magris’s idea of literature as an internal border, which erases the external ones that we continually face. Ultimately, literature is the only journey that may provide a chance to travel <italic>away from</italic> or <italic>to</italic> a(n) (un)wanted situation, in spite of the (self-)constrained status of an author.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0047244112460001">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Magris’s most famous book, <italic>Danubio</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0047244112460001">1986</xref>; <italic>Danube</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047244112460001">2001</xref>) published in 1986, reveals his foresight about the difference between superimposed geo-political limits and their spontaneous local formation. Magris’s erudite and fascinating journey departs from the disputed sources of the Danube – a disputation that has been driven at times more by local interests than by scientific accuracy, and that reflects the debate about the spiritual value of the river as a symbol (or not) of the Hapsburg’s universalism<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0047244112460001">25</xref></sup> – and ends at its equally controversial estuary on the Black Sea. Magris emphasizes how the river itself, with its ever-changing course and scenarios, dispenses and disperses the cultural heritage of a territory that had been mostly part of the Hapsburg Empire. The predominance of a geographical time over a historical time is evident from the book’s title. Following the river, the writer enters the domain of a geo-anthropological space which does not change or erase the events of history, but places them in a different perspective, less tied to a national/political timeframe and more in tune with the cultural substratum that emerges in the various explorations of the river bends and valleys. All the major or local historical events, including the many legends that became history throughout the centuries, happened and resonated because of the river, which facilitated the many cultural exchanges between the people who call the Danube <italic>their</italic> river. The long and slow course of the Danube, therefore, bridged together different languages, people and traditions, making local events relevant to a broader geographical area; and yet, in accordance with the logical paradox inherent to any border, it also worked as a barrier – as a watershed that preserved the very own diversity that characterized and formed each one of these distinct ethnic, linguistic and cultural identities. When Magris finished his journey, just a few years before 1989, the composite mouth of the Danube ended in Romania (Sulina, the channelled and most recognized estuary; and Sfantul Gheorghe) and in the Soviet Union (Kiliya, much smaller in area than its two Romanian counterparts, but as visible and present in the life of the territory). Despite the nationalistic efforts that in the past claimed the spiritual importance of one estuary over another, today, after the territorial adjustments generated by the dissolution of the Soviet world, the Kiliya’s (or Chilia’s) estuary is in the Ukraine. In other words, political geography now matches, once again, physical geography. This change is the result of one of those not too rare instances in which history operates an ironic reversal that goes well beyond an adjustment of limits and borders. The disappearance of the Soviet Union has, in fact, favoured the restoration of some of the ethnic cultures which once played a fundamental role in shaping the Austrian Empire.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0047244112460001">26</xref></sup> In fact, it went even further: it created (or recreated with different limits) actual nations out of those cultures (Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia, Slovakia, the Ukraine, etc.) that once amalgamated the lands crossed by the river, as sustained by Emil Cioran, among many others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047244112460001">Magris, 2001 [1986]</xref>: 284).</p>
<p>The ambiguity brought forth by the disputed origins as well as by the different estuaries of the river projects itself onto the entire book. <italic>Danubio</italic> is a multifaceted work that deals with (and confirms) the strong and lasting existence of culturally and linguistically mixed dimensions, which resist and thrive within larger national limits: countries within a country; regions within regions; microcosms within the cosmos represented by the collision and fusion of so many different historical, cultural, religious and ideological ways of life merged by the slow course of the river. It is a book of history, a meditation on the philosophy of history, an intellectual reflection upon political events which deal with the two world conflicts as well as the Holocaust and the rise of communism in Eastern Europe. It is also a book of literary criticism and a book of fiction that can easily be defined as a novel.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0047244112460001">27</xref></sup> Magris’s interest in the culture of the Austrian Empire is motivated by precise historical reasons, but he also has a strong and vital interest in the rich heritage of the empire that reverberates and reaches well into the twenty-first century.</p>
<p>The date of publication of <italic>Danubio</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0047244112460001">1986</xref>) renders some of Magris’s writing even more prophetic. As one example, I would like to point to his Danubian passage through <italic>Pannonia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047244112460001">2001 [1986]</xref>: 281–339), the vast plain identified with Hungary that Magris, to respect the composite geographical space of his journey, calls by its Roman name. Throughout the centuries it was administered, ruled and conquered by many different people (from the Huns to the Ostrogoths; from the Franks to the Magyars; from the Byzantines to the Ottomans and the Hapsburgs) and currently sits between Austria, Hungary, Slovakia, Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia and Bosnia. In other words, it represents the pulsating heart of the Hapsburg Empire. In some of the pages dedicated to the Hungarian leg of his voyage, Magris describes the clever intelligence of his guide – whom he calls by the name of Kocsis<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0047244112460001">28</xref></sup> – a ‘colleague’ (that is, an academic) but also an old member of the Party, who is assigned to escort him during his visit: ‘Kocsis is a small power in the Party, and is therefore a valuable companion … Within the Party Kocsis is a small power dethroned. He can no longer give orders but he enjoys respect and favours’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047244112460001">Magris, 2001 [1986]</xref>: 247). These pages and those that take him from Vienna to Budapest, dissect in a surgical way the political events that brought Hungary from the Stalinist turn taken after the failed 1956 rebellion to the almost prosperous/liberal communism of the early 1980s, nearly anticipating its readiness and eagerness to take advantage of the upcoming 1989 watershed (which, naturally, Magris could not politically foresee, but could culturally see and feel). Magris’s considerations on János Kádár (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047244112460001">2001 [1986]</xref>: 295–8) – the historical leader who betrayed Nagy and the revolution in 1956 but who, in retrospect, had probably done as much as possible to pilot Hungary towards a quasi-tolerant and internationally open country years ahead of the fall of the Wall – are nowadays within the norm.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0047244112460001">29</xref></sup> But Magris wrote those lines in 1985, in a book devoted to a cultural exploration of Central Europe’s intellectual heritage, not in a political science essay.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0047244112460001">30</xref></sup> His perception of actual changes and historical events is only in part the result of self-evident political circumstances; it is, above all, the outcome of his painstakingly careful cultural observations:
<disp-quote>
<p>A moment spent in a Budapest pastry-shop or bookshop will give the lie to anyone who thinks that an indistinct sort of Asiatic womb begins just east of Austria … In the last century, the novelist Zsigmond Kemény asserted that the function of Hungary was to defend the multi-national nature of the Hapsburg Empire, splitting Germanism and Slavism and preventing either of them from becoming supreme. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047244112460001">Magris, 2001 [1986]</xref>: 242)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Once again, in the struggle between border and bridge, it is the <italic>and</italic> – the conjunction – that needs to prevail over the <italic>either/or</italic> adversative solution, as suggested by Kemény’s assertion (‘Germanism <italic>and</italic> Slavism’). The Hungary that Magris visits in the mid-1980s has retained (or regained) its old Danubian spirit much more than may seem to be the case. Hence his insistence on ‘Pannonia’, the geographical term that allows the writer and traveller to swerve around the pickets of historical time, which is subject to sudden short-term changes. While crossing the Magyar plain, Magris, consistent with his assumption that a writer is always on the other side, observes with clear eyes, without prejudices, and is thus able to read ahead of events. After all, for him literature is no different from archaeology or geology: it needs to reveal the stratification of history or nature, and must be able to read the future in the past: ‘each scrap of reality requires the archaeologist, or the geologist, to decipher it; and it may be that literature is nothing but this archaeology applied to life itself’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047244112460001">2001 [1986]</xref>: 253). A writer needs to guess the order of things, human and natural alike, to reconstruct the past in order to build the present and the future.</p>
<p>The Pannonian pages seem at times to convey a strong anti-Hapsburg view, and yet once again they remind us of the intrinsic survival of the lesson of the old empire, both culturally and politically. Magris does not have a pro-Hapsburg agenda. His goal in <italic>Danubio</italic> is not to find universal traces of the Hapsburgs everywhere he goes: on the contrary, it is the geo-human landscape he investigates that relates that to him. He writes quite openly about how this universalism probably never reached several parts of the empire, untamed by any sense of historical tolerance or justice. At the same time, he also digs below the surface, as a good archaeologist should do, and uncovers hidden artefacts that reveal a different story or different aspects of an accepted version of events. At first, it appears obvious that his Hungarian guide, the savvy political survivor Kocsis (‘Excluded as a young man from an academic career … he re-emerged in the 1950s as a Stalinist … a convinced supporter of the absolute primacy of the party’: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047244112460001">2001 [1986]</xref>: 247), has sceptically repudiated any possible inheritance of the legacy tied to the vestiges of imperialism. And yet he confesses to Magris that his new scholarly project is on the poet Mihály Babits, translator of Dante into Hungarian. Magris astutely observes that this choice is not nationalistic – that is, it is not aligned with somebody who had ties to his party’s history – but is fundamentally Mitteleuropean. Babits, who died in 1941, rejected fascism – as did other Austro-Hungarian writers after the dissolution of the Hapsburg Empire – but he also rejected Marxism. This position could have made him a less desirable subject outside a context that culturally, despite its pro-Moscow stance after 1956, clearly responded first and foremost to the solicitations of Mitteleuropean culture. The hidden but active presence of what Magris calls the ‘Danubian Empire’ is similarly felt in the figure of one of the most outspoken detractors of the Austrian heritage, the Croatian (Yugoslav at the time, but Pannonian in Magris’s view) author Miroslav Krleza. Magris opens his stringent examination of Krleza from a casual reference: he remembers that during his visit to the region Hungarian TV was showing one of Krleza’s dramas. Krleza was a personal protégé of Tito’s, and, in Magris’s words, he portrayed the world of Pannonia in more depth than most Hungarian-born writers. He was adamantly anti-Hapsburg in his fictional works as well as in his scholarly choices, as his essay on Karl Kraus, the fierce early twentieth-century Viennese satirist, proves (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047244112460001">Magris, 2001 [1986]</xref>: 300). Once again, Magris demonstrates that all the pieces of the Danubian cultural puzzle seem to come together, as one of the strongest lessons of the Danubian Empire was precisely that of allowing a reasonable artistic freedom and even stern self-criticism. Kraus, whose origins were Czech, despite his vehement writings against Vienna’s societal hypocrisy, was allowed to live, work and publish in the capital of the empire while openly denouncing its political shortcomings. It is not surprising that in the 1930s, once the forbearing object of his satire was gone, Kraus himself embraced the nationalistic and nostalgically pro-Austria party in the hope that, in name of the old Austrian way, it would keep at bay the growing Nazi movement. Krleza’s choice to write about Kraus in order to criticize the Hapsburg civilization proves indirectly that he was aware of the fact that self-criticism and irony were indeed part of the Danubian civilization to which he probably belonged more than he could (or wanted to) reveal. It is possibly because of this awareness that, in a late memoir which touches upon the complex fabric of the old Hapsburg world, Krleza calls himself a son of ‘Agram’, the imperial German name of Zagreb: ‘The vast royal and imperial union had taught even him … to love it, or at least to understand it by rebelling against it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047244112460001">2001 [1986]</xref>: 255).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0047244112460001">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>As stated before, we could search in any of Magris’s books and easily verify that his works and thought revolve around the cultural contradictions and composite views that surround whomever witnesses the duality of a border. All his works deal, in fact, with the description of the rich cultural texture of ‘the other side’, and its subsequent exploration. In such a literary approach, following a river to its estuary, its natural death – which is also its life – in the sea, brings to the surface the most evident symbol of exploration for a writer born in Trieste: the sea, both the Adriatic and the Mediterranean:
<disp-quote>
<p>Fortunately also the Danubian travellers love the sea and perhaps … they cross the vast Mitteleuropean planes under heavy skies first and foremost in order to arrive at the sea. It is on the sea shores … that we meet with the broad breath of life, which opens to the great question about destiny and the meaning of good and evil; the sea makes us confront ambiguity, it invites us to brave it. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047244112460001">Magris, 2005</xref>: xix)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We have already touched upon Magris’s predilection for the myth of Ulysses as an investigative model that never forgets the point of departure, precisely to report and compare – and, thus, to accept or not – the changes proposed by new experiences. The sea is both a hidden and an explicit presence in <italic>Danubio</italic>. The river and its cultures seem far away from the sea of Ulysses, but its course ends up in the Black Sea almost across from the Dardanelles, the great stage where the myth of Troy unfolds. The mythical fights for space and supremacy which took place in those narrow waters are an omen of the brutal wars in the lands crossed by the blue Danube. It is not mere coincidence that the myth of Troy is mentioned in the book during Magris’s visit to Mauthausen. Here Magris prepares the ground for his meditation on the tragedy of the Holocaust:
<disp-quote>
<p>In the castle museum in Linz is a nineteenth-century print showing a view of Mauthausen. Peaceful hills, friendly houses, boats on the Danube full of people waving gaily, the idyllic atmosphere of a country outing. From the steamers on the river there rises, cheerfully, a puff of smoke. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047244112460001">Magris, 2001 [1986]</xref>: 142)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The cheerful ‘puff of smoke’ produced by the tourist boats filled with merry people is a foreshadowing of what the traveller is going to visit next, the concentration camp where more than 110,000 people were killed (not one of the worst, Magris remarks with his usual historical accuracy). The Danubian traveller climbs down and up the 186 steps, the stairs of death that reached the stone quarry: ‘The steps are steep, I am tired and sweaty’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047244112460001">2001 [1986]</xref>: 144). The camp is a border zone without internal limits; there is no <italic>either/or</italic> versus <italic>and</italic> opposition: death could reach the prisoners on their way upstairs or downstairs with tremendous indifference: ‘Up these 186 steep steps the slaves carried rocks … they were struck down by beatings or bullets’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047244112460001">2001 [1986]</xref>: 144). They were beaten to death or shot, according to convenience and circumstances. The anthropology of killing is traced in the practical choice given by modernity: a technological or manual killing. It is while reflecting on those 186 steps, climbed up and down by enslaved humans, that Magris goes all the way back to the original source of pure bravery – to Hector who defended his beloved walls – to find the only way to celebrate the dignity of the anonymous heroes who rebelled, often simply by refusing to obey an order, and thus stopped for a moment the tides of degradation that reach the shores of humanity with the atrocious regularity of history:
<disp-quote>
<p>But on these steps the individual has also succeeded in rendering himself unique and ineffaceable, greater than Hector beneath the walls of Troy … In the various camps, as well as on these steps at Mauthausen, there were many such heroic deeds … that stem the tide of abasement. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047244112460001">Magris 2001 [1986]</xref>: 145)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The water of the Danube represented in the idyllic painting mentioned above will eventually reach the sea that faces the mythical place where Hector became the first hero of Western civilization – the same civilization that, in one of its many turns, suddenly replaced the smoke of festive steamboats with that of gas chambers.</p>
<p>Throughout the millennia, the Mediterranean served, no differently from any border, as a double-edged symbol, bridge or barrier. On its waters took place exploration, commerce, trade, cultural exchange, religious conflicts and ethnic mixing. But the Mediterranean also became a symbol of fear, depredation, piracy, invasion and (forced) mass migration. This is still very clear to all of us today, when political, economic and national interests too often produce the easy equation in which border equals barrier.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0047244112460001">32</xref></sup> Millennia of reciprocal colonization attempts, from the Phoenicians to the Etruscans and the Greeks, have caused wars, conflicts and grief, but have also produced strong cultural exchanges and bonds that affected and still affect a common way of conceiving the world. The name ‘Mediterraneus’, ‘in the midst of lands’, denotes its natural geo-historical function as a bridge among different people.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0047244112460001">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>In these last pages, I would like to focus on Magris’s short historical novel <italic>Un altro mare</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0047244112460001">1991</xref>). The book was therefore published at the very beginning of the war in the former Yugoslavia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0047244112460001">1991</xref>) but was written in the months leading up to it. From a historical point of view, the novel reflects on the territorial dissolution and epochal changes caused in the northern Adriatic by the two world wars. It therefore acquires an even stronger meaning if re-read in light of the events of the early 1990s. <italic>Un altro mare</italic> embodies, as much as <italic>Danubio</italic>, Magris’s idea that the cultural heritage of the Austrian Empire, with both its positive and negative legacies, reaches deep into the contemporary world.</p>
<p>The novel talks about the life of Enrico Mreule, a scholar of ancient Greek and Latin, and one of the closest friends of the thinker and poet Carlo Michelstaedter, who took his own life in 1910.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0047244112460001">34</xref></sup> Enrico – Rico to his friends – grew up and studied in Gorizia, which was part of the Austrian Empire before World War I. In 1909, after completing his degree in classical studies at the universities of Innsbruck and Graz, Enrico, decided to travel to South America, and more specifically to Argentina. The main reason for his sudden departure was that the world he inhabited had been subjugated by what he calls ‘the ancient authority of the aorist and the sequence of tenses’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0047244112460001">Magris, 1993</xref>: 2): in other words, a universe ruled by the ghost of a rigid, logical culture that affected the Mediterranean basin, and also – perhaps particularly – the shores which belonged to the Austrian Empire. Its aim was to absorb the ancient classical heritage into its own cogent and orderly new classical interpretation of the world. If crossing a border means crossing spaces and historical times, as we have seen before, the rigid concatenation of the verbal tenses of <italic>dead</italic> languages, studied to interpret the past and not as communicative idioms, can only lead to a self-referential discourse. In Enrico’s mind, there seems to be a consistency between the role played by German, a modern language, and its two ancient predecessors: all three represent a world that looks incessantly for form and harmony – a world that leaves no space for improvement or new knowledge. It is in line with this sense of cultural equivalence that the headmaster of Gorizia’s <italic>Staatsgymnasium</italic> asked his students to translate Greek directly into German, the only modern language that could be adopted to ask questions about the essence of life.</p>
<p>In Argentina, after initial uncertainties, Rico quits teaching and becomes a gaucho – a profession in which he does not seem to need his erudition. However, while in Patagonia, he goes on translating the Greek classics, an activity which appears to be in contradiction with the reason behind his departure, and above all out of place in that vast and barren space. But Mreule makes this practice part of his daily life, translating technical and work-related terms into Greek, and giving the ancient language a new purpose in the new space under the immense starry Patagonian sky – a sky that offers itself to ironic metaphysical investigations, appropriate to the language of philosophy. Once health problems force him to abandon Patagonia and live in an urban area, in 1922 Enrico decides to go back to Gorizia, where he resumes teaching. In 1933 he moves to Umago, a small town surrounded by the Istrian Sea, where he spends the rest of his life until his death in 1959, first harassed by the fascists and then by the communists. The two dates of his return (1922) and of his retirement to Umago (1933) are emblematic: 1922 is the year of the rise of fascism in Italy and in 1933 Hitler comes to power in Germany: two historical events indirectly caused by the effects of World War I, the conflict that Enrico – an Italian subject but an Austrian citizen – had avoided, by chance, thanks to his early departure for Argentina.</p>
<p>Enrico is an uncharacteristic explorer: he does not speak much and he is not too keen to meet people. He resembles a taciturn shipwrecked survivor who carries within himself his own encounters with life and death: ‘One doesn’t go to listen to the sound of the wind in the thorn bushes just for the sake of the odd anecdote’ (Magris 1995 [1991]: 26). His approach can be compared to that of his famous Adriatic model, Giacomo Leopardi, whose auscultation of the wind attempted to capture the sense of the infinite, the only voyage allowed to the poet’s imagination.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0047244112460001">35</xref></sup> Enrico, however, unlike Leopardi, embarks in a real voyage. He crosses a small sea (the Mediterranean), which epitomizes a space and a time that are very familiar – perhaps too familiar – to him, to reach an unknown immense ocean; and yet the wind, even if it is much stronger and carries different smells, eventually produces the same ineffable sound.</p>
<p>Enrico had left the small enclosure represented by the Adriatic Sea because he felt oppressed by a civilization that seemed too regressive and intricate to be understood or endured, within the narrow limits of the south-east corner of the Austro-Hungarian Empire that he inhabited. But the political changes that swept away the empire after World War I suggest that what seemed uncomfortable and oppressive to him in 1909 – namely, the strange feeling of belonging to an empire whose official language was German but which nonetheless saw itself as the righteous inheritor of the classical culture that civilized the Mediterranean – was perhaps the only key to a truly multicultural life. It is in the enormous mono-linguistic spaces of Argentina that Enrico grasps the two hidden lessons he had learned in his formative years in Gorizia. The first one is the realization that the mixing of languages and cultures in such a narrow territory – as his headmaster used to say – was actually a solution that allowed relatively pacific co-existence in a region with no political borders but only invisible barriers constituted by its different languages and cultures: ‘a true Gorizian … to lead a full and satisfying life … need[s] Italian, German, Slovenian, Friulan, and Trieste-Venetian’ (Magris 1995 [1991]: 9). Enrico, who speaks all these languages, appreciates the elusive significance of this sentence even more once he learns the new language, Spanish, which allows him to survive and travel in a vast territory far away from the small sea subjected to the ‘aorist[s] and the sequence of tenses’ (Magris, 1995 [1991]: 2). Mreule’s reflection upon the constant shifting of languages in such a small area on a daily or hourly basis, or even within the same conversation, possibly represents a solution to the question of the border/bridge image: it forces us to think about how many theoretical issues and material things that are actually dear and close to us may remain indecipherable unless we are willing and curious enough to place them in their own proper microcosm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0047244112460001">Magris, 1991</xref>: 16).</p>
<p>The formation of national states after the collapse of the empire was probably the only effective historical solution at the time, but it did provoke inevitable nationalistic tensions that – in such a concentration of cultures and languages – encouraged the predictable imposition of one ethnic group onto the others in the name of the newly unified states. On the other hand, the implosion of the Austrian Empire (and here we touch on the second lesson that Enrico learns during his long journey away from his complex homeland) originated from a lack of understanding that a true civilization, after its natural expansion, needs to limit itself; it needs to prune and clip its own overgrown bushes and branches: ‘civilization, like gardening, is the art of pruning’ (Magris, 1995 [1991]: 25). Before planting new trees, we need to tend to those that are already in front of us; we need to let go of what we deem useless in order to achieve our own aspirations and reach our set goals. Again, it is only after understanding the limits of our own departure point that we can open up to different views without either succumbing to them or over-imposing on them our own established ideas. This was the essential lesson taught by his philosophy teacher, Schubert-Soldern, in the <italic>Staatsgymnasium.</italic> Schubert-Soldern, born in Prague, had refused the offer of a chair in Theoretical Philosophy at the University of Leipzig to teach high school students in Gorizia, despite the fact that they could barely understand what he was saying, let alone what he was writing. But what had appeared to be an inexplicably odd decision at the time, in retrospect actually shines in all its wisdom. Declining a new experience does not necessarily mean rejecting the idea of it or dismissing its potential: it simply means accepting one’s own limitations and letting them thrive where and how they can. At times it takes as much courage to stay put and work with what is already before our eyes, as embarking on new journeys. Enrico understands all this while looking at a huge tree, with its immense branches badly in need of a good pruning. He suddenly understands why his teacher renounced the prestigious university post. He realizes that the academic debate would have divided Shubert-Soldern’s publications and theories into many different branches, and would have focused its attention on the discarded branches as well, losing sight of the main tree – the opposite of a natural pruning, where the branches disposed of do not survive.</p>
<p>The historical, geographical and cultural confusion of which Enrico tried to make sense with his departure for the broad spaces of Patagonia becomes, after World War I, when he returns to Istria, a permanent condition which leads to the tremendous historical upheavals of World War II, and to changes that reach well into the present time, with a paradoxical – and yet logical – geo-political reconfiguration of some of the territories of the old empire. Enrico’s malaise, his rejection of any norm that he is presented with upon his return, is caused by the ambivalence of the new geographical situation, with three distinct countries (Italy, Austria and Yugoslavia) surrounding the small portion of land that he had called home. It is the same confusion that baffles many other Austro-Hungarian intellectuals, including Schubert-Soldern, who has to leave the new Italian city of Gorizia and the <italic>Staatsgymnasium</italic>, aptly transformed into the Liceo Vittorio Emanuele III, and moves to Austria, where he spends his last years until his death in 1924 without any official citizenship (as in theory he is now Czechoslovakian), as he is reluctant to choose one.</p>
<p>The title of the book, <italic>A Different Sea</italic>, reminds us that the Mediterranean that Enrico finds when he returns from Patagonia is indeed another sea, as different as the vast ocean that surrounded him while he was in Argentina. The union of languages and lands which he left behind is still there, but it is hidden by the nationalistic impositions which represent the worst interpretation of a border: the inability of each of the sides to understand that a border is always a bridge and a barrier, but not in the sense of a bridge thrown up to conquer a wall or a barrier erected to separate. The prevalence of these ideas can only drive more ethnic conflicts and new wars. Magris’s book, as I said, came out at the beginning of the Yugoslavian conflict, and at the time of the first mass migrations from Eastern Europe and from Africa to Italy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0047244112460001">1991</xref>). This short novel traces the origins of a specific geo-historical discontent that erupted again decades later, to be settled, it seems, after years of renewed fighting. Magris’s message is that this discontent will surface anywhere and in any culture that does not learn how to respect the microcosms of which it is composed, as well as the new vital impulses that can and should be regulated, but cannot be stopped in any effective way by any barrier.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Magris is indeed a careful <italic>geographer</italic>, an expert traveller as well as a sailor over a culturally rich and dense territory. For him literature is voyage, movement, exploration, and at the same time it also entails respect for what is already there, the sedimentary part of another, pre-existing culture. Even when the journey is surrounded by the inevitable fear of the unknown, Magris shows that it is the writer’s ethical duty to keep searching for new solutions. Ultimately, the open lesson of his works is that the border is before our eyes, and it is visible; but it is also within each one of us, as an invisible obstacle that we need to overcome to attempt anything worthy of being called new.</p>

<p>Most, if not all, scholarship on Magris stresses how his writings are associated with travelling as well as the great figures of the journey (the sea, the river, etc.) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0047244112460001">Pellegrini, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0047244112460001">Governatori, 1999</xref>). Magris has admitted in many circumstances and venues (his own books, newspaper articles, prefaces, interviews, etc.) that the sea and the journey are both central to his writings, and that he envisions the various and multifaceted components of any journey as a reflection of the natural flow of the sea. For specific definitions, among many, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0047244112460001">Magris (1991</xref>: 10; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047244112460001">1999a</xref>: 63) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0047244112460001">Ciccarelli (2004</xref>: 416).</p></fn>

<p>The essay was first published in 1992 in the journal <italic>Nuova Antologia</italic> (April–June: 50–61) with the slightly different title: ‘Chi è dall’altra parte? Cosiderazioni di frontiera’ (‘Who is on the other side? Considerations about borders’). I translate this as ‘On/from the other side’ as ‘dall’altra’ in Italian may imply both meanings, and on some occasions it does, although ‘from’ seems to be the prevailing usage in Magris’s article. This is, in my opinion, Magris’s most revealing theoretical intervention on the subject of writing, regardless of the tragic circumstances that prompted it. The importance of this essay for Magris’s own idea of writing is also demonstrated by the fact that he goes back to these concepts in many of his post-1993 writings (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0047244112460001">Ciccarelli, 2004</xref>).</p></fn>

<p>Officially the wars of independence in the former Yugoslavia took place from 1991 to 1995 for Croatia; 1992–5 for Bosnia-Herzegovina; 1998–9 for Kosovo; and in 1991 (the ‘Ten Day War’) for Slovenia. Montenegro initially entered a confederation with Serbia and briefly fought alongside it (particularly against Croatia); after years of tension, it declared independence in 2006.

<p>The book is based on specific autobiographical and historical events, and deals with one of the most absurd situations caused by the aberrations of World War II. It is the story of the tragically botched relocation of the philo-Germanic Cossacks to Friuli: ‘Perhaps for me the seminal experience of narrating, of the relation between narrative and the misunderstandings of life and history, originates from a grotesque and painful change of borders that I fortuitously witnessed as a child: that grotesque “Kosakenland” that the Germans … had promised to their Cossack allies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047244112460001">Magris, 1999a</xref>: 56). ‘Grotesque and painful’ is a combination that harks back to Pirandello’s definition of life in his theorization of humour.</p></fn>

<p>It has been noted that Magris’s first book is the foundation for his future explorations of the period, which goes roughly from the late years of the Austro-Hungarian Empire to the inception of World War II. Magris was only 24 years old when the book was published, and he later adjusted his critical evaluation on the subject, but the substance of this book informs his lifelong interpretation of Austrian authors.</p></fn>

<p>Not all the major writers participated in the nostalgic celebration of the empire. Schnitzler, with his strong controversial and censored insistence either on anti-Semitic themes or sexual behaviour certainly did not, while Hofmannsthal and Roth, in different ways, contributed to the formation or consolidation of the myth (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0047244112460001">Magris, 1963</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0047244112460001">1971</xref>). It is important to note, as Magris stresses in many of his writings, that several intellectuals who later celebrated the Hapsburg myth had been strongly critical of the empire (like Joseph Roth) or even its enemy (like the poet Biagio Marin).</p></fn>

It is interesting to note that there is a certain similarity between the late empire’s combination of national unity and universalism and the idea of one of its strongest detractors in the nineteenth century, Giuseppe Mazzini.

<p>Among the intellectuals who, in different measures, share this view are Czesław <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0047244112460001">Miłosz (1968)</xref> and Milan Kundera, who, in an 1983 article originally written in French and translated into English the following year, wrote a passionate – and sometimes politically misinterpreted – piece on Central European culture as an orphan of (but also in the sense of having been abandoned by) Europe. One passage in particular seems to refer to the dispute in question: ‘Today, all of Central Europe has been subjugated by Russia with the exception of little Austria, which, more by chance than necessity, has retained its independence, but ripped out of its central European setting, it has lost most of its individual character and all of its importance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0047244112460001">Kundera, 1984 [1983]</xref>: 8). Some historians and political scientists have used Kundera’s article to prove him wrong in terms of statistical analyses related to the post-1989 outcome. Kundera’s words were conceived well before the fall of the Berlin Wall and such interpretation does not acknowledge the author’s original literary and cultural intent or offer his entire historical view, which is not naïvely blind in favour of the ‘lost’ empire: ‘The Austrian empire had the great opportunity of making Central Europe into a strong, unified state. But the Austrians, alas, were divided between an arrogant Pan-German nationalism and their own Central European mission. They did not succeed in building a federation of equal nations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0047244112460001">Kundera, 1984 [1983]</xref>: 5). These considerations are not very different, from a cultural and historical standpoint, from Magris’s observations in many of his writings.</p></fn>

<p>Yiddish, despite its long reach and range, as well as its strong influence on the entire Central European region, did not join the fate of other cultural/linguistic groups.

<label>22</label>
<p>It is interesting to note that since his early works, when talking about Austro-Hungarian émigrés, Magris seems to define their exile as a condition more than a geo-political issue. His definition is not too dissimilar from that given by many Eastern European writers well beyond the generation that directly experienced the fall of the empire. It is, for instance, at the centre of Iosif Brodskij’s writings, as exemplified in particular by a 1987 speech delivered in Vienna. See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0047244112460001">Brodskij (1988)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0047244112460001">Bethea (1994)</xref> for a scholarly assessment of the concept of exile in Brodskij’s opus. In what may just be another irony of history, the first city where the great Russian-born poet set foot as soon as he was expelled from the Soviet Union in 1972 was Vienna. For a similar definition of exile as a condition that cannot be always translated into a specific geo-political situation, see the first pages of Kundera’s novel <italic>L’Ignorance</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0047244112460001">2000</xref>).</p></fn>

<p>Joseph Roth was born in Brody, in the eastern part of the Austrian Empire, an area which now belongs to the Ukraine.

<p>Constraints that may come from political situations but that can also depend on biographical choices, as Magris points out for some of the Mitteleuropean writers, characterized as home-bound Ulysses, who travel more on the atlas than in reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047244112460001">2005</xref>: xix).</p></fn>

The author refers to the millenarian disputation about the Danube’s actual sources, which, not unlike those of the Nile, were considered secrets for a long time. Magris’s ironic prose, in the first part of the book, touches upon the modern dualism between Donaueschingen (the official source of the river) and Furtwangen (the less reputable option), and their reciprocal claim to be the true origin of the river. Magris’s ironic pages unveil the futility of certain hypotheses, including one that claims that the river derives from a faucet that regulates the water which falls from a gutter, which in turn channels the rain coming down from a hill. A rainwater puddle would thus be the true source of the river. He also remarks that the choice of one solution over another may reflect a very different cultural and political approach, as the Danube has mostly been seen as the Hapsburg river where different cultures mingle together, as opposed to the Rhine, which instead represents the pure Germanic river. For the dismissed hypothesis that the Danube is a tributary of the Rhine see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047244112460001">Magris (2001 [1986]</xref>: 28–9).</p></fn>

<p>The meaning of the Latin name is not only accepted by the other Romance languages, but it occurs in most of the languages of people or nations that shared the sea throughout the centuries (in Arabic, Hebrew, Berber and Albanian, not to mention German or English). Recent historical events have confirmed the indissoluble connection between the fate of specific Mediterranean states and the life of others in the region, regardless of their willingness to be involved. Technology has played a fundamental role in some of these changes: clearly, wireless navigation is much faster than any actual boat. However, the physical dimension, with its geo-historical and common cultural proximity, also played a central role in spreading the protests and the changes from one Mediterranean country to another.

<p>Carlo Michelstaedter (1887–1910, born in Gorizia) is one of the most interesting as well as controversial figures of pre-World War I Italian culture. Besides his various finished and unfinished writings (poems, essays, tales), his most important work is his dissertation for a degree in humanities at the University of Florence, <italic>La persuasione e la rettorica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0047244112460001">1995 [1982]</xref>; <italic>Persuasion and Rhetoric</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0047244112460001">2004</xref>). In this essay, he develops a partially nihilistic (and, within Italian culture, anti-Dannunzian) theory, stating that everything aimed at obtaining the illusory pleasures of life is rhetorical – that is, not essential – while any attempt to overcome the illusions that seem to make our existence pleasurable belongs to the realm of persuasion, which he freely associates with a stoic essential rationality. Life’s true pleasure is therefore the embracing of its transitional status, as well as the ability to enjoy any moment of it, regardless of its apparent importance. In this approach, death does not need to be exorcised through the search for pleasure or exceptionality, but is accepted as inevitable. Michelstaedter killed himself as soon as he finished his dissertation, before he could develop his thought further or even edit most of his poems and writings, which were published posthumously by his friends. The edition of his works, despite recent clear improvements, is still controversial.</p></fn>

<p>I am referring to Leopardi’s famous poem ‘L’infinito’ (1821), where the sound of the wind brings forth the sense of the sea as a figure of eternal immensity in which the poet’s rationality, ironically, loses itself in what Leopardi himself describes as a ‘sweet’ shipwrecking of the mind. Leopardi’s poetic speculation about the contrast between the limits of human life and the innate contemplation of nature and death is very much present throughout Magris’s book, both as a dialogic reference point for the author and for the main character. Magris’s own intellectual approach to life is indeed an open dialogue with Leopardi’s sadly ironic view of life as a rollercoaster between utopic enthusiasms and brutal disenchantments, as is made clear by many of his writings, including the opening article which gives the (Leopardian) title to the collection of essays <italic>Utopia e disincanto</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047244112460001">1999</xref>: 7–16; <italic>‘Utopia and Disenchantment’</italic>).</p></fn>
