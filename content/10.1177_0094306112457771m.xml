<p>In this ambitious ethnography of postwar El Salvador, Irina Silber examines the complexity of reconstruction and development through the lived experiences of rural peasants in transition from one struggle to another. <italic>Everyday Revolutionaries</italic> considers two key periods, the postwar reconstruction (1993–1998) and the recent period of emigration from El Salvador to the United States (2000–2008). The author begins her fieldwork in a former insurgent stronghold of northern El Salvador, but finds that the full story of reconstruction takes her to the United States where an unofficial development policy turns former revolutionaries into undocumented migrants. Silber uncovers how in the transition from war to peace, everyday lives are ensnared in the contradictions and conflicts which emerge between hope and disillusionment, development and marginalization, repatriation and diaspora.</p>
<p>Central to the investigation is a concern with how people navigate the transition from revolutionary action to nation-building in the face of continued marginalization. Through participant observation, in-depth interviews, and the collection of life histories, the author gathers stories from former revolutionaries and refugees as they live out new roles (e.g., activist, community leader, mother, and migrant). This work helps to illuminate the challenges and possibilities of democracy in postwar El Salvador. However just as importantly, it bears witness to the experiences of violence, despair, and loss that constitute the history of war. The author explores how this history is actively constructed and how the celebration of memory is selective, often emphasizing the heroism of revolutionary struggle. The author suggests that these acts seek to create feelings of community and solidarity, which stand in tension with many people’s experiences of disillusionment and betrayal. Through this broad lens, Silber offers insight to a number of phenomena including the gendered experiences of war and reconstruction, the NGO-boom that followed the war, the failure of development and return to diaspora, and the emergence of new forms of governance and control (i.e., neoliberal governmentality). The book will be of interest both to area specialists as well as more generally to those researching collective memory, peace and war, development, and migration.</p>
