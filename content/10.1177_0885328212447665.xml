<abstract>
<p>A bioactive glass and its corresponding glass-ceramic have been used to investigate the possibility to load a common antibiotic (carbenicillin) on their surface during the reactivity processes which occur by dipping these materials in a simulated body fluid. The materials bioactivity in the early stage of simulated body fluid treatment has been investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM-EDS) and X-ray diffraction. The uptake of carbenicillin has been performed by dipping the samples in simulated body fluid solution with a drug concentration of 500 mg/l for 6, 12 and 24 h. Some glass samples underwent a pre-treatment in simulated body fluid, for different time frames, in order to form a silica gel layer before the surface exposition to antibiotic. The carbenicillin release has been measured in water up to 36 h. The amount of incorporated and released antibiotic has been estimated by UV visible spectrophotometer. All samples were able to incorporate a significant amount of antibiotic and it was possible to tailor the drug release by modifying the simulated body fluid pre-treatment.</p>

<p>Despite the use of strict hygienic protocols, special sterile enclosure with laminar flow and intraoperative systemic antibiotic prophylaxis, the infections development remains a significant issue for surgical treatments. The use of synthetic materials to restore or support the human body is more and more diffused in the modern medicine, especially in orthopaedic field, and the increased use of biomaterial implants has resulted in a concomitant rise in bacterial infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328212447665">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328212447665">2</xref></sup> Biomaterials contamination by different bacterial strains limits the longevity of implanted devices, since, in the body, it causes infections that are often resistant to antibiotics prophylaxis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328212447665">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328212447665">4</xref></sup> In turn, surgical site infections often cause several adverse events, such as the prolongation of hospitalization period, additional diagnostic tests, excess of morbidity and, in the worst case, mortality. Moreover, all these factors significantly contribute to the medical cost increasing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328212447665">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328212447665"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328212447665">7</xref></sup> For these reasons, many efforts are carried out in order to prevent and control the surgical site infections, both from research and medical point of views.</p>
<p>The prophylaxis and therapies against post-operative infections always foresee the regular systemic antibiotics administration. However, the target of the systemically administered drug is a surgical wound that often is poorly approachable and has a compromised blood supply inhibiting drug delivery to the site. Moreover, the antibiotics may have systemic side effects and the high doses of administered drugs can develop a bacteria resistance. After an implantation, micro organisms adhere on conditioning film, growing on the material surface, and lead to a mature biofilm, which is difficult to get rid of by antibiotics prophylaxis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328212447665">8</xref></sup> When an implant is introduced inside the human body, the host defences are activated and the host’s immune system stimulated, causing a kind of “race for the surface”, a fight between cellular tissue integration and bacterial colonization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328212447665">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328212447665">9</xref></sup> Then, the combination of a local drug delivery and the ability of a bioactive material to bond with bone allows to realize a device able to promote the bone regeneration and to limit the infection risk, by avoiding the effect of a systemic administration.</p>
<p>For this purpose, in the last years, many efforts have been carried out to realize devices able to allow a local drug release, in order to provide an antibiotic concentration only on the surgical site, for prolonged time and immediately effective after implantation.</p>
<p>As far as the orthopaedics field is concerned, the first example of local antibiotics application is the polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)-based acrylic bone cement loaded with antibiotic, which is commercially available. From the research point of view, many studies have been carried out to associate the antimicrobial power of antibiotics to the osteointegration properties of glasses, ceramics and glass-ceramics, such as hydroxyapatite (HAp), apatite-wollastonite glass-ceramics (AW), β-tricalcium phosphate or bioactive glasses, which can be used as bone substitutes. Composites based on PMMA bone cement incorporating ceramics, glasses or glass-ceramics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328212447665">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328212447665">11</xref></sup> in association with antibiotics or anti-inflammatory, are widely studied to combine the mechanical properties of PMMA, the bioactivity of ceramic/glass-ceramic phase and the antimicrobial effect of drugs. Other systems for local drug application are antibiotic impregnated bone substitutes, such as calcium sulphate and calcium phosphates: OSTOSET® pellets are beads of surgical-grade CaSO<sub>4</sub> completely resorbable, which promote bone repair and can be impregnated with tobramycin sulphate and can be used to treat bone tissue infections.</p>
<p>Some recent research works evaluate the possibility to incorporate in different ways antibiotics into HAp, hydroxycarbonateapatite (CHA), bioactive glasses, AW glass-ceramics or other ceramics materials and their composites, to use them as bone grafts, substitutes (in the form of particulates, membranes, or porous matrix) or coatings on metallic implants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328212447665">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328212447665"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328212447665"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328212447665">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Stigter et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328212447665">12</xref></sup> have reported the possibility to incorporate different antibiotics into a CHA coating on titanium implants during a biomimetic co-precipitation process. This study demonstrates the drugs ability to bond with CHA coating, due to the presence of carboxylic groups, able to create a stable chemical bond with calcium ions.</p>
<p>In the present work, the possibility to incorporate an antibiotic on a bioactive glass and its corresponding glass-ceramic has been investigated, by overworking the bioactivity process which occurs by dipping these materials in a simulated body fluid (SBF). As discussed in literature,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328212447665">16</xref></sup> as well as in the following sections of the present paper, the bioactivity mechanism begins with a rapid ions exchange between alkaline ions from the glass surface and hydrogen ions from the solution (Step I), followed by the formation of silanols (Step II), which then undergo polycondensation to develop a silica gel layer (Step III). This layer promotes the adsorption of calcium, phosphate and carbonate ions from the solution (Step IV). These ions subsequently react, forming the HCA layer (Step V). Taking into account these features of bioactive glasses, the aim of the present work is to incorporate an antibiotic during the early stages of surface reactivity of bioactive glasses and glass-ceramics. The bioactivity steps of the glass and glass-ceramic studied in this work have been systematically investigated in order to determine the kinetics of silica gel formation and its thickness. Subsequently, the ability of the selected antibiotic to be incorporated and its release kinetics have been evaluated.</p>

<p>A bioactive glass belonging to the system SiO<sub>2</sub>-P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>-CaO-MgO-Na<sub>2</sub>O-K<sub>2</sub>O (CEL2), with the following molar composition: 45% SiO<sub>2</sub>, 3% P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, 26% CaO, 7% MgO, 15% Na<sub>2</sub>O, 4% K<sub>2</sub>O<sub>,</sub> completely characterized by the authors in a previous work,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328212447665">17</xref></sup> was prepared by melting the reactants (Sigma Aldrich) in a platinum crucible at 1400℃ for 1 h and by quenching the melt in a brass mould to obtain bars. The glass bars were annealed at 500℃ for 12 h in order to release the internal stresses and subsequently were cut into slices of 1 cm × 1 cm and 2 mm of thickness. CEL2 glass shows a glass transition temperature <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> at 550℃ and two crystallization temperatures within 600℃ and 850℃.</p>
<p>CEL2 slices were also thermally treated at 950℃ for 1 h to obtain glass-ceramic samples (CEL2GC); this glass-ceramic is characterized by two crystalline phases, identified as akemanite [Ca<sub>2</sub>Mg(Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>)] and as combeite [Na<sub>4</sub>Ca<sub>4</sub>(Si<sub>6</sub>O<sub>18</sub>].<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328212447665">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328212447665">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Both CEL2 and CEL2GC slices were polished with SiC abrasive paper up to 1200 grit in order to obtain smooth and comparable surface for all samples.</p>
<p>Carbenicillin, an antibiotic belonging to the carboxypenicillin family drug, normally used for the infections treatments, was selected for incorporation on top of CEL2 and CEL2GC samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328212447665">Figure 1</xref>); for CEL2 samples both pristine and pre-treated samples were used whereas for CEL2GC only pristine sample were put in contact with the drug. This antibiotic has a wide spectrum of action towards Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, by inhibiting the cell wall synthesis. Carbenicillin has a low molecular weight (Mw 378.4) and two carboxylic groups; both these properties should enhance the possibility to incorporate and/or chemically bond the carbenicillin to glasses and glass-ceramics, as reported by Stigter et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328212447665">12</xref></sup>

<sec id="sec3-0885328212447665"><title>In vitro bioactivity test</title>
<p>CEL2 and CEL2GC samples underwent <italic>in vitro</italic> bioactivity test, by soaking the slices in an simulated body fluid (SBF, proposed by Kokubo and Takadama<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328212447665">19</xref></sup>). CEL2GC bioactivity has been already investigated by the authors in a previous paper.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328212447665">17</xref></sup> In the present research work, an extensive investigation was performed to evaluate and compare the early stage in vitro reactivity of both CEL2 and CEL2GC, as this information is crucial to effectively incorporate the antibiotic into their surface reaction layers. In fact, the estimation of the silica gel formation and hydroxyapatite (HAp) microcrystal precipitation kinetics are both central for understanding the optimal conditions for the antibiotic incorporation.</p>
<p>All samples were soaked in 25 ml of SBF maintained at 37℃ for 12, 24 and 48 h for CEL2 and 1, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h for CEL2GC (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0885328212447665">Table 1</xref>).

<p>Time schedule for soaking in SBF was different for CEL2 and CEL2GC due to the different reaction kinetic observed for the two materials, as will be discussed further in the paper. After soaking, each sample was removed from the solution, gently washed in distilled water and let dry in air at room temperature. Subsequently, samples were analysed by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM – FEI, QUANTA INSPECT 200), energy dispersion spectrometry (EDS – EDAX PV 9900) and X-ray diffraction (XRD – X’Pert Philips diffractometer) using the Bragg Brentano camera geometry and CuKα incident radiation, to observe the silica gel formation and the eventual HAp precipitation. SEM and EDS analyses were also carried out on polished material cross-sections embedded in a polymeric resin (Struers) after 6, 12 and 24 h, to evaluate the quality and thickness of the reaction layers.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0885328212447665"><title>Antibiotic incorporation</title>
<sec id="sec5-0885328212447665"><title>Uptake on pristine CEL2 and CEL2GC</title>
<p>The carbenicillin incorporation was carried out in SBF solution, using an antibiotic concentration of 500 mg/l. CEL2 and CEL2GC pristine samples were incubated at 37℃ in 25 ml of uptake solution for 6, 12 and 24 h; in this way, the antibiotic can co-precipitate and bond with the reaction layer that is developing on CEL2 and CEL2GC surfaces during their interaction with the solution.</p>
<p>In detail, the incorporation of carbenicillin was performed during the above-mentioned first steps of bioactivity, which can be observed in vitro.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328212447665">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885328212447665">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328212447665">21</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885328212447665">Figure 2</xref> schematically resumes the bioactivity process steps. During the first two phases, the ion-exchange (Step I) between the alkaline ions of the materials and hydrogen ions of the biological fluid generates silanols groups (Si-OH) on the glass (or glass-ceramic) surfaces (Step II). These silanols (Step II) could be used to promote a direct bonding between functional groups of the drug (like –COOH groups) and the active sites (Si-OH) on the material surface, but it is difficult to control. During Step III, silanols condensate and form a silica gel layer, which in Step IV is enriched in calcium, phosphate and carbonate ions, coming from the solution. During these two steps (III and IV), a co-precipitation rather than a surface grafting of the drug into the gel-like layer can be promoted, since the condensation of silanols reduce the Si-OH free sites for direct bonding of the drug to the material surface. However, the COOH groups in the antibiotic and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the gel layer represents can react together enhancing the drug co-precipitation.
<fig id="fig2-0885328212447665" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of bioactivity process steps.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0885328212447665-fig2.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>On this basis, it can be expected that the drug uptake will be greatly influenced by the bioactivity process kinetics and that the amount of antibiotic incorporated on the material surface will depend on the soaking time in SBF of CEL2 and GCEL2GC and thus on their surface chemistry and morphology.</p>
<p>At the end of the uptake, the materials were removed from the solution, gently washed in bi-distilled water and underwent the release test. The remaining uptake solution was analysed by UV-Visible spectrophotometer (UV-Vis, Varian 500SCAN) as carbenicillin shows an absorbance wavelength at 236 nm, in order to evaluate the residual antibiotic concentration and thus the incorporated amount. An absorbance calibration curve was performed using different solution concentrations to compare the absorbance peaks to the antibiotic amount.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0885328212447665"><title>Uptake on pre-treated CEL2</title>
<p>A set of glass samples (CEL2) underwent a pre-treatment in SBF in order to form a silica gel layer before the material exposition to antibiotic. This test was performed in order to investigate the eventual role of a previously grown gel layer in promoting the carbenicillin precipitation or bonding ability to the surface; only CEL2 samples were used for sake of simplicity. CEL2 samples were pre-treated for 1, 6, 12 and 24 h by soaking the slices in 25 ml of SBF solution; afterward, the samples were gently washed in bi-distilled water and dipped for 24 h into 25 ml of 500 mg/l concentration uptake solution (SBF and carbenicillin). The uptake time after the pre-treatment was selected on the basis of previous results obtained for the pristine samples. At the end of the process, CEL2 slices were washed in bi-distilled water and the residual solution was analysed by means of UV-Vis spectrophotometer.</p>
<p>All tests were performed in triplicate, the average and standard deviation were calculated.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0885328212447665"><title>Antibiotic release</title>
<p>In this step, for a preliminary evaluation of the drug release ability from the modified surface, in order to avoid any influence on the release kinetic both from the environment and from further going of the bioactivity process that might occur on the material surface, a simple release medium was selected and the carbenicillin release was evaluated in bi-distilled water, as previously reported by other authors for similar release tests.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885328212447665">22</xref></sup> As for the antibiotic incorporation, a calibration curve was performed analysing the absorbance values of carbenicillin solutions at different concentration. Pristine CEL2GC slices and pristine and pre-treated CEL2 ones after the uptake were soaked into 25 ml of bi-distilled water at 37℃, in static conditions for 1, 6, 12, 24 and 36 h as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0885328212447665">Table 2</xref>.

<p>The test allows evaluating CEL2 and CEL2GC ability to release the incorporated carbenicillin (chemically grafted and/or co-precipitated) and, in turn, the potential clinical application of the antibiotic-loaded materials in alternative to the surgical prophylaxis commonly carried out just before the implant (or in combination with it, at lower systemic dosages). In view of this application and considering that the efficacy of antibiotics normally decreases with time (being inactive within three days), the release was evaluated only up to 36 h.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328212447665">Figure 3(a) and (b)</xref> reports SEM micrographs of CEL2 samples soaked in SBF for 12 and 48 h; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328212447665">Figure 3(c)</xref> shows the thickness of the silica gel layer on CEL2 after 24 h in SBF (about 10 µm, as evidenced in the picture, between the two arrows). As it can be seen, already after 12 h in SBF, CEL2 surface is completely covered by a silica gel layer and no particular evolution can be observed up to 48 h. The cracks evidenced in the pictures are a common morphological feature for silica gel grown on bioactive glasses; they normally appear after the gel formation, during the drying step of the samples (after soaking), and are due to the vacuum environment needed for SEM observation. After different times of soaking, the morphology of the gel layer is unchanged but EDS analyses evidenced a modification of the surface composition with increasing soaking time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328212447665">Figure 3(d)</xref>). In particular, during the first 12 h a net Na and K decrease was observed, index of the ion-exchange process occurred between the material and the solution, whereas Si increased, due to the silanols condensation and formation of the silica gel (Steps I, II, III). Besides, after 24 h in SBF, an increasing of Ca and P was observed due to the precipitation and diffusion of these species into the formed silica gel layer (Step IV). During the test time-frame, CEL2 did not reach Step V, in which the precipitated ions crystallized into HAp crystals, since any sign of crystalline HAp nucleation was not observed until 48 h. This behaviour is supported by XRD analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328212447665">Figure 3(e)</xref>); the XRD spectrum of CEL2 after 48 h in SBF solution evidences the typical amorphous halo of glasses at 30 degree and a halo at about 20 degree characteristic of silica gel layer, while any crystalline peak can be observed.

<sec id="sec10-0885328212447665"><title>Antibiotic incorporation and release for pristine samples (CEL2 and CEL2GC)</title>
<p>The carbenicillin uptake values for CEL2 and CEL2GC are reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0885328212447665">Figure 5(a)</xref>. The uptake was performed for 6, 12 and 24 h: the uptake for 6 h (not reported) was not sufficient to promote the antibiotic incorporation, whereas after 12 and 24 h a significant carbenicillin amount was incorporated in the silica gel layer. Generally, CEL2GC incorporated more antibiotic than CEL2, but considering the standard deviations, there is no statistical difference between 12 and 24 h of uptake. After 12 h in SBF, CEL2 and CEL2GC reached different bioactivity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0885328212447665">Table 3</xref>) and both the thickness and the composition of the self-grown gel layer are not comparable. On the contrary, after 24 h, both materials are in the same bioactivity step (Step IV) and the silica gel thickness is similar; for this reason, an uptake of 24 h has been selected for both CEL2 and CEL2GC.
<fig id="fig5-0885328212447665" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Amount of carbenicillin incorporated (a) and released (b) for CEL2 and CEL2GC samples; error bars represent standard deviation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0885328212447665-fig5.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0885328212447665">Figure 5(b)</xref> reports the carbenicillin release in water after different time of leaching from CEL2 and CEL2GC loaded with carbenicillin for 24 h; the release trend is similar for both materials: no significant release of carbenicillin can be noticed until 12 h and, generally, CEL2 releases a slightly great amount of antibiotic than CEL2GC. However, also in this case, by considering the standard deviations, the differences of released carbenicillin are not significant. The release trend decreases for both materials after 36 h probably due to re-precipitation phenomena on the silica gel, caused by the in vitro experimental setting conditions, as discussed in the next sections.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-0885328212447665"><title>Antibiotic incorporation and release for pre-treated samples (CEL2)</title>
<p>Concerning CEL2 samples pre-treated in SBF, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0885328212447665">Figure 6</xref> shows the results of 24-h uptake test following different times of pre-treatment (1, 6, 12 and 24 h); there is no correspondence between pre-treatment time and the incorporated antibiotic amount; in particular, the amount of carbenicillin on samples pre-treated for 6 h differs from the others values. After 1 h of pre-treatment, the amount of loaded carbenicillin is greater than 20%, while after 6 h it is less than 5%. Any significant difference was evidenced in the total loaded amount with longer pre-treatment times (12 and 24 h).
<fig id="fig6-0885328212447665" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Amount of carbenicillin incorporated on CEL2 after 24 h of uptake and different pre-treatment times (1, 6, 12 and 24 h); error bars represent standard deviation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0885328212447665-fig6.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0885328212447665">Figure 7</xref> shows the carbenicillin release, after a 24 h uptake, from pre-treated CEL2 samples. The trend of samples pre-treated for 1 and 6 h is similar, showing a very low release, without a kinetic profile: no release was observed until 24 h of dipping whereas almost all the antibiotic (about 70–80%) was released after 36 h of dipping in water.
<fig id="fig7-0885328212447665" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Carbenicillin released by CEL2 pre-treated for 1, 6, 12 and 24 h (uptake 24 h); error bars represent standard deviation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0885328212447665-fig7.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Differently, CEL2 samples pre-treated for 12 and 24 h, begun to release carbenicillin already after 12 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0885328212447665">Figure 7</xref>). For 12 h pre-treated CEL2, the released amount is not proportional to the times: at 12 h of test, 85% of previously incorporated carbenicillin is released, then an important decrease of the released amount can be observed at 24 h, probably because the antibiotic re-precipitates on the calcium-rich silica gel (formed during Step IV of bioactivity). The re-precipitation might be ruled by dissolution and re-precipitation phenomena of calcium ions. After 36 h, the release seems to increase, but the obtained values are dispersed and have a high deviation standard.</p>
<p>Similarly, 24 h pre-treated CEL2 released a significant carbenicillin amount after 12 h of test (65%), but in this case the trend is gradual and any antibiotic re-precipitation has been observed. Likely, the longer pre-treatment leads to a thicker silica gel layer and so to a slower release.</p>
<p>The antibiotic release should be reported taking into account its possible impact with bacteria strains. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885328212447665">23</xref></sup> one of the bacteria strain mostly involved in surgical infections, is 1÷8 mg/l (depending on penicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains). All samples, independently by the eventual pre-treatment, released an antibiotic amount significantly higher than <italic>S. aureus</italic> MIC although different release times were needed for the different samples. CEL2 released a carbenicillin amount between 22 and 63 mg/l, while CEL2GC release is in the range of 5 ÷ 60 mg/l. The pre-treated CEL2 samples released a carbenicillin amount variable between 2 and 85 mg/l depending on the pre-treatment time. This result is promising in view of antibacterial tests, which will be the object of future experimental work.</p>

<sec id="sec12-0885328212447665" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="sec13-0885328212447665"><title>In vitro bioactivity</title>
<p>The bioactivity test in SBF demonstrated the high reactivity of CEL2 and CEL2GC, since both materials are able to create, in few hours, a layer of silica gel on their surfaces. Nevertheless, differences in the thickness of silica gel layer and in the rate of bioactivity process steps have been noticed, as reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0885328212447665">Table 3</xref>. The bioactivity of CEL2 is slightly slower than its corresponding glass-ceramic (CEL2GC). This unusual feature is probably due to the residual amorphous phase of CEL2GC that is able to react more rapidly with SBF solution in comparison to the amorphous parent glass CEL2. In fact, in the residual amorphous phase, the ratio of modifier/former oxides shifts towards modifier oxides as the amorphous phase consists in a silica-based glass more rich in K<sup>+</sup> and phosphate ions than the parent CEL2 glass, allowing a faster bioactivity.</p>
<p>For this reason, up to 12 h CEL2 is in Step III, while the Step IV, i.e. the enrichment in calcium and phosphate ions, is observable only after 24 h. In the case of CEL2GC, this ions enrichment takes place already at 12 h of soaking. Moreover, the silica gel thickness is higher for CEL2GC, since it reaches about 8 µm after 12 h and grows up to 10 µm at 24 h time-point at which the thicknesses for CEL2 and CEL2GC becomes equivalent and both are enriched in calcium and phosphates, Step IV, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0885328212447665">Table 3</xref>). These observations can be useful to explain the different incorporation and release of carbenicillin by the CEL2 and CEL2GC surfaces.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-0885328212447665"><title>Antibiotic incorporation and release for pristine samples (CEL2 and CEL2GC)</title>
<p>Concerning the carbenicillin uptake, this antibiotic has been selected since it has a double bond site (carboxylic groups evidenced in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328212447665">Figure 1</xref>) able to increase the chances of success for the drug co-precipitation process. The carbenicillin uptake for 6 h appears not effective, while an uptake of 12 and 24 h lead to consistent antibiotic incorporation.</p>
<p>By comparing the uptake results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328212447665">Figure 4(a)</xref>) with the bioactivity tests ones, the amount of loaded (co-precipitated) carbenicillin can be justified by considering the different surface properties of both CEL2 and CEL2GC in the various steps of their reactivity when put in contact with the uptake solutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0885328212447665">Figure 8</xref>). The low amount of loaded carbenicillin after 6 h of uptake can be explained by assuming that at about 6 h treatment, the silanols present on CEL2 and CEL2GC surface begin to condensate, but they create a very thin silica gel layer, not sufficient for an effective antibiotic incorporation. On the contrary, after 12 and much more after 24 h of uptake, both materials showed a thick silica gel layer, able to incorporate a significant amount of carbenicillin. On equivalent time-frames of uptake, CEL2GC seems to incorporate a drug amount slightly higher than CEL2, probably for the ability of its residual amorphous phase to form a thicker silica gel layer quicker than CEL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0885328212447665">Figure 9</xref>). Nevertheless, the differences in uploaded carbenicillin are included in the standard deviations and so they are not very significant.

</fig></p>
<p>The carbenicillin release of pristine CEL2 and CEL2GC showed different behaviours for short and long leaching periods: it is almost neglectable during the first 6 h of water dipping, while a significant antibiotic release occurred at 12 h with an increase up to 24 h and then a decrease at 36 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0885328212447665">Figure 5(b)</xref>). The carbenicillin is probably released by means of a diffusion process across the silica gel layer: the drug amount released from CEL2 is slightly greater than the CEL2GC one, since the carbenicillin has to diffuse through a thinner silica gel layer. The antibiotic seems to re-precipitate at 36 h. This behaviour, observed on both CEL2 and CEL2GC, could be related to dissolution and re-precipitation processes of ionic species present in the gel-like layer (e.g. Ca<sup>++</sup>), which could involve also the carbenicillin already released. This hypothesis should be supported by further release tests up to longer time periods, which, however, are not compatible with the stability of carbenicillin at 37℃, which is only stable up to 3 days.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-0885328212447665"><title>Antibiotic incorporation and release for pre-treated samples (CEL2)</title>
<p>When the samples have been pre-treated in SBF, the antibiotic incorporation (uptake for 24 h) takes place on a different surface depending on the pre-treatment time, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0885328212447665">Figure 9</xref>. As previously reported, the 6 h pre-treatment leads to the worst carbenicillin amount in comparison with the other timeframes and more generally the pre-treatment did not show benefits in terms of material ability to incorporate the antibiotic.</p>
<p>On the basis of these results and also on the carbenicillin releases, three different typologies of uptake can be defined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0885328212447665">Figure 10</xref>): the first and the second are typical of samples that underwent a short-time pre-treatment (1 and 6 h). In particular (first typology), after 1 h of pre-treatment, it is possible that the antibiotic covalently bonds with free Si-OH groups exposed on glass surface (Step II of bioactivity process – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0885328212447665">Figure 10(a)</xref>). This could explain the good uptake (23%) after such a short pre-treatment (1 h) reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0885328212447665">Figure 6</xref>. On the contrary (second typology), after 6 h of pre-treatment, the silanos groups begin to condense into a silica gel layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0885328212447665">Figure 10(b)</xref>), being no longer receptive for drug direct bonding. However, the silica gel developed in 6 h is probably too thin to incorporate a significant amount of antibiotic by diffusion, explaining the observed lower uptake (4%—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0885328212447665">Figure 6</xref>).
<fig id="fig10-0885328212447665" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><p>Hypothesis of antibiotic bond for pre-treated CEL2 samples.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0885328212447665-fig10.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The third typology of uptake, reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0885328212447665">Figure 10(c)</xref>, is typical of long-time pre-treatments (12 and 24 h, with an uptake for 24 h) and it is characterised by a carbenicillin precipitation on a pre-formed silica gel layer (Steps III and IV of bioactivity). This is a classic impregnation not related to a direct chemical bond between the antibiotic and the glass although a bonding of carbenicillin with calcium ions, which precipitate during Step IV of bioactivity, cannot be excluded, as reported by some authors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328212447665">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>So, for long times pre-treated samples, as for pristine CEL2 and CEL2GC, the carbenicillin precipitates on a silica gel layer leading to the formation of an osteoconductive hydroxyapatite layer enriched with the chosen antibiotic.</p>
<p>The slight increase of incorporated antibiotic of the samples pre-treated for 24 h in comparison with those pre-treated for 12 h can be due to the increased silica gel thickness, but it is not significant, considering the standard deviations.</p>
<p>The release results of pre-treated CEL2 samples confirmed the hypotheses about the different typologies of uptake; indeed, 1 h pre-treated CEL2 showed a slow release and most of the carbenicillin was released after 36 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0885328212447665">Figure 7</xref>). This can be due to the formation of a strong covalent bond between the antibiotic and the free hydroxyl groups on CEL2 surface: all antibiotic can be released only if a break of chemical bond with Si-OH groups occurs.</p>
<p>The 6 h pre-treatment leads to the worst behaviour, both for uptake and release. After 6 h of SBF pre-treatment, few hydroxyl groups are available, since silica gel is forming on the glass surface. A drug incorporation by diffusion into the gel layer can be expected but, as this layer is very thin, it will not be able to incorporate a significant amount of carbenicillin. Moreover, this layer is not already enriched of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, which could promote a better carbenicillin precipitation by chemically attracting it. For these reasons, it can be expected that the antibiotic will be covalently bonded with the few remaining free Si-OH groups and that it will be completely released after 36 h.</p>
<p>As far as the 12 h pre-treated CEL2 samples are concerned, any antibiotic release was observed in the first hours of water dipping, while all the 85% of carbenicillin incorporated is released after 12 h. The percentage of released antibiotic decreases drastically at 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0885328212447665">Figure 7</xref>); probably a drug precipitation on calcium-enriched silica gel layer occurred (it might have been promoted by Ca<sup>++</sup> ions dissolution and re-precipitation phenomena, which can include a chemical bonding between Ca<sup>++</sup> ions and carbenicillin during their re-precipitation), and re-increases at 36 h, although not significantly considering the high standard deviations.</p>
<p>The same release trend was observed for 24 h pre-treated CEL2 samples, but in this case the released carbenicillin amount after 12 h is only 65% of the incorporated one and antibiotic re-precipitation does not occur. In fact, after 24 h of SBF pre-treatment, the formed silica gel layer is thicker than after 12 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0885328212447665">Figure 8</xref>). It can be assessed that the carbenicillin diffuses more slowly across the gel layer and, in turn, the release trend results are more gradual.</p>
<p>In summary, the release trends observed and achieved in this work were very different one from each other and can be explained taking into account the various steps of bioactivity of both CEL2 and CEL2GC. On this basis, a multiplicity of pre-treatment strategies can be used to load a proper amount of carbenicillin on their surface. Future efforts should be focused on the optimization of the pre-treatment and up-take steps, in order to promote a relevant amount of carbenicillin release at shorter times.</p>

<sec id="sec16-0885328212447665" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The glass (CEL2) and glass-ceramic (CEL2GC) characterized in this work are bioactive materials with a fast bioactivity kinetics; both materials are able to form a thick silica gel layer after soaking for few hours in SBF.</p>
<p>Carbenicillin can be easily incorporated into the silica gel layer by dipping the samples in SBF containing the chosen antibiotic. CEL2GC is able to incorporate a slightly greater amount of antibiotic and to release it more slowly than CEL2.</p>
<p>By a pre-treatment of CEL2 samples in SBF, a silica gel layer formed before the drug loading. Three incorporation mechanism have been individuated: the first one (CEL2 pre-treated for very short times) is related to a chemical bond with silanols exposed on the glass surface, the second one (pre-treatment for medium-short times) concerns the drug diffusion into a gel-like surface layer in competition with direct bonding with the residual free silanols, while the third one (CEL2 pre-treated for long times) foresees the precipitation of the antibiotic into the silica gel layer, probably assisted and enhanced by calcium ions attraction. The release trends confirmed the existence of these different uptake mechanisms, since the samples of the first two typologies, released almost all the antibiotic only after 36 h, while the third one began to release after 12 h and showed a more gradual trend. Finally, all samples, pre-treated and pristine released an antibiotic amount significantly higher than <italic>S. aureus</italic> MIC of carbenicillin.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this research work confirmed the possibility to effectively incorporate an antibiotic on a self-formed silanols/silica gel layer by overworking the bioactivity process which is characteristic of bioactive glasses and glass-ceramics. The choice of the proper uptake treatment depends on the release kinetics to be obtained, and thus on the clinical needs. In future works, a further optimization of the pre-treatment and uptake steps should be foreseen, in order to investigate the possibility of inducing a faster drug release during the first hours of contact with the leaching solution. After this optimization, it will be reasonable to investigate the release kinetic in a more complex solution (like SBF) as well as to evaluate the antibacterial properties of the modified materials with specific microbiological tests.</p>
