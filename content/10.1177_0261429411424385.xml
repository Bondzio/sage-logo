<abstract>
<p>The training of teachers for a meaningful use of all that contemporary technology offers to developing curriculum requires constant vigilance, experimentation, innovation, revision and updating. The lifestyle of today’s gifted students includes a range of ever-unfolding technologies, such as text messaging, blogging, social networking, personal webpages, video pods, streamed television, online textbooks, online knowledge base, web searching, presentation tools, desktop publishing, graphics infused in word processing, simulations and complex gaming. At the same time, the technology literacy of most teachers is in ‘catch-up mode’ with constant retraining about how to provide curricula that includes webquests, virtual field trips, virtual passports, interactive maps (Google Earth) and webliography (TrackStar), presented in diverse formats.</p>
<p>The following questions will be examined in this paper:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>How do you cross regional boundaries and local educational administration to provide a comprehensive state-wide teacher training system in gifted education?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>How do you differentiate teacher training in gifted education that uses appropriate methods, strategies and best practices in teaching gifted students?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>How do you incorporate the daily technology needs and uses of gifted students into training their teachers?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>How can you provide teacher training that is independent of time and space to reach teachers beyond their classroom yet make it directly applicable?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>How do you structure a system of accountability that meets state and national standards for gifted education?</p>
</list-item>
</list></p>
<p>In the state of Florida, USA, a three-tiered comprehensive approach provides online training and certification to teachers at the state level, through the WOGI (Working on Gifted Issues) project, at the district level that builds on Florida State Training Modules for local relevance, and at the university level that can be incorporated into a graduate Master’s degree with a specialization in gifted education.</p>

<title>Professional development conceptual model: state of Florida, USA. Why the need for state training of teachers of the gifted?</title>
<p>Florida statute, section 1012.07, requires that the State Board of Education in Florida annually identify critical teacher shortage areas. This list of shortage areas is used in implementing the Critical Teacher Shortage Tuition Reimbursement Program and the Critical Teacher Shortage Student Loan Forgiveness Program. The Rule 6A 20.0131(2) Florida Administrative Code (FAC) further provides that:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>On or before 1 December of each year, the Commissioner shall recommend to the State Board for approval the specific teaching areas and high-priority locations in which critical teacher shortages are projected for the public schools during the year following the academic year in which approval is made.</italic>
</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>In accordance with procedures approved by the Commissioner, a list of critical teacher shortage areas shall be prepared based on consideration of current supply and demand information related to Florida public school instructional personnel including, but not limited to:
<list list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item>
<p>(a) the number and percentage of vacant positions in each teaching discipline;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>(b) the number and percentage of positions filled by teachers not certified in the appropriate field; and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>(c) the projected annual supply of graduates of state approved Florida teacher education programs for each discipline.</p>
</list-item>
</list></p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Based on the information outlined above, all exceptional student education programs are designated by the State Board of Education as critical teacher shortage areas for 2010–11. In fact, since 1992, exceptional student education programs have been continually listed as critical teacher shortage areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0261429411424385">Office of Research and Evaluation, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In the fall of 2008, the Department of Education surveyed the school districts to determine the number of teaching positions filled from 1 July to 1 October. Survey results provided two indicators of fields currently facing critical shortages: (1) the number of new hires as a percentage of teachers in each field and (2) the number of positions filled by teachers who lack appropriate certification. The data indicate that there were 77 new hires out of the estimated number of 2,224 teachers for the critical teacher shortage area in gifted or 3.5% of the total number. Of those 77 new hires, 31 were hired out of field. Thus, 40% of the teachers hired to teach gifted were not certified. This was the highest number in all exceptional student education areas (e.g. handicapped, visually impaired, autistic) and was only exceeded by middle/junior/senior high basic reading at 53%. It was noted in the data that principals sometimes filled such positions with experienced subject area teachers who lack coursework in gifted, but who may complete the requirements for gifted endorsement. Finally, 22% of teachers currently teaching gifted students are not certified. Additional data from the 2007–08 teacher education program completers indicate that about one-quarter of the teachers trained in gifted have completed coursework in the state university system, almost one-half in the community college system and one-third in a district alternative certification program. These data do not include returning teachers and teachers moving from one district to another. The projected need for teachers in gifted represents only 21% in 2010–11 based on the projected number of program completers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0261429411424385">Office of Research and Evaluation, 2009</xref>). Implications from these data support the need for increased teacher training of gifted educators across the state of Florida.</p>

<sec id="section2-0261429411424385">
<title>How can more teachers be trained state-wide?</title>
<p>Working on Gifted Issues (WOGI) is a state project funded through the legislature and the Florida Department of Education (FLDOE) to provide technical assistance to regional programs for gifted and district coordinators. The project was initiated in 1996 as a collaboration between the FLDOE and a designated university, currently the University of North Florida. The purpose of the WOGI project is to provide professional development and technical assistance for district coordinators of the gifted to improve the teacher quality and academic achievement for students who are gifted. This includes providing a continual development and revision of the five required endorsement modules for teachers of the gifted, as identified in the rule stated below.</p>
<p>Rule 6A-4.01791, FAC establishes specialization requirements for gifted endorsement –academic class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261429411424385">Florida Department of the State, 1992</xref>). The requirement is for a bachelor’s or higher degree with certification in an academic class coverage and completion of three semester hours each in five courses in gifted education:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>nature and needs of gifted students</italic> to include student characteristics; cognitive, social and emotional needs; and history and current research;</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>
<italic>curriculum and instructional strategies for teaching gifted students</italic> to include modification of curriculum content, instructional process, student products and learning environment;</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>guidance and counseling of gifted students</italic> to include motivation, self-image, interpersonal skills and career options for gifted students;</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>
<italic>educating special populations of gifted students</italic> such as minorities, underachievers, handicapped, economically disadvantaged and highly gifted to include student characteristics and programmatic adaptations; and</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>theory and development of creativity</italic> to include elements of creativity such as fluency, flexibility, originality and elaboration.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>In 2002–03, the WOGI project initiated the revision of these five endorsement courses that had been in existence for over 10 years. Over the next several years, the courses were edited or revised and offered to teachers through local school districts throughout the state. Each course was designed for 60 contact hours. The modules were disseminated in hard copies and then eventually made available on compact discs.</p>
<p>By 2005–06, it was determined by the WOGI project that more teachers could be trained if the modules were offered as online classes that could then be applied toward district continuing education credit. At that time several issues were considered:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Did the WOGI project have enough funds to support the initial development of online courses?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Did the WOGI project have access to facilities and resources for the online development and design?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Could the WOGI project continue to support the course offerings on a yearly basis?</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>It was fortunate that ‘yes’ was an answer to each of the concerns listed, but only as long as funds were allocated to the project each year. In addition, as time went by, several modules became outdated. This included the <italic>Curriculum and Instructional Strategies for Teaching Gifted Students</italic>, which needed to reference both Rule 6A-6.030191, FAC, which sets criteria for development of educational plans (EPs) for students who are gifted, and the <italic>Florida’s Frameworks for K-12 Gifted Learners </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0261429411424385">Weber et al., 2007</xref>), which provides guidelines supporting a challenging and rigorous curriculum that enhances the state standards.</p>
<p>Finally, in the spring of 2007, the<italic> Nature and Needs of Gifted Students </italic>module<italic> was </italic>offered as an online course. Because it was considered a pilot course, it was first offered at no cost to teachers whose counties were considered part of the Institute for Small and Rural Districts (ISRD). Three more courses were developed and offered online during 2006–10. Currently, the <italic>Guidance and Counseling of Gifted Students </italic>course is being developed as an online course. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0261429411424385">Table 1</xref> represents the courses offered and number of participants completing the classes through the WOGI project. Project funds were used to help pay for the cost of online development and course facilitators’ fees. It is also important to note that required texts for the courses were made available to participants on a loan basis process. Each course costs participants approximately $240 and is applied toward district continuing education.</p>

<p>During 2009–10, the project has been able to fund two courses during each of summer, fall and spring. With data supporting the need for training teachers to work with gifted students, the project has been able to provide the opportunities necessary to decrease the number of teachers not certified in the appropriate field and the new hires teaching out of field. It will be interesting to note these changes as reported in the next data gathered by the Florida Department of Education (FLDOE) Office of Research and Evaluation. In addition, the course evaluation data collected have been positive as far as relevancy to the profession and preparation for working with gifted students. Both course interface (e.g. the course was easy to navigate; the online course tools were useful and engaging; I was comfortable with technology) and course content are continually evaluated for effectiveness. With continued funding of the project for 2010–11, it is anticipated that teachers could complete the five endorsement courses within a year. Additional data are being collected to include information about reasons why teachers are enrolling (newly hired teacher teaching gifted out of field; currently teaching gifted and out of field; a personal interest in obtaining gifted endorsement; a professional interest in obtaining gifted endorsement), which course(s) are still needed to obtain the gifted endorsement and whether the course is the final course needed to obtain gifted endorsement.</p>

<title>Other state-wide professional development opportunities supported through technology</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261429411424385">Fine (1994</xref>: 5–6) notes that<disp-quote>
<p>Technologies can support and broaden professional learning communities and help teachers make better use of their time. Through a range of technologies, e.g. the Internet and video- and audioconferencing, teachers can access both instructional resources and collegial networks.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Web-based professional learning resources can provide the ‘just-in-time’ training, thus allowing for flexible access to professional development resources. This is one of the main reasons educators are turning to online resources for professional development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0261429411424385">Devaney, 2007</xref>). After another initiative of the WOGI project, the <italic>Florida Frameworks for K-12 Gifted Learners</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0261429411424385">Weber et al., 2007</xref>) was developed, the process of providing state-wide professional development opportunities that supported this curricular reform was also needed. Consequently, select professional development activities were transferred into digital formats enabling educators to use them at all different times. To increase usability of the multimedia presentations, the video files were converted into several different formats and then placed online at the WOGI website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.unfwogi.com">www.unfwogi.com</ext-link>). The formats include online video (.mpg), Windows Media (.wmv), Flash video (.swf), audio (.mp3) and enhanced video podcast (.mp4). Multiple formats were chosen to facilitate educators’ access to the presentations using formats with which they were familiar or comfortable. Users now can access the files viewing online video on their computer (e.g. using Windows Media Player), or downloading to podcasts or to portable MP3/MP4 players. Recently, a professional development module, ‘Understanding and Using the Florida Frameworks for K-12 Learners’, was developed and includes a PowerPoint presentation and activities, thus presenting an opportunity to further substantiate professional development across the state.</p>
<p>Finally, another initiative for 2009–10 was to provide support to parents of gifted children. This also has been accomplished through the use of technology as a way to reach many parents. An expert in counseling parents of gifted children has written a series of questions and answers (Q&amp;As), which are posted at the WOGI website. In addition, five enhanced podcasts relating specifically to parents are being developed and posted on the website and will include topics such as introducing the five domains of giftedness, whether giftedness is innate and may (or may not) be shown through performance, asynchrony across domains and examining the ‘overexcitabilities’. While purposely developed for parents, these podcasts can be downloaded by teachers who are novice to the field of gifted or by those needing a reminder about the characteristics of gifted children.</p>

<title>Endorsement Certificate in Gifted Education in Hillsborough County Public Schools, Florida</title>
<p>As previously noted, the Florida Department of Education mandates endorsement of teachers who teach gifted students. The endorsement includes the completion of five courses. Since mid-2000, Hillsborough County Public Schools (SDHC) has used the internally developed online gifted endorsement program to deliver the endorsement courses and prepare teachers of gifted students with the knowledge and skills necessary for success in the gifted classroom.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0261429411424385">
<title>SDHC gifted endorsement goals</title>
<p>While the primary goals of the online endorsement program are to meet the requirements of the Florida Department of Education for the endorsement of teachers who serve gifted students and to improve the performance of teachers of the gifted, the courses also serve to move the district forward in accomplishing the overall goals of the district’s gifted program. These goals include identifying potential giftedness, especially among underrepresented populations, meeting the learning needs of gifted students of all ages through a differentiated curriculum designed to focus on learning strengths, and enhancing the capacity of teachers who serve gifted students through training, support and leadership development opportunities.</p>
<p>As the district’s student population has increased, so has the demand for endorsed teachers of the gifted. Since 2001, when the ‘live’, face-to-face endorsement courses were discontinued except during the summertime, the online program has been the district’s primary means of training gifted teachers. During the 2004–05 school year, approximately 25 teachers participated in each of 14 online endorsement course sections, a total of approximately 350 teachers. During the 2009–10 school year, 23 online endorsement course sections were offered, with approximately 25 teachers completing each course, a total of more than 550 course completions. To accommodate the enormous demand for online endorsement course participation in the district, five terms of online courses are offered each year. During the summer, endorsement courses are offered in both an online format and a ‘live’ format.</p>
<p>An annual needs assessment is conducted in the early spring to determine the perceived need for online courses for the coming school year. After the initial planning of the endorsement training calendar, it is sometimes necessary to add an additional section of a given course because of high demand. Up to two sections of each online course may run concurrently, with 30 teachers enrolled in each course section.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0261429411424385">
<title>Structure of endorsement courses</title>
<p>All online gifted endorsement courses are run through the district’s intranet using the ‘First Class’ software, ‘IDEAS’. As all district personnel must become familiar with First Class for day-to-day communication, there is minimal training required for teachers to learn to successfully navigate the online endorsement learning environment.</p>
<p>Each course is scheduled for an 8-week period. During the first week of each online term, an in-person ‘help’ session is offered to support teachers who are taking their first online endorsement course. The purpose of the differentiated help session is to provide an overview of the IDEAS online learning environment and offer personalized assistance based on the level of support needed by the individual teacher. Once teachers are familiar with the online learning environment, they may successfully navigate each of the online courses.</p>
<p>Courses are organized around six 1-week online learning sessions comprising required readings, group reflections, independent assignments and a 1-hour synchronous discussion led by the instructor. A textbook is not required as participants access up-to-date articles and other web-based resources directly through electronic subscriptions provided by the district. A plethora of district-specific resources are accessible through the IDEAS intranet. Rubrics are provided for each course so that participants may self-assess their own learning products.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0261429411424385">
<title>Differentiated learning</title>
<p>Learning experiences within each course are specifically designed to address the required objectives for the state’s endorsement courses and to move the district forward in accomplishing the goals of the gifted program. During the online courses, participants are asked to identify and address real problems at their school sites through the development and implementation of action plans, collaboration with others, and the creation and sharing of products and presentations. Differentiation is built into each course as participants have frequent choice of their learning options.</p>
<p>Each online course includes a follow-up assignment to extend the learning from the online sessions. Each course offers several choices of follow-up assignments allowing teachers a differentiated learning experience. Among the follow-up options are: creating and sharing a faculty presentation, reading and summarizing a related book, subscribing to a gifted journal, creating a website, attending a related training or webinar and creating an action plan. Teachers are also encouraged to design their own follow-up option based upon their personal professional development needs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0261429411424385">
<title>Interactivity and individualization</title>
<p>The district’s online gifted endorsement courses are designed as a blend of pedagogy, technology and organizational support, and are characterized by collaboration, interactivity and relevant content.</p>
<p>Because the course design, level of interactivity and instructional approaches of the online instructor and the characteristics of the individual learner are significant factors in the effectiveness of online learning, the courses are in a continual state of modification and improvement. Each course is modified annually; readings and websites are updated for relevance, assignments are modified based upon instructor and participant feedback, and more advanced technology including podcasts and video clips are included and linked, all in an effort to improve the effectiveness of the online learning experience.</p>
<p>Hillsborough’s online gifted courses are designed to be people-focused and may actually allow for greater interaction than face-to-face courses as participants have opportunities for learner to instructor interactions, learner to content interactions and learner to learner interactions. Course instructors guide learners through weekly online discussions, provide personalized feedback to all assignments, and respond to all emails from individual teachers. Learners may work at their own pace through online readings and assignments within the framework of the online sessions and explore in depth areas of interest. Each online discussion is archived and available for learners to review. Learners respond to one another through both the weekly synchronous discussions and reflections led by the instructor.</p>

<sec id="section9-0261429411424385">
<title>Professional development of instructors</title>
<p>Because instructors of the online courses require specialized preparation in order to develop the necessary skills to support online learners in the endorsement courses, they have specific qualifications and also participate in regular professional development to target their skills as facilitators of online learning. Online facilitators must have knowledge of the subject matter, expertise in teaching and must possess skills in effective online communication.</p>
<p>To qualify as an online gifted endorsement instructor in Hillsborough, individuals must have a Master’s degree, hold the gifted endorsement, have experience as a teacher of gifted students and complete a defined instructor training program. Endorsement instructor training is similar to a multilevel internship whereby there is exposure to all aspects of facilitating the courses and a gradual increase in responsibility and involvement in teaching. Instructors-in-training shadow both a face-to-face course and at least one 8-week online course prior to facilitating a course independently.</p>
<p>To support the development of the necessary skills for success as an online instructor, an online faculty handbook has been developed and is provided to all course instructors. The handbook includes procedural information as well as tools to support online communication so that instructors may move learning beyond the transmission of content to the construction of meaning.</p>
<p>Ongoing professional development for instructors includes semi-monthly endorsement faculty meetings. Some faculty meetings are online meetings held in a course chatroom. During faculty meetings, instructors reflect upon course successes and make suggestions for improvements. Periodically, instructors are asked to examine and evaluate the level of interactions in their online discussions and set goals for improved communications. Other training experiences include examining new technologies to be added to the online courses.</p>
<p>Collaboration among the instructor cadre is essential for the success of the online courses. Instructors share ideas and instructional strategies for making online learning meaningful for teachers. They share anecdotal information about participants so that necessary support may be provided. Instructors support one another by acting as online substitutes for one another when necessary.</p>
<p>In Hillsborough County Public Schools, online learning provides a successful framework to support the professional development of an enormous number of teachers so that they may better address the needs of the district’s gifted students and move the district forward in accomplishing the goals of the gifted program.</p>

<title>Graduate Certificate in Gifted Education and degree programs, University of Central Florida</title>
<p>As well as serving the local and state community in offering a Certificate in Gifted Education, the university model incorporates these online courses into a graduate Master’s degree program. Some of the challenges that this program faces are how to bridge higher level research that would stimulate advanced study with local endorsement standards; how to incorporate national standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261429411424385">NCATE/NAGC/CEC, 2007</xref>) but also incorporate international perspectives; how to infuse multicultural perspectives and a focus on critical issues into creative and critical assignment outcomes of relevance to each teacher’s context; how to cross cultural and international boundaries and educational systems to provide global teacher training in gifted education; and how to foster and develop teacher leaders in the field of gifted education.</p>
<p>The gifted education program at the (UCF) Central Florida incorporates the perspectives, strategies, motivations and technology of a ‘conceptual age’. As clarified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0261429411424385">Pink (2006)</xref>, the new skills of intelligence include design, story, symphony, empathy, play and meaning. In this program, these new skills are challenged in online learning that takes account of what a contemporary and future learning environment should offer in relation to Eastern <italic>and </italic>Western perspectives, the <italic>abundance</italic> of information accessible instantly and the trend to <italic>automation</italic> with a resultant focus on creative and critical thinking, action and production (new technologies identified by Pink, 2006).</p>

<p>This is a Conceptual Model of the Gifted Education Program. The square represents the course Understanding Gifted and Talented Students. If we open this gift box, we observe the unique characteristics of giftedness that can be identified in these students that generate a need for an appropriate educational plan. The triangle represents the course Program Planning and Methodology for gifted and talented students which shows the interaction of student, teacher and curriculum in differentiating learning activities, and developing strategies and skills. The pie represents the course ‘Education of Special Populations of Gifted Students’ indicating the diverse pieces of the pie in an age of changing demographics and the search for equity and excellence. The circle represents the course ‘Guidance and Counseling of Gifted and Talented Individuals’. This shows the self and identity of the gifted student who has unique socio-emotional needs. The graphic represents the course ‘The Nature and Development of Creativity’. This is your chance to explore theories and research about the creative person and process as you explore your own creativity as a future teacher of gifted and talented students. Courses are fully online, web-based and follow a cycle: in the Fall EGI6051 (Understanding) and EGI 6245 (Curriculum) are offered and in the Spring EGI6246 (Special Populations) and SDS 6426 (Counseling) and over the Summer EGI6305 (Creativity).</p>

</p>
<p>While the program is structured to meet state and national standards, it also offers elective courses to students who have specialized interests, such as counselor education, art or music education, business management or any other field where challenging individuals to reach their highest potential and creative productivity are prized.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section17-0261429411424385">
<title>Differentiation</title>
<p>As with gifted education programs, the teacher/instructor takes on the role of facilitator by clarifying objectives and key concepts, providing core information in online modules that can be compacted, establishing levels of mastery, and then presenting options for higher level projects and learning activities. UCF offers online tutorials and individual support and guidance in managing the tools and skills required by the blackboard format that is used, and within each course a ‘tour guide’ walks students through each tool and how it relates to course expectations. Students are expected to manage their own time and study to complete options and consult evaluation rubrics that clearly identify expectations. They are guided to collaborate and communicate with other students/teachers through chats, bulletin board postings and paired or grouped projects. This also allows for an examination of issues in depth that can lead to independent research in areas that may be a focal interest for further graduate study. One student completed a module on twice-exceptional students, followed by a case study of a student with Asperger’s syndrome; a research paper on this subject was then formulated into a journal article for <italic>Gifted Education International</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0261429411424385">Horn, 2009</xref>). This spurred an interest in research in this area, leading to a doctoral dissertation on the subject. In addition to the standard UCF Student Perception of Instruction course evaluation, the evaluative process includes self-evaluation through rubrics and reflections and the development of an e-portfolio to present evidence of having met, and in many cases exceeded, competencies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0261429411424385">
<title>Diverse perspectives</title>
<p>The development of empathy, or an understanding of the cultural relativity that places each gifted student in their cultural, social, ethnic and ethical context, is essential for teachers of the gifted. A key characteristic of gifted students is their concern with critical issues and a need to examine injustice and inequity within the context of global responsibility and citizenship. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0261429411424385">Wallace and Eriksson (2006)</xref> identified the core issues, strategies and best practices in multicultural and global gifted education – these are infused throughout the coursework in this program. Teachers learn how to model ‘intercultural intelligence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261429411424385">Eriksson, 2006</xref>) 2006 by developing competence in the:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>cognitive area – understanding code-switching from one context to another; experiencing diverse cultures, contexts and continents; reading local, national and international news, books, literature and websites that display ethnic perspectives;</p>

<list-item>
<p>affective area – understanding their own cultural framework and re-examining their own stereotypes and prejudices; sharing their personal strengths and unique achievements; validating marginalized groups and celebrating their unique talents and abilities; and the</p>

<p>behavioral area – infusing culturally responsive learning; creating learning options that develop problem-solving on issues related to overcoming racism, sexism, ageism, religious tolerance; and stimulating conflict resolution through scenarios and role play.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>These perspectives are embedded in a curriculum that examines issues of global citizenship and ethical and social action. While a specific course addresses special populations, the whole program integrates equity issues and global education. One student (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0261429411424385">Tweed, 2009</xref>) developed a program entitled YWIG – Young Women in Gifted:<disp-quote>
<p>The goal of Young Women in Gifted is to match middle school gifted girls with college students currently enrolled in educational degree programs seeking gifted certifications. In service-learning, students will implement curricula based on the TASC model that emphasizes problem-solving and leadership within a social context.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0261429411424385">
<title>Communication and information</title>
<p>The establishing of an online community in a conceptual age requires training in the use of tools familiar to most gifted students, such as chats, blogs, video pods, web searches, web quests, social networks and virtual meetings. Specific applications, such as Skype and Second Life take this a step further in creating online meetings in which teachers interact with each other around course content or work collaboratively on issues, assignments or the planning of lessons, units or whole programs. To create this sense of community online there needs to be time to interact around stimulating enrichment topics that are not being assessed. In this program each course includes an OPEN forum or blog where current events, displays, performances, ideas, articles or viewpoints are presented. Students can also create their own discussion threads around any topic of relevance to the course. In an analysis of past online coursework over 5 years in this program, the number of interactions around this OPEN forum far exceeds the number of interactions around structured coursework. This is not a surprising result as these types of social interactions mirror those found in Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and other social networks. The teachers in these courses therefore become generators rather than consumers of information – a paradigm shift from the notion of the traditional role of the teacher.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0261429411424385">
<title>Teacher products and performances</title>
<p>Within this program, teachers either choose from a range of possible assignment options or create their own in areas of their own needs, interests, research possibilities or programs. Throughout the program teachers complete activities designed to support them in implementing a program. Beyond this, however, they are encouraged to design innovative strategies, enrichment units, acceleration and integrative curricula based on sound theories, models and best practices in gifted education. Some examples of these creative assignment outcomes include:</p>

<title>The optimal match – educational plans for teachers of the gifted</title>
<p>The UCF approach models best practices for educating gifted and talented students by structuring the program to demonstrate these. Before each course, students can demonstrate their previous knowledge and skills. This identification also includes exposure to diverse forms of assessment, and opportunities for teachers to identify their own interests, abilities, characteristics and personal and professional needs in a range of questionnaires, reflective activities, goal setting and choices in planning their own learning from a range of options. While each course covers core content and generates questions to spur higher level research and interaction with others, it demands the setting of goals, self-management and self-monitoring. It includes a system of scaffolding that presents accelerating intellectual demands, setting high expectations. At the same time a range of resources is available to assist in skill development with templates, web links, examples and personal consultations through online chats.</p>
<p>One comment made by a teacher of the gifted (who was a gifted student himself) was: ‘This is the hardest course I have ever taken, but thank you, it was the best, the most dynamic, powerful and rewarding! It has spurred me on to complete a doctoral degree.’ It does require a paradigm shift for teachers who are used to a traditional method and enter the program with the notion that they will merely complete prescribed reading, answer questions, write exams and write papers with largely predetermined or ‘model answer’ content. Within each course, learning tasks and assignments are chosen by students, who then document and include evidence of the skills and competencies they have developed across the five courses in a ‘gifted education professional portfolio’ that includes self-evaluation and a series of reflections.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0261429411424385">
<title>Challenges</title>
<p>As with any online program, the technology competence of the incoming students varies considerably, as does their background knowledge of the field. Some students are beginning teachers, others have completed gifted education courses out of state and others have completed district courses not accredited at the graduate level. Students who are used to a face-to-face course may struggle with the perceived anonymity online and may fail to contribute authentically to forms of communication. Students may confuse online learning modules that replace the regular classroom sessions with assignments that extend content into focused study. Students may not use effective time and study management, or skim over content without concentrated examination of issues. Administrative challenges relate to finding faculty trained in the full use of technology as well as gifted education, differentiating the course content for graduate study beyond that provided at the district level and linking the coursework to further doctoral study programs. The program uses a comprehensive evaluation system. Regular UCF course evaluations are examined, as well as the e-portfolio reflections and modifications made constantly to ensure relevance and meet the overall objectives. Future challenges include how to manage course presentation to an international audience anywhere and creating cohorts for specific independent schools or associations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0261429411424385">
<title>The promise of the future</title>
<p>In conclusion, as these three tiers evolve, how best to work together to further the interests and education of gifted students throughout the state of Florida and beyond is of the utmost importance. We already have interactive blackboards, assistive attention devices, instant access to information and individuals, individualized virtual learning programs, online textbooks, and learning through games and virtual field trips. Future trends such as a textbook-free campus, smart systems that link communication devices, online learning centers and resources, implanted communication devices and global partnerships with underdeveloped countries are on the horizon. Creating meaningful online teacher training and simulations that allow teachers to experience the very conditions, motivations, and aspirations of gifted students so that they can then create dynamic curricula for their own students is one of the greatest challenges.</p>
