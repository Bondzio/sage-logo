<abstract>
<p>The micro credit-based development programme working through self-help groups (SHGs) is an initiative whose basic premise is that the empowerment of women can be achieved through economically gainful activities. The lack of access to financial resources is considered to be one of the main reasons for the patriarchal subjection and subjugation of women as well as their low status in family and society. However, empowerment thus achieved or claimed to have been achieved through SHG initiatives may do more to enhancing the bargaining power of women within the existing system of male hegemony, thereby not only acknowledging but also strengthening it—the same unequal, hierarchical, masculine, biased system that SHGs are said to free women from. Using ethnographic field data undertaken in the city of Delhi, the present article examines some of the paradoxes in the practices of micro credit.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>With the Indian government’s explicit adoption of financial policies of liberalisation and privatisation and the shift in its welfare role from one of intervention to that of facilitator, women-focused thrift and credit collectives, otherwise called self-help groups (SHGs), have gained wide popularity—both as a measure of poverty eradication and for the empowerment of women. Claiming to have combined both financial and non-financial developmental purposes, they became idealised by the advocates of mainstream and alternative development<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0971521513482219">1</xref></sup> and by feminist activist/scholars<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0971521513482219">2</xref></sup> alike. However, while the very dominant ideologies of capitalism and patriarchy (within which the neoliberal development paradigm is constructed and practised) have proven to be exploitative, exclusionary and marginalising, one question has to be asked: does this strategy of integrating the victims of a particular social order within that very social order, even if in a more ‘advantageous/efficient’ way, yield the desired result—the empowerment of women—or does it merely equip them to survive within the same system, which is the root cause of their marginalisation? Can we then call such a situation women’s empowerment at all? This article attempts to gauge the intricacies of these issues in the context of the practice of SHGs in Delhi.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0971521513482219">3</xref></sup> It is an outcome of doctoral research<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0971521513482219">4</xref></sup> on SHGs operating in select localities<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0971521513482219">5</xref></sup> in the National Capital Region of Delhi. The SHGs chosen for the study are organised by four different NGOs<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0971521513482219">6</xref></sup> and are operational in different slum settlements/resettlement colonies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0971521513482219">7</xref></sup> The poorest urban slums or resettlement colonies are broadly characterised as being very thickly populated, with families often occupying a one-room accommodation with very poor infrastructural facilities, no public toilet and drainage facilities, and so on. So-called urban villages—which also characterise the city of Delhi—are usually relatively better-off in terms of the economic status of the occupants as well as infrastructural facilities.</p>

<title>Discourses on SHGs</title>
<p>Self-help groups<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0971521513482219">8</xref></sup> are generally understood in the context of group-based ‘informal’ delivery of credit to the ‘economically weaker sections’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0971521513482219">9</xref></sup> of society. They typically involve providing relatively small amounts of thrift and credit to the poor, in order to raise income levels and improve their living standards. Although SHGs are variously depicted as civil society institutions of the poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0971521513482219">Fernandez, 2007</xref>), cooperatives in all aspects but name and legal status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0971521513482219">Harper, 2005</xref>), and so on, for the state they are the instruments for mass poverty alleviation and the empowerment of women as they primarily target women from poor households. Over the last decade, SHGs have been brought to the centrestage. This has gone hand in hand with specific macro-economic policies and corresponding economic and social measures for the restructuring of the economy, which has effectively shifted the onus of welfare from the state to people themselves.</p>
<p>Although SHGs are widely prevalent across the country in varying forms and have different dynamics according to contextual specificities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0971521513482219">Kabeer, 2005</xref>), much of the popular literature projects a uniform picture. A common perception is that an SHG is composed of a group of individuals (not more than 20) who, by free association,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0971521513482219">10</xref></sup> come together for a common collective purpose. These members are known to each other, coming from the same village, community or neighbourhood. That is, they are a homogenous group with pre-existing social bonds. They encourage members to make small and regular savings which become ‘low’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0971521513482219">11</xref></sup> interest loans that are rotated amongst the members through self-generated norms. The joint liability, peer monitoring and peer pressure that get built into the organisational structure are identified as the key features that then address the critical problems of screening (of potential defaulters), incentives (for borrowing and repayment) and enforcement (compelling repayment) at reduced transaction costs to the lenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0971521513482219">Kalpana, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The purpose of promoting SHGs may be different for different agencies. For the poor, SHGs may be a platform for collectively addressing their common problems. Many lent their support as a potential means for women’s empowerment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0971521513482219">Sharma, 2004</xref>). Others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0971521513482219">Narendranath, 2001</xref>) believe that:
<disp-quote>
<p>… the SHG is also a forum for solidarity<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0971521513482219">12</xref></sup> and empowerment of women, providing them the space and voice to negotiate and participate as equals both within the family and in society in general, playing three roles simultaneously: mutual help and internal financial mediation; external financial mediation; and empower women to make demands on the external world.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Strategies of SHGs could, in principle, serve to empower them both individually and collectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0971521513482219">Kabeer, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>The Evolution of SHGs: A Historical Trajectory</title>
<p>Mostly functioning outside the formal<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0971521513482219">13</xref></sup> channels of credit delivery as a mechanism for credit disbursal, SHGs have witnessed massive expansion in recent decades across the globe. Some believe that SHGs need to be seen as the natural evolution of the development strategies of participation that were built on the practices of ‘chit funds’ among the rural poor within affinity groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0971521513482219">Vijayakumar, 2009</xref>). Yet, one needs to gauge whether a link can be made between such possible pre-modern origins with its definition as an affinity group and the contemporary context within which it received a renewed upsurge.</p>

<sec id="section4-0971521513482219">
<title>The Socio-cultural History: Evidence from Anthropological/Sociological Studies</title>
<p>There are quite a number of anthropological studies (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0971521513482219">Firth, 1959</xref>) which show that exchange of credit or consumption lending (though non-monetary and in a most rudimentary form) was widespread in kinship-based primitive/traditional societies. Despite the flourishing of productive credit as time advanced, the community-based exchange of consumption credit in its various forms has been thriving without interruption. These arrangements were generally made on the basis of mutual trust. Explicitly or otherwise, these were often viewed as obligations to support relatives and fulfil their requests; for example, acts which were more often reciprocal as well as relative to one’s social and financial status. Within such myriad community expectations and rules of reciprocity, some have traced it as having a direct impact on business management both as symbolic of socio-cultural ties as well as having financial value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0971521513482219">Guerin, 2006</xref>). Re-injecting cash income into the community as an investment which can be withdrawn at a time of pressing need also helps to maintain a community network. Invoking family and community ties to pool financial resources in times of contingencies like marriage or death is common in traditional societies as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0971521513482219">Aiyappan, 1965</xref>). Thus, the practice of informal finances interlinked with socio-cultural community ties is nothing new. However, the attached value is what is at stake in modern societies compared to traditional ones. In traditional societies the informal finances were more instrumental in maintaining community ties, whereas in its modern incarnation it is perhaps the other way around.</p>

<title>The Institutional History</title>
<p>Institutionally as well, extending credit to the poor has a definite history<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0971521513482219">14</xref></sup> and may be traced to the formal credit disbursal efforts of the state. In India, government policies have been built around the premise that rural regeneration is possible by increasing the flow of agricultural credit, thereby addressing underdevelopment and poverty. Providing loans for agricultural activities has a long history. The ‘taccavi’ loans for agricultural credit at low interest rates started in the late 18th century. The colonial administration enacted the <italic>Deccan Agricultural Debtor’s Relief Act</italic> in 1879 to rein in debt and tenancy. Although there are records of the operationalisation of the earliest cooperative society towards the end of the 19th century, it was only in the early 20th century that a legislative framework was put in place for the purpose (<italic>Cooperative Credit Societies Act</italic>, 1904). Stressing thrift and mutual help, this Act encouraged small cooperative societies to meet the short-term credit needs of farmers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0971521513482219">Karmakar, 1999</xref>, p. 46). Various committees were also constituted from time to time,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0971521513482219">15</xref></sup> both before and after Independence, to study the problems of agricultural credit. Although the presence of the cooperative sector in extending credit to the poor was noticeable, the presence of formal institutional agencies like commercial banks was negligible. Yet, the largest share of rural credit was from informal sources.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0971521513482219">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 1972, the definition of priority sectors was formalised to include agriculture and allied activities, small-scale and cottage industries. In 1980–1981, the Indian government set up the Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP) to route subsidised loans to poor self-employed people through the banking sector. In the following year the government established the Development of Women and Children in Rural Areas (DWCRA) scheme as a subsector of IRDP to enable poor women to take up income-generating activity by providing a revolving fund to groups of 15 to 20 women. Another major impetus to rural credit was provided by the establishment of the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) through an Act of parliament in 1982. The formal sector took the initiative to develop a supplementary credit delivery mechanism by encouraging institutional arrangements outside the financial system, like SHGs, with NGOs acting as facilitators or intermediaries. The beginning was made with NABARD’s pilot project in Karnataka. In the initial period in 1992–1993, just 255 SHGs were linked to banks. The SHG–bank linkage<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0971521513482219">17</xref></sup> programme got consolidated with the expanding SHG movement led by the NGO<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0971521513482219">18</xref></sup> sector in the country. It is evident therefore that extending credit socio-culturally or institutionally is not new and has been in place from historical times. However, micro credit-based SHGs as (in)formal institutional mechanisms for meeting the financial needs of the poor emerged in an institutional vacuum<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0971521513482219">19</xref></sup> and has been the outcome if not creation of the structural adjustment programmes and financial liberalisation and privatisation policies the world over. Their emergence must be seen against the backdrop of the failure of the formal institutional framework in providing credit to the rural poor due to their ‘supply’-led systems<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0971521513482219">20</xref></sup> and their inability to bring credit to the poor due to various structural, operational and cultural hurdles,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0971521513482219">21</xref></sup> leading to a high level of default in loan repayment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0971521513482219">Fernandez, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0971521513482219">Satish, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0971521513482219">Swaminathan, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Microcredit in Feminist Discourses</title>
<p>Feminist interventions within the sphere of microcredit have been numerous and complex, ranging from questions of equity to those of efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0971521513482219">Moser, 1989</xref>). In all the views expressed there has been considerable speculation as to whether economic benefits would automatically reach women. There were arguments that women’s empowerment may be increased when access to credit is combined with other services, including additional financial services, such as, insurance, enterprise development services like management training or marketing support; and welfare-related services like literacy, social and gender awareness training. The feminist interventionist strategy placed considerable weight on linking self-sustaining participatory women’s micro credit groups to the larger women’s movement against patriarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0971521513482219">Johnson, 1997</xref>). However, benefits to women cannot be assumed even in the most innovative of programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0971521513482219">Mayoux, 1998</xref>). Goetz and Gupta (1996) questioned the naivete of the assumption that economic empowerment is a straightforward process, such that easing women’s access to credit translates unproblematically into their control over its use. Socialist feminists have a different standpoint with regard to micro credit and women’s empowerment concerns. For them, integrating and interlinking explicit strategies for addressing resource and power inequalities within households and communities should be an integral part of economic interventions so as to materialise the potential of women’s empowerment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0971521513482219">Mayoux, 2001</xref>). There is an explicit recognition that the issues of improving women’s contributions to household income and well-being and reversing patriarchal power relations need to be tackled separately but with equal seriousness.</p>
<p>Critically reviewing certain studies conducted in Bangladesh, where it was shown that the majority of women borrowers neither had control over the loans received nor the income generated from the microenterprises, Scully (2004) says credit by itself cannot overcome patriarchal forms of control at the household and community level, and for this reason, microfinance is no panacea against poverty, which is a multi-causal problem in which the lack of access to capital is only one. When financial sustainability becomes the priority for promoting microcredit-based SHGs, they fail to protect the interests of women and undermine women’s empowerment by neglecting women’s access to and control over their own resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0971521513482219">Premchander, 2005</xref>), and thus strengthen structural inequality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0971521513482219">Sharma, 2004</xref>). Gendered experiences demonstrate a need for change in the biases in inter- and intra-household resource allocation. Intervention programmes such as micro credit must focus on the empowerment of women themselves and enable them to gain in decision-making power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0971521513482219">Gnanou, 2002</xref>). Focusing solely on economic productivity and the social well-being of poor women reduces it to a safety net (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0971521513482219">Kabeer, 2005</xref>). There are others, such as Jakimow and Kilby (2006), who argue when examining the normative model that the SHG programmes have the potential to empower women, but the persistence of ‘top-down’ approaches in implementation create obstacles in realising the empowerment objective. In their view, such SHGs contribute to maintaining the status quo or at best empower women within the prevailing system, and do not challenge the social structure that restrains the marginalised from pursuing their interests. This is further supported by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0971521513482219">Kannabiran, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0971521513482219">Mayoux, 2003</xref>) who argue that SHG programmes have generally used patriarchal structures in their modes of implementation, particularly in their adherence to gender norms that increase the efficiency of the programme. For instance, the official reason for the inclusion of women in SHG programmes is their greater credit worthiness and relatively disempowered status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0971521513482219">MYRADA, 2002</xref>). For Rahman (1999, p. 74), micro credit programmes actually take advantage of the disempowered status of women in society. Rather than enabling empowerment through a transformation of consciousness and traditional ideologies, existing patriarchal values are reproduced through the practices of SHGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0971521513482219">Thampi, 2004</xref>, p. 211), where women’s empowerment is defined more or less in terms of increasing their capacity to improve the well-being of their families, assuming that the mutual synergies between improved well-being, community development and participation in groups would lead to nothing but virtuous spirals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0971521513482219">Devika and Thampi, 2007</xref>, p. 36).</p>
<p>Thus, feminists, while vehemently criticising the top-down approach in the implementation of SHGs and their inability to address structural shortcomings, nonetheless argue that these attempts when combined with measures to address the structural fallouts would lead to positive outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0971521513482219">Burra et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0971521513482219">Devika and Thampi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0971521513482219">Kabeer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0971521513482219">Mayoux, 2001</xref>). However, the structure that they wish to see changed is the same as that defended in conventional views.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0971521513482219">
<title>The Practice of SHGs: Women as Financial Mediators</title>
<p>In contrast to popular perceptions of SHGs, ground-level practices give quite a contradictory picture, certainly as I found it to be in the field sites of Delhi. Normally, a group of 10 to 20 women come together at the behest of the promoting organisation which makes promises of the financial gains of forming such groups. It is hardly worth mentioning that the poorest among the poor are eliminated outright from these groups because they lack credit worthiness or because they are a ‘bad credit risk’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0971521513482219">22</xref></sup> From among the better-off too, not everyone is welcome. It is usually married and non-working women<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0971521513482219">23</xref></sup> whose husbands are earning reasonably well who are allowed to join. With the homogeneity of the group limited to neighbourhood proximity, it is not beyond their ability to make regular payments. The members are selected after SHG mobilisers make a judgement on the steady repayment capacity of these chosen women. This is generally done by visiting homes and soliciting the opinion of other women in the community. Another virtue of potential members is their passivity. Women thought of as ‘belligerent’ in the community are rarely taken into the group. According to one of the officials of the NGO whom I interviewed, they preferred not to take women who talk ‘unnecessarily’ during group activities, demanding explanations for almost everything, which in turn would ‘hamper’ group activities. In any case the organisation could not be expected to explain everything to those illiterate women. Moreover, confidentiality was important in running successfully.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0971521513482219">24</xref></sup> Saroj, one of the SHG members, however, had a different perspective on this. She said:
<disp-quote>
<p>[T]hey expect us to be ‘obedient’, which means we should not ask anything about new rules that they bring out or why they change the existing ones from time to time. If we do that we would be stamped as ‘argumentative’. Sometimes I do not like their decisions about the running of the group or the criteria for availing a loan. This is also the case for other women. But no one raises their voice for fear of facing the ire<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0971521513482219">25</xref></sup> of the staff. When no one opposes why should I do so unnecessarily?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another community woman, a widow who was not a member but wanted to become one, believed that she was not entertained by the NGO because she was popularly known for being <italic>ladakku</italic> (querulous), a probable reason for being an ‘untouchable’ for them.</p>
<p>Although the organisations develop their own strategies<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0971521513482219">26</xref></sup> for the successful operation of SHGs, both for the organisation and so also for the community women, the central focus is immediate financial needs. Loans availed of are rarely for investing in income-generation activities and more often for consumption. Where the money is invested or what is the purpose of the loan is not really a concern for the organisations for all practical purposes, although in official records they are very meticulous in showing ‘proper use’. Loans are availed of for different uses like investing in the business interests of their husbands, meeting contingent consumption costs, such as, health, education, renovation of houses, buying land, or meeting socio-cultural contingencies, such as, visiting one’s native home, attending marriages or death ceremonies, going on pilgrimages, and even for purely consumption needs like buying a new colour television or other household gadget. Irrespective of the purpose of the loan and its final use, most often these loans provide a cushion and at times avert a possible financial crisis in the family.</p>
<p>Interestingly, as a general practice, no loan is availed of by SHG members without the knowledge and permission of the men in the family. As shown by both organisers and SHG members, it is the money of the male members of the family that the women are saving. Besides, as one SHG member explained, ‘monthly savings are relatively smaller amounts that we can meet without the knowledge of our husbands. But loans are bigger sums that need to be repaid in installments. From where would the women get the money to repay the loans?’ However, for Sunita, an SHG member, a woman taking a loan or even holding a higher amount is as good as putting her own <italic>izzat</italic> (self-respect) at stake. She says:
<disp-quote>
<p>if I take a loan without the knowledge of my husband and decide to spend it for the family, and if I am caught with the money, I owe an explanation to my husband about the source of the money. My integrity would be questioned. It is not necessary that he believes my words. Suspicion is something very bad. That is an inherent (bad) quality of men. Men are of the same folk; whether they are of Bihar or Bengal, white or black their <italic>sochvichar</italic> [thinking] is the same. Men can hold money and no one would ask them about the source; but a woman is bound to have to give an explanation about the source of it. The community women too would blame the woman for having money without the permission of her husband. After all, what contingency is there over and above a woman’s own family? In our society only men are allowed to be secretive, not women.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Even the SHG mobilisers themselves encourage women to first seek their husbands’ consent before joining the group. One of the NGO officials was counselling a group of women who had come forward to form a group:
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Behene</italic> [sisters], you should try to join the group with the consent of your husbands as you people are not supposed to steal your husband’s money to make the saving nor lie to him which might lead to a family feud. As ideal wives, you should do activities to please him and get his permission to join the group. As a woman, you have to show your capabilities in getting his permission. I believe no man would turn to alcohol if he gets enough love and care from his wife. The women are at fault for the fighting in your homes. Hence my advice to all of you is that you join the Group only with the consent of your husbands. You can build your savings from the day-to-day expenses and that is one way of pleasing your husbands.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For another SHG mobiliser, it was alright for a woman to be secretive about saving money for the group, but her ultimate goal should be to serve the menfolk. Her advice to her client who wanted to take her husband’s permission to join the group was this:
<disp-quote>
<p>Do you get the permission of your husband for everything you do? 50 rupees might not be a big amount for you; that you can easily save without the knowledge of your husband. And the advantage is that when your husband needs, say 2,000 rupees, you can take a loan from the group and give it to him and thus can get his appreciation.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Effectively, no loan is sanctioned and dispersed without the consent of men. For all practical purposes, when sanctioning a loan, the NGO takes physical collateral like rights to property or at least an undertaking on official stamp paper from the beneficiaries. And as one of the mobilisers said:
<disp-quote>
<p>quite often the property would be in the name of the men in the family and hence we require his signature before sanctioning the loan. And after all it is for their use that the loan is taken and hence they are willing to give the undertaking.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another official said that the woman’s signature was just a formality:
<disp-quote>
<p>what do we do with the signature of these poor women. It is the men who are earning and we need to get surety from them. Getting the signature from the woman member is only a necessary formality since in the records of the group it is in their name that the loan is sanctioned.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One should therefore not be surprised to see men arriving at the NGO office to repay relatively higher sums. The reason is quite ‘logical’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0971521513482219">27</xref></sup> when explained by one of the mobilisers:
<disp-quote>
<p>[T]hese poor women are not habituated to handle bigger amounts and it is not safe for the mobiliser to collect the amount at the place of the SHG meeting and then carry it to the office. Hence we depute the men themselves to bring the money to the NGO office and make the repayment.</p>

<title>SHGs and the Devaluation of Household Labour</title>
<p>Even when SHG activities are part of household labour, they become glorified just because they are valued in terms of their economic worthiness. Ordinary routine chores of the house are worthless (in the eyes of wider world). When economic resources are given prime importance, it follows that only paid labour is valued and all other labour devalued and degraded as worthless, falling into the realm of the ‘feminine’. While in poor households it is the labour of the woman that saves the family from extreme poverty, patriarchal society devalues economically all women’s engagements which are otherwise labelled household labour. Self-help groups inherently take for granted that women are ‘unemployed’ and that SHG activities are equal to women’s employable activities. Therefore, it is these activities that should be given priority over her other household chores. This is because the very involvement in SHG activities is seen as working towards their empowerment, towards making them more visible as contributors to the household finances and hence worthier women.</p>
<p>This attitude attaches less value to housework and leaves the impression that women must prioritise SHG activities over other engagements. When I asked a group of women attending monthly meetings about this, one of them, speaking for the rest of them, said:
<disp-quote>
<p>We have to do the household chores. Also, most of us do piece-rate work. The meeting is fixed for a particular day and time each month. And we do not know what kind of contingency might occur on that day a month in advance. Whatever happens we have to be here to pay money. Otherwise they would charge us a penalty. And the timing also is such that many have their children coming back from school and others may have to send their children. All these are problems in reaching on time for the meeting. Madam <italic>log</italic> [the organisers] are sitting here for the meeting and they do not need to bother about all these. [Another member added] There are various reasons. Sometimes, the meeting dates are changed according to the convenience of the mobilisers and we don’t find the changed dates convenient. But our convenience is never counted. Also on any day we have to do the daily household responsibilities and we have to arrange to come for the meeting by making alternative arrangements to take care of the children and other activities. Two hours is the minimum time taken for the meeting. And it really means a lot of time for us. Sometimes, it so happens that the PDS rations are distributed on that particular day. What is more important, collecting the rations or to come for the monthly meeting?</p>

<title>SHGs—The Empowering Machine of the State</title>
<p>The term empowerment was initially associated with ‘alternative approaches’ to development and proposed as a substitute to the mainstream top-down development approach. The alternative, especially the empowerment aspect, offered a number of attractions for development agencies because of its bottom-up, supposedly people-friendly and participatory approach to development. Also, the enthusiasm for this approach, from both civil society activists and those within development organisations, can be understood as a reaction to the frustrating attempts to institutionalise gender in mainstream development policies and programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0971521513482219">Razavi and Miller, 1995</xref>). However, empowerment more recently has been adopted by mainstream development agencies as well, albeit, more to improve productivity within the status quo than to foster social transformation. As empowerment gained currency in mainstream development discourse, it began to be interpreted variedly according to the ideologies of the concerned institutions/agencies. With a more individualistic approach to empowerment, the concept fitted well within the frame of entrepreneurial capitalism and market forces as the saviours of backward economies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0971521513482219">Young, 1997</xref>), as much as within the alternative socialist structural approaches.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, SHGs are now being promoted as empowering tools, especially for women, primarily as a result of the policy shifts of the Indian state during the consolidation of neo-liberal economic policies. It is from the Seventh Plan (1985–1990) that women who had been thought of as welfare recipients gained recognition as active participants in development initiatives. From the Ninth Plan (1997–2002) onwards, efforts intensified and the empowerment of women was enshrined as a specific goal to be pursued for the advancement of the nation. The initiatives were partially a reflection of policy at the international level, as well as pressure from women’s movements nationally and internationally which argued that lack of economic resources was the main reason for women’s oppression. Bringing women closer to the economy was the main agenda for women’s empowerment, by making credit available through SHGs the central mechanism.</p>
<p>The concept of microcredit for the poorest segment along with a new set of credit delivery techniques was seen by the state as a replacement for the earlier mechanisms of institutional credit delivery. As part of the propagation of participatory governance, sustainable and people-friendly economic development, the bottom-up approach became the trademark of democratic governments in the period of heightened globalisation. Programmes and initiatives such as micro credit-based SHGs became the shortcut for the state to showcase its commitment towards the deprived in society, especially one of the most exploited social categories—women. Specific initiatives, such as, the Rashtriya Mahila Kosh, Indira Mahila Yojana, Swavalamban and Swashakti, are a few of the schemes and programmes that came to be launched over the years. Besides, listed as the central concerns of the Tenth Plan (2002–2007) towards the empowerment of women are social and economic empowerment and gender justice. The social empowerment of women is envisaged through the creation of an enabling environment which, apart from policies and programmes, showcases SHGs. The state has followed the same policy in the Eleventh Plan (2007–2012) as well, where SHGs are seen as an important mechanism in attaining critical parameters of growth.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the state’s appropriation and adoption of the concept of empowerment to suit its own dominant ideology is at the cost of the very (alternative) approach that empowerment was said to stand for. For instance, the primary aim of Rashtriya Mahila Kosh<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0971521513482219">28</xref></sup> is to provide or promote the provision of microcredit to poor women for incomegeneration activities, for asset creation, as an instrument of women’s empowerment, socio-economic change and development<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0971521513482219">29</xref></sup>. The reason cited in its documents for its concentration on poor women was that among the poor, it is poor women who are the most disadvantaged—they lack education and access to resources, both of which are required to help upward economic and social mobility. The problem is more acute in India because they also lack status. However, the tangible evidence that was held up as proof of the success of such initiatives was that groups of women are better customers than men and better managers of resources; and that the benefits of loans spread wider among the household if loans are routed through women. There is a circular argument here: the empowerment capability of microcredit came to be closely linked with the patriarchal ideology that women are better homemakers, although it goes contrary to its primary aim of helping women to overcome their low status in society which, in turn, is caused by the patriarchal bias against them. And, as this study has revealed, this paradox is quite evident in the functioning of SHGs at the ground level.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0971521513482219">
<title>SHGs and Empowerment: The Paradox</title>
<p>As we have seen, the term empowerment in recent decades has become the buzzword for developmental agencies both at the national and international levels, as also for the state and civil society when addressing the issues of economically backward social groups. Over the last two to three decades among different groups in poor and rich countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0971521513482219">Townsend et al., 1999</xref>, p. 20), empowerment has come to be seen as the gaining of power by the vulnerable. In grassroots programmes and policy debates as well, empowerment has virtually replaced terms such as welfare, upliftment, community participation and poverty alleviation to describe the goals of development and intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0971521513482219">Batliwala, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>In the world of micro credit, the empowerment approach has two distinctive positions. One is the neo-liberal minimalist model which emphasises financial self-sustainability<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0971521513482219">30</xref></sup> (or financial systems approach), claiming that providing credit per se automatically empowers women. Placing a premium on profitability and market competitiveness, this model<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0971521513482219">31</xref></sup> argues that there is no need to give women explicit support to increase their incomes, to defend their interests within the household, or for wider social and political changes in gender and class relations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0971521513482219">32</xref></sup> The structuralist/socialist feminist critiques<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0971521513482219">33</xref></sup> argue that interventions like microfinance have little scope for success in addressing women’s needs unless they are linked to wider movements for change against patriarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0971521513482219">Kabeer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0971521513482219">Mayoux, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0971521513482219">2001</xref>). The ‘credit plus’, ‘integrated approach’ or feminist empowerment approach<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0971521513482219">34</xref></sup> maintains that women’s empowerment is the result of many mutually reinforcing interventions that go beyond mere lending. Here microcredit is promoted as an entry point in the context of a wider strategy for women’s economic, social and political empowerment, by combining financial services with other forms of support which use group-based strategies to build the organisational capacity of the poor.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, both the approaches have one thing in common—the end result, which is empowerment of women to enable them to rise out of their state of subordination, primarily by challenging the existing mode of power distribution in a patriarchal social structure. Interestingly, when the concept of empowerment came into vogue in development discourse as a desirable objective, SHGs were the first to appropriate the term and claim its on-the-ground achievement, especially among one of the most excluded sections in the society—women from marginalised sections of society. And, as already discussed, this was one term that was acceptable to diverse interests. Multiple claims were made about the potential of SHGs in achieving empowerment, although there were diverse opinions as to the path selected or the means to do so. But what does this ultimately lead to: better survival in the existing system? If so, what are its ground level implications in the lives of women who are already marginalised on several grounds other than gender?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0971521513482219">
<title>Re-powering Patriarchy as Empowerment</title>
<p>The entry of women into SHGs are usually as wives, daughters, mothers and sisters of men. Their membership gives them a sense of pride, especially when they are given the loan amount to spend on the family. In effect, then, SHGs often strengthen gender roles in the community. It is taken for granted that men are breadwinners, and women are caretakers. By encouraging unemployed women<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0971521513482219">35</xref></sup> to become members of the group, to take loans on behalf of the men in the family, as also make payments from their earnings, SHGs exalt the role of women as caretakers. They thus consolidate her position within the patriarchal family. It is in fact the men in the family who decide if the women can join the group, if the loan is required at all, and for what purpose it should be used. The organisation sanctions the loan after getting an oral and written agreement from the men about the repayment. The women’s role is limited to that of mediator. This financial mediation makes demands on women, at times compromising her own <italic>izzat</italic> (self-respect) for the sake of the <italic>izzat/samman</italic> of the family (read men); she may end up doing more work in addition to her routine household work, make savings even under the harshest of situations. All these activities are easily interpreted as ‘empowering’ for both the women and the wider society. In the words of one of the members, ‘he may not take my opinion in any other decision related to the family, but at least for getting the loan from the group he has to beg to me; I really feel empowered with this arrangement. At least once in a lifetime he will have to plead with me and that makes me really proud.’</p>
<p>Such views were supported by the organisation as well. One of them said:
<disp-quote>
<p>when they take loans for their husbands they feel they get a better position in the family. They always find contentment with the happiness of their family. And thus they feel they could do something for the family by getting loans for their husbands. That would also get better <italic>samman</italic> [respect] for the woman.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is not only that the women uphold their pride as a part of the patriarchal system but also often act as the carriers of that system. He further continues:
<disp-quote>
<p>since women identify themselves with the family they are much more concerned about the family pride than the men. This is one reason for their high repayment rate. It is this pressure that compels women to make the payment even if it is by taking loans from some other sources.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Furthermore, as the presumption is that the loan is taken for economic purposes, the SHG activities fall into the ‘productive’ realm as defined in modern terminology, so that this extended caretaking role of women gets added recognition and is therefore considered as empowering.</p>
<p>Moreover, this empowered status of women often helps them to overcome what have been called patriarchal risks<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0971521513482219">36</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0971521513482219">Cain et al., 1979</xref>). One way of coping with male domination in society and the resultant oppression for women is to accept dominance obligingly, adhering to their subordinate status. This means accepting prevailing definitions of femininity and the female body which they translate into their own ideal femininity so that its oppressive nature remains hidden even to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0971521513482219">Thapan, 1997</xref>, p. 189). Women in the community accept patriarchal domination as normal and their own status as dependents. The risks and uncertainties associated with women’s dependent status within such systems paradoxically engender in them greater incentives to comply with, rather than challenge, male dominance and to manipulate the norms of male obligation and protection to shore up their own position within their families. By adding the further role of financial mediator to their household routines and so upscaling their worth in the family, SHGs help women to overcome the risk of being dependents.</p>
<p>As ‘SHGs cannot work against the practised and accepted social structure’, they cannot be the instruments that challenge the segregation of job allocations in the family and household. If women can extend their caretaking activities for financial gains to the family, it should be with the approval of the men, because the assumption being that men are wiser in dealing with financial matters, when in fact it is the intelligent handling of family finances by the women which keeps poverty at bay and provides the family enough to eat. When it comes to managing poverty, women are experts because of their altruistic character and their ability to put the family’s well-being ahead of their own. But when it comes to financial dealings with the external world, it is the men who are capable, as justified and naturalised within dominant discourses. These are accepted gender norms within society and SHGs thrive on them. Working more efficiently within the accepted structure has thus become a sign of the empowered status of women.</p>
<p>The financial mediating role of women and their ability to make finances available for family can sometimes act like a subsidised dowry. Once the money from SHG funds reach the household through the financial mediation of the woman it becomes men’s property. Culturally it is assumed that women have no use for money apart from the need to take care of the family. This restricts their access to money for personal use, and if they do spend, their integrity and commitment to the family is questioned.</p>

<title>Concluding Thoughts</title>
<p>While capitalism and patriarchy seek to make a society after their own image,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0971521513482219">37</xref></sup> this is often done through a process of self-generation, through (non-violent or symbolically violent) intervention of the state and other dominant institutions of society. In order to quell the otherwise possible resistance by the majority who are disadvantaged, this self-generation or regeneration is apparently done in a more people-friendly manner, under cover of notions such as participatory development and empowerment. However, instead of seeking a transformation, they end up making available more bargaining power for better survival of the people within the system. This process only strengthens the existing system/structure of which the disadvantaged are already the victims. While femininity and gender are defined by the structure, the idealisation of women’s roles in the given structure or her adjustment to the system with more bargaining power is interpreted as her empowerment. It raises question whether this is the kind of empowerment that society visualises for women, or has this empowerment been ‘uprooted’ from its original meaning? If the very concept of empowerment originated with the idea of conscientisation,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0971521513482219">38</xref></sup> or critical awareness of one’s own socio-political environment, can any act that does not result in a critical understanding of social transformation be called empowerment? Have we gone wrong in defining empowerment? Or do we need to understand that this is a result of the decontextualised application of the concept of empowerment? Isn’t it time for us to go back to the roots of the emergence of the very concept of empowerment for a better understanding, especially in the context of women’s emancipation?</p>

It is concerned more with local development and emphasises agency, in the sense of people’s capacity to effect social change. However, sharing a common development discourse and adapting to the overall changes, the mainstream and alternative development perspectives evince considerable overlap at present times (which is one of the conclusions drawn from this study as well).

Microfinance is a more encompassing term, while SHG has limited application. Microfinance is a financial service of a small amount provided by the financial institutions to the poor. These services may include savings, credit, insurance, leasing, money transfer, equity transaction, etc., that is, any type of financial service provided to customers to meet their normal financial needs—life cycle, economic opportunity and emergency—with the only qualification that the transaction is small and customers are poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0971521513482219">Dasgupta, 2005</xref>). Micro credit has come to be referred to as a small-scale financial service (including savings, credit, insurance, business services and technical assistance) provided to rural people who operate small or micro-enterprises, provide services, work for wages or commissions, and other individuals and groups working at local levels. Thus, while microfinance indicates larger institutional financial services, micro credit is generally indicative of the quantum of finance involved and the target group. Or, micro credit is only one component of microfinance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0971521513482219">Kalpana, 2005</xref>). The formation of an SHG is one, and the most prominent, among the various operational mechanisms of microfinance/micro credit in the contemporary period. By far the largest component of microfinance in present-day India, in terms of scale, geographical coverage and outreach, is the SHG–bank linkage model.</p></fn>

Cultural hurdles involve people’s differences in perception about availing of traditional credit and loans from a bank or government. The cultural values attributed to the two situations are different, and the situations that arise when there are defaults in repayment too need differential treatment which the bank officials are not sensitive to.
