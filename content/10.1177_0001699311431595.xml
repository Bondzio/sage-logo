<abstract>
<p>Research into the effects of ability grouping has usually been conducted within schools. In the British and North American context, where the bulk of this kind of research has been carried out, ability grouping commonly occurs within schools. In Flanders – the Dutch-speaking, northern part of Belgium – as in other European countries, there are not only tracks within schools, but schools themselves can be distinguished by the curriculum they offer. This study questions whether students’ global self-esteem is affected differently by processes of within-school tracking (multilateral schools) compared to processes of between-school tracking (categorial schools). Analyses are based on a subsample of the Flemish Educational Assessment, gathered in 2004–2005, encompassing 10 multilateral and 56 categorial schools with 3,758 academic and 2,152 vocational students. Multi-level analyses (HLM6) show that academic students have a significant higher self-esteem than vocational students and this difference is larger in multilateral schools. Academic students in multilateral schools have a slightly higher self-esteem than those in categorial schools. Conceivably, academic students compare themselves with the vocational track students, leading to a higher awareness of status gratification, resulting in a higher self-esteem. </p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Research into the effects of ability grouping has usually been conducted <italic>within</italic> schools. In the British and North American context, where the bulk of this kind of research has been carried out, ability grouping commonly occurs within schools. In Flanders – the Dutch-speaking, northern part of Belgium – as in other European countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0001699311431595">Brunello and Checchi, 2007</xref>), there are not only tracks within schools, but schools themselves can be distinguished by the curriculum they offer. We differentiate between within-school tracking, in which relatively heterogeneous groups of students within a school are assigned to different streams within that school on the basis of their prior achievement, and between-school tracking, in which students are assigned to different schools on the basis of their prior achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0001699311431595">Trautwein et al., 2006</xref>). The existence of these different types of schools in Flanders allows testing whether the segregation of tracks into different schools enlarges the stated effects of tracking (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0001699311431595">Hallam and Ireson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0001699311431595">Schofield, 2006</xref>). A recent study emphasizes the importance of investigating the effects of between-school tracking on student outcomes by demonstrating that within-school tracking – and not between-school tracking – reinforces differences in study involvement between vocational and academic students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0001699311431595">Van Houtte and Stevens, 2009</xref>). Whereas the organization of tracks between schools reduces the opportunities for frequent and regular contact between students in different tracks, tracking within the same school rather encourages the exposure to students of other tracks. It is plausible, then, that in these schools vocational students are more likely to take the academic students as a comparative reference group, giving rise to feelings of relative deprivation and resulting in higher study disengagement (see differentiation–polarization theory: Abraham, 2008; Kelly, 2009). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0001699311431595">
</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0001699311431595">
</xref> </p>
<p>If it is the case that within-school tracking is more stigmatizing for the lower-track students, resulting in negative self-feelings, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0001699311431595">Van Houtte and Stevens (2009</xref>), within-school tracking might have a greater impact on students’ global self-esteem than between-school tracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0001699311431595">Van Houtte, 2005</xref>). This raises the question whether students’ global self-esteem is affected differently by processes of within-school tracking (or the separation of students in different groups within a school) compared to processes of between-school tracking (or the separation of students in different schools)? A considerable number of studies on ability grouping have focused on students’ academic self-concept as outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0001699311431595">Chiu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0001699311431595">Trautwein et al., 2006</xref>), as it has been shown that academic achievement is substantially more correlated with academic self-concept than with general self-concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0001699311431595">Marsh, 1987</xref>). But it is important to investigate the effects of different tracking processes on more general affective outcomes, such as global self-esteem, as well. Low self-esteem due to being in a low ability group may lead to a total rejection of school and cause a student to drop out or resist school by disruptive or delinquent behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0001699311431595">Finn, 1989</xref>; Rosenberg et al., 1989). However, more importantly, if resulting in lower global self-esteem, the impact of ability grouping might exceed the pure educational context. As adolescents spend most of their time at school, educational stratification can be expected to affect more than school-related outcomes, but wider outcomes, such as their global self-worth, with possibly negative consequences beyond the school. After all, individuals with low self-esteem are at risk of depressive reactions, which could, in the worst case, provoke suicidal behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0001699311431595">Harter, 1993</xref>). By comparing the effects of within and between-school tracking on students’ global self-esteem, this study builds on a large and important research tradition in sociology of education and ongoing policy debates concerning the relationship between inequality and ability grouping (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0001699311431595">Araùjo, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>This study is unique in that it uses data from a representative sample of students and secondary schools (in Flanders) to examine whether the difference in self-esteem between academic and vocational students is more pronounced in schools characterized by within-school tracking (so-called multilateral schools) compared with schools characterized by between-school tracking (categorial schools). Simultaneously, we compare the global self-esteem of academic and vocational students attending multilateral schools with their counterparts attending categorial schools. The following sections first discuss ability grouping in general, how tracking is organized in Flanders, and how this relates to the students’ global self-esteem. After presenting the results of our multi-level analyses, the conclusions summarize findings the main of the study and discuss its implications for future research and social policy on ability grouping.</p>

<title>The ongoing debate concerning ability grouping</title>
<p>In many countries around the world there has been a long tradition of grouping students in secondary education according to their ability level – a practice supported by the belief that students have relatively fixed levels of ability and need to be taught accordingly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0001699311431595">Araùjo, 2007</xref>). As such, ability grouping is the practice of dividing students for instruction according to their purported capacities for learning and usually refers to the placement of students into homogeneous learning groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0001699311431595">Gamoran et al., 1995</xref>). It is assumed that it is easier and far more efficient to teach a group of students that is fairly homogeneous in terms of ability, so teachers do not have to worry about losing the slowest or boring the fastest learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0001699311431595">Brunello and Checchi, 2007</xref>). In addition it is claimed that, by grouping students, education can be tailored to be the most beneficial for those with different labour market trajectories. Students are offered distinctive, internally coherent programmes of study congruent with their scholastic interest and competencies and fitted to their anticipated educational and vocational needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0001699311431595">Trautwein et al., 2006</xref>). </p>
<p>In secondary education, ability grouping is organized in a myriad of ways (short overview of several countries: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0001699311431595">Maaz et al., 2008</xref>). While ‘tracking’ (US) or ‘streaming’ (UK) refers to a situation in which students are taught an entirely different curriculum depending on their ability group, ‘setting’ or ‘banding’ refers to a situation in which students are taught the same curriculum but differentiated for specific subjects in different ability groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0001699311431595">Gamoran, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0001699311431595">Van de Gaer et al., 2006</xref>). In each country, the secondary educational system is characterized by a history of introducing, abolishing and re-introducing diverse systems of ability grouping. From the second half of the twentieth century on, and especially in the late 1970s and early 1980s, in several European countries, as well as in the US, concerns about the inequality following from selective tracking systems led to ‘detracking’ or the creation of comprehensive educational systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0001699311431595">Araùjo, 2007</xref>). However, in the 1990s, in part due to concerns about ‘raising attainment’, social policy-makers and educationalists implemented and emphasized the importance of selecting students into different ability groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0001699311431595">Ireson and Hallam, 1999</xref>). </p>
<p>While current educational policy appears committed to the value of ability grouping, discussion and uncertainty still prevail over the relative merits of a selective versus a comprehensive school system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0001699311431595">Araùjo, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0001699311431595">Brunello and Checchi, 2007</xref>), notwithstanding the wealth of international research on the effects of structured ability grouping on the academic, personal and social outcomes for students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0001699311431595">Hallam and Ireson, 2006</xref>). In particular, research consistently suggests that ability grouping<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0001699311431595">1</xref>
</sup> reduces achievement among the low ability students (overviews: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0001699311431595">Carbonaro, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0001699311431595">Schofield, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, it is shown that ability grouping engenders negative school attitudes and alienation from school in low ability groups, and results in the development of anti-school cultures when these feelings are shared (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0001699311431595">Ball, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0001699311431595">Hargreaves, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0001699311431595">Rosenbaum, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0001699311431595">Van Houtte and Stevens, 2010</xref>). Ability grouping may impact on students’ self-esteem as well, although here the evidence is less univocal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0001699311431595">Ireson and Hallam, 2005</xref>). Nevertheless, research in different national contexts has demonstrated quite consistently that students in lower ability groups do manifest more negative attitudes towards themselves than those in higher ability groups (China: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0001699311431595">Cheung and Rudowicz, 2003</xref>; England: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0001699311431595">Ireson et al., 2001</xref>; Finland and Poland: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0001699311431595">Malmberg and Trempala, 1997</xref>; US: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0001699311431595">Vanfossen et al., 1987</xref>). These adverse effects of ability grouping are also demonstrated within Flemish secondary education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0001699311431595">Stevens and Vermeersch, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0001699311431595">Van de Gaer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0001699311431595">Van Houtte, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0001699311431595">2006</xref>), stimulating debates on the usefulness of early tracking, which is generally considered as the main cause of the unremitting social inequality in Flemish education. </p>

<title>Tracking in Flanders</title>
<p>In Flanders, grouping or ‘tracking’ students in secondary education into separate classrooms has been commonplace since the beginning of the twentieth century. In the second half of the twentieth century in Flanders, as in the UK and other European countries, controversy arose over the adequacy of the process whereby students were selected, with a concern that those from working-class backgrounds were disadvantaged. While comprehensive schooling was introduced as a means to address educational inequality, in practice it was often motivated on economic grounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0001699311431595">Araùjo, 2007</xref>). In Flanders, the comprehensive system was adopted from the 1970s on, but as early as the end of the 1980s it was abolished again, mainly for financial and organizational reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0001699311431595">Wielemans, 1996</xref>). A new system was established, originally intended as a merger of the traditional categorial tracking system and the comprehensive system. However, today Flemish secondary education is characterized by stringent tracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0001699311431595">Van de Gaer et al., 2006</xref>). Flemish secondary school consists of six years of education divided into three ‘grades’ lasting two years each (grades 7–12, age 12–18) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0001699311431595">Figure 1</xref>
). </p>

</fig>
<p>Although the first grade offers a core curriculum to allow students time to ‘orientate’ themselves to a particular track, in practice the kinds of courses offered depend on the main tracks offered in the final four years in the school. There are four main tracks: academic education preparing for higher education, technical, vocational and artistic education, the last-mentioned being a rather marginal track in terms of the number of students. Students are not formally assigned to a track when starting secondary education. Students and parents choose a track in first grade, usually based on their achievement in primary education. Research shows that the socio-economic status remains determinant in this choice, next to achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0001699311431595">Boone and Van Houtte, 2010</xref>). From the first year on, each year a certificate, based on school achievement, indicates whether students can continue their current school career or not. A certificate B indicates that the student needs to join another, usually lower track (technical instead of general or vocational instead of technical); a certificate C means that the student has to repeat the year. </p>
<p>Schools tend to specialize in a particular curriculum, giving rise to academic schools on the one hand and technical/vocational and a few pure vocational schools on the other. Besides these ‘categorial’ schools there are ‘multilateral’ schools incorporating academic, technical and vocational tracks. Within these multilateral schools, the firm distinction between tracks remains, and there is no question of education in heterogeneous or mixed-ability groups. An important feature of the Flemish educational system is the free choice of school: students are not formally assigned to a school and one is not obliged to enrol in a school in the neighbourhood. School choice often depends upon family tradition or distance between home and school. As such, the intake of students does not differ between categorial and multilateral schools, except that students with a high socio-economic status are more likely to enrol in categorial academic schools, which are therefore also more elitist (see Variables). </p>
<p>The different tracks are commonly classified hierarchically, with technical and vocational tracks placed at the lower end. In the present knowledge-based society, the occupations for which students are prepared in technical/vocational tracks are usually less esteemed, and de-industrialization and technological change have led to the collapse of demand for skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled (male) manual workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0001699311431595">Nixon, 2006</xref>). As a result, a technical or vocational training is usually not considered a truly positive choice, but rather a second choice because one does not meet the standards set by academic tracks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0001699311431595">Ainsworth and Roscigno, 2005</xref>). </p>
<p>The tracking system in Flanders may be typified as ‘explicit school-level tracking to different school types catering to specific student groups’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0001699311431595">Trautwein et al., 2006</xref>: 789).  Within these explicit tracking programmes that use achievement as a selection criterion and have a profound impact on later educational and occupational opportunities, the status of students in particular tracks is clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0001699311431595">Trautwein et al., 2006</xref>). By explicitly differentiating students in ability groups, processes of categorization and self-categorization are reinforced, yielding contrast effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0001699311431595">Harris, 1998</xref>). This is likely to happen particularly when groups are determined along a status dimension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0001699311431595">Kelly, 2009</xref>). Students are aware of the relative lower status associated with being in a low track (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0001699311431595">Abraham, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0001699311431595">Stevens and Vermeersch, 2010</xref>) and this experience of status loss and failure may result in diminished self-esteem, arising from comparing themselves with higher-track peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0001699311431595">Ireson et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0001699311431595">
<title>Within and between-school tracking and global self-esteem</title>
<p>Global self-esteem is generally seen as a component or dimension of a multidimensional self-concept structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0001699311431595">Marsh and O’Mara, 2008</xref>). Self-concept – a person’s self-perception formed through interpretations of one’s environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0001699311431595">Shavelson et al., 1976</xref>) – has been the topic of thousands of studies in a variety of disciplines, most of them dealing with self-esteem (Rosenberg et al., 1989). Self-esteem pertains to the global evaluation of the self, the individual’s overall assessment of his or her value or worth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0001699311431595">Chiu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0001699311431595">Trautwein et al., 2006</xref>). Research on the effects of ability grouping on the well-being of students has focused primarily on students’ self-concepts or self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0001699311431595">Chiu et al., 2008</xref>). A considerable number of these studies dealt with self-concept as outcome, but recently researchers have increasingly begun to differentiate between global evaluations of the self, that is self-esteem, and evaluations of specific abilities, such as academic self-concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0001699311431595">Trautwein et al., 2006</xref>). Prominent in this respect is the description of the by now classic Big-Fish-Little-Pond-Effect, whereby equally able students have lower academic self-concepts in high-ability schools than in low-ability schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0001699311431595">Marsh, 1987</xref>) (see below). </p>
<p>A crucial mechanism with respect to the link between track position and self-concepts or self-esteem is social comparison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0001699311431595">Chiu et al., 2008</xref>). This mechanism involves using others as benchmarks for self-evaluation and is, as such, a potential source of self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0001699311431595">Schwalbe and Staples, 1991</xref>). Three sources of self-esteem are usually distinguished: social comparison, reflected appraisals and self-attribution (Rosenberg et al., 1989; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0001699311431595">Schwalbe and Staples, 1991</xref>). Reflected appraisals holds that people’s feelings about themselves are strongly influenced by their judgments of what others think of them. Self-attribution holds that people draw conclusions about themselves by observing the success or failure of their efforts. Students who do well in school experience more favourable social comparisons, reflected appraisals and self-attributions, enhancing their global self-esteem (Rosenberg et al., 1989). A public and as such very visible indicator of educational ‘success’ is the track students attend. It seems apparent that students in both higher and lower tracks use the other as a yardstick against which to judge their own academic capabilities. As such, students in different tracks take each other as a comparative reference group, for lower-track students resulting in relative deprivation, lower achievement expectancies and feelings of inferiority and inadequacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0001699311431595">Reuman, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0001699311431595">Richer, 1976</xref>). </p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0001699311431595">Richer (1976</xref>) believes that the relative deprivation depends upon the social interactions between lower and higher ability students. He reasons that because grouped low-ability students have no contact with the high-ability students, relative deprivation is unlikely to occur. Hence, he argues that homogeneously grouped low-ability students will be less likely to develop such feelings of inferiority. However, research has demonstrated quite consistently that lower-track students do manifest more negative attitudes towards themselves than higher-track students, showing that grouping students does not prevent them from comparing themselves with each other, quite the reverse. However, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0001699311431595">Richer (1976</xref>) that a crucial condition for reference group processes to develop is the visibility of the other group, we may expect feelings of relative deprivation to be higher in a within-school tracking system, since the visibility is likely to be higher there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0001699311431595">Trautwein et al., 2006</xref>). </p>
<p>Furthermore, given the high value placed on education, our society tends to consider high-track membership the norm. Tracking is said to confer unnecessary distinction on those in the higher tracks, while placing a stigma on those in the lower tracks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0001699311431595">Kulik and Kulik, 1982</xref>). As a result, lower tracks may be considered as a stigmatized social category; that is, a social category about which others hold negative attitudes and beliefs, and which is devalued by the broader society. Because of this, members of the stigmatized groups may develop negative self-feelings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0001699311431595">Crocker and Major, 1989</xref>). The mechanism of reflected appraisals comes to the fore here. Self-evaluations are known to be related to how one believes others perceive the self (Cooley, 1902 [1983]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0001699311431595">Crocker and Major, 1989</xref>). Members of stigmatized groups are aware of the negative stereotypes that others hold toward them and internalize the negative view of them held by society at large, resulting in diminished self-esteem. Several strategies may protect the self-esteem of stigmatized persons, among which certain comparison processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0001699311431595">Crocker and Major, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0001699311431595">Major and O’Brien, 2005</xref>). Integrating stigmatized and non-stigmatized individuals – as in within-school tracking – should facilitate or even impose comparisons, and as such result in lower self-esteem among the stigmatized. Conversely, segregating stigmatized individuals inhibits their ability to compare themselves to out-group members because they are physically unavailable for comparison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0001699311431595">Crocker and Major, 1989</xref>). </p>
<p>Considerable research into ability grouping compares grouped low-ability students with non-grouped low-ability students to see which effect – if any – this grouping has on students’ (academic) self-concept. Research of this kind generally finds that ability grouping has no adverse effects for low-ability students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0001699311431595">Marsh, 1987</xref>). On the contrary, when students are grouped with others of similar ability, the comparison with fellow students within the same group is more likely to turn out in their favour, improving their self-image; that is, the aforementioned well-known Big-Fish-Little-Pond-Effect.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0001699311431595">2</xref>
</sup> Our study does not examine the effect of ability grouping as such, but investigates whether the association between track position and self-esteem depends upon the way this tracking is organized – within-school or between-school tracking. Considering that feelings of inferiority due to relative deprivation are more likely as students get in touch with each other, and given the assumption that within-school tracking is more stigmatizing for lower-track students, we expect lower-track students – vocational students – to display lower levels of self-esteem in multilateral than in categorial schools. Hence, based on the research literature we hypothesize that the difference between academic and vocational students’ self-esteem should be larger in multilateral schools than in categorial schools, meaning that within-school tracking sharpens the differences between lower and higher-track students. </p>

<title>Research design</title>
<p>First, we verified whether track position and self-esteem are related by comparing the self-esteem of students in the lowest and highest tracks; that is, vocational students and academic students. Second, we investigated by means of multi-level analyses whether the difference in self-esteem between these two tracks varies according to school type, differentiating between multilateral and categorial schools (HLM6: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0001699311431595">Bryk and Raudenbush, 1992</xref>). Thereafter, we estimated a cross-level interaction (academic* multilateral) by letting the slope of track vary across school type, distinguishing between academic and vocational students with respect to track position and between multilateral and categorial schools with respect to school type. In the analysis we took into account students’ gender, age, socio-economic status, ethnicity and parental support in order to consider possible selection effects, as these variables have been related to self-esteem in previous research (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0001699311431595">Van Houtte, 2005</xref>).

<p>In a final model we added a measure of prior academic achievement – students’ GPA in the year before the inquiry. Given the link between self-esteem and academic achievement, and between tracking and achievement, we need to verify that a relationship between school type, tracking and self-esteem is not explained by academic achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0001699311431595">Chiu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0001699311431595">Trautwein et al., 2006</xref>). This control is included in the final step of our analysis because our measure of prior achievement is a rather crude one (see Variables), so prudence is in order. All determinants are grand mean centred, except for the dichotomous variables (school type, track position, gender and ethnicity), which are uncentred for reasons of interpretation, and the slopes are allowed to vary across schools.<sup>

<title>Data</title>
<p>The analyses were based on a <italic>subsample</italic> of the Flemish Educational Assessment – data gathered in 2004–2005 from 11,872 third and fifth-grade students (ninth and eleventh-grade students) in a sample of 85 secondary schools in Flanders. First, we selected proportional-to-size postal codes (which refer to municipalities), with the size for this purpose defined as the number of schools within the postal code as gathered from the data of the Flemish Educational Department. From the 240 postal codes, we selected 48 with a desired slight overrepresentation of greater municipalities. Second, all regular secondary schools within these selected municipalities were asked to participate (<italic>n </italic>= 274), yielding a positive response of 31 per cent. The 48 municipalities as well as the 85 schools in this data set are representative of the Flemish situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0001699311431595">Van Houtte et al., 2005</xref>). Schools agreeing to participate did so with parents’ consent. Students completed the questionnaires in class in the presence of one or two researchers and a teacher. In the end, 11,945 students completed a questionnaire, of which 11,872 proved to be valid, yielding a response rate of 87 per cent. Of the total number of students, 6,081 were in the third grade and 5,791 in the fifth. The questionnaires were not anonymous, but names were removed as the data were assembled, so the final database and all analyses are completely confidential. </p>
<p>For this study, we selected four school types: 10 multilateral (offering academic, technical and vocational education) and 56 categorial, of which 22 were academic schools, 4 vocational schools and 30 technical/vocational schools. The 19 schools that were excluded are not categorial as they provide arts education as well, or are not purely multilateral – that is, offering all three tracks, academic, technical and vocational. On average, multilateral (mean number of students = 345) and categorial schools  did not differ significantly with respect to school size (<italic>t</italic> = 1.064, <italic>p</italic> = 0.291), and an equal proportion of multilateral and categorial schools were run privately and publicly, respectively (53.6 per cent of the categorial and 50 per cent of the multilateral schools were private). Moreover, we limited our analyses to the 3,758 academic students and the 2,152 vocational students, being the highest and lowest track, enrolled in the 66 considered schools, yielding a sample of 5910 students (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0001699311431595">Table 1</xref>

<title>Variables</title>
<p>
<italic>Self-esteem</italic> was measured by means of a Likert-scale inspired by the Rosenberg Self-Concept Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0001699311431595">Rosenberg, 1963</xref>) and consists of 12 items with 5 answer categories, 1  =  <italic>absolutely do not agree </italic>to 5  =  <italic>completely agree</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0001699311431595">Brutsaert, 2001</xref>). Examples of items are ‘I accept myself as I am’ and ‘In general, I am self-contented’. This measurement has been used successfully in a number of studies in the past (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0001699311431595">Brutsaert, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0001699311431595">Van Houtte, 2005</xref>). Missing values were substituted by means of item correlation substitution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0001699311431595">Huisman, 1999</xref>). The analyses use the students’ total score (range = 12–60, Cronbach’s alpha = 0.87, <italic>n</italic> = 11,602). </p>
<p>Two kinds of <italic>tracks</italic> were considered: the academic track (coded 1) and the vocational track (0). The majority of the students in the sample were enrolled in an academic track (63.59 per cent). </p>
<p>The main determinant <italic>school type</italic> distinguishes between multilateral schools (<italic>n</italic> = 10), offering academic, technical and vocational education (coded 1), and categorial schools (0), offering either academic or technical and vocational or vocational education (<italic>n</italic> = 56). </p>
<p>Regarding <italic>gender</italic>, our sample was equally divided with 51.9 per cent being female (male = 1, female = 2). About half (52.9 per cent) of the academic students and about half (50.2 per cent) of the vocational students were female. For vocational students, a majority attending multilateral schools were female, in contrast to the students attending categorial schools. As for academic students, there was a higher representation of girls in categorial schools than in multilateral schools (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0001699311431595">Table 2</xref>

<p>Our research concentrated on the third and fifth-grade students of secondary education, so the <italic>age</italic> of most respondents was 15 (38.5 per cent) or 17 (about 32.5 per cent) years in 2005. The oldest respondents were 20 years or older; the youngest was 13. The respondents were on average 16.33 years old, and the vocational students were, on average, significantly older (16.94) than the academic students (15.99), owing to their higher retention rate. Vocational students attending categorial schools were, on average, significantly older than those attending multilateral schools, but for the academic students the opposite was true (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0001699311431595">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>We measured the socio-economic status (SES) of origin by means of the occupational prestige of the father and mother (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0001699311431595">Erikson et al., 1979</xref>) – the highest of both was used as an indicator of the SES of the family. The respondents had a mean SES of 5.16. On average, the vocational students had a significantly lower SES (3.49) than the academic students (5.99). Academic students attending multilateral schools had, on average, a significantly lower SES than academic students attending categorial schools (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0001699311431595">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>
<italic>Ethnic origin</italic> is determined by the place of birth of the mother’s mother, substituted by the mother’s or father’s nationality if the maternal grandmother’s birthplace was missing – since most immigrant students are second or third-generation immigrants and have Belgian nationality. Only West European birthplaces and nationalities were considered to qualify a respondent as of native descent (0 = native, 1 = immigrant). In our data, 14.1 per cent of the students were identified as from a foreign origin. Ethnic origin is negatively correlated with SES: immigrant students’ SES is lower than that of native students (<italic>r</italic> = –0.392, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). There were more immigrant students in the vocational track (27.4 per cent) than in the academic track (6.4 per cent). Of the academic students attending categorial schools, only 3.9 per cent had an immigrant background, compared to 29.3 per cent of those attending multilateral schools (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0001699311431595">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>
<italic>Parental support</italic> was measured using a seven-item scale with five answer categories, ranging from <italic>absolutely do not agree</italic> (score 1) to <italic>completely agree</italic> (score 5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0001699311431595">Brutsaert, 2001</xref>). Items are for example: ‘My parents accept me as I am’, ‘My parents give me the feeling not to come up to their expectations (coded reverse)’ and ‘My parents only see my mistakes (coded reverse)’. We summed the scores on each item (range: 7–35, Cronbach’s alpha = 0.83, <italic>n</italic> = 11,727). On average, academic students reported a significantly higher parental support (28.55) than vocational students (28.19). Vocational students attending categorial schools report, on average, significantly higher parental support than those attending multilateral schools (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0001699311431595">Table 2</xref>). </p>
<p>As a measure of prior academic achievement, we used the GPA at the end of the year preceding the inquiry. This measure should be considered with caution. There are no standard tests (for example, centrally administered and standard examinations) in the Flemish educational system, which makes educational achievement very hard to compare across schools and across students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0001699311431595">Stevens, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, we need to rely on a self-reported GPA, yielding questions regarding validity because of memory problems and cover-up strategies. Not unexpectedly, this variable shows more missing values than other variables do (11.7 per cent). Notwithstanding these faults, it is the best measure we have to control for prior academic achievement. The mean GPA in this data set was 70.75. On average, academic students reported a significantly higher GPA (71.64) than vocational students (68.97). Academic students attending multilateral schools had, on average, a significantly higher GPA than those attending categorial schools (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0001699311431595">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>On average, academic students had significantly higher self-esteem (43.55) than vocational students (42.49, <italic>t</italic> = –6.020, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). This finding was confirmed in a multi-level analysis taking into account the students’ gender, age, SES, ethnicity and parental support: the students’ self-esteem was significantly, but modestly, associated with their track position (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0001699311431595">Table 3</xref>

<p>Unconditional multi-level analyses revealed that 4.40 per cent of the variance in self-esteem is between schools (<italic>τ<sub>0</sub> </italic>/(<italic>τ<sub>0</sub> </italic>+<italic>σ<sup>2</sup>
</italic>), with <italic>σ<sup>2</sup>
</italic> = 38.417, <italic>τ<sub>0</sub> </italic> = 1.766, <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.001). Separate unconditional analyses showed that for vocational students 5.46 per cent of the variance in self-esteem was between schools; for academic students this was 3.38 per cent. Overall, school type was not significantly associated with self-esteem (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0001699311431595">Table 3</xref>, main effect model 2a), but the relationship between track and self-esteem differed according to school type, as was evident from the significant positive cross-level interaction coefficient (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0001699311431595">Table 3</xref>, Model 2a: <italic>γ</italic> = 1.162, <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). This coefficient indicated that the difference in self-esteem is larger between academic and vocational students attending multilateral schools, than between academic and vocational students attending categorial schools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0001699311431595">Figure 2</xref>
). When the effect of track equalled 1.157 in categorial schools, it equalled 2.319 ( = 1.157 + 1.162) in multilateral schools. Multilateral schools clearly sharpen the difference in self-esteem between vocational and academic students. The interaction between track position and school type remained significant when taking into account GPA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0001699311431595">Table 3</xref>, Model 2b).</p>

</fig>
<p>So while the main effect of school type showed no significant association between school type and self-esteem, school type was associated with the magnitude of the difference in self-esteem between students attending different tracks. As interactions can be interpreted in two directions, we might as well say that the coefficient of 1.162 indicated the difference in the effect of school type between a vocational and an academic student. Whereas the effect of school type for vocational students was negative (be it not significant: –0.352, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05), it was positive for academic students (0.81 = –0.352 + 1.162), revealing that the larger difference in self-esteem in multilateral schools was due to the higher levels of self-esteem in academic students rather than to lower levels of self-esteem in vocational students (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0001699311431595">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
<p>The significant variance component in the final model (2.287, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) showed that there is still a significant proportion of the variance in self-esteem which can be explained at school level. And next to the significant coefficients of track and school type, the final model revealed significant associations of self-esteem with gender, age, ethnicity, parental support and GPA, confirming that boys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0001699311431595">Block and Robins, 1993</xref>), older students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0001699311431595">Block and Robins, 1993</xref>), immigrant students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0001699311431595">Van Geel and Vedder, 2010</xref>) and students who report more parental support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0001699311431595">Wenk et al., 1994</xref>) and a higher GPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0001699311431595">Allensworth and Kaplowitz, 1999</xref>) display higher levels of self-esteem. The traditional association with SES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0001699311431595">Rosenberg and Pearlin, 1978</xref>) disappeared when accounting for track.</p>

<title>Discussion </title>
<p>While there has been considerable research on the relationship between forms of within-school tracking and students’ outcomes, this study is unique in comparing how students’ global self-esteem is influenced by processes of within and between-school tracking. Using data from a representative sample of schools and students in Flanders, this study tests whether within-school tracking in secondary education sharpens the disparity in self-esteem between academic and vocational students. Although tracking research usually tends to focus on school-related outcomes, such as study involvement, it is important to examine the impact of educational stratification on general psychological outcomes such as global self-esteem as well. As adolescents spend most of their time at school, its impact is likely to exceed the pure educational context. Multi-level analysis confirms the association between track position and global self-esteem, namely the significant lower self-esteem of vocational in comparison to academic students. Moreover, this association is shown to be stronger in multilateral schools, indicating that within-school tracking, as predicted, tends to enlarge the difference in self-esteem. Importantly, this larger difference is not only due to the lower self-esteem of vocational track students in multilateral schools, as expected, but even more to the heightened self-esteem of the academic students. We predicted that the vocational students would display lower levels of self-esteem in multilateral schools, because feelings of inferiority due to relative deprivation are more likely as students get in touch with each other, and because within-school tracking seems more stigmatizing for lower-track students. However, school type did not seem to matter much for the self-esteem of vocational students. Academic students, on the other hand, tend to unfold a higher self-esteem in multilateral schools, likely because of a mechanism of ‘relative gratification’ which results when a non-deprived person compares him/herself with a deprived person (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0001699311431595">Davis, 1959</xref>). It seems plausible that by getting in touch with lower-track students, academic students are more inclined to compare themselves with their lower-track peers, leading to a higher awareness of status gratification and feelings of superiority, resulting in heightened self-esteem. </p>
<p>The effects of within-school tracking on vocational students’ self-esteem do not appear as detrimental as expected. Vocational students attending multilateral schools do not seem to manifest a pronounced lower self-esteem than those attending categorial schools. On the other hand, a recent study showed that within-school tracking reinforces differences in study involvement between vocational and academic students, because in multilateral schools vocational students are more likely to develop negative study attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0001699311431595">Van Houtte and Stevens, 2009</xref>). Although at first sight these findings seem contradictory, they might help to explain tentatively the present finding that within-school tracking does not seem to affect the self-esteem of vocational students. It should be borne in mind that members of stigmatized groups are known to try to protect their global self-esteem from being harmed by negative comparisons with others by, for example, devaluating those performance dimensions on which they fare poorly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0001699311431595">Major and O’Brien, 2005</xref>). As such, research has demonstrated that students in lower tracks develop an anti-school culture to overcome the status deprivation resulting from being in a lower track. The problem lower-track students confront is that they do not meet the criteria required by the educational system: their lack of perceived ability – based on achievement – pushes them into lower tracks. This entails a loss in status, as ending up in lower tracks is commonly considered as ‘failing’, which these students try to overcome by rejecting the system and the values it is based on, namely ability and hard work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0001699311431595">Ball, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0001699311431595">Hallam and Ireson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0001699311431595">Van Houtte and Stevens, 2010</xref>). Instead, they will focus on other sources of positive self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0001699311431595">Kelly, 2009</xref>). All this allows us to speculate on why the present data do not support the idea that within-school tracking has a negative effect on the self-esteem of vocational students: probably they have found ways to protect their self-esteem from being harmed, among which the rejection of typical school values, resulting in lower study involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0001699311431595">Van Houtte and Stevens, 2009</xref>). As such, the findings of both studies can be reconciled easily. </p>
<p>This interpretation has important theoretical implications as well, as it suggests that future research into the effects of status deprivation needs to take into account several contexts. Status deprivation in one context might be compensated in another; as such preventing deprived groups from developing negative self-feelings. Therefore, tracking research needs to consider other contexts than the school context – and other outcomes than genuine educational outcomes – to get an insight into the effects of educational stratification. Paying attention to general indicators of well-being seems obvious then. Furthermore, outcomes in other contexts than the school context need to be considered to discover how vocational students foster their self-esteem. Resisting school is a strategy to prevent the self-esteem from being harmed, but undoubtedly they will look for other sources of status outside the school walls as well, e.g. paid work, going out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0001699311431595">Kelly, 2009</xref>) – likely with negative consequences for their school career. </p>
<p>Whereas the results of this study do not show that putting different tracks together in one school provokes more negative self-feelings in lower-track students, they do show that for higher-track students attending a multilateral school might enhance their self-esteem, which might have favourable effects on their school grades – although the latter needs to be demonstrated. Because of the enhanced self-esteem of academic students, within-school tracking sharpens the difference in self-esteem between vocational and academic students. Future explorative (qualitative) research needs to examine the possible consequences of this disparity in self-esteem between academic and vocational students in multilateral schools regarding, for example, the relations between academic and vocational students. It also needs to be examined what exactly causes the stated disparities between academic and vocational students in multilateral schools. A plausible explanation might be that in a system of within-school tracking students from different tracks get in touch with each other more easily and get to know each other better than is the case in a system of between-school tracking. This familiarity will enhance social comparison, which is an important source of self-esteem. </p>
<p>Notwithstanding the possible adverse outcomes, familiarity between students in different tracks needs to be encouraged, unless society wants to develop into a dual society based on educational attainment. As such, within-school tracking may be preferable to between-school tracking. After all, Flemish research has shown that tracking also leads to the development of distinct cultural and political attitudes and values, and the between-school segregation of tracks is often blamed for these divergences. However, schools need to be aware that in a situation of within-school tracking students are more likely to take each other as a comparative reference group, yielding feelings of status deprivation in vocational students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0001699311431595">Van Houtte and Stevens, 2009</xref>) and feelings of status gratification in academic students. </p>

<p>We have no theoretical reasons for assuming that the slopes would not vary across schools. Therefore, in the first instance it is appropriate to estimate the variances for the slopes, and as such not to fix the variance components U at zero. In the final models, all non-significant variance components could be set to zero in order to simplify the models, but doing this does not alter the final conclusions. </p>

<p>In many ways the situation of these immigrant groups resembles that of the black minorities in the USA, typified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0001699311431595">Ogbu (1991</xref>) as involuntary or caste-like minorities. In particular, the second and third generations – born here – did not choose to be here and seem to have their minority status inflicted upon them against their will. They form a cultural model characterized by strong oppositional identity, distrust of mainstream society and a negative perception of the opportunity structure. They do not see the lack of opportunities as something temporary, and as such they do not try ‘to make it’ in the host society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0001699311431595">Hermans, 2004</xref>). The continuing matrimonial migration, in that young migrants tend to marry brides and grooms from their homeland, hampers the integration and assimilation process even more. </p>
