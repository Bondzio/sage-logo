<abstract>
<p>To date, little empirical study has tested the effects of service encounter performance, satisfaction, trust, commitment, and switching costs on word-of-mouth (WOM) intentions in a single framework. To fill this gap, this study attempted to investigate the roles that these variables play in determining WOM intentions of customers in a full-service restaurant by considering monetary and nonmonetary switching costs as moderators in WOM intentions, along with satisfaction, trust, and commitment. The results of the structural equation modeling showed that encounter performance, satisfaction, trust, and commitment had essential roles in generating WOM intentions, whereas satisfaction, trust, and commitment were found to act as partial or complete mediators in the proposed framework. Last, the tests verified the moderating effects of monetary and nonmonetary switching costs on the bonds linking encounter performance and satisfaction to WOM intentions. However, the paths from trust and commitment to WOM intentions were not moderated by switching costs. A key finding was that the perception of high switching costs may diminish customers’ intent to share word of mouth. Rather than attempt to create high switching costs, however, restaurateurs may improve WOM and reduce defections by paying careful attention to service excellence and meeting guests’ needs and desires.</p>

<body>
<p>Because word-of-mouth (WOM) has long been recognized as a vitally influential force in the marketplace, many studies have investigated the factors that influence WOM and the relationships among those factors in forming WOM intentions and behavior. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1938965511433599">Henning-Thurau, Gwinner, and Gremler (2002)</xref>, for instance, empirically verified the significant relationships among customer satisfaction, commitment, and WOM. In their study, satisfaction and commitment were relational quality variables, and WOM was a relational outcome variable. Their findings indicated that satisfaction was strongly related to commitment, and both satisfaction and commitment were key drivers in generating WOM. Combining satisfaction and trust into one construct (relationship quality), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1938965511433599">Kim, Han, and Lee (2001)</xref> also demonstrated the significant relationship between relationship quality, commitment, and WOM intentions.</p>
<p>Service failures are likely the main reason for customer dissatisfaction and resulting negative WOM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1938965511433599">Keaveney 1995</xref>). On the other hand, high levels of customer satisfaction, trust, and commitment induce customers to decide or behave favorably toward a firm, including recommending the restaurant and sharing positive WOM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938965511433599">Back and Lee 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1938965511433599">Kim and Han 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1938965511433599">Kim, Han, and Lee 2001</xref>). Thus, the challenge for restaurant operators is to find an effective way to generate favorable WOM by understanding the particular roles of service encounter performance, satisfaction, trust, and commitment in helping restaurant customers engage in favorable WOM.</p>
<p>One way service providers of all types attempt to keep customers from defecting is by increasing switching costs, which involve customers’ costs in changing services from one provider to another, including not only monetary expenses but also nonmonetary factors such as time, effort, and psychological costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938965511433599">Dick and Basu 1994</xref>). Despite the popularity of loyalty programs and other switching cost builders, research indicates that the perceptions of high switching costs possibly create a passive reason for customers to stay with a current provider although they may withdraw support by reducing positive WOM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1938965511433599">Fullerton 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1938965511433599">Han, Back, and Barrett 2009</xref>). Thus, another challenge for restaurant industry professionals is to identify the effectiveness or usefulness of switching costs in generating favorable WOM, particularly as costs relate to service encounter performance, satisfaction, trust, and commitment.</p>
<p>While the significant relationships among the constructs of service encounter performance, customer satisfaction, trust, commitment, and WOM intentions are quite apparent, key questions remain unaddressed. No researcher has yet attempted to develop a comprehensive model that integrates all these drivers with the effect of switching costs for restaurant customers. In addition, while the impact of switching costs on the link between satisfaction and intentions has been examined (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1938965511433599">Han, Back, and Barrett 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1938965511433599">Yang and Peterson 2004</xref>), their effect on the paths from encounter performance, trust, and commitment to WOM intentions has not been researched. Moreover, previous research has not clearly articulated an independent role for each dimension of switching costs in determining WOM intentions. This study attempts to reduce these gaps, with a model that aimed to test the moderating roles of monetary and nonmonetary switching costs in forming WOM intentions, and to examine the mediating roles of satisfaction, trust, and commitment in engendering WOM intentions.</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<sec id="section2-1938965511433599">
<title>Service Encounter Performance</title>
<p>This study bases its definition of a service encounter on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1938965511433599">Surprenant and Solomon’s (1987)</xref> definition, which involves the personal interaction between customers and employees of a service firm. It almost goes without saying that many empirical studies have verified that the performance of services during a face-to-face service encounter is an influential factor on satisfaction, trust, and behavioral intentions, such as word of mouth, repeat repurchase, and loyalty (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938965511433599">Bitner 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938965511433599">Briggs and Grisaffe 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1938965511433599">Gremler, Gwinner, and Brown 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1938965511433599">Zeithaml, Berry, and Parasuraman 1996</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1938965511433599">
<title>Customer Satisfaction</title>
<p>Although customer satisfaction has been defined in various ways in the marketing and consumer literature, we use the definition resulting from the customer’s evaluation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938965511433599">Back and Parks 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1938965511433599">Han, Back, and Barrett 2009</xref>). Thus, we draw from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1938965511433599">Oliver’s (1980)</xref> idea that customer satisfaction results when customers’ experience in a service encounter compares favorably with their expectations. Numerous studies in the service industry have empirically validated the linkages among satisfaction, trust, commitment, and WOM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938965511433599">Back and Lee 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1938965511433599">Han and Ryu 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1938965511433599">Ladhari 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1938965511433599">Henning-Thurau, Gwinner, and Gremler (2002)</xref>, for example, empirically verified the significant relationship among customer satisfaction, commitment, and WOM. They found that satisfaction is positively related to commitment, and both satisfaction and commitment are key drivers of WOM. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1938965511433599">Ladhari (2007)</xref> found that satisfaction greatly contributed to increasing likelihood of generating positive WOM, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938965511433599">Back and Lee (2009)</xref> identified country club member satisfaction as an important determinant of member loyalty.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1938965511433599">
<title>Trust</title>
<p>Trust is an essential element of these relationships. A customer holding a high level of trust toward an organization easily perceives positive outcomes, and believes that these positive outcomes will continue into the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938965511433599">Aydin, Ozer, and Arasil 2005</xref>). Trust has frequently been studied as an antecedent of WOM. Building on earlier studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938965511433599">Bendapudi and Berry 1997</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1938965511433599">Moorman, Zaltman, and Deshpande 1992</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1938965511433599">Gremler, Gwinner, and Brown (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1938965511433599">Henning-Thurau, Gwinner, and Gremler (2002)</xref> found that trust has a strong relationship with WOM. Trust also acts as a mediator. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938965511433599">Briggs and Grisaffe (2010)</xref> found that customer trust significantly mediates the relationship between service performance and behavioral intentions. In a restaurant setting, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1938965511433599">Kim and Han (2008)</xref> found that trust as a component of relationship quality mediates the influence of such factors as quality of performance and value on intent to share positive WOM and to repeat a purchase. In addition, trust has been frequently recognized as playing a central role in affecting commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1938965511433599">Morgan and Hunt 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1938965511433599">Ok, Back, and Shanklin 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1938965511433599">
<title>Commitment</title>
<p>Hospitality operators seek commitment from their customers in part because committed customers are less likely to switch providers and tend to spend more money than noncommitted customers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1938965511433599">Reichheld and Sasser 1990</xref>). Commitment is believed to be a vital component for building WOM intentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938965511433599">Brown et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1938965511433599">Pritchard, Havitz, and Howard 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1938965511433599">Kim, Han, and Lee (2001)</xref> found a positive relationship between commitment and repeat purchases and WOM intentions. Their findings indicated that commitment also is an intervening variable between relationship quality (i.e., satisfaction and trust) and WOM and repeat-purchase intentions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1938965511433599">Pritchard et al. (1999)</xref> also identified commitment as an important proximal cause of relational outcomes such as WOM and repeat purchase.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1938965511433599">
<title>Word-of-Mouth</title>
<p>As we said at the outset, WOM has long been recognized as a powerful force in attracting and retaining consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1938965511433599">Henning-Thurau, Gwinner, and Gremler 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1938965511433599">Wangenheim and Bayon 2004</xref>). The internet has required revision of past WOM definitions. This study follows the formulation of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1938965511433599">Stokes and Lomax (2002)</xref>, who limited the perspective of WOM to informal interpersonal communication between customers that is independent of corporate influence. Similarly, WOM intentions in this study include all product and service-related informal interpersonal communication intentions between a customer and others, with such communications being free from any corporate influence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1938965511433599">
<title>Switching Costs</title>
<p>We have seen little empirical research regarding the role of switching costs in explaining restaurant customers’ decision-making processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1938965511433599">Han 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1938965511433599">Jones et al. 2007</xref>). We have found no research investigating an independent role of switching costs in generating WOM intentions in a restaurant setting. Many researchers agree that switching costs include both monetary and nonmonetary aspects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1938965511433599">Klemperer 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1938965511433599">Kim, Kliger, and Vale 2003</xref>). As we said above, nonmonetary costs include time, effort, and psychological stress. In that regard, the psychological perceived risk is highest when a customer faces the uncertainty of an unfamiliar brand, particularly a service brand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1938965511433599">Sharma et al. 1997</xref>). For this reason, our study highlights the different impact of monetary and nonmonetary switching costs in the proposed complicated relationships among service encounter performance, satisfaction, trust, commitment, and WOM intentions.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most critical finding regarding high switching costs is that they apparently have a detrimental effect on WOM intentions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1938965511433599">Fullerton (2003)</xref>, in his study of the mobile phone sector, found that the positive effects of affective commitment on advocacy (i.e., recommendation and WOM praise) are tremendously diminished by the presence of high monetary and nonmonetary (psychological) switching costs. His study suggested that switching costs significantly affect the relationship between affective commitment and behavioral intentions. Additionally, in a service context, many researchers agree that relationships between customers and service providers are often significantly built on economic and psychological switching costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1938965511433599">Fournier, Dobscha, and Mick 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1938965511433599">Gundlach, Achrol, and Mentzer 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1938965511433599">Rigby, Reicheld, and Schefter 2002</xref>). In this regard, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1938965511433599">Fullerton (2003)</xref> concluded that although customer commitment enhances customer retention, when customers feel trapped in a relationship with a service provider because of high perceived switching costs, they respond to these feelings by reducing favorable WOM.</p>
<p>The significant moderating role of switching costs in the relationship between trust and intention to share WOM and repeat a purchase has been investigated by some researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938965511433599">Aydin, Ozer, and Arasil 2005</xref>; Bloom et al. 1978). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938965511433599">Aydin, Ozer, and Arasil’s (2005)</xref> study found a weaker relationship between trust and behavioral intentions in a customer group with high perceived switching costs than in a customer group with low perceived switching costs (again for the mobile phone sector). This is because the customer generally wants to avoid the associated perceived risks and uncertainty derived from the termination of the current relationship. That is, although customers’ trust level is low, customers who perceive high switching costs still form favorable behavioral intentions for a firm, and thus the link from trust to intentions become weaker.</p>
<p>Recently, many researchers have begun to investigate the moderating effect of switching costs specifically on the link between customer satisfaction and behavioral intentions (or loyalty) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1938965511433599">Han, Back, and Barrett 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1938965511433599">Jackson 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1938965511433599">Lee, Lee, and Feick 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1938965511433599">Jones, Mothersbaugh, and Beatty 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1938965511433599">Lee, Lee, and Feick et al. (2001)</xref> found that dissatisfied mobile phone customers who perceived high switching costs would not change carriers. Most critically, they concluded that dissatisfied customers can be mistakenly regarded as loyal. Further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1938965511433599">Jeong, Jang, and Han (2010)</xref> examined the moderating effect of switching costs and found that monetary and nonmonetary switching costs independently moderate behavioral intentions. Particularly, their study showed that although customers are not fully satisfied, they still build favorable intentions for a firm if they perceive high switching costs.</p>
<p>Although the moderating effect of perceived switching costs on the relationship between encounter performance and behavioral intentions has not been specifically identified, some research has attempted to examine the effect of switching costs on the relationship between service quality and behavioral intentions or loyalty. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938965511433599">Bell, Ahu, and Smalley (2005)</xref> found that high switching costs have a significant moderating role in the relationship between functional service quality and customer behavioral intentions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1938965511433599">Urbany (1986)</xref> found, for instance, that switching costs significantly affect the relationship between service quality and retention. His study also suggested that despite a low quality level, if customers perceive high switching costs, they do not switch.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1938965511433599">
<title>Mediating Effect of Study Variables</title>
<p>The literature suggests that satisfaction, trust, and commitment are key mediating constructs in forming behavioral intentions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1938965511433599">Henning-Thurau, Gwinner, and Gremler 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1938965511433599">Kim and Han 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1938965511433599">Morgan and Hunt 1994</xref>). In these studies, behavioral intentions frequently involve a customer’s willingness to engage in WOM activities and repeat a purchase. In examining determinants of restaurant customers’ loyalty intentions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1938965511433599">Kim and Han (2008)</xref> showed that satisfaction and trust have significant mediating effects in generating future intentions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1938965511433599">Morgan and Hunt (1994)</xref> found that unidimensional trust and commitment mediated the relationship among a variety of relational variables (i.e., relational antecedents and outcomes). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1938965511433599">Henning-Thurau, Gwinner, and Gremler (2002)</xref> found that commitment mediates the effect of relational benefits (e.g., trust) and WOM communication. These findings from previous studies indicate that satisfaction, trust, and commitment are key mediating variables in customers’ decision formation.</p>

<sec id="section9-1938965511433599">
<title>Hypotheses and Conceptual Model</title>
<p>Overall, this discussion implies that high-level service performance increases customer satisfaction, trust, commitment, and the likelihood of spreading favorable WOM, and that monetary and nonmonetary switching costs have a moderating role in forming WOM intentions. Given the findings of existing research, this study proposes the following eleven hypotheses. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1938965511433599">Exhibit 1</xref> shows the research model, which presents the associations among study constructs as well as moderating effects of monetary and nonmonetary switching costs.</p>

<title>Survey Instruments</title>
<p>To measure the study constructs, we adapted measurement scales validated in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938965511433599">Burnham, Frels, and Mahajan 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1938965511433599">Garbarino and Johnson 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1938965511433599">Kim, Lee, and Yoo 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1938965511433599">Mattila and Enz 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1938965511433599">Maxham and Netemeyer 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1938965511433599">Morgan and Hunt 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1938965511433599">Price, Arnould, and Deibler 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1938965511433599">Yang and Peterson 2004</xref>), using multiple items and 7-point Likert-type scales (shown in the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1938965511433599">appendix</xref>). Service encounter performance was measured with five items; customer satisfaction, trust, and commitment were assessed using three items each; WOM intentions were evaluated with two items; and monetary and nonmonetary switching costs were measured with two items each. We revised the scales based on the results of a pretest and on suggestions from two hospitality professors and two full-service restaurant managers. A pilot test of the final survey questionnaire with thirty restaurant customers indicated an acceptable level of reliability since all Cronbach’s alpha coefficients ranged higher than .70. In addition, the correlation patterns (i.e., within construct and between construct correlations) using the correlation matrix provided general evidence for convergent and discriminant validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1938965511433599">Churchill 1979</xref>).</p>

<title>Sample and Data Collection</title>
<p>A field survey was conducted over the course of two weeks early in 2009 at three full-service restaurants with different brand names (one American-style restaurant, one Korean-style restaurant, and one Japanese-style restaurant) in three metropolitan cities of the United States (two in a southeastern state and one in a midwestern state). We asked for approval for data collection from the manager of a randomly selected full-service restaurant in each city. These restaurants offered full table service, recorded check averages between $15 and $25, and provided customers with high-quality food, service, and atmosphere. The restaurants varied in size from 125 to 150 seats and employed 15 to 20 workers. Respondent selection included a convenience and self-selection factor, since customers could choose whether they actually wanted to evaluate the service encounter on this survey. Using a self-administered questionnaire, we collected data at different times of the day and on different days of the week to ensure an adequate representation of the population. The host distributed the questionnaire to every customer at randomly selected tables when they were seated, explained the purpose of the study, and assured guests that all responses would remain confidential and anonymous. The questionnaire had a cover letter that also mentioned confidentiality and anonymity. Customers who agreed to participate filled out the questionnaire sometime during the meal, and the wait staff collected the completed surveys at the end of the meal. We received a total of 263 surveys out of the 350 distributed (response rate = 75%). We had to exclude two surveys because of incomplete responses and extreme outliers, Mahalanobis’ <italic>D</italic> (20) &gt; 45.315, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, leaving us with 261 responses for data analysis.</p>
<p>Respondents’ mean age was 40.84 years, and 56.8 percent were female. The most commonly reported household income range (42.7%) was $55,000 to $69,999. Three-fifths of the respondents held bachelor’s degrees or graduate degrees, and a majority were Caucasian (63.6%), followed by African American (17.8%), Hispanic (10.1%), and Asian (7.0%).</p>

<title>Tools for Data Analysis</title>
<p>The collected data were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) on SPSS for Windows and AMOS 5. SEM assesses a series of dependent relationships simultaneously, is particularly efficient for modeling involving multiple independent and dependent variables, and is useful for testing mediation and moderation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1938965511433599">Hair et al. 1998</xref>). In keeping with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938965511433599">Anderson and Gerbing’s (1988)</xref> guidelines, we first estimated a measurement model using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) followed by the SEM for model evaluations, modeling comparison, and research hypotheses testing. The hypothesized moderating role of monetary and nonmonetary switching costs was assessed with a series of modeling tests for metric invariance.</p>

<title>Measurement Model</title>
<p>The results of the measurement model showed a good fit to the data (χ<sup>2</sup> = 303.323, <italic>df</italic> = 148, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = .064, comparative fit index [CFI] = .967, normed fit index [NFI] = .939). As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1938965511433599">Exhibit 2</xref>, the composite reliabilities of variables ranged from .696 to. 954, exceeding the minimum criterion suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938965511433599">Bagozzi and Yi (1989)</xref>. This indicated adequate internal consistency of multiple items for each construct. Based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1938965511433599">Fornell and Larcker’s (1981)</xref> suggestion, we tested construct validity. The average variance extracted (AVE) values ranged from .535 to .912, which are above Bagozzi and Yi’s (1988) suggested cutoff. This indicates an adequate level of convergent validity. Discriminant validity was established in that the squared correlation between a pair of constructs was found to be less than the AVE for each variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1938965511433599">Fornell and Larcker 1981</xref>). A close examination of the correlations among scales revealed that the measurement items within constructs were highly correlated (convergent validity), and these correlation patterns were different from the correlation patterns between constructs (discriminant validity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1938965511433599">Churchill 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1938965511433599">Hinkin 1998</xref>). However, high correlations were found among items for satisfaction, trust, and WOM intentions. Although they were below the problematic level of .80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1938965511433599">Hair et al. 1998</xref>), this test indicated that only preliminary evidence for the construct validity of the modified scales exists.</p>

<p>The effect of service encounter performance on satisfaction (β = .730, <italic>t</italic> = 11.842, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), trust (β = .283, <italic>t</italic> = 4.444, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), and WOM intentions (β = .199, <italic>t</italic> = 3.107, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) were positive and significant. Thus, hypotheses 1, 2, and 3 were supported. The findings indicated that satisfaction was a significant predictor of trust (β = .618, <italic>t</italic> = 9.180, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), commitment (β = .236, <italic>t</italic> = 2.574, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), and WOM intentions (β = .840, <italic>t</italic> = 9.412, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), thereby supporting hypotheses 4, 5, and 6. Hypothesis 7 was supported, as the path from trust to commitment was significant (β = .561, <italic>t</italic> = 6.005, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), but the linkage between trust and WOM intentions was not significant (β = .025, <italic>t</italic> = .280, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), meaning that hypothesis 8 was not supported. Last, as expected, WOM intentions were positive functions of commitment (β = .188, <italic>t</italic> = 2.950, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), supporting hypothesis 9.</p>
<p>Further analysis was conducted to test the mediating role of satisfaction, trust, and commitment in forming WOM intentions. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1938965511433599">Exhibit 4</xref>, indirect effects of service encounter performance on trust (β<sub>SEP</sub> → <sub>CS</sub> → <sub>Trust</sub> = .451, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), commitment (β<sub>SEP</sub> → <sub>CS and Trust</sub> → <sub>Commitment</sub> = .584, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), and WOM intentions (β<sub>SEP</sub> → <sub>CS, Trust, and Commitment</sub> → <sub>WOMI</sub> = .742, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) were all significant. In addition, indirect impacts of satisfaction on commitment (β<sub>CS</sub> → <sub>Trust</sub> → <sub>Commitment</sub> = .346, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and WOM intentions (β<sub>CS</sub> → <sub>Trust and Commitment</sub> → <sub>WOMI</sub> = .125, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) were positive and significant. Further, trust indirectly affected WOM intentions (β<sub>Trust</sub> → <sub>Commitment</sub> → <sub>WOMI</sub> = .105, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). These findings implied that satisfaction, trust, and commitment acted as mediators in forming WOM intentions in the proposed model. In particular, since the hypothesized direct paths (excluding hypothesis 8) were all significant, these variables can be described as partial mediators. However, commitment acted as a complete mediator in the relationship between trust and intentions, causing their insignificant direct relationship.</p>

<title>Metric Invariances</title>
<p>To test hypotheses 10 and 11 and their variations relating to the hypothesized effect of switching costs, we used <italic>K</italic> means cluster analysis to split the respondents into groups, first based on high and low monetary switching costs and then on high and low nonmonetary switching costs. The high monetary cost group comprised 149 respondents, and the low group had 112 cases. For nonmonetary switching costs, the high group included 159 respondents and the low group had 102 cases.</p>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1938965511433599">Steenkamp and Baumgartner’s (1998)</xref> suggestion, we compared the confirmatory factor analysis without constraining any factor loadings across groups (nonrestricted model) as against the full-metric invariance model, in which all factor loadings were set to be invariant (as summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1938965511433599">Exhibit 5</xref>). For monetary switching costs, a full-metric invariance model was supported, Δχ<sup>2</sup>(11) = 19.962, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .01, but that was not the case for the nonmonetary switching cost groups, Δχ<sup>2</sup>(11) = 26.081, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, since factor loadings between groups for nonmonetary switching costs were not equivalent. Accordingly, we then applied a partial-metric invariance test to the nonmonetary switching cost group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1938965511433599">Han, Back, and Barrett 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1938965511433599">Steenkamp and Baumgartner 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1938965511433599">Yoo 2002</xref>). The results of the subsequent test revealed that a partial-metric invariance, in which one invariant constraint between groups with a high value of the expected parameter change was relaxed, was supported, Δχ<sup>2</sup>(10) = 11.823, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .01. As a result of these tests, subsequent analysis used the full-metric invariance model for the monetary switching-cost groups and the partial-metric invariance model for the nonmonetary switching-cost groups.</p>

<title>Theoretical Implications</title>
<p>In contrast to previous studies, we took a relatively holistic approach with multivariate data analyses to extended previous studies regarding the formation of WOM intentions. We believe our study makes a contribution because it adopts a two-dimensional view in examining the role of switching costs in WOM. We found that monetary and nonmonetary switching costs significantly moderated the paths from service encounter performance and satisfaction to WOM intentions. More critically, this verifies the role of low switching costs with regard to the effects of encounter performance and satisfaction on WOM intentions. This finding extends previous research by highlighting the potential negative outcomes of both monetary and nonmonetary switching costs in inducing positive WOM intentions. However, our results also showed that the level of restaurant customers’ trust and commitment is independent of any perceived switching costs. Our study demonstrates that monetary and nonmonetary switching costs have an independent moderating role in the proposed theoretical framework. Thus, this research goes beyond recent hospitality research using switching costs as one construct in explicating intention formation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938965511433599">Back and Lee 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1938965511433599">Han 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1938965511433599">Han, Back, and Barrett 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1938965511433599">Han, Back, and Kim 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1938965511433599">Jones, Mothersbaugh, and Beatty 2000</xref>). To more clearly comprehend the formation of WOM intentions, researchers should consider using these two dimensions of switching costs.</p>
<p>Satisfaction, trust, and commitment do serve as mediators in the proposed framework of this study, but it is clear that this is a complicated matter and researchers should take care in modeling these constructs. This result was consistent with the findings of previous studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1938965511433599">Henning-Thurau, Gwinner, and Gremler 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1938965511433599">Kim and Han 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1938965511433599">Morgan and Hunt 1994</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section20-1938965511433599">
<title>Managerial Implications</title>
<p>For restaurant practitioners, creating ways to enhance service performances eventually contributes to increased satisfaction, trust, commitment, and WOM intentions. Efforts to enhance the service encounter performance would contribute to building social bonds between service employees and individual customers, increasing customers’ confidence level, enhancing their enduring desire to maintain a valued relationship, and finally boosting their intention to recommend and spread positive WOM. Further, restaurant operators should truly understand individual customers’ preferences and characteristics, the better to develop targeted and appealing services, promotions, and activities intended to increase customers’ satisfaction, confidence, and commitment with a goal of increasing favorable WOM.</p>
<p>The results indicated that restaurant customers who perceive low monetary switching costs but were highly satisfied reported greater intentions to engage in favorable word-of-mouth, as compared to those who felt they had high switching costs. These findings were consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1938965511433599">Fullerton’s (2003)</xref> notion that customers tend to diminish positive WOM communication when they feel locked into a relationship with a service provider. Having said that, we acknowledge that most restaurant operators (and indeed all service businesses) do seek to build various monetary and nonmonetary switching costs, notably, through loyalty programs, to encourage repeat business. Given our finding that the perception of high monetary switching costs can diminish favorable word of mouth, we instead suggest that restaurateurs focus on excellent service and meeting other customer needs to discourage customers from defecting.</p>
<p>The level of nonmonetary switching costs had no significant effect on WOM intentions. We also found that the relationship between commitment and WOM intention was not moderated by monetary or nonmonetary switching costs. Since the level of customers’ trust and commitment in the context of full-service restaurants does not depend on the existence of either type of switching cost, restaurant operators should strive to develop customers’ trust and commitment. In this context, we again point to the significance of the mediating variables in the proposed framework, namely, satisfaction, trust, and commitment. Helping customers improve their overall dining experiences through various strategies would be an effective tactic for improving satisfaction, trust, and commitment, all of which eventually contribute to generating favorable WOM.</p>
<p>In summary, this is one of the few empirical research studies to confirm for restaurant managers that superb service induces customers’ positive evaluation of their dining experiences and a high confidence and commitment level, thereby contributing to generating favorable WOM intentions, and that superb performance more effectively helps the patrons be good ambassadors for a restaurant when satisfaction, trust, and commitment are high. Furthermore, to our knowledge, this study is the first to caution restaurant practitioners that the perception of high switching costs could reduce favorable WOM intentions even when service is excellent. Also new is the finding that increasing trust and commitment for generating favorable WOM intentions is totally independent from the degree of monetary and nonmonetary switching costs.</p>

<title>Limitations and Suggestions for Future Research</title>
<p>A key limitation of this study is that it used a convenience sample. Moreover, the data were collected at full-service restaurants in three metropolitan cities, and thus, we should be cautious about generalizing the results to other restaurant segments or locations. Future studies could test the proposed model using a broader sampling range and in other types of restaurant.</p>
<p>Second, this study did not consider the effects of personality traits and demographic factors in forming WOM intentions. Testing the proposed model by considering the effects of personality traits and demographic factors would be a useful direction for future research.</p>
<p>Third, the proposed moderating impact of switching costs on some paths was not supported. The insignificant impact of switching costs on the trust and intention link may be caused by a complete mediating role of commitment, and the insignificant moderating role of switching costs in the link from commitment to intention may be attributable to suppressor effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938965511433599">Bollen 1989</xref>). Indeed, the direct path from trust to intention was not significant, and the impact of satisfaction on intentions was extremely high in both invariance models for monetary and nonmonetary switching costs (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1938965511433599">Exhibits 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1938965511433599">7</xref>). Future research should further examine the relationships among these variables in a different context and compare different ways of modeling these associations.</p>
<p>Fourth, this research did not delve into the debate regarding what drives positive or negative word of mouth. Most particularly, contrary to the expectations created by several studies, we see no theoretical explanation yet of why customers’ online reviews of restaurants are overwhelmingly favorable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1938965511433599">Pantelidis 2010</xref>). As an extension of this study, future research should examine the contradictory explanations for what drives either favorable or unfavorable WOM by integrating two-dimensional views of service performances (positive and negative) into the proposed model.</p>
<p>Fifth, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1938965511433599">Donaldson and Grant-Vallone (2002)</xref> illustrated the problem of mono-method bias by showing how it can distort conventional parameter estimates of the substantive relationships between constructs measured using the same method or data source. Therefore, concerns arise about the validity of the conclusions in this study. Future research using multiple sources of data should rule out the threat to validity of self-report and mono-source response bias.</p>
<p>Last, convergent and discriminant validity of the modified scales was not fully satisfactory because of the high correlations among satisfaction, trust, and WOM intentions. Future research should use a more thorough measurement adaptation procedure to ensure conceptual clarity or consistency of the items.</p>
