<p>The subject of Alice Mattoni’s book is how groups of precarious workers have used a variety of analogue and digital, alternative and mainstream media to mobilize. As she notes, most of the work that deals with social movements and media tends to focus on one of these four aspects, for example, how activists use alternative media or how mainstream media represent activists. The benefits of bringing the four aspects together to analyse the circuit of political communication as a whole are substantial if we wish to understand the significance and reach of social movements in the contemporary world.</p>
<p>Mattoni takes five case studies of precarious groups of workers in Italy from 2001 to 2006 including call centre workers, fashion workers and those employed on precarious or temporary contracts in universities. As well as interviewing the activists she examines their relationships with media objects (artefacts such as websites) and media subjects (for example, journalists, PR officers). Mattoni employs Dieter Rucht’s useful Quadruple-A approach examining how activists adopt four approaches to media use: adaptive (to the mainstream), abstention (from the mainstream), attack (on the mainstream) and alternative (to the mainstream).</p>
<p>The strengths of the book lie very much in the provision of data about the activists and their perceptions of events and approaches to media production and media subjects. Perhaps inevitably other elements of the circuit of political communication are left relatively under-examined. There is little by way of analysis of what media artefacts the activists produce, there is room for more systematic analysis of how ‘mainstream’ media report on or ‘frame’ the activities of these precarious groups, and it would have been useful to have some assessment of whether public attitudes (or those of political elites) to precariousness in Italy changed as a result. In other words, while Mattoni advances a very desirable holistic mode of analysis for examining social movements and media, she does not quite live up to the model in her book. Nevertheless, it is an important and well-researched book and it should be of interest to those who seek to understand the dynamic relationship between protest, alternative and mainstream media.</p>
