<title>Background</title>
<p>Osteoid osteoma is a classically described benign bone tumour. Traditionally, the surgical treatment of choice was excision, but this can have significant morbidity.

<sec id="sec1-0036933013482636" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Osteoid osteoma is a benign bone tumour commonly seen in children and young adults. This lesion has a central nidus of osteoid tissue and is surrounded by a reactive sclerotic rim.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0036933013482636">1</xref></sup> Although benign, it does cause pain that is classically worse at night and relieved by aspirin or other anti-inflammatory drugs. Although the condition tends to be self-limiting after a number of years,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0036933013482636">2</xref></sup> pain can be significant enough to consider intervention. Traditionally, the treatment of choice was surgical excision of the nidus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0036933013482636">2</xref></sup> Despite the small size of lesion, procedure often involved resection of a large section of bone in an attempt to ensure complete removal, but this potentially had significant morbidity and complications including the requirement for internal fixation and/or bone grafting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0036933013482636">3</xref></sup> Over the last decade or so, percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has become a widely accepted and successful treatment for osteoid osteoma. This technique has the advantage of being minimally invasive as CT guidance allows precise placement of the RF probe in the central nidus of the lesion. Several reports have supported the use of this technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0036933013482636">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0036933013482636">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0036933013482636"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0036933013482636"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0036933013482636"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0036933013482636"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0036933013482636"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0036933013482636">9</xref></sup> The purpose of this study is to report the outcomes using this technique in our regional bone tumour unit.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0036933013482636" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>Between May 2003 and October 2007, 14 patients (female, <italic>n</italic> = 4; male, <italic>n</italic> = 10) aged 15–32 years (mean age: 20.4 years) underwent CT-guided RFA treatment. These patients had typical radiograph, CT, MRI or isotope bone scan features of osteoid osteoma and had significant pain symptoms. The duration of pain prior to treatment varied from 2 months to 4 years. The lesions were located in the lower extremity (<italic>n</italic> = 13) and the upper extremity (<italic>n</italic> = 1). Children were not included in this study as they were treated at another unit. Each case of suspected osteoid osteoma was discussed at a multi-disciplinary meeting of the radiologists and orthopaedic surgeons in the setting of the regional referral centre for bone tumours, prior to embarking on RF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0036933013482636">Figures 1</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0036933013482636">3</xref>).

</fig></p>
<p>The RFA procedures were performed with the patient under general anaesthesia and CT guidance. A small skin incision was made and, if the location of the lesion was beneath dense bone, access to the nidus was facilitated by using a drill prior to the introduction of the RF probe. The position of the RF probe in the centre of the nidus was confirmed with a fine-cut CT slice before the ablation procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0036933013482636">Figure 4</xref>).

</fig></p>
<p>The protocol for ablation in our institute is heating the tip of the electrode to 90°C for 6 minutes. In total, 13 (92.9%) of the procedures were a technical success. One (7.1%) procedure was a technical failure as the RFA equipment malfunctioned and the patient only received 2 minutes of RFA treatment at 90°C instead of the intended 6 minutes. This represents the only intra-operative complication. No post-operative complications were encountered. No material from the nidus was sent for histology. All procedures were performed on a day-case basis. Patients were allowed to return to their daily activities as soon as comfortable.</p>
<p>All patients were subsequently reviewed in the out-patient clinic for up to 1 year post procedure. We monitored their history of pain relief and radiological evidence of lesion healing/recurrence. In addition, all our patients and their general practitioners were encouraged to contact us at any time after the procedure if their symptoms recur. Outcomes were taken from the Scottish Bone Tumour Registry database, clinical notes and imaging studies.</p>

<p>Eleven (78.6%) procedures provided prompt relief of pain symptoms. In three (21.4%) cases, the procedure was considered to be unsuccessful on first attempt though it should be noted that one of these cases was the one where technical problems were encountered with the equipment, meaning a suboptimal ablation was provided. The other two (14.3%) of these cases had incomplete relief of pain after the first RFA treatment. All three of the above patients had complete relief of symptoms after one further RFA treatment and have shown no signs of recurrence at last follow-up. One (7.1%) patient initially had complete relief of symptoms, but suffered a clinical and CT-proven recurrence 9 months after the initial treatment. This patient also had a second curative RFA treatment. He has shown no signs of further recurrence even after 12 months.</p>
<p>No significant side effects were detected immediately, post-operatively or reported at subsequent clinic review.</p>
<p>Follow-ups ranged from 3 to 18 months (mean: 10 months) and four patients declined to return to the clinic for follow-up.</p>
<p>Therefore, in summary, 14 patients (100%) had pain relief with RFA treatment. Four patients (28.6%) required a second RFA treatment to achieve pain relief. No cases of osteoid osteoma in the appendicular skeleton have required surgical excision since we began using this technique. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0036933013482636">Table 2</xref> summarises the patient outcomes.

<sec id="sec4-0036933013482636" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although osteoid osteoma is a benign tumour, the classic symptom of pain can be severe enough that active intervention is contemplated if analgesia alone is unsuccessful. Unfortunately, surgical resection can involve significant morbidity and complications, such as risk of fracture and infection. The difficulty of locating a small tumour (usually &lt;1.5 cm) intra-operatively can often mean more normal tissue is resected around the area to ensure complete removal. Furthermore, localising of the lesion during surgery can be difficult and its anatomical location may result in significant morbidity during the surgical approach. Consequently, over the last 10–15 years, there has been real interest in percutaneous RFA of these tumours and there have been a number of reports supporting the use of this technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0036933013482636">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0036933013482636">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0036933013482636"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0036933013482636"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0036933013482636"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0036933013482636"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0036933013482636"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0036933013482636">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Over 78% of our cases had complete relief of pain after one treatment. We feel that one of the unsuccessful cases was caused by an equipment failure where the ablation was given only for 2 minutes instead of6 minutes. Three patients (21.4%) had incomplete resolution of symptoms after the first RFA (including the technical failure), but all of these had full relief of their symptoms after a second RFA treatment. After initial relief following one RFA treatment, only one patient (7.1%) in this series had a symptomatic recurrence at 9 months post-procedure. This led to a good response to the second RFA treatment and there are no further signs of recurrence at 12 months’ follow-up. Thus, we have a primary success rate of 78.6%, a secondary success rate of 100% (after one additional procedure) and a recurrence rate of 7.1%. Our results are comparable with several of the existing reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0036933013482636">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0036933013482636">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0036933013482636">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0036933013482636"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0036933013482636">9</xref></sup> Importantly, no significant side effects were noted, though some have been reported in other series such as small burns and transient paraesthesia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0036933013482636">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0036933013482636">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0036933013482636">11</xref></sup> Certainly, the risks of complications are much lower with this method of treatment when compared to open surgical resection. It should be emphasised that no cases of extremity osteoid osteoma treated at our institution after 2005 have required surgical excision since we began using the technique.</p>
<p>One potential drawback to this technique is the lack of confirmed histological diagnosis. As mentioned above, all cases are reviewed in a multi-disciplinary meeting with musculoskeletal tumour radiologists and bone tumour orthopaedic surgeons. Only those with typical clinical and imaging features of osteoid osteoma are considered for RFA. No material is sent for histological examination in our institution for the following reasons: to attempt percutaneous biopsy prior to RFA would, in most institutions, require two procedures (later subsequent RF treatment) and the histological yield from such biopsies is disappointing with confirmation possible in &lt;50% of cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0036933013482636">12</xref></sup> There is little in the existing literature to support routine histological diagnosis prior to RF treatment, given the poor sensitivity and good clinical outcomes across the studies cited above. Of course, if there is clinical doubt of the diagnosis of osteoid osteoma, then biopsy prior to planning treatment would be prudent.</p>
<p>The above studies have examined osteoid osteoma lesions in the appendicular skeleton. There are some doubts regarding the safety of the procedure near critical neurovascular structures such as near the spinal cord due to the heat generated. The use of this technique for spinal lesions has not been accepted in the same way it has been for limb lesions. Several reports have suggested that this technique is safe and efficacious both in the cervical and the lumbar spine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0036933013482636">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0036933013482636"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0036933013482636"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0036933013482636">16</xref></sup> An intact cortical shell of bone should ideally be present between the nidus and the neural structures and one study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0036933013482636">14</xref></sup> has recommended supplementing the procedure with irrigation to reduce the temperature in an effort to safeguard the critical neural structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0036933013482636">15</xref></sup> Another study recommends performing these techniques under local anaesthesia as this allows conscious monitoring of any developing neurological damage. Although the technique of RFA for osteoid osteoma is undoubtedly effective, it’s safety remains questionable with respect to lesions in the axial skeleton. More research with bigger study populations is required to explore this topic further, especially in those lesions that lie very close to the spinal cord or nerve roots.</p>
<p>The present study is limited by its small numbers. We serve a comparatively small population of 2.2 million people and our total numbers reflect this. However, our results are proportionately similar to other published case series. Although our average follow-up is 10 months, all patients and their family doctors are advised to make contact with us if their symptoms recur. As we are the only regional referral centre for bone tumours in the West of Scotland and the only unit that offers RFA in the region, we believe we would be informed of any recurrences. Four patients did not return to the clinic after their treatment; however, we have had no communication from them, their general practitioners, or any other hospitals to suggest any recurrence. Our unit covers a large geographical area and patients potentially have to travel significant distances for each visit, therefore we believe this represents understandable non-compliance on the part of the patients. Our routine follow-up comprises visits to the out-patient clinic for symptom review, allied with plain radiographs to assess filling in of the defect left by the ablated nidus of the osteoid osteoma. Although CT scanning is more sensitive, we do not believe these should be used routinely for follow-up assessment. With satisfactory plain radiographs and no significant pain, we do not feel the comparatively high dose of radiation is justifiable in (young) patients for routine post-procedural monitoring. CT remains the preferred type of investigation in the case of suspected recurrence.</p>
<p>In summary, we believe that our results add further weight to the growing literature supporting RFA as the treatment of choice for osteoid osteoma. Our results are comparable with the other reports available in the literature on this topic. This procedure is now the preferred type of treatment at our institute for lesions located in the appendicular skeleton.</p>
