<abstract>
<p>This study investigated the associations of psychological and social variables with the likelihood of exhibiting three different behaviors as a bystander in a bullying situation. The sample comprised 238 Korean-American and Korean students, from the 3rd to 12th grades, studying in the USA. Students receiving classmate support showed a lower probability of exhibiting outsider behaviors in a bullying situation as compared to non-involvers, whereas those receiving teacher support showed less likelihood of exhibiting assistant, outsider, and defender behaviors as compared to non-involvers. Furthermore, students showing higher responsibility exhibited a lower probability of being a defender group as compared to the non-involvers, while those showing higher empathy demonstrated a greater probability of being in the defender group over non-involvers. The current study discusses the implications for bullying preventive interventions in school settings.</p>

<p>Bullying has become recognized as a problem due to its negative effects on school achievement, psychological status, and social skills for adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143034311430406">Boulton, Trueman, &amp; Murray, 2008</xref>). It is a phenomenon that has been recorded worldwide—including settings as widely distributed as Serbia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143034311430406">Popović-Ĉitić, Djurić, &amp; Cvetković, 2011</xref>); Finland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0143034311430406">Sairanen &amp; Pfeffer, 2011</xref>); Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143034311430406">Murray-Harvey &amp; Slee, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0143034311430406">Sakellariou, Carroll, &amp; Houghton, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0143034311430406">Skrzpiec, Slee, Murray-Harvey, &amp; Pereira, 2011</xref>); USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0143034311430406">Tenenbaum, Varjas, Meyers, &amp; Parris, 2011</xref>); England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143034311430406">Boulton, Smith, &amp; Cowie, 2010</xref>); Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143034311430406">Cassidy, Jackson, &amp; Brown, 2009</xref>); Taiwan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143034311430406">Cheng, Chen, Ho, &amp; Cheng, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0143034311430406">Wei &amp; Jonson-Reid, 2011</xref>); Greece (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143034311430406">Andreou &amp; Bonoti, 2010</xref>); Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0143034311430406">Hampel, Manhal, &amp; Hayer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0143034311430406">von Marees &amp; Petermann, 2010</xref>); Sweden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0143034311430406">Ybrandt &amp; Armelius, 2010</xref>); and Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0143034311430406">Shin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0143034311430406">Yoon, Bauman, Choi, &amp; Hutchinson, 2011</xref>). Bullying based on ethnicity is a serious and growing problem in a multicultural society such as the United States of America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143034311430406">Hanish &amp; Guerra, 2000</xref>). Previous studies found that Asian-American were more likely to be bullied than any other ethnic minority group in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143034311430406">Espelage &amp; Swearer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143034311430406">Mouttapa, Valente, Gallaher, Rohrbach, &amp; Unger, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0143034311430406">Shin, D’Antonio, Son, Kim, &amp; Park, 2011</xref>). Specifically, Asian-American students were more likely to be excluded from activities than African-American and non-Caucasian Hispanics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143034311430406">Fisher, Wallace, &amp; Fenton, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0143034311430406">Moran, Smith, Thompson, &amp; Whitney, 1993</xref>) with similar findings also reported in Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143034311430406">Boulton, 1995</xref>). Most target groups for ethnic minority studies on school bullying, however, have been African American and Hispanic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0143034311430406">Yoo &amp; Lee, 2008</xref>). Little attention has been paid to Asian American students in a bullying situation although their population in the USA is rapidly increasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0143034311430406">Shin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0143034311430406">Yoo &amp; Lee, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, few bullying studies have been conducted on Korean adolescents in the USA although Korean-American adolescents and Korean students studying in the USA are one of the fastest increasing Asian groups in the USA, with the dramatically growing number, from 69,130 in 1970 to 1,076,872 in 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0143034311430406">Shrake &amp; Rhee, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143034311430406">Lee and Koro-Ljungberg (2007)</xref> proposed that Korean students who either live as a minority or come to study in the USA may encounter various hardships such as bullying and racism because of skin color and language problems. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0143034311430406">Shin and colleagues (2011)</xref> found that 30% of Korean American experienced bullying and more than 70% of them observed others being bullied in a school, and that this group may be at higher risk than other ethnicity in the USA. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143034311430406">Kim (2007)</xref> reported that Korean adolescents who had never been bullied before exhibited a vague fear of being bullied. Like previous research where bullying was of interest to prevent and stop racial/ethnic targeting in schools, we investigated the psychological and social factors which were theoretically related to bystanders’ roles for Korean Americans in the USA.</p>
<p>Generally, <italic>bystander</italic> can be defined as an individual or a group of individuals indirectly involved in a bullying, as well as one who plays various roles during bullying as a member within the social context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143034311430406">Gini, Polzzoli, Borghi, &amp; Franzoni, 2008</xref>). Bystanders’ behaviors in a bullying situation differ in degrees, ranging from a passive observer to an active participant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0143034311430406">O’Connell, Pepler, &amp; Craig, 1999</xref>). Consequently bystanders have been categorized into three or four subgroups depending on their roles in a bullying situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0143034311430406">Salmivalli, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0143034311430406">Sanders, 2004</xref>): Facilitators of the bully, defenders of the victims, and just onlookers.</p>
<p>Prior research showed that 85% of adolescents have been involved as bystanders in a bullying situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0143034311430406">Nishina &amp; Juvonen, 2005</xref>). Bystanders’ efforts to ameliorate a bullying behavior were effective although the number of bystanders discouraging the bully’s behavior were relatively small as compared to those who assisted the bully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143034311430406">Hawkins, Pepler, &amp; Craig, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0143034311430406">Rigby &amp; Johnson, 2006</xref>). Given that more than 70% of Korean adolescents were observers of school bullying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0143034311430406">Shin et al., 2011</xref>), we hypothesized that those students can be utilized to prevent bullying and investigated which variables are associated with different types of bystanders’ behaviors.</p>
<p>Many psychological and contextual variables are assumed to be related to bystanders’ behaviors in a bullying situation. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143034311430406">Menesini et al. (1997)</xref> found that males and females showed varied attitudes and reactions toward the victim. With regard to the effects of age on a bystander’s behavior toward bullying, many studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143034311430406">Gini et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143034311430406">Menesini et al., 1997</xref>) consistently have shown that students’ positive attitudes toward the victim decreased as they became older. Other researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143034311430406">Eisenberg et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0143034311430406">Warden &amp; MacKinnon, 2003</xref>) examined the relationship between helping behaviors in a bullying situation and psychological characteristics (e.g. empathy and responsibility). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143034311430406">Eisenberg et al. (1998)</xref> claimed that children with high levels of empathy are more likely to exhibit prosocial behaviors (e.g. helping the victim) than others with low levels of empathy. Furthermore, findings from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143034311430406">Gouzhen, Li, and Shengnan’s study (2004)</xref> indicated that the empathy level of children from 8- to 12-years-old was positively associated with their helping behaviors in a bullying situation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143034311430406">Menesini, Codecasa, Benelli, and Cowie (2003)</xref> designed a befriending intervention program in which the bystanders’ responsibility was enhanced to prevent bullying in Italian middle schools and evaluated its effects on bullying. They found that the intervention program that increases students’ responsibilities resulted in a decrease in negative behaviors and attitudes toward the victim in a bullying situation. Other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143034311430406">Demaray &amp; Malecki, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0143034311430406">Salmivalli, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0143034311430406">Smith &amp; Myron-Wilson, 1998</xref>) also demonstrated that adolescents’ perceived social supports are associated with positive outcomes (e.g. school adaptation and reduction in problem behaviors). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0143034311430406">Salmivalli (1999)</xref> has suggested that peer support prevents and reduces bullying and decreases many problems regarding bullying. Low levels of perceived support from parents, teachers, and classmates could be related with negative outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143034311430406">Demaray &amp; Malecki, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143034311430406">Cairns, Cairns, Neckerman, Gest, and Gariépy (1988)</xref> also reported that students’ perceived peer support was negatively associated with aggressive behaviors.</p>
<p>Although several studies have investigated the relationship of psychological and social variables with bystanders’ behaviors in a bullying situation, these previous studies showed limitations. Specifically, most previous studies on bystanders were conducted with Anglo-American students, and even the few minority studies on bullying were based on either African-American or Hispanic students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143034311430406">Juvonen, Graham, &amp; Schuster, 2003</xref>). Little empirical research has been conducted to investigate the influences of psychological variables on bystanders’ behaviors for the Asian-American population, especially Korean students in the USA. Second, although the several studies discussed above have empirically investigated the associations of psychological variables with bystanders’ behaviors in a bullying situation, these findings cannot clearly differentiate the influences of psychological variables on each of the three or four types of bystanders’ behaviors. Further, because bystanders may show varying behaviors in a bullying situation, it is of theoretical and practical interest to examine the associations of psychological variables with the negative and positive types of bystanders’ behaviors. There is, therefore, a need to identify the direction and magnitude of effects of psychological variables on each type of behaviors exhibited by bystanders.</p>
<p>The current study aims to investigate how psychological and social variables are associated with three types of bystanders’ behaviors in the Asian population, especially Korean-American and Korean students in the USA, and can contribute to the design of an effective bullying prevention/intervention program.</p>

<p>Participants were 238 Korean-American (63.4%) and Korean students (23.9%) in the USA. They comprised 46.2% females and 46.2% males; 26%, 28.2%, and 39.1% of students were identified as those being enrolled in elementary, middle, and high school, respectively. This study collected data from six states in the USA (31.1%, Missouri; 7.6%, North Carolina; 29.0%, Pennsylvania; 17.2%, Illinois; 10.1%, South Carolina; 5.0%, Nevada). Of these students, 76.5% were from a public school and 15.5% were enrolled in a private school.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0143034311430406"><title>Participant Role Scales</title>
<p>Participant Role Scales (PRS) were adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143034311430406">Oh and Hazler’s (2009)</xref> study to identify bystanders’ roles. They revised the original PRS scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0143034311430406">Salmivalli, Lagerspetz, Björkqvist, Österman, &amp; Kaukiainen, 1996</xref>) and modified it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143034311430406">Camodeca &amp; Goosens, 2005</xref>). The revised PRS consisted of eight items describing the four different roles of bystanders: <italic>Assistant</italic>, <italic>reinforcer</italic>, <italic>outsider</italic> and <italic>defender</italic>. However, the scale used in the current study is composed of seven items with two items modified into one for the defender group. For the <italic>assistant</italic> group, items stating ‘I joined in the bullying when the bullies had started it’ and ‘I assisted the bullying by doing something for the bully’ were used. For the <italic>reinforcer</italic> group, items like ‘I giggled, laughed, shouted, or similar reactions’ and ‘I kept looking at the bullying and enjoying the situation’ were employed. For the <italic>outsider</italic> group, items stating ‘Nothing, I pretended not to notice what was happening’ and ‘Nothing, I went away from the situation’ were used, and for the <italic>defender</italic> group, ‘I tried to help in some way’ was used. Given low endorsements (i.e. <italic>n</italic> = 3, 1.3%) to the two items for <italic>assistants</italic>, we decided to categorize the bystanders into three subgroups: <italic>assistants, <italic>including</italic> reinforcers</italic>, <italic>outsiders</italic>, and <italic>defenders</italic>. Percentages of the subgroups in the study were 14.3%, 49.6%, and 27.3% for <italic>assistant, <italic>including</italic> reinforcers</italic>, <italic>outsiders</italic>, and <italic>defenders</italic>, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0143034311430406"><title>Demographic variables</title>
<p>This study included gender and grade as the demographic variables that were consistent with the previous studies showing the relation of gender and age with four types of bystanders’ behaviors. However, the focus of this study was the bullying in schools so that grade, rather than age, was used as a variable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0143034311430406"><title>Psychological variables</title>
<p>The Social Skills Improvement System (SSIS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143034311430406">Gresham &amp; Elliot, 2008</xref>) was employed to assess adolescents’ empathy and responsibility. SSIS is the revised scale of a social skills rating system (SSRS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143034311430406">Gresham &amp; Elliot, 1990</xref>), which was a norm-referenced and standardized social behavior scale. SSIS was designed to measure three domains (social skills, problem behavior, and academic competence) and is rated by multiple sources (i.e. student, teacher, and parent). This study used the student version of SSIS to assess the two social skill variables of empathy and responsibility. Specifically, empathy and responsibility were measured with six and seven items, respectively. A sample item for empathy is ‘I feel bad when others are sad’, and a sample item for responsibility is ‘I do my part in a group’. Participants were asked to respond to the items using a four-point Likert scale ranging from ‘Not true (1)’ to ‘Very true (4)’. Higher scores indicated a higher level of empathy and responsibility. Internal consistency reliability coefficients were 0.79 and 0.74 for empathy and responsibility, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0143034311430406"><title>Social support</title>
<p>Perceived social support was assessed using the Child and Adolescent Social Support Scale (CASSS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143034311430406">Malecki, Demaray, Elliott, &amp; Nolten, 1999</xref>). CASSS is a multidimensional self-report scale assessing perceived social support from three sources including parents, teachers, and classmates. CASSS originally consisted of 36 items and measures the frequency and importance of perceived social support.</p>
<p>This study only employed the frequency rating of perceived social support because the importance rating is intended for use in clinical interpretation. Students were asked to rate the frequency of perceived social support based on a six-point Likert Scale ranging from ‘Never (1)’ to ‘Always (6)’. Example items for parent, teacher, and peer support are ‘My parents listen to me when I need to talk’, ‘My teachers show me how to do things’, and ‘My classmates treat me nicely’, respectively. Internal consistency reliability coefficient was 0.94 for the perceived social support scale (specifically, 0.92 for parent support, 0.95 for teacher support, and 0.94 for classmate support).</p>

<sec id="sec8-0143034311430406" sec-type="methods"><title>Procedures</title>
<p>To be eligible for the current study, students had to be Korean Americans who were born in the USA or Korean students who were studying in the USA. To recruit participants we researched Korean Churches and weekend schools for Korean language on the Internet and sent an email along with a description of the study and a request for data collection to a youth administrator of each institute. Then, a researcher contacted administrators allowing us to collect the data at their facility in order to discuss whether they wanted to collect the data by themselves or wanted the researchers to do so. A researcher explained the survey procedure and sent the questionnaire with all the relevant information. The survey was implemented during the school hours in the Korean church and after the weekend language class in the Korean language schools.</p>

<sec id="sec9-0143034311430406"><title>Research design and data analysis</title>
<p>Participants in the study were categorized into a non-involved group and three bystander groups according to their bystander role. The three bystander groups, except for the non-involved group, were classified as <italic>assistants</italic>, <italic>outsiders</italic>, and <italic>defenders</italic>. A frequency analysis was utilized to investigate the differences in gender and grades across the four groups. Furthermore, a multinomial logistic regression analysis was employed to investigate how psychological and social variables distinguish between each of the three bystanders groups from the non-involved group. In multinomial logistic regression, odds ratios quantifying associations between theoretically related variables and the probability of being in each of the bystander groups relative to the non-involved group were reported. All analyses were performed with SPSS 15.0.</p>

<sec id="sec11-0143034311430406"><title>Differences in gender and grade among four groups</title>
<p>Before examining the associations of theoretically related variables with the bystander groups in a bullying situation, we investigated whether there were differences in demographic variables across the four groups. Of the 238 participants, 231 (97.1%) participants were included in this analysis because seven of them did not report their gender and grade. There was no significant difference in gender among the four groups, χ<sup>2</sup> (4) = 1.47, <italic>n</italic> = 231, <italic>p</italic> = 0.84. However, the four groups showed significant differences in their grade bands, χ<sup>2</sup> (6) = 24.275, <italic>n</italic> = 231, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01. For example, in the 3rd-to-6th grade band, the number of participants in the non-involved, assistant, outsider, and defender groups were 14 (6.3%), 5 (2.3%), 38 (17.2%), and 4 (1.8%), respectively. Interestingly, the outsider group was the largest group in all grade bands: 38 (17.2%), 39 (17.6%), and 33 (14.9%) for the 3rd to 6th, 7th to 9th, and 10th to 12th grade bands, respectively.</p>

<p>Correlations among variables were estimated and evaluated in order to examine multicollinearity before conducting the multinomial logistic regression analysis. Results in a correlation analysis showed estimates ranging from 0.02 to 0.58, indicating that none of the seven variables was strongly interrelated; therefore, all variables of interest were included in the analysis of their associations with bullying behaviors.</p>
<p>In order to examine the associations of variables of interest with group membership in a bullying situation, a multinomial logistic regression was used. Given the interest in how those involved in a bullying situation were different from those not involved in such a situation, the non-involved group was considered as a reference group.

<p>In the comparison of the assistant group with the non-involved group, adolescents reporting more perceived teacher support were less likely to be the assistant group than the non-involved group, Odds Ratios (OR) = 0.94, 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) = [0.89, 0.98]. Specifically, if the adolescents received one more unit of teacher support, their relative risk (RR) of belonging to the assistant group over the non-involved group decreased by about 6%. However, the other variables were not statistically significant in predicting the relative likelihood of being the assistant group over the non-involved group.</p>
<p>The outsider group was compared with the non-involved group. Those who were higher in the grade bands, perceived more teacher support, and more classmate support were less likely to be the outsider group than the non-involved group, OR = 0.84, 95% CI = [0.72, 0.98] for grade bands, OR = 0.96, 95% CI = [0.93, 0.99] for perceived teacher support, and OR = 0.96, 95% CI = [0.93, 0.99] for perceived classmate support. Given a one-unit increase in the grade bands, teacher support, and classmate support, the RR of belonging to the outsider group than the non-involved group decreased by 6%, 4%, and 4%, respectively. However, the other variables were not statistically significant in predicting the RR of being the outsider group over that of the non-involved group.</p>
<p>In the comparison of the defender group with the non-involved group, the RR of belonging to the defender group over the non-involved group were significantly related to empathy, OR = 1.37, 95% CI = [1.08, 1.72], responsibility, OR = 0.74, 95% CI = [0.61, 0.91], and teacher support, OR = 0.94, 95% CI = [0.89, 0.98]. Interestingly, adolescents showing more empathy exhibited a higher probability of belonging to the defender group than that of belonging to the non-involved group, whereas those having a higher level of responsibility and perceived teacher support showed a lower probability than that of belonging to the non-involved group. One-unit increase in empathy increased the relative likelihood of belonging to the defender group rather than the non-involved group by about 37%. Additionally, given a one-unit increase in responsibility and teacher support, the RR of belonging to the defender group over the non-involved group decreased by 39% and 6%, respectively. However, the other variables were not statistically significant in predicting the RR of being in the defender group over the non-involved group.</p>

<sec id="sec14-0143034311430406"><title>Discussion and implications</title>
<p>This study examined the association of theoretically related variables with the RR of belonging to each of the three bystander groups (i.e. assistant, outsider, and defender) over the non-involved group in a bullying situation. Findings in this study showed slightly different implications of gender differences in bystanders’ behaviors in a bullying situation. Unlike most previous studies regarding gender differences in bystanders’ behaviors, gender was unrelated to bystanders’ behaviors in the current study. Specifically, previous studies found that male adolescents seemed to be more actively involved as facilitators than other groups in a bullying situation, whereas female students were more likely to take on the role of an outsider or defender than other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0143034311430406">Rigby &amp; Johnson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0143034311430406">Salmivalli et al., 1996</xref>). Given that the current study was conducted with Korean students and that most previous studies were conducted with non-Asian students, inconsistent findings regarding gender differences in bystanders’ behaviors may imply that the relationship between gender and bystanders’ behaviors in a bullying situation is moderated by ethnicity. Findings regarding grade differences showed that students in higher grades were more actively involved in a bullying situation as a facilitator or defender than just passively avoiding the situation. This result is consistent with previous literature.</p>
<p>The second finding indicated that empathy and responsibility were associated with only a defender in a bullying situation. However, those variables were unrelated to being an assistant and outsider. This finding was consistent with other research on the role of empathy. Previous literature has consistently showed that empathy has a positive relation with prosocial behavior, such as helping people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143034311430406">Eisenberg &amp; Miller, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0143034311430406">Strayer &amp; Roberts, 2004</xref>) and was inversely related to aggressive behavior in adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143034311430406">Miller &amp; Eisenberg, 1988</xref>). This study broadens the role of empathy in a bullying situation such that those with higher levels of empathy are more likely to be defenders in a bullying situation and can theefore assist in reducing bullying.</p>
<p>Unlike empathy, more responsibility was less likely to help the victims. As a possible explanation for this result, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0143034311430406">Stueve et al. (2006)</xref> reported that a bystander’s responsibility decreased in the presence of others. Because bullying often occurs in a social event and several students can be involved simultaneously in a bullying situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0143034311430406">Salmivalli et al., 1996</xref>), those experiencing more reduced responsibility than others are less likely to help the victims regardless of the level of responsibility in their daily lives. Although the influence of responsibility on the likelihood of being assistants and outsiders was insignificant, the direction of effects might imply that responsibility may reduce negative behaviors in a bullying situation. To identify the effect of responsibility in a bullying situation, further research will be necessary.</p>
<p>Another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0143034311430406">Orpinas, Horne, &amp; Staniszewski, 2003</xref>) also demonstrated that teacher support was a key factor in designing a bullying prevention program. However, teacher support in this study showed varied influences according to bystanders’ behaviors. Specifically, teacher support was related to a reduction in the likelihood of both assisting and ignoring bullying. Simultaneously, it was associated with a reduction in the probability of helping the victim. Therefore, teachers’ support is more effective in decreasing negative behaviors than in encouraging positive behaviors. On the other hand, this study found that peer support was associated with a decrease in outsiders’ behaviors and not with either assistants’ or defenders’ behaviors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143034311430406">Lee and Koro-Ljungberg (2007)</xref> reported that minority students in the USA showed prosocial behaviors in a bullying situation when the major ethnic group of students was favorable to them. Given the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0143034311430406">Cowie and Olafsson (2000)</xref> suggestion that peer support helps to increase the students’ interaction and to lessen prejudice and conflict across ethnic groups, peer support may be a very important variable in the case of minority students.</p>
<sec id="sec15-0143034311430406"><title>Limitations and future direction</title>
<p>Findings in this study demonstrated that psychological and social variables had different influences on each type of bystander behaviors. Social variables such as teacher and peer support were more related to a decrease in negative behaviors in a bullying situation, and psychological variables were more strongly associated with helping the victim. However, it is difficult to generalize these findings because of inconsistent results of previous and current studies on predictors influencing bystanders’ behaviors. Additionally, unlike most prior research this study considered various participants’ behaviors in a bullying situation. Therefore, we suggest that more research should be conducted to generalize the findings of this study on the development of specific and differentiated programs aimed at bystanders’ behaviors.</p>
<p>Another limitation is our use of self-report in identifying bystanders’ behaviors; respondents may either over-report or misreport their status in a bullying situation given the discrepancy of perceptions between respondents and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0143034311430406">Perry, Kusel, &amp; Perry, 1988</xref>). A multi-informant approach activating sources around a participant, such as peers, teachers, and parents would be the best for producing best estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0143034311430406">Pellegrini, 2001</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-0143034311430406"><title>Implications</title>
<p>This study confirms prior reports that bystanders are a valuable resource for preventing bullying in school. We showed how theoretically related variables are associated with each type of bystanders’ behavior in a bullying scenario for Korean American students —one of the most likely bullied Asians in the USA. While findings from this study may not be generalized to all Asian Americans because of inter-group differences among the Asian American groups, this study provides several implications for stakeholders who plan to design preventive intervention programs for ethnic minority students. Our findings indicate that preventive intervention programs should consider the different roles of bystanders in the situation to stop bullying in schools. To reduce the prevalence of bullying, preventive intervention programs should be designed to include factors that decrease bystanders’ behavior of facilitating the bully, and increasing bystanders’ assistance to the victim. In doing so, empathy is a more important factor than responsibility in accelerating the defender’s role in a bullying situation. The findings also suggest that if students perceived more support from teacher and friends in a school, they are less likely to assist the bully. Therefore, effective preventive intervention programs in stopping bullying should emphasize supports from teachers and friends in a school.</p>
