<abstract>
<p>This article argues that the widespread hypothesis stating that intra-party democracy has declined since the glory days of the mass party is too sweeping and, largely, empirically groundless. In order to test it the article draws on a comparison between two internal policy-making processes within the Swedish social democratic party (SAP), one concerning an expansion of welfare benefits in the 1950s and the other concerning a retrenchment in the 1990s. If intra-party democracy is in a state of decline, the results of the comparison most likely should confirm this tendency. Yet the article concludes that party leaders exercised considerably less control, while activists were much more influential in the 1990s than in the days of mass party mobilization in the 1950s. Therefore, drawing on a single case study, the article casts doubts over the influential decline hypothesis and proposes new venues for research on the fate of intra-party democracy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1354068811407583">Robert Michels' (1962)</xref> classic ‘iron law of oligarchy’, party scholars generally assume that elites gradually establish control over party organizations at the expense of members and activists (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354068811407583">Duverger, 1954</xref>: 133–5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1354068811407583">McKenzie, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1354068811407583">Kirscheimer, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1354068811407583">Janda, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1354068811407583">Panebianco, 1988</xref>). This idea is particularly pronounced in contemporary research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354068811407583">Allern and Pedersen, 2007</xref>: 69). Several prominent scholars argue that modern party organizations have forsaken ideals and practices associated with the mass party – for example participation, deliberation, and leadership accountability (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1354068811407583">Hopkin, 2004</xref>: 645). Over the course of time, parties have instead transformed into internal cartels controlled by career professionals (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354068811407583">Katz and Mair, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354068811407583">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354068811407583">Mair, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354068811407583">Katz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354068811407583">Blyth and Katz, 2005</xref>). Although new, inclusive procedures for candidate selection appear to empower rank and file members (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1354068811407583">Rahat et al., 2008</xref>), such reforms are regularly claimed to be attempts by cartel party leaders to exclude activists from policy-making (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354068811407583">Mair, 1997</xref>: 113–14, 146–52; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354068811407583">Katz, 2001</xref>: 290; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354068811407583">Katz and Mair, 2009</xref>: 759). Accordingly, when comparing policy-making in the mass party with the elites striving for autonomy in the cartel party,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1354068811407583">1</xref>
</sup> mainstream party research tends to hypothesize, implicitly or explicitly, that intra-party democracy has declined, if not disappeared altogether (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1354068811407583">Scarrow and Gezgor, 2010</xref>). However, in this article, I wish to argue that this widely-purveyed hypothesis is too sweeping and is, at least partly, empirically unfounded.</p>
<p>First, most accounts on the erosion of intra-party democracy are based on anecdotic evidence, whereas in-depth empirical analysis – in particular comparisons over time – is lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1354068811407583">Teorell, 1998</xref>: 340–41; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354068811407583">Kitschelt, 2000</xref>: 174). Furthermore, neither internal decision-making procedures nor the history of party activism has been sufficiently analyzed in previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354068811407583">Allern and Pedersen, 2007</xref>: 86; Birnir, 2009: 30). Second, in opposition to the cartel party thesis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354068811407583">Herbert Kitschelt (2000)</xref> argues that the limited room for popular reform in contemporary politics, together with declining class loyalty and party identification, forces party elites to be more, not less, sensitive to increasingly-unruly members. Somewhat surprisingly, the proponents of the cartel party thesis have failed to address this rival hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354068811407583">Blyth and Katz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354068811407583">Katz and Mair, 2009</xref>). Therefore, with the aim of further developing it, this article sets out to test the under-studied, but influential, hypothesis stating that intra-party democracy has declined since the heyday of the mass party.</p>
<p>Employing previously uncharted data, the article compares two internal policy-making processes surrounding two contested pension reforms within the Swedish social democratic party (SAP). In 1959, the SAP triumphed in a fierce political battle; the party pushed through the supplementary pension scheme, ATP (allmän tilläggspension [universal supplementary pension scheme]), by a close margin in parliament in 1959, after one referendum in 1957 and a re-election in 1958 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1354068811407583">Molin, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1354068811407583">Svensson, 1994</xref>). Approximately 30 years later, in 1991, the social democratic party elite instead faced fierce opposition from the party on the ground after striking a deal with the newly-elected right-wing government to reform the ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354068811407583">Lundberg, 2003</xref>). If intra-party democracy is in a general state of decline, I argue that there are three reasons why the comparison between these two cases <italic>most likely</italic> should confirm this tendency.</p>
<p>First, the comparison weighs what appears to be a rather clear-cut example of party system cartelization in the 1990s against a catch-all strategy in the 1950s, designed by the leadership to attract middle-class voters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1354068811407583">Svensson, 1994</xref>). Although public pensions have been described as an issue of huge strategic and ideological importance to the party both in the 1950s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1354068811407583">Svensson, 1994</xref>) and in the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354068811407583">Anderson and Meyer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354068811407583">Lundberg, 2003</xref>), party leaders clearly needed to mobilize the resources of the mass party to prevail in the 1950s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1354068811407583">Ruin, 1986</xref>), whereas they should have had strong incentives to cut off activists from policy-making in the 1990s. In fact, previous research already views the difference between internal policy-making surrounding these two reforms as symptomatic of evolving oligarchic control within the SAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354068811407583">Lundberg, 2003</xref>: 275). Second, while a common assessment is that membership influence is in a general state of decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1354068811407583">Pettitt, 2007</xref>: 230), policies of retrenchment – like the Swedish pension reform in the 1990s – are thought to present contemporary social democratic leaders with particularly strong incentives to leave the legacy of the mass party behind and obstruct activist influence (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1354068811407583">Kitschelt, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1354068811407583">2001</xref>). Third, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354068811407583">Katz and Mair (1995</xref>: 17) suggest that political parties in Sweden, given their tradition of cooperation and mutual agreement on generous state support, are especially likely to behave like secluded cartels. In line with this, previous research has concluded that intra-party democracy in Swedish parties – notability in traditional mass parties like the SAP – has deteriorated since the 1950s (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354068811407583">Pierre and Widfeldt, 1994</xref>: 343–6).</p>
<p>Yet, contrary to these expectations, the article concludes that SAP party leaders in the 1990s exercised considerably less control over internal policy-making and propaganda than their predecessors did in the 1950s, in the glory days of the mass party. Therefore, drawing on a single comparative case study, the article casts doubts over the influential postulates of increased elite autonomy and proposes new venues for research on the fate of intra-party democracy.</p>
<p>The article proceeds as follows: the first section presents the concept of intra-party democracy and briefly reviews the decline hypothesis. The second section introduces criteria for evaluating varying degrees of leadership control and discusses data and operationalizations. The third and fourth sections present the results, while the final section concludes.</p>

<title>Intra-party democracy and the decline hypothesis</title>
<p>Ever since Robert Michels' (1962) celebrated study, intra-party democracy has rather loosely been associated with a party model in which leaders represent, and ultimately are accountable to, members (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1354068811407583">Teorell, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354068811407583">Allern and Pedersen, 2007</xref>: 73–5). Correspondingly, party oligarchy refers to a party organization in which members and activists are irrelevant to policy-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1354068811407583">Michels, 1962</xref>: 61, 308). Thus, although intra-party democracy also depends on the inclusiveness of procedures for candidate selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1354068811407583">Michels, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1354068811407583">Bille, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354068811407583">Bolleyer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1354068811407583">Rahat et al., 2008</xref>), genuine empowerment of members is first and foremost a matter of whether mid-level activists can supervise, and exercise control over, party policy (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354068811407583">Katz and Mair, 1995</xref>: 10–11; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354068811407583">Katz, 2001</xref>: 283–92; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1354068811407583">Hopkin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354068811407583">Blyth and Katz, 2005</xref>: 37; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1354068811407583">Pettitt, 2007</xref>: 230).</p>
<p>Although party scholars, in line with Michels' influential thesis, never thought that this kind of membership influence was much more than a formality (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354068811407583">Duverger, 1954</xref>: 133–5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1354068811407583">McKenzie, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1354068811407583">Panebianco, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354068811407583">Katz, 2001</xref>: 293), the mass party model is still viewed as significantly closer to the democratic ideal than present-day parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1354068811407583">Hopkin, 2004</xref>: 646; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354068811407583">Allern and Pedersen, 2007</xref>: 69). Moreover, in spite of hierarchical structures and democratic flaws, mass parties are commonly described as avenues for mass input into politics (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1354068811407583">Pettitt, 2007</xref>: 235) and important arenas for ‘real discussions' about policy alternatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354068811407583">Allern and Pedersen, 2007</xref>: 75). Yet according to the influential cartel party thesis, such organizational features – however limited they might have been in reality – are things of the past. Similar to Michels' original theory, the proponents of this thesis hypothesize that the significance of the extra-parliamentary party, and opportunities for membership influence, gradually diminishes over time (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354068811407583">Katz and Mair, 1995</xref>: 7; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354068811407583">Mair, 1997</xref>: 153; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354068811407583">Blyth and Katz, 2005</xref>: 37; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1354068811407583">Michels, 1962</xref>: 61, 308), while party leaders increasingly pursue policy agendas divorced from the preferences of the party on the ground (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354068811407583">Blyth and Katz, 2005</xref>: 40–4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354068811407583">Katz and Mair, 2009</xref>: 756; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1354068811407583">Michels, 1962</xref>: 221).</p>
<p>Whereas scholars have evaluated the cartel party thesis at the party system level (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354068811407583">Detterbeck, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1354068811407583">Scarrow, 2006</xref>), the inner life of party organizations remains largely unexplored (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354068811407583">Bolleyer, 2009</xref>). Yet, in the following, I will present empirical indicators consistent with the main premises of increased leadership control over internal policy-making and agendas.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1354068811407583">
<title>Indicators of leadership control</title>
<p>Following Steven <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1354068811407583">Lukes (2005</xref>: 14–38), power can be conceptualized as leadership control over: (i) concrete decision-making procedures (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1354068811407583">Dahl, 1958</xref>); (ii) political agendas; and (iii) the formation of preferences. This three-dimensional view is clearly consistent with Michels' theory and the cartel party thesis, both of which highlight the decreasing power of members in formal decision-making arenas – notably the party congress – along with increasing leadership control over political agendas. Hence, in order to compare degrees of intra-party democracy over time, I attempt to incorporate indicators of all three views of power in the analysis: the first two criteria below primarily gauges leadership control over concrete policy-making, whereas the third concerns power over agendas and preference formation.</p>
<p>If intra-party democracy is declining, the comparison in the article should display: (criterion 1) that internal policy deliberations and debates become less intensive and less relevant to the policy alternatives contemplated by party leaders (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354068811407583">Kitschelt, 2000</xref>: 164); (criterion 2) that the party on the ground, particularly activists at the party congress, has less impact on the actual policies pursued by party leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354068811407583">Katz and Mair, 1995</xref>: 17, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354068811407583">2009</xref>: 756–60). Moreover, if <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354068811407583">Katz and Mair (2009</xref>: 756) are correct when assuming that the preferences of party leaders increasingly will be ‘treated as being the interests of the party writ large’ (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1354068811407583">Michels, 1962</xref>: 221), instruments for communication and propaganda ultimately controlled by the party elite – in this case the party press – should become less informative about alternative policies, and also less critical of the choices made by leaders (criterion 3).<sup>

</sup>
</p>
<sec id="section4-1354068811407583">
<title>Operationalizations and data</title>
<p>Criteria 1 and 2 both concern potential leadership control over ideologically-committed activists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1354068811407583">May, 1973</xref>: 135–6).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1354068811407583">3</xref>
</sup> Criterion 1 – the importance of internal policy deliberations – is evaluated, drawing on the following two sub-criteria:<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>C1.1 Alternative policies: If alternative policy preferences do not exist, it is, at least when studying concrete decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1354068811407583">Lukes, 2005</xref>: 20), pointless trying to gauge elite control over formal decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1354068811407583">Dahl, 1958</xref>). Therefore, the analysis must reveal one official party policy, endorsed by the leadership, but also <italic>diverging</italic> alternatives preferred by activists. Moreover, the mere existence of policy alternatives obviously suggests that leaders do not have exclusive control over agendas or preferences.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>C 1.2 Importance of policy deliberations: In order to tap into the <italic>importance</italic> of internal deliberations, the number of motions – proposing diverging alternatives – officially acknowledged by the party congresses is accounted for. Furthermore, party leaders' official, and unofficial, response to alternative suggestions is evaluated.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>If intra-party democracy is in a general state of decline, the analyses of criteria 1.1–1.2 should indicate that the intensity of internal debates diminishes in the 1990s, and also that the party leaders increasingly disregard policy alternatives preferred by activists.</p>
<p>Criterion 2 – the impact of the party on the ground – is evaluated, employing the following sub-criteria:<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>C 2.1 The power of the party congress: Decision-making procedures inside parties can of course be a facade, hiding the real actions of elites in the parliamentary arena (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354068811407583">Katz and Mair, 2009</xref>: 756). Still, in order to partly appraise the importance of the internal decision-making process, the analysis asks whether the party congress – that is, the majority of delegates – debated, and officially sanctioned, the final party decision.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>C 2.2 The impact of activism: In order to evaluate this criterion, the analysis attempts to determine if alternatives proposed by activists constrained the party leaders and, in that case, if these alternatives ultimately affected the final policy pursued by the party in public office.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1354068811407583">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>If the thesis under scrutiny is correct, the analyses of criteria 2.1–2.2 should show that the party congress and potential activists challenging official party policy imposed less of a constraint on leaders in the 1990s than in the 1950s.</p>
<p>Criterion 3 – propaganda in the party press – is evaluated making use of two content analyses covering all articles concerning pensions between 1956–9 and 1994–7 in SAP’s largest internal magazine <italic>Aktuellt i Politiken</italic> (Current Issues in Politics).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1354068811407583">5</xref>
</sup> The following criteria are used to code the articles (coding procedures, and methodological considerations, are discussed in end notes):<list list-type="simple">

<title>Comparing internal policy-making</title>
<p>The two policy-making processes compared in the article were equally extended – the most intensive deliberations lasted for four years respectively, 1956–9 and 1994–7. Moreover, leaders and activists clearly viewed pensions as <italic>the</italic> central political issue of their respective time periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1354068811407583">Molin, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1354068811407583">Svensson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354068811407583">Lundberg, 2003</xref>).

<title>Internal policy-making in the 1950s</title>
<p>When discussing the pension battle of the 1950s in his memoirs, the SAP party chairman (1946–69), Tage Erlander, recalls that it sparked unprecedented levels of intra-party participation. According to Erlander, party members ‘joined in the effort to create a new Swedish society without class boundaries' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1354068811407583">Erlander, 1976</xref>: 26).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1354068811407583">9</xref>
</sup> What Erlander, along with SAP’s own history books (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1354068811407583">Linderborg, 2002</xref>: 256–8), fails to mention is that the party leaders faced a substantial trade-off dilemma. In the 1950s, the SAP was primarily a mass party for the working class. However, instead of proposing pensions targeting this social class, the party leaders' strategy was to pursue income-graded benefits in order to attract white-collar workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1354068811407583">Molin, 1965</xref>: 184–5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1354068811407583">Svensson, 1994</xref>: 242–52). In a society with a shrinking working class, this, largely covert, catch-all strategy turned out to be very successful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1354068811407583">Svensson, 1994</xref>). Yet previous research has not analyzed how activists inside the party reacted to the ideological trade-off when it actually took place.</p>
<p>The protocols and archive materials I have employed indicate that they did not have the opportunity to react at all. Conversely, even though pensions were the most politicized issue on the agenda for almost five years (1956–9), the party congress only addressed the issue once. Moreover, at the party congress in 1956, only one motion mentioned the future pension scheme, referring to it as ‘the workers pension’, thus implying a demand for equal benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1354068811407583">SAP Congress Protocol, 1956</xref>: 335). Furthermore, the party leaders used the same words when discussing pensions internally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1354068811407583">SAP Congress Protocol, 1956</xref>: 335). Hence, an <italic>alternative</italic> policy – that is, a pension scheme with equal benefits and no income grading – clearly existed (C 1.1). Judging from the statements made by SAP leaders at the 1956 party congress, this policy seemed to be endorsed by them as well. Yet in reality they pursued a drastically-different alternative. However, an obvious question is whether or not party activists, on the whole, supported the strategy employed by leaders. Previously unexplored protocols from secret deliberations inside the party’s executive organs<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1354068811407583">10</xref>
</sup> indicate that they did not.</p>
<p>Polls made by the party executive in 1956 conveyed a serious problem. Only 22 per cent of the party’s own voters favored income-graded pensions when party leaders first discussed this policy in public. However, 59 per cent claimed to favour the alternative discussed at the party congress <italic>–</italic> that is, a pension scheme with equal benefits (SAP Party Executive – Election Surveys, 1950–62 [1956]). At a meeting with the party executive, Sven Aspling, an influential member of the party elite, exclaimed that ‘it is hard for us [the social democrats] to sell our social policy’, adding that there ‘is reactionary tendency these days' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1354068811407583">SAP, Party Executive, Protocols and Attachments, 1950–80</xref> [Protocol 25 September, 1956: 19, Sven Aspling]). Moreover, the party chairman, Erlander, expressed serious doubts that a pension reform would be possible at all if the policies preferred by the leaders where openly discussed in public. In 1956, his preferred option was instead to make a secluded deal with the Agrarian party (center party). Behind the closed doors of the party executive, he sadly noted: ‘Without a coalition government [with the center party] there will be no mandatory pension scheme’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1354068811407583">SAP, Party Executive, Protocols and Attachments, 1950–80</xref> [Party Executive, Protocol 12 October, 1956: 20, Tage Erlander]). However, the problems became even greater when the liberal opposition party, at the end of 1956, publicly demanded a referendum on pensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1354068811407583">Molin, 1965</xref>). Subsequently, the prime concern of the SAP executive committee was how to transform the opinion among the party’s rank and file (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1354068811407583">SAP, Executive Committee, Protocols and Attachments, 1950–80</xref> [(<italic>Vu</italic>) 20 March, 1956: 39; 24 January, 1957: 94; 16 April, 1957: 51; 27 June, 1957: 94]). Prior to the 1957 referendum, the SAP executive committee (<italic>Vu</italic>) set up a new, and highly-secluded, propaganda committee (<italic>Kommittéen för Linje 1</italic>). It only consisted of the absolute party elite and, according to the SAP executive committee, this new organ ‘alone should be responsible for the production of propaganda’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1354068811407583">SAP, Executive Committee, Protocols and Attachments, 1950–80</xref> [16 April, 1957: 157]). Even though the social democratic alternative got over 45 per cent of the votes in the 1957 referendum, new surveys conducted by the party executive showed that the basic problem remained. Although the party’s working-class members favoured the social democratic policy over right-wing alternatives, they considered the income grading to be unfair and unnecessarily expensive.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1354068811407583">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>As it turned out, the SAP won a great political battle, and the introduction of the new pension scheme secured the dominance of the party in Swedish politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1354068811407583">Svensson, 1994</xref>). However, when party leaders constructed the income-graded policy in the 1950s, it was never particularly popular internally. Instead, as the battle raged on, the right-wing parties came to be viewed as opponents to public pension altogether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1354068811407583">Molin, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1354068811407583">Svensson, 1994</xref>), thus leaving people in need of pensions with only one real option. In spite of this, the outcome of the battle for ATP was by no means a result of internally-democratic policy-making procedures. Conversely, this brief analysis has revealed rather oligarchic tendencies. First, the leadership endorsed one official party policy, while activists and rank-and-file members preferred and proposed a different alternative (C 1.1). Second, the intensity of internal deliberations was extremely low, at least at the party congress. In fact, no critical deliberations occurred at all in this arena, and only one motion occurred – referring to a different pension scheme than the one introduced in 1959 (C 1.2). Third, the party congresses never got the chance to debate or approve the final policy of the party (C 2.1). Fourth, since no significant activism occurred, alternatives preferred by activists obviously did not affect the final policy of the party (C 2.2).</p>

<title>Internal policy-making in the 1990s</title>
<p>In 1990, approximately 30 years after introducing the ATP, SAP party leaders decided to cut a deal with the right-wing government to abolish this scheme. Moreover, the SAP leaders continued honoring this agreement after regaining power in 1994. Hence, this joint effort by five mainstream parties, from opposing political blocs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354068811407583">Andersen and Meyer, 2003</xref>), could be seen as a rather clear-cut example of party system cartelization (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354068811407583">Katz and Mair, 2009</xref>: 754). Furthermore, the party’s executive committee appointed two members of the party elite to secure internal approval for the reform – party secretary Ingela Thalén (interview, 16 June 2004), and undersecretary, and later minster for social security 1994–6, Anna Hedborg (interview, 27 September 2004). When these two representatives of the party elite first presented the reform to the party organization, they apparently tried to conceal their true intentions, claiming that they wanted to preserve the ATP, while also stating that it was ‘probably the best pension system in the world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1354068811407583">SAP Congress Protocol, 1993</xref>: C: 73). However, from the outset it was clear that activists viewed such rhetoric as manipulative, while outspokenly proposing different policy alternatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354068811407583">Lundberg, 2003</xref>: 228–80; C 1.1). Moreover, when interviewed, both Thalén and Hedborg claim that they tried to avoid an intense internal debate about the pension reform which they thought would damage the party. Furthermore, the two party chairmen who ultimately were responsible for the pension reform, Ingvar Carlsson (1986–96) and Göran Persson (1996–2006), confirm that the party leadership utterly failed at controlling the internal debate, even though they tried (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1354068811407583">Persson, 1997</xref>: 72; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354068811407583">Carlsson, 2003</xref>: 523). Hence, in line with the cartel party thesis, the social democratic leaders had clear incentives to cut off mid-level activists from policy-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354068811407583">Katz and Mair, 2009</xref>: 759). Still, the party elite lost control over the policy-making process and the pension scheme constituted the central issue in three party congresses, and no less than three internal consultation committees were set up in order to provide mass input into the policy-making process.</p>
<p>At the party congress in 1993, after the first consultation committee, 27 motions concerned pensions, and all of them demanded that the ATP should be preserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1354068811407583">SAP Congress Protocol, 1993</xref>: C: 63–7, motions 140–6). At the subsequent party congress, in 1996, after the second consultation committee, all 231 motions addressing pensions demanded sharp revisions of party policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354068811407583">Lundberg, 2003</xref>: 157). Finally, at the 1997 party congress, 64 motions addressed pensions, and all of them openly criticized the policy advocated by the party leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1354068811407583">SAP Congress Protocol, 1997</xref>: motions 1390, 1467–1530). Hence, out of 322 motions in total, not a single one endorsed the official party policy. Moreover, two of the most outspoken activists, Göran Borg (interview, 10 May 2004), a delegate to the party congress in 1996 and 1997, and Karin Wegestål (interview, 7 March 2005), a social democratic member of parliament, claim that they visited virtually all local party districts in the country, openly campaigning against the plans to reform the pension scheme. What is more, they did so without any opposition from the party elite. The two representatives of the party leadership, Thalén (interview, 16 June 2004) and Hedborg (interview, 27 September 2004), confirm this, and claim that they caved in to the opposition. Instead of forcing their will upon the party, leaders decided to set up a third consultation committee, aimed at tapping into the sentiments of all members. Additionally, at the party congress in 1996, the leaders announced that the party would abstain from establishing an official policy before reviewing the results of this consultation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1354068811407583">SAP Congress Protocol, 1996</xref>: 408). Leaders made this promise in spite of the fact that a principal decision, laying down the framework for a future reform, had already been passed by the Swedish parliament (the Riksdag) in 1994. Accordingly, when the results of the internal survey showed that 94 percent, out of 526 responding labor organizations, criticized the policy already decided by the party in public office (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354068811407583">Loxbo, 2007</xref>: 215), party leaders appeared to be in trouble. Yet, even now, they did not force their will upon the party on the ground. Instead, they started informal negations with the activists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354068811407583">Lundberg, 2003</xref>: 272–3). As a result, before the party congress finally approved the reform, the social democratic party – now in government (1994–8) – decided to pursue new policies, diverging from the principal decision laid down in parliament three years earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1354068811407583">SAP Congress Protocol, 1997</xref>: Protocol 3: 167). Even if the basic structure of the pension reform remained, leaders agreed to abolish individual pension fees while also agreeing to introduce a new public pension fund (the seventh public pension fund), reducing the need for individual choice within the new premium reserve system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354068811407583">Loxbo, 2007</xref>: 102–4). According to activists who negotiated with the leaders (interview, Göran Borg 10 May 2004), as well as the party leaders themselves (interview, Ingela Thalén 16 June 2004; interview, Anna Hedborg 27 September 2004), these concessions were all consistent, albeit not in perfect accordance, with the alternative policies pursued by activists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354068811407583">Loxbo, 2007</xref>: 220–3). Additionally, after the 1997 party congress, party leaders had to reopen negotiations with the representatives of the right-wing parties, who all claim that they viewed the internal compromises between activists and leaders inside the social democratic party as a breach of the unofficial deal between the parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354068811407583">Loxbo, 2007</xref>: 102–4).</p>
<p>On the whole, although the initial decision by the SAP elite to reform the pension scheme in the 1990s looks like a case of party system cartelization, the conclusion about <italic>increased</italic> oligarchic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354068811407583">Lundberg, 2003</xref>: 275) simply does not hold up. On the contrary, compared to the internal policy-making process in the 1950s, intra-party democracy had improved dramatically in the 1990s. First, as in the 1950s, party leaders endorsed, and tried to push through, one official party policy while activists pursued other policies (C 1.1). Second, in sharp contrast to the 1950s, activists flooded the three congresses with critical motions. They also freely expressed their views in a number of intensive deliberations (C 1.2). Third, also in contrast to the 1950s, leaders maintained that the party congress must sanction the final decision (C 2.1). Fourth, only after compromises with the activists, the party congress in 1997 finally approved the new pension system (C 2.2). This is undoubtedly the most notable difference compared with the 1950s. Even though leaders initially tried to obfuscate polices and cut off the party on the ground, alternative policy-choices preferred by activists ultimately had an impact on the final policy pursued by party leaders in public office.</p>
<p>Still, one possible objection to the results could be the obvious difference between policy-making in time-periods characterized by welfare expansion, on the one hand, and retrenchment on the other. Does it not make perfect sense that members rebel against retrenchment polices while they remain relatively content when polices instead are expansive? In this case, I argue that this is a flawed objection. First, as shown earlier, the income-graded proposal in the 1950s was internally contested and could only – according to the leaders themselves – be pushed through if the party elites controlled policy-making and propaganda. Second, according to the cartel party thesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354068811407583">Blyth and Katz, 2005</xref>: 43–4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354068811407583">Katz and Mair, 2009</xref>: 754), it is precisely the new political circumstances emanating from the difference between popular expansion and unpopular retrenchment that fuels increased oligarchic tendencies inside political parties. Still, the results of the comparison conclusively demonstrate that intra-party democracy in the SAP had increased, not declined, in the 1990s.</p>

<p>If intra-party democracy is declining over time, it is, following C 3.1, reasonable to expect that leaders or ‘official journalists' increasingly dominate the party press while articles written by independent writers becomes less frequent. In an increasingly oligarchic party organization, this expectation is especially likely if party leaders are pursuing unpopular policies, like the SAP leaders clearly did in the 1990s.

<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1354068811407583">Figure 1</xref> shows that party leaders, or official journalists, were much more present in the party press in the 1950s than in the 1990s. Moreover, as the intensity of the ATP battle escalated around 1956, this presence increased markedly. Although leaders in the 1990s should have had even stronger incentives to control the press, especially when the internal conflicts mounted around 1993, no such transformation occurred during this decade. Instead, the share of articles written by independent writers in the 1990s outweighed the share written by leaders all years expect in 1996. Hence, if we only rely on C 3.1, the idea of increased leadership control gains no support. Yet an obvious objection could be that the party leaders still control the mindset of authors and that the press supports their policies regardless of the identity of the authors. In order to judge the validity of this objection, we turn to C 3.2, aimed at tapping into the share of articles only propagating for official party policy while neglecting policy-alternatives.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1354068811407583">Figure 2</xref>
illustrates that the share of articles only discussing official party policy, while neglecting alternatives, gradually increased in the 1950s. In the 1990s such articles instead declined as the years went by. The explanation for this difference is the following: before the political conflict begun in the 1950s, between 1954 and 1956, party policy seemed vague, and leaders had not finally decided to pursue an income-graded scheme, at least not in public (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1354068811407583">Molin, 1965</xref>). As a result, a couple of articles addressed the alternative policy choice – a pension scheme with equal benefits. Rank-and-file members (coded as <italic>independent writers</italic>), wrote all those articles, always in the form of letters to the editor. In the 1990s, lack of articles on policy alternatives in the press, especially in 1992 and 1993, was probably a result of the fact that members had not yet realized that the ATP was about to be abolished. Party leaders instead spoke of constructing ‘the new ATP’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1354068811407583">SAP Congress Protocol, 1993</xref>: C: 73). However, as the intensity of the internal policy-making process picked up, a pattern similar to the one in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1354068811407583">Figure 1</xref> is visible. Articles only propagating for the official party policy, while neglecting alternatives, completely dominated the press in the 1950s, but were strikingly less common in the 1990s. This indicates that leaders had less control over the internal policy agenda in the 1990s than they did in the 1950s.</p>

<p>Appealing to ideological tradition, in order to stake out intra-party consensus, is commonly viewed as an important strategy of party leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354068811407583">Downs, 1957</xref>: 113; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1354068811407583">Kitschelt, 1994</xref>: 242–4, 267–72). Hence, if it is true that parties are becoming more oligarchic over time, it is reasonable to expect that the party press increasingly obfuscates, or ignores, trade-offs that could damage party unity. Yet once again the results display the opposite tendency.</p>
<p>As already stated, both pension reforms were difficult ideological trade-offs. In the 1950s the SAP leaders traded off the working-class identity of the party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1354068811407583">Svensson, 1994</xref>), and in the 1990s they got rid of the ‘crown jewel’ in the social democratic welfare state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354068811407583">Lundberg, 2003</xref>: 282). However, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1354068811407583">Figure 3</xref>
, very few articles discussed the apparent ideological trade-offs in the 1950s – only 1955 and 1957 (altogether five articles out of 141), always in the form of letters to the editor. Still, leaders and official journalists in the 1950s totally neglected these problematic questions. The difference compared to the 1990s could not have been greater. Although party leaders initially tried to obfuscate their intentions and avoid an open debate on perceived ideological trade-offs, 62 per cent of all articles between 1992 and 1997 explicitly focused on these problems. Furthermore, party leaders or official journalists wrote 40 per cent of these articles themselves (19 out of 49). Hence, rather than displaying a party press increasingly controlled by the elite in the 1990s, the results indicate an anxious leadership trying to legitimize a hard, but necessary, choice by openly discussing the different alternatives on the agenda. Considering that leaders were well aware of the vast unpopularity of the new pension reform in the 1990s, results from the content analyses are not compatible with the thesis expecting increased leadership control.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This article has scrutinized the widely-purveyed hypothesis which states that intra-party democracy has declined since the glory days of the mass party – in contemporary research, most known as the cartel party thesis (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354068811407583">Katz and Mair, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354068811407583">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354068811407583">Blyth and Katz, 2005</xref>). Drawing on a comparison between two internal policy-making procedures within the Swedish social democratic party (SAP), one in the 1950s and the other in the 1990s, the article weakens this idea. If intra-party democracy is in a general state of decline, I argue that the comparative case study in the article should provide most likely conditions for confirming this tendency. Yet the results show that SAP party leaders in the 1990s, in a critical situation where they should have had strong incentives to obfuscate and control, instead had considerably less leverage over policy deliberations and activists than their predecessors in the 1950s. Moreover, the propaganda in the party press – pointed out as a primary tool for oligarchic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1354068811407583">Michels, 1962</xref>: 149) – seemed to constitute a potent instrument for agenda control in the 1950s, but had evidently slipped out of the hands of the leaders in the 1990s. Hence, in this case, intra-party democracy has improved, not declined, over time.</p>
<p>Still, the results from a single case study can only marginally weaken the general assumptions of increased leadership control (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354068811407583">Lijphart, 1971</xref>: 692). The results showing improved intra-party democracy within the SAP might, in fact, constitute a deviant case, while previous research indicates that it is likely to expect that the opportunities for membership influence and intra-party democracy differ a great deal between parties and varying party systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1354068811407583">Heidar and Saglie, 2003</xref>: 233; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354068811407583">Carty, 2004</xref>: 16–17; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1354068811407583">Pettitt, 2007</xref>: 236). Even if the results in this article obviously cannot be generalized empirically, I argue that they carry enough weight to undermine the influential postulates of increased elite autonomy and strengthen the rival hypothesis advanced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354068811407583">Kitschelt (2000)</xref>. In the first seminal article on the emergence of the cartel party, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354068811407583">Katz and Mair (1995</xref>: 22) rather sweepingly claim that modern ‘[p]arties are partnerships of professionals, not associations of, or for, the citizens'. The historic fate of intra-party democracy seems even more gloomy when Peter Mair, in a later publication (1997: 153), concludes that ‘[t]he relevance of linkages which are based on trust, accountability, and above all, representation tends to become eroded, both inside and outside the parties'. Contrary to these alleged tendencies, this study indicates that SAP leaders instead had lost some of their previous ability to control, while activists seemed to count for more than they did in the heyday of the mass party. Hence, considering that most accounts of declining intra-party democracy present hypotheses rather than empirical results (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354068811407583">Bolleyer, 2009</xref>), these results suggest that an equally plausible assumption is that party leaders are losing, rather than gaining, control over internal policy-making and agendas. There is no doubt that modern party members perceive that they lack influence over party policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1354068811407583">Pettitt, 2007</xref>: 230), while discontent and frustration grows among ideologically committed activists in the wake of welfare retrenchment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1354068811407583">Kitschelt, 2001</xref>). However, rather than viewing such unruly sentiments as results of evolving elite control, I argue that it is more plausible to see them as a consequence of new external economic conditions beyond the control of party leaders. If this assumption is correct, party leaders do not increasingly dominate policy-agendas, as stated by the cartel party thesis, but are themselves constrained by new economic conditions and, hence, face greater difficulties satisfying their principals than their predecessors ever did. At any rate, increased dissatisfaction with party policy does not equal growing elite control. Moreover, lacking empirical evidence and comparisons over time, party scholars run the risk of idealizing the democratic qualities in the mass party (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1354068811407583">Hopkin, 2004</xref>: 646; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1354068811407583">Pettitt, 2007</xref>: 235), while overestimating the control exercised by present-day party leaders. However, as contemporary party leaders can no longer rely on the incentives that maintained loyalty and unity in the mass party, increased control over the mindset of activists and members seems like a far-fetched assumption (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354068811407583">Kitschelt, 2000</xref>: 175). An open question in the future analysis of the historic fate of intra-party democracy is, therefore, whether the few party members that do remain in parties exercise less influence over party policy than members in the past or, rather, if they have become a force with which to be reckoned.</p>

Yet when restating the thesis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354068811407583">Katz and Mair (2009</xref>: 763) point out that it consists of two general hypotheses, one concerning the collusion between parties and the other concerning the internal cartelization of party organizations.</p>

<p>Whereas the proponents of the cartel party thesis are not very explicit about how leaders control their followers, Michels highlights the party press as a prime instrument of control (1962: 149). Even if the party press obviously was more important in the beginning of the 20th century, when Michels wrote his book (1911), than in the modern age of the cartel party, it still remains a potential instrument for controlling internal policy agendas and preference formation. Hence the cartel party thesis gives us no reason to suspect that party leaders would refrain from using it.</p>

<italic>Party leaders</italic> in the SAP refer to the party chairman, the party executive (<italic>Partistyrelsen</italic>), and the executive committee (<italic>Verkställande utskottet).</italic> When the party is in government, ministers are also seen as part of the party leadership. Yet in the empirical analysis it is the members of the party leadership that were the most prominent spokespersons that represent the party leaders. With the term <italic>activists,</italic> I refer to the 350 delegates to the party congress, in particular the most outspoken critics (see note 5). Criteria 1 and 2 are evaluated drawing on public protocols along with previously-unexplored archive data from the 1950s and interviews with key actors from the 1990s (leaders as well as activists). Debates and deliberations at the party congresses are analyzed using protocols from 1952, 1956, 1993, 1996, and 1997 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1354068811407583">SAP Congress Protocol, 1952, 1956, 1993, 1996, 1997</xref>). Material from other extra-parliamentary organs in the 1950s concern the social democratic and blue collar union (LO) committee set up to propagate for public pensions prior to the referendum in 1957, the committee for Line 1 (<italic>Kommitéen för linje 1</italic>). Furthermore, from the 1950s, I have also had access to protocols from deliberations among party leaders in the party executive (<italic>Partistyrelsen</italic>) as well as the party executive committee (<italic>Verkställande utskottet</italic>).The extra-parliamentary organs in the 1990s concerned three bodies for membership consultation (1992, 1994, and 1996). Moreover, I have had access to a large membership survey tapping into the opinion on pensions. Since protocols from the party executive and the executive committee in the 1990s are still classified, I have instead relied on interviews with the two central spokespersons, high up in the party hierarchy, appointed by the party chairman to negotiate with rival parties and activists (interview, Ingela Thalén 16 June 2004; interview, Anna Hedborg 27 September 2004), along with two of the most prominent activists, criticizing party policy, Göran Borg (interview, 10 May 2004), a delegate to the Party Congress in 1996 and 1997, and Karin Wegestål (interview, 7 March 2005), a social democratic member of parliament.</p>

<p>In order to study this criterion the analysis will have to provide evidence that the party leaders adjusted their position as a result of activist involvement. Hence it accounts for the motives of party leaders and thus requires a number of reliable sources where party leaders are likely to speak out. In the 1950s I primarily rely on the protocols from a variety of executive party organs (see note 4), and in the 1990s primarily on interviews.</p>

<p>The relevant trade-offs were obviously very different in the two policy-making processes. In the 1950s the most difficult trade-off was undoubtedly that the social democratic party, which up until then had been a working-class party, proposed a very expensive pension scheme that primarily benefited the middle class rather the typical blue collar worker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1354068811407583">Molin, 1965</xref>: 184–5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1354068811407583">Svensson, 1994</xref>: 239–61, 282–307). If the article discussed, or even mentioned, this trade-off, the article is coded as <italic>covering trade-offs</italic>. Yet another difficult trade-off during the 1950s was the introduction of the public pension funds (<italic>AP-fonderna</italic>), because several prominent activists wanted to use them as a tool to control, or even socialize, private companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1354068811407583">Lewin, 1967</xref>: 411–12). If the controversies concerning this issue were discussed in the article, it is coded as <italic>covering trade-offs.</italic> Turning to the decision-making process in the 1990s, there were even more perceived ideological trade-offs. Even though the reformed pension scheme has been described as consistent with social democratic principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354068811407583">Anderson and Meyer, 2003</xref>), virtually all changes in the previous pension scheme (ATP) – notably the introduction of a ‘life earnings principle’, the introduction of individual pension fees, and the introduction of a limited premium reserve system. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354068811407583">Lundberg, 2003</xref>: 191–221). If any of these perceived downsides of the new system are discussed in a critical way, the article is coded as covering trade-offs.</p>
