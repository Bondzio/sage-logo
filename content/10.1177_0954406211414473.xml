<abstract>
<p>Microforming which exploits the advantages of metal-forming processes has been considered to be a very promising manufacturing technology for microparts. However, the fundamental understandings on microforming have not been well established yet since the extensive findings and know-how of conventional forming cannot be simply transferred to the microscale. This article attempts to offer an effective theoretical and experimental modelling to describe the so-called ‘size effect’ on the behaviour of metals in microforming. A theoretical model was developed based on the dislocation theory to quantify the grain size and feature size effects on the flow behaviour of polycrystalline materials. Tensile tests of copper sheets of various specimen thicknesses and grain sizes were carried out, and thus the effectiveness of the theoretical model can be confirmed by comparing the predicted flow stress, dislocation density, and Hall–Petch constant with experimental measurements. The general trend of decreasing flow stress with increasing grain size and decreasing specimen thickness was observed. The ratio of feature size to grain size was identified as an important parameter to characterize the flow stress level, grain boundary strengthening, and failure characteristics in microscale deformation processes.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954406211414473" sec-type="intro"><title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>With the continuing trend towards miniaturization and the rapid development in micro-system technologies and micro-electromechanical systems, a significant progress has been made in micro-fabrication technologies. As one of the effective and efficient production processes for microparts, microforming appears very promising due to its economical and ecological benefits such as fast cycle rates, high material utilization, improved mechanical properties, and near net shape production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406211414473"><bold>1</bold></xref>]. Most of the existing studies on microforming, however, are based on lab-scale experimental works since the extensive findings and know-how of conventional forming cannot be simply transferred to the microworld due to the so-called ‘size effect’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406211414473"><bold>1</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954406211414473"><bold>2</bold></xref>]. Hence, in order to expand the applications of microforming processes, a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms causing the size effect is highly demanded in terms of material behaviours, deformation mechanics, and tribology.</p>
<p>The most important parameter characterizing the material behaviour in metal forming is the flow stress, which controls the forming force, the load on the tools, the local flow behaviour, and the filling of the die. Numerous researchers have observed the size effect on the flow stress of polycrystals associated with miniaturization. Hall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954406211414473"><bold>3</bold></xref>] and Petch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954406211414473"><bold>4</bold></xref>] performed the pioneering works on the ‘grain size’ effect on the material strength. They noted that the presence of grain boundaries in polycrystalline materials can change their mechanical properties dramatically. This effect was explicitly described as a Hall–Petch equation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954406211414473"><bold>3</bold></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406211414473"><bold>5</bold></xref>], and has been extensively studied and discussed by material scientists. Another size effect called as ‘feature size’ effect actually involves geometrical scaling of the workpiece. Relatively little attention, however, has been drawn to this size effect since it predominates only when a few grains are present in a specimen cross-section. In microforming processes, as the feature size is downscaled without change in microstructure, the total number of grains located in the deformed areas is significantly reduced. Hence, both the grain size and feature size effects should be simultaneously considered in modelling of materials to understand the physics of microforming processes completely.</p>
<p>Recent research studies in microforming have studied the influence of the feature size on the flow stress and its interaction with the grain size effect. Geiger et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954406211414473"><bold>6</bold></xref>] systematically investigated the feature size effect of CuZn15 alloy by performing the tensile and upsetting tests on geometrically similar specimens of different dimensions. A decrease in the flow stress was observed with a decrease in specimen size. Similar results were found in similar research studies for different materials such as aluminium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954406211414473"><bold>7</bold></xref>], brass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954406211414473"><bold>8</bold></xref>], and stainless steel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954406211414473"><bold>9</bold></xref>]. Raulea et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954406211414473"><bold>7</bold></xref>] showed that the ratio of grain size to sheet thickness greatly affects the material strength. Their experimental results demonstrated that both the yield and tensile strengths of the material decrease with a decreasing number of grains over the sheet thickness. A surface layer model was established by Engel and Eckstein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954406211414473"><bold>10</bold></xref>] to describe the feature size effect in microforming. They pointed out the free surface grains at the specimen surface are less constrained compared to the grains lying in the internal volume, and consequently, the free surface grains will deform at an apparently lower flow stress. Since the share of free surface grains increases with miniaturization, a decrease of the integral flow stress in microforming could be qualitatively explained. Analytical studies to investigate the size effect quantitatively were also performed. Leu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954406211414473"><bold>11</bold></xref>] proposed a tensile flow stress model to represent the deformation of polycrystals as a function of the ratio of sheet thickness to grain size <italic>t</italic>/<italic>d</italic>. The critical value of <italic>t</italic>/<italic>d</italic> to distinguish the macroscale from the microscale is subsequently proposed based on the affected zone model. Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954406211414473"><bold>12</bold></xref>] introduced scaling parameters which modify the Hall–Petch equation to consider both the grain size and specimen size effects at the micro/meso scale. Yeh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954406211414473"><bold>13</bold></xref>] developed a new mathematical model based on the Nelder–Mead method, and explored the influence of grain size and sheet thickness by the analytical and numerical methods.</p>
<p>In spite of the large amount of research, an analytical model to describe the flow behaviour accurately in microforming has not been developed yet. It is obvious that the size effects need to be studied from the essence of metal plastic deformation to understand the miniaturization effects thoroughly and to build the correct relationship between the plastic behaviour and the material parameters. Therefore, in this study, a theoretical model was newly developed based on the dislocation theory to investigate the size effects and to explain the flow behaviour of polycrystalline materials both in microscale and macroscale forming. Tensile tests of copper sheets of various grain sizes and specimen thicknesses were performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical model. The ratio of feature size to grain size is identified as a measure of the size effect, and its influences on the flow stress, grain boundary strengthening, and failure were investigated.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0954406211414473"><title>2 THEORETICAL ANALYSIS</title>
<p>As miniaturization occurs, the flow stress of a polycrystalline material decreases and eventually converges to that of a single crystal. Hence, the most important task for the design and development of microforming processes is to characterize the size-dependent material flow thoroughly. In this section, a simple dislocation density-based model is proposed to quantify the flow stress dependence on miniaturization.</p>
<sec id="sec3-0954406211414473"><title>2.1 Construction of flow stress model</title>
<p>When a plastic crystal is deformed, dislocations are generated and stored in grains, and the storage causes the material to work harden. The shear flow stress <italic>τ</italic> for a dislocation-hardened material can be related to the total dislocation density <italic>ρ<sub>T</sub></italic> based on the classical Taylor equation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954406211414473"><bold>14</bold></xref>]
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-0954406211414473"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211414473-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>α</italic> is a geometrical constant related to the crystal and grain structure, <italic>G</italic> the shear modulus, <italic>b</italic> the magnitude of the Burgers vector, and <italic>τ</italic><sub>0 </sub>a friction stress extrapolated to zero dislocation density. The macroscopic shear flow stress <italic>τ</italic> is related to the corresponding tensile flow stress <italic>via</italic> the Taylor orientation factor <italic>M</italic> as follows
<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-0954406211414473"><label>(2)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211414473-eq2.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>σ</italic><sub>0</sub> = <italic>Mτ</italic><sub>0</sub> is a constant. The Taylor orientation factor <italic>M</italic> correlates radiation-induced microstructural evolution to changes in mechanical properties. Its average value is found as 3.06 for a random face-centred cubic (FCC) polycrystalline material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954406211414473"><bold>15</bold></xref>].</p>
<p>It is generally assumed that the total dislocation density represents the coupling between the two types of dislocation; statistically stored dislocation (SSD) and geometrically necessary dislocation (GND) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954406211414473"><bold>16</bold></xref>]. During homogenous plastic deformation, SSDs develop by trapping each other in a random way. They are considered uniformly distributed in the matrix. However, since a uniform strain in the grains of the materials causes overlaps and voids, GNDs develop as obstacles to dislocation glide to accommodate these mismatches and maintain the plastic deformation compatibilities. It is suggested that the GNDs are concentrated in the grain boundary region and increase the deformation resistance to the SSDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954406211414473"><bold>17</bold></xref>]. Considering the interactions between the SSDs and the GNDs, the total dislocation density is expressed as [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954406211414473"><bold>18</bold></xref>]
<disp-formula id="disp-formula3-0954406211414473"><label>(3)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211414473-eq3.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>ρ<sub>S</sub></italic> is the mean density of SSDs and <italic>ρ<sub>G</sub></italic> the mean density of GNDs. The exponent <italic>μ</italic> represents the significance of both kinds of dislocation in contributing the flow stress.</p>
<p>Ashby [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954406211414473"><bold>16</bold></xref>] assumed that the mean density of SSDs depends on the plastic strain <italic>ε</italic> and the average travel distance of a dislocation segment, <italic>L<sub>s</sub></italic> as
<disp-formula id="disp-formula4-0954406211414473"><label>(4)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211414473-eq4.tif"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>It is evident that <italic>L<sub>s</sub></italic> is a function of grain size <italic>d</italic> since the grain size is a theoretical upper limit of <italic>L<sub>s</sub></italic>. Experimental and analytical considerations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954406211414473"><bold>17</bold></xref>], however, show that this relationship is valid only for very small strains. When strain increases, a grain size dependence of <italic>L<sub>s</sub></italic> becomes very weak. It addition, it is observed that <italic>L<sub>s</sub></italic> is inversely dependent on strain <italic>ε</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954406211414473"><bold>17</bold></xref>]. Thus, <italic>ρ<sub>S</sub></italic> is simply approximated as
<disp-formula id="disp-formula5-0954406211414473"><label>(5)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211414473-eq5.tif"/></disp-formula>
where C<sub>1</sub> and <italic>n</italic> are constants where <italic>n</italic> &gt; 1.</p>
<p>Similarly, Ashby [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954406211414473"><bold>16</bold></xref>] related GNDs to plastic strain gradients which arise from compatible deformation at the grain boundaries. Since the magnitude of the plastic strain gradient is approximately of the order of the average strain in the crystal divided by the local length scale of the deformation field, the density of GNDs can be described as
<disp-formula id="disp-formula6-0954406211414473"><label>(6)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211414473-eq6.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>L<sub>g</sub></italic> is the geometric slip distance that is proportional to the grain size. It is found, however, that the requirement of the grain boundary accommodation decreases with increased strain, and the dynamic recovery processes reduce a proportional increase of the GNDs with strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954406211414473"><bold>19</bold></xref>]. Thus, it is considered to be more reasonable to relate the GNDs to <italic>ε<sup>m</sup></italic> where <italic>m</italic> is a constant in the range of 0 &lt; <italic>m</italic> &lt; 1. Assuming that the GNDs are stored close to the grain boundaries rather than uniformly distributed in the grains, the mean density of GNDs can be obtained by multiplying the fraction of material volume occupied by GNDs, <italic>f</italic>. Thus, <italic>ρ<sub>G</sub></italic> is finally expressed as
<disp-formula id="disp-formula7-0954406211414473"><label>(7)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211414473-eq7.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>C</italic><sub>2</sub> is a constant.</p>
<p>It is seen that the geometrical volume fraction <italic>f</italic> by the GNDs decreases with strain and grain size asymptotically tending to saturation at larger strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954406211414473"><bold>17</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954406211414473"><bold>20</bold></xref>]. Guided by the results presented in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954406211414473"><bold>21</bold></xref>], the evolution of <italic>f</italic> is estimated as
<disp-formula id="disp-formula8-0954406211414473"><label>(8)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211414473-eq8.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>β</italic> is a material constant.</p>
<p>By combining <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0954406211414473">equations (2)</xref>, (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-0954406211414473">3</xref>), (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula5-0954406211414473">5</xref>), (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula7-0954406211414473">7</xref>), and (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula8-0954406211414473">8</xref>), the macroscopic tensile flow stress can be modelled as follows
<disp-formula id="disp-formula9-0954406211414473"><label>(9)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211414473-eq9.tif"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>It is noted that <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula9-0954406211414473">equation (9)</xref> does not predict a precise Hall–Petch equation of the form <italic>σ</italic>(<italic>ε</italic>) = <italic>σ<sub>s</sub></italic>(<italic>ε</italic>) + <italic>k</italic>(<italic>ε</italic>)<italic>d</italic><sup>−1/2</sup>, where <italic>σ<sub>s</sub></italic>(<italic>ε</italic>) and <italic>k</italic>(<italic>ε</italic>) are constants at a particular strain <italic>ε</italic>. In fact, a linear relationship between <italic>σ</italic>(<italic>ε</italic>) and <italic>d</italic><sup>−1/2</sup> can be expected in case of smaller grain size. Otherwise, the exponent of <italic>d</italic> is expected to change between −1 and −1/2 depending on the grain size and material parameters as supported by the previous works in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954406211414473"><bold>19</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954406211414473"><bold>22</bold></xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0954406211414473"><title>2.2 Size effect in microforming</title>
<p>Although the derived model of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula9-0954406211414473">equation (9)</xref> reflects the grain size dependence of flow behaviour for conventional polycrystalline materials, the scaling down of flow stress with decreasing feature size in microforming cannot be explained with this model. As the specimen size is reduced without change in microstructure, the relative fraction of free surface grains increases. Since the dislocation movement at the free surface is not restricted from the neighbouring grains, the grain boundaries locating at the free surface of the specimen do not represent the strength comparable to the internal grain boundaries. This free surface effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954406211414473"><bold>10</bold></xref>] is widely accepted to explain the flow stress decrease in microforming qualitatively where the number of grains contained in the specimen section is much reduced.</p>
<p>To describe the feature size effect quantitatively, the size factor <italic>λ</italic> that represents the fraction of the free surface grains is introduced by relating the circumference of the specimen section <italic>C</italic> with the total grain boundary length as follows
<disp-formula id="disp-formula10-0954406211414473"><label>(10)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211414473-eq10.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>g<sub>t</sub></italic> is the number of grains in the specimen section and <italic>L</italic> the perimeter of a grain. It can be seen that the size factor <italic>λ</italic> decreases as the specimen size is decreased, and eventually becomes one for a single crystal. Then, the relationship between the free surface area <italic>A<sub>o</sub></italic> in the specimen section and the total area of the specimen <italic>A<sub>t</sub></italic> can be established using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula10-0954406211414473">equation (10)</xref> as
<disp-formula id="disp-formula11-0954406211414473"><label>(11)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211414473-eq11.tif"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>where <inline-formula id="ilm1-0954406211414473"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math1-0954406211414473"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is the total cross-sectional area of a grain, <inline-formula id="ilm2-0954406211414473"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math2-0954406211414473"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> the boundary area of a grain, and <italic>δ</italic> the thickness of the work hardened grain boundary. In <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula11-0954406211414473">equation (11)</xref>, the fraction of the free surface area is increased from zero to one as the specimen size decreases from the macroscale (i.e. <italic>λ</italic> = ∞) to the single crystal case (i.e. <italic>λ</italic> = 1). Thus, when the size factor is reduced to a certain critical value, the feature size effect becomes significant due to the increased influence of the grain boundaries at the free surface.</p>
<p>Since the GNDs are concentrated at the grain boundaries, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula9-0954406211414473">equation (9)</xref> can be modified in microforming considering the grain boundary weakening at the free surface as follows
<disp-formula id="disp-formula12-0954406211414473"><label>(12)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211414473-eq12.tif"/></disp-formula></p>
<p><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula12-0954406211414473">Equation (12)</xref> becomes the same with <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula9-0954406211414473">equation (9)</xref> in the case of macroscale forming (i.e. <italic>λ</italic> = ∞), while it approaches to the strength of a single crystal as the size of the specimen decreases (i.e. <italic>λ</italic> → 1). Thus, it can be concluded that the derived model of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula12-0954406211414473">equation (12)</xref> represents a more generalized flow stress behaviour of materials for both macro- and microscale forming processes by describing the grain size and feature size effects simultaneously.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0954406211414473"><title>3 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title>
<p>In order to confirm the size effects in microforming and validate the derived flow stress model, tensile tests were carried out for copper specimens of various grain sizes and specimen thicknesses. The tensile test specimens were cut from the cold-rolled plates by wire electrical discharge machining process. The initial gauge length and width were kept constant, respectively, to 57 and 12.5 mm, and the transition radius was 12.5 mm to reduce the strain concentrations. The specimen thicknesses prepared for the evaluation of the feature size effect were in the range from 50 to 2000 µm. Since the grain diameter is usually controlled by recrystallization after cold working, the samples were annealed at different temperatures of 450, 600, and 750°C for 1 h to minimize variations in specimen texture as well as to obtain a wide range of grain sizes. After annealing, the specimens were polished and chemically etched. Then, the geometry of grains was measured using light-optical microscope based on ASTM-E112 standard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954406211414473"><bold>23</bold></xref>]. The effect of the annealing conditions on the grain size was shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406211414473">Fig. 1</xref>. Fine grained structure with regard to the lower annealing temperature was observed. The average grain diameter after annealing at 450°C was 10 µm. The increase of annealing temperature to 600°C and 750°C resulted in the grain growth to 20 and 40 µm, respectively. The tensile tests were conducted at a constant strain rate of 0.0005 s<sup>−1</sup> on a universal tensile testing machine.

<p>The validity of the proposed theoretical model was verified through the comparisons with the experimental measurements from the microscale to the macroscale. As listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954406211414473">Table 1</xref>, the material parameters <italic>M</italic>, <italic>α</italic>, <italic>G</italic>, <italic>b</italic>, and <italic>σ</italic><sub>0</sub> were taken from the corresponding references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954406211414473"><bold>19</bold></xref>]. The values of <italic>C</italic><sub>1</sub> = 2.23 × 10<sup>15</sup> m<sup>−2</sup> and <italic>n</italic> = 1.21 can be obtained from the extrapolated flow stress values to an infinite grain size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954406211414473"><bold>24</bold></xref>], since the SSDs accumulate during deformation of a single crystal regardless of the grain size.

<sec id="sec7-0954406211414473"><title>4.1 Macroscale</title>
<p>True stress–true strain curves were illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406211414473">Fig. 2</xref> at the macroscale level (i.e. <italic>λ</italic> → ∞) for the three different grain sizes of 10, 20, and 40 µm. It can be seen that the theoretical results by calculations agree very well with the experimental measurements. A typical grain size dependence of flow stress – the smaller the grain, the greater the stress at each strain – was observed.
<fig id="fig2-0954406211414473" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Comparison of the experimental and calculated results of flow stresses with various grain sizes at the macroscale (<italic>λ</italic> = ∞)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211414473-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The accuracy and reliability of the derived theoretical model was further investigated in a wider range of grain size through the comparisons of the Hall–Petch curves and dislocation densities between the calculations and the experimental findings in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954406211414473"><bold>24</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954406211414473"><bold>25</bold></xref>]. When the flow stress values were plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954406211414473">Fig. 3</xref> as a function of <italic>d</italic><sup>−1/2</sup> at three different true strains (i.e. <italic>ε</italic> = 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2), less than 10 per cent error was observed between the theoretical predictions and the reported experimental measurements. However, the flow stress curves by calculations exhibited a small curvature upward, while a normal linear relationship was observed in the case of experiment. In addition, the average slope of the curve at each strain was slightly steeper in the former case. As explained in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula9-0954406211414473">equation (9)</xref> and the previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954406211414473"><bold>19</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954406211414473"><bold>22</bold></xref>], the relationship between flow stress and <italic>d</italic><sup>−1/2</sup> is not exactly linear due to the gradual change of deformation mechanism with varying grain size. Considering the inherent scatter of the experimental data and the slight differences in experimental condition and material composition between this study and the reported experimental work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954406211414473"><bold>24</bold></xref>], it can be concluded that the calculations are in a reasonably good agreement with experiments.
<fig id="fig3-0954406211414473" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Calculated <italic>σ</italic> − <italic>d</italic><sup>−1/2</sup> curves in comparison with experimental data at selected strains</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211414473-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The total dislocation densities calculated at various grain sizes and strains were also compared with the experimental data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954406211414473"><bold>25</bold></xref>]. Since dislocation storage is approximately linear to the tensile strain in case of smaller strain (i.e. <italic>ε</italic> ≤ 0.2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0954406211414473"><bold>26</bold></xref>], the mean values of <italic>ρ<sub>T</sub></italic>/<italic>ε</italic> were obtained from calculations and compared with the experimentally fit curve as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954406211414473">Fig. 4</xref>. Both curves clearly indicate the effect of grain size on dislocation density and explain the mechanism by which a decrease in grain size increases the flow stress. The overall trend of the predicted values is in a good agreement with experiments. It can be seen, however, that the theoretical model generally overestimates the dislocation storage in grains. This seems to be due to inaccurate material property definitions used in the theoretical model and possible errors in fitting of experimental results.
<fig id="fig4-0954406211414473" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Calculated dislocation densities in comparison with experimental data as a function of grain size and strain</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211414473-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>As a result, the overall trend of material behaviour is successfully predicted at the macroscale level as verified with experimental results, and thus the effectiveness of the theoretical model can be confirmed with reasonable accuracy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0954406211414473"><title>4.2 Microscale</title>
<p>Using the verified theoretical model at the macroscale, the feature size effect which predominates only in microforming was further discussed. The stress and strain curves for different values of the size factor <italic>λ</italic> (i.e. <italic>λ</italic> = 2.5, 5, and ∞) were presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406211414473">Fig. 5</xref>. Under the condition of constant grain size (i.e. 10 µm in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406211414473">Fig. 5(a)</xref>, 20 µm in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406211414473">Fig. 5(b)</xref>, and 40 µm in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406211414473">Fig. 5(c)</xref>), flow stress decreased with decreasing size factor and eventually converged to that of single crystal <italic>σ</italic><sub>single</sub>. Again, the general trend and values by calculations were in a good agreement with the experimental data, which confirms the validity of the theoretical model at the microscale as well. For the copper material investigated in this study, however, the feature size effect does not seem to be very significant especially for larger grains. When the grain size is over 40 µm, less than 30 MPa decrease of flow stress was observed at <italic>ε</italic> = 0.2 as the size factor changes from the macroscale (i.e. <italic>λ</italic> = ∞) to the microscale (<italic>λ</italic> → 1). The variation of the flow stress values with specimen size, however, will increase in case of other materials which have more significant strengthening effect at grain boundaries. The proposed theoretical model, in this sense, will be very useful in microforming processes to predict the plastic behaviour of materials accurately and to prevent possible erroneous results from the conventional Hall–Petch-based models.
<fig id="fig5-0954406211414473" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Comparison of the experimental and calculated results of flow stresses at different size factors and grain sizes: (a) <italic>d</italic> = 10 µm, (b) <italic>d</italic> = 20 µm, and (c) <italic>d</italic> = 40 µm</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211414473-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The variation of flow stress at a specific strain value of <italic>ε</italic> = 0.2 was predicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954406211414473">Fig. 6</xref> in a wider range of grain size and feature size. When the feature size effect is ignored, the flow stress values were dependent only on the grain size as mentioned previously. With the decrease of the specimen size (i.e. size factor), however, the flow stress started to decrease gradually in the condition of constant grain size. A rapid decrease of the flow stress was observed when the size factor <italic>λ</italic> was reduced below a certain critical value due to the increased influence of the grain boundaries at the free surface.
<fig id="fig6-0954406211414473" position="float"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Variations of flow stress as a function of grain size and size factor at <italic>ε</italic> = 0.2</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211414473-fig6.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>In order to identify the critical values of size factor <italic>λ<sub>c</sub></italic>, the flow stress in the microscale was normalized by the saturated flow stress in the macroscale at different grain sizes, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406211414473">Fig. 7</xref>. It can be seen that the finer the grain size, the lower the normalized flow stress <italic>σ<sub>n</sub></italic> became. It seems that a portion of the entire grain occupied by the grain boundary region is increased with decreasing grain size, and thus the relative fraction of the grain boundaries located at the free surface is increased as the grain size decreases. The value of <italic>λ<sub>c</sub></italic> against the grain size was determined when the decreasing rate of the normalized flow stress with decreasing size factor reaches a certain critical value. If the critical value is set to 0.5 per cent, for example, the value of <italic>λ<sub>c</sub></italic> is around 9 when the grain size is 5 µm, while it decreases down to about 4 in the case of larger grains over 100 µm. It is evident that the value of <italic>λ<sub>c</sub></italic> changes depending on the material strength in the grain boundary and internal regions. If the grain boundary strengthening becomes more significant, the values of <italic>λ<sub>c</sub></italic> will increase. Thus, the critical size factor <italic>λ<sub>c</sub></italic> to distinguish the microscale from the macroscale needs to be determined separately for each material considering the material properties and microstructure.
<fig id="fig7-0954406211414473" position="float"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>The effects of grain size and size factor on the normalized flow stress at <italic>ε</italic> = 0.2</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211414473-fig7.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Based on the results of the previous sections, it is evident that the crucial factor affecting the mechanical characteristics of materials in microforming is more related to the ratio of the sheet thickness to the grain size <italic>t</italic>/<italic>d</italic>. Thus, the flow stress values obtained from the microscale depart from the linearly approximated Hall–Petch relationship, especially when the feature size effect is prominent. The size dependence of flow stress in microforming needs to be fitted by other equations than <italic>d</italic><sup>−1/2</sup> to incorporate the feature size effect and to explain the deviations from the conventional Hall–Petch relation properly. It can be estimated from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula12-0954406211414473">equation (12)</xref> that the variation of flow stress has a certain relationship with the term of (1−<italic>λ</italic>−1)<italic>d</italic><sup>−1/2</sup> . In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954406211414473">Fig. 8</xref>, the flow stress values obtained at various grain sizes and size factors were approximated on a linear basis with the term of (1−<italic>λ</italic>−1)<italic>d</italic><sup>−1/2</sup> at three different strain values. It was observed that the results from the experiments match very well with the theoretical predictions.
<fig id="fig8-0954406211414473" position="float"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>Plots of the modified Hall–Petch relationship at microscale</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211414473-fig8.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Finally, the size dependence of the fracture strain in microforming was evaluated from the tensile test results. It is generally stated that the ductility increases with decreasing grain size since the smaller grains reduces the slip length and therefore the stress concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954406211414473"><bold>27</bold></xref>]. In addition, the reduced grain size leads to multiple slip near the grain boundaries, resulting in more homogeneous deformation and the increased resistance to the propagation of microcracks. Under the condition of constant grain size, significant reduction in the fracture strain was also observed for the thinner specimens, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406211414473">Fig. 5</xref>. It appears that the smaller number of grains per specimen cross-section in microforming lowers the probability that a gliding system is properly oriented and activated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0954406211414473"><bold>28</bold></xref>]. An increase of the relative surface roughness in the case of thinner specimen also seems to cause stress concentration at the flaw and fasten the weakening of the material. Thus, it is deduced that the fracture strain at the microscale has a certain relationship with the grain size and the feature size. When the fracture strain at the microscale was normalized by the macroscale value as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954406211414473">Fig. 9</xref>, a rapid decrease of the fracture strain was observed when the value of <italic>t</italic>/<italic>d</italic> was less than 20. The data can be best fitted by <italic>ε<sub>nf</sub></italic> = 1 − 0.93 e<sup>−0.1</sup><italic><sup>t</sup></italic><sup>/</sup><italic><sup>d</sup></italic> to show the dependence of <italic>t</italic>/<italic>d</italic> on the fracture strain numerically without any physical meaning.
<fig id="fig9-0954406211414473" position="float"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption><p>The effect of <italic>t</italic>/<italic>d</italic> on the normalized fracture strain</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211414473-fig9.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Consequently, a theoretical model to explain the size effects in microforming was successfully developed and validated through the detailed comparisons with the experimental data for copper. This model is established based on the classical dislocation theories to describe the strain hardening behaviour of polycrystalline materials. Thus, it is expected that the plastic behaviour of various classes of metals and alloys can be predicted using this model.</p>

<sec id="sec9-0954406211414473" sec-type="conclusions"><title>5 CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>For a safe and reliable design of microforming systems, a fundamental understanding of the size effect associated with miniaturization is greatly needed. In this study, the size dependence of the mechanical behaviour of the materials was investigated using the theoretical and experimental methods.</p>
<p>A theoretical model based on the dislocation theory was developed to quantify the grain size and specimen size effects in microforming. The accuracy and reliability of the model can be validated through the comparisons with the experimental measurements from the microscale to the macroscale. As a result, the general trend of decreasing flow stress with increasing grain size and decreasing specimen size can be qualitatively and quantitatively confirmed.</p>
<p>The ratio of specimen thickness to grain size related to the size factor <italic>λ</italic> in this study was identified as a crucial parameter affecting the mechanical properties of the materials at the microscale. When this ratio drops below a certain critical value depending on the grain size, a decrease of the flow stress became prominent. The critical value was increased with decreasing grain size. In addition, the conventional Hall–Petch relation was modified to reflect the feature size effect in microforming. A linear relationship between the flow stress and the (1−<italic>λ</italic>−1)<italic>d</italic><sup>−1/2</sup> term was suggested as verified from the calculations and the experimental findings.</p>
<p>The size dependence of the fracture strain was investigated in microforming from the stress–stain data. The fracture strain decreased with increasing grain size and decreasing feature size due to the influence of slip mechanism, surface roughness, and deformation homogeneity. The decrease of the fracture strain in magnitude can be related with the ratio of specimen thickness to grain size by an exponential decay.</p>
