<p>In the small but growing field of research into climate change and migration, there is much debate about terms. Attempts to definitively count the numbers or pinpoint the characteristics of ‘climate refugees’ are being discarded in favour of more nuanced descriptors, such as climate-induced migration, that are better attuned to the agency and complexity of populations on the move in a warming world. The choice of the word ‘displacement’ in the title of this book, therefore, reveals much about its editor’s intent. Confirmed in the introductory chapter, migration related to climate change is being positioned, from a rather sedentrist perspective, as a problem to be solved rather than, more broadly, as a phenomenon to be understood. While such an angle may be appealing to policy-makers, those who are interested in what the governing of climate migrants reveals about the deeper workings of race, state, culture, science and capital will be somewhat disappointed in this collection. Disciplinary perspectives and contributors are favoured that in sum offer a bird’s-eye view that fits neatly within institutional categorizations of the evidence required to ‘manage’ climate change and migration. Moreover, this is largely a project of managing the poor. Those likely to be displaced from their waterfront mansions as sea levels rise are not positioned as displaced persons that need to be brought under the managerial gaze of bureaucrats, who are seeking to understand why the poorer segments of populations will move, when they will move, where they will go, and how many of them there will be.</p>
<p>While this exclusion of the rich is no doubt driven by a desire to see the situation of the mobile poor improved, privileging the categories of policy-makers presupposes that these are the actors who will improve the situation of poorer migrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309132511432085">Bakewell, 2008</xref>). This is a dangerous assumption when we recall Agamben’s compelling account of the governing of refugees in terms of spaces of exception – their lives are to be saved, while their political voice is silenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309132511432085">Oels, 2010</xref>). While many of the book’s contributors make some inroads into understanding the agency of mobile individuals and households, and the power relations in which they are enfolded, the introduction sets a confused scene that dims the insights later on. The first paragraph of the book makes the mistake of drawing on the sensationalism around climate migration to justify its existence, seeking to address sensationalism with ‘considered, well informed research’. The claim is made that ‘climate change threatens to significantly increase human movement’ but leaves unexplained who and what is perceived as being threatened, furthermore failing to recognize that sensationalism and fear surrounding climate change and migration are objects of study in their own right.</p>
<p>The multidisciplinary approach sees contributions from international law, refugee studies, economic geography, international relations, population health and psychology. While such a spread may be satisfying to some, those interested in understanding the role of capital or culture in large-scale environmental change and mobility will lament the largely absent perspectives of political economy, political ecology, cultural geography, cultural studies and anthropology. The book is also awkwardly timed, at a moment when research into climate change and migration is rapidly evolving from a project of identifying risks to one of providing rich empirical material from which broad-brush risk identification can be more soundly supported. The book thus feels both somewhat out of date and underworked, a problem which might have been avoided if room had been made for recent empirical work, particularly in disciplines which centralize ethnographic research. There is a cohort of postgraduate researchers interested in climate change and development taking up migration issues with gusto with participant communities all around the world. Some of these belong to the vulnerable populations in question, and are therefore positioned to provide unique perspectives that both support and challenge macro-level studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309132511432085">Simati, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Not that the book does not contain some very interesting perspectives. For example, Lorraine Elliot provides a critique of the climate migration-as-threat discourse in the Pacific region; Peter Penz argues for social insurance to compensate states for adaptation costs, including migration; and the editor, Jane McAdam, thoroughly canvasses the international law of ‘disappearing states’. For this reader, however, John Campbell’s account of the struggles of the Banabans of Rabi, who were internationally relocated over 60 years ago in the context of exploitation of their island by the British Phosphate Corporation, provides the type of evidence that is required to fully understand climate migration on the ground. The colonial government’s policy of encouraging relocation, as a way to increase mining activity, has left this community ambiguously positioned, symbolically and viscerally, politically and economically, between a decimated homeland and a relocation site. Campbell is not reifying rootedness in land, rather highlighting the contextual and complex political and emotional geographies that may await climate migrants. Beyond this, the book has little focus on work with particular communities long identified as possible climate migrants, beyond passing tokenistic references – for example, the perspectives of Kiribati youth in Maryanne Loughry’s chapter or the lonely voice of a Pacific islander activist mentioned in Lorraine Elliott’s chapter.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that several of the chapters are oriented towards the Asia-Pacific region (those by Hugo, Elliot, Campbell and McAdam). This focus is clearly a reflection of the editor’s own interests and networks (many of the contributors are based in the region). Yet Pacific people in particular are drawing attention to the need to understand climate change and migration through their own ontologies and epistemologies. Such perspectives require significantly more research attention, particularly as the same peoples describe their participation in climate change dialogue as minimal, and call for greater ownership of responses to their apparent vulnerability in the face of climate change. This is an aspect of climate migration discourse paid too little attention in the current volume. Until such work is included in collections such as this, the cynics among us might conclude that policy-makers, and their advisors, do not want interference in their attempts to manage climate migration from precisely those they are trying to manage.</p>
