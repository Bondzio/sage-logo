<p>The Association for Humanist Sociology (AHS) seeks graduate and undergraduate student papers that advocate for more humanistic workplaces. Papers may critically evaluate current forms of economic and workplace organization that repress the potential of people through inequality, bias, discrimination based upon race, gender, sexual orientation, and other bases of exploitation/domination. Papers may also address political and economic changes, initiatives, and policies, which occur away from workplaces but have significant consequences for conditions of work and workers. Examples include critiques of the global economy, outsourcing, and effects of austerity measures. Paper topics can also address how people resist dehumanizing conditions and create more humanistic alternatives, such as worker owned cooperatives, socially and environmentally responsible businesses, nonprofit and/or grass roots activist organizations, and instances where workers and/or unions have organized to win higher wages and/or improved working conditions.</p>
<p>The author of the most outstanding paper will be invited to present her or his work at the annual meetings of AHS and will receive a $250 honorarium to defray travel expenses and a free year of membership in AHS. The winning paper will also be formally reviewed and cultivated for possible publication in the journal of the AHS, <italic>Humanity and Society.</italic>
</p>
<p>Deadline: Papers must be submitted by May 30. Winners will be announced on August 15.</p>
<p>Papers accepted for publication are not eligible to receive the award.</p>
<p>Please send three copies of your paper to the following address or e-mail papers to “AHS Paper Competition Chair”: humanityandsociety@nau.edu. Please contact “Paper Competition Judge” if you have any questions.</p>

<bold>Frank Lindenfeld</bold>, a long-time member and dear friend to AHS, passed away on June 8, 2008. He was a husband and father, scholar, visionary advocate for democracy, and tireless worker for social and economic justice. As a scholar-activist, he was a leading authority on worker cooperatives and the cofounder of Grassroots Economic Organizing, a decentralized collective of educators, researchers, and grassroots activists working to promote an economy based on democratic participation, worker and community ownership, social and economic justice, and ecological sustainability. His wisdom, kindness, dedication, and gentle manner touched the lives of many people and his spirit will live on in the work that we do together to build a better world. Toward this end, the AHS Frank Lindenfeld Memorial fund was established and makes possible this paper competition.</p>
