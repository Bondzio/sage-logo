<p>Sports labour migration received dedicated academic study in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1012690212467527">John Bale and Joseph Maguire’s (1994)</xref> seminal text, <italic>The Global Sports Arena: Athletic Talent Migration in an Interdependent World</italic>. Subsequent contributions in the years since have largely consisted of case study material featuring the experiences of professional athletes in and across many sports and locations. A developing body of research has thus solidified the subject of migratory experiences, but on the whole research into sport labour migration is still arguably, as Maguire – the early pioneer of sports labour migration – identified, ‘in its relative infancy… much more work needs to be done, both at a conceptual level and with regard to empirical inquiry’ (2004: 477). Carter’s publication does both – and more – as it is a highly critical, deeply theorised, richly insightful and profoundly committed publication that exceeds anything published so far regarding labour migration in sport.</p>
<p>I first met Tom at a ‘Sport and the Irish’ interdisciplinary conference organised by Alan Bairner – an invaluable mentor and friend Tom and I share – at Magee campus, University of Ulster, in April 2002 and was instantly impressed not only by his knowledge of migrating cricket players to Northern Ireland but his passion for the study of migration experiences more broadly. Not only was Tom critically advancing sports labour migration research – a research passion of mine at the time – but he also brought a refreshing approach to the study of sport in Northern Ireland beyond the all too familiar fixation with ethno-sectarian politics. It is thus pleasing Carter has followed his passion to tenaciously and impressively collect over a decade’s worth of fieldwork to underpin this book and raise the bar for sports labour migration researchers in two ways.</p>
<p>Firstly, Carter impressively articulates and critiques the lives of many who travel the world through their athletic ability, and as a result he acquires a deservedly unheralded position that no other researcher can claim to have owing to the veracity, breadth and depth of his data as well as the length of time he spent in the field. Secondly, it is clear from early on that Carter views current sports labour migration research to be weak, and seems to use it a key motivating factor for the book. This can only be good, as Carter has produced a book that provides the ‘conceptual and empirical development’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1012690212467527">Maguire, 2004</xref>: 480) of sports labour migration by critically challenging what he sees as key weaknesses of current research. Fundamentally, he takes issue with how ‘several assumptions embedded within the existing literature on sport migration uncritically accept transnational sports migrants’ actual abilities to move when and where they desire and the significant benefits such strategic moves produce’ (p.5). It is not only commendable to seek to advance critical thought and debate in this way but will likely spark reactions from those he criticises who have produced:<disp-quote>
<p>…the current theoretical assumptions and methodological shortcomings within the study of sport, [and] this critique [the book] will create a more dynamic articulated space in which theories about the cultural institution called ‘sport’ will become more nuanced and less blinded by presumptions of historical pre-eminence, cultural superiority and Manichean divisions that reduce people to cardboard cut-outs. (p.11)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>By the end of the book I felt a greater clarity for what ‘sport’ is and how it is experienced and understood by those who migrate because of it – and this comes from someone whose doctorate is in sports labour migration.</p>
<p>One of the major contributions of the book is Carter’s framing of sports labour migration around ‘“transculturation” … to develop a theoretical framework for understanding transnational sport migration’ (p.12). Chapter 1 is centred on how ‘to facilitate our understanding of the politics and experience of transnational sports migrants [through] three related concepts, transculturation, mobility and visibility’ (p.17) and concludes with a ‘crucial point: transnational sport migration is a form of labour migration’ (p.44). Not only does this differ from other theories previously forwarded, but Carter offers a theoretical framework that arguably other theories – including the one I found most applicable (world systems theory) – do not convince with. Of particular benefit here is Carter’s research position (outlined in Chapter 1) as an anthropologist – rather than as a sociologist like other sports migrant researchers – and his justification that:<disp-quote>
<p>…an anthropological approach to the study of transnational migrants and migrant labour… has centred upon the contexts in which labourers navigate alien social landscapes that are no longer linked to a singular locale or contained within a nation-state but have become transnational social orders within which people struggle to make lives for themselves…This is as true for transnational sport migrants as it is for labourers in other industries (p.11).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Through this anthropological approach, Carter presents an unrivalled data set of rich insights from numerous sport migrants (coaches, players, club officials, journalists and medical staff) that have been deliberately chosen because they are not ‘sports stars’.</p>
<p>Rather, and commendably, Carter criticises fellow researchers (I am one) who ‘focus solely on these “sport stars” while virtually ignoring the thousands of other transnational sport migrants who labour in anonymous fields far from glaring media-fuelled attention and visibility’ (p.6). Considering that most sports labour migration research centres on giving the migrant a ‘voice’, Carter is only correct to extend the analytical lens to this majority group of sports migrants – the non-celebrity – and this is a further strength of the book.</p>
<p>In Chapter 2 Carter focusses on globalisation and global sport and duly criticises previous concepts of globalisation of sport as they ‘obscure, rather than reveal, many of the processes and experiences of what actually occurs in and around sport throughout the world’ (p.46). After comprehensive argument, Carter regards global sport to be ‘a commodity fetish’ (p.64). Interestingly, here Carter then moves to criticise Alan Tomlinson and John Hughson regarding their analysis of sport(ing) culture (and football culture, in particular) and how ‘the relation of sport to other aspects of society contains an ill-defined or undefined presumption that individuals who participate in a given sport share a specific worldview, norms, values and mores whenever and wherever they are in the world’ (p.65). For Carter:<disp-quote>
<p>Missing from these analyses are the specific, situated contexts of individuals’ practices <italic>in relation to</italic> alternative ways of engaging in the same practice or, more often, what is missing is the context of the practice <italic>in relation to</italic> other practices within the same society (p.65).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In quite a strong critical section, Carter contends that ‘this is the mistaken direction in much of what has come to be called sports studies, in which a sport-related practice typically becomes an object that defines the group’ (p.65).</p>
<p>Without stopping for breath, the criticism continues regarding the contributions of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1012690212467527">Miller et al. (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1012690212467527">Maguire (1999)</xref> on ‘global sport’, with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1012690212467527">Miller et al. (2001)</xref> being chastised for not focussing on sports labour migration at all. On the other hand, Maguire comes in for weighty criticism – both on pages 66–67 and in Footnote 11 on p.195 – because Carter:<disp-quote>
<p>…cannot find a single individual acting in an embedded social context (speaking, running, teaching, working and so forth) in Maguire’s ever-growing <italic>oeuvre</italic>. Any voices heard are filtered through media, governing and corporate institutions; nowhere does any individual speak or act for themselves. (p. 67)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p><italic>In Foreign Fields</italic> certainly cannot be criticised for not allowing the transnational sports migrant to speak or act for themselves, and it will be interesting to see how Maguire takes Carter’s criticisms given Maguire’s article revisiting sports labour migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1012690212467527">Maguire, 2004</xref>) to rebuff criticisms made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1012690212467527">Magee and Sugden (2002)</xref>.</p>
<p>Carter’s doubts regarding global sport literature sees Chapter 3 dedicate itself to how the global governance of sport and global institutions control athletic talent migration to the point that ‘transnational sport migrants must deal with both state-level and international governance, which at times can include conflicting, if not merely contradictory, auspices of that governance’ (p.75). The chapter uses the vibrant experiences of various subjects to conceptualise the state, sovereignty and citizenship and indicate how ‘transnational sport migrants have to deal with bureaucratic practices’ (p.96). A most telling point is the fluidity of citizenship and how ‘transnational sport migrants, particularly athletes, can and do switch citizenship to facilitate their economic earning power’ (p.95). Chapter 4 moves on to consider the New Economic Order of sport as ‘a space to make themselves [transnational sports migrants] visible and a vehicle to further enhance their own economic capital. NEOsport provides the means for developing their own capitalized Self in a dialectic process of production and alienation’ (p.98). Using key excerpts from subjects, Carter raises some excellent points regarding the production and alienation of the Self as, and through being, a transnational sports migrant. The beauty of the writing here is such that the reader imagines themselves to be a part of the research action rather than a reader of it.</p>
<p>This vibe continues in Chapter 5 when Carter focusses on the issue of family, an often overlooked component of the sport migrant’s decision-making process, and some telling accounts are provided to illuminate the (family) difficulties that lie behind being mobile. The transnational sport migrant has a job waiting for them, but those who accompany the migrant do not, and as a result Carter raises a significant point by recognising that families are not uniform, in most cases are shaped by gender relations and that the spouse/partner and the athlete/husband do not experience mobility in the same ways. Carter eloquently highlights the elements of family risk in the decision to migrate, though it was telling to me to hear some South African migrants consider post-Good Friday Agreement Northern Ireland to be a safer place than post-apartheid South Africa, no doubt a key factor in the rising stock of Ulster rugby in the last decade or so.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 for me was the most powerful chapter as Carter begins by recounting a meeting at a Belfast cricket club with what turned out to be an illegal subject from the Asian subcontinent who was ‘visibly’ playing cricket as a way of ‘hiding’ from the UK immigration authorities, a paradox almost beyond belief. Carter then discusses ‘the movement of such “illegal” persons as undocumented migration’ (p.153), but is quick to point out what is under consideration in this chapter is not human trafficking, as for the transnational sport migrant ‘their eventual employment is totally legal, although the means by which they acquire such positions may not be entirely so’ (p.156). The European football passport scandals and smuggled labour in Cuban/Caribbean/US baseball dominate the rest of a very articulate chapter that indicates the lengths to which some individuals and even authorities will go to provide ‘false citizenship claims to facilitate athletic careers’ (p.163). The focus of this chapter neatly leads into the start of the concluding chapter as Carter introduces the case of Carlos Entrada, a disappeared Cuban baseball player who ‘may have become the first “baseball <italic>balsero</italic>” to actually die in the attempt to leave Cuba and obtain a professional contract in the United States’ (p.181). It is difficult not to get emotional here, such is the tragedy of the case, and also the emotional fervour within Carter’s prose that portrays the dangerously difficult predicament Entrada faced and the decision he ultimately made.</p>
<p>Carter duly summaries the key facets of the book well in the conclusion and reinforces his central theme that ‘the production of mobility is a defining characteristic of the politics of transnational sport migration’ (pp.186–187). Carter concludes by correctly indicating that the journeys experienced by his subjects have yet to be concluded, and as a result fuller and deeper analysis is not yet possible until the journeys end. Indeed, this would be my sole criticism of Carter’s book in that I want to know how the journeys of the different migrants end, and what sense can be made upon their conclusion rather than those offered here from a part-made journey. To do that requires more research from Carter – assuming he still has access to the subjects – and only he knows if that will occur. Like other researchers on sports labour migration, though, he reinforces the plea for more research and pinpoints in particular a hope for research from non-Western academics, in non-Western locations and also in less visible geographical places and sports.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a momentous contribution to the study of sports labour migration and sport studies in general. Carter has significantly raised the bar for those in sports labour migration research, and with that has laid down a challenge for future work to be more theorised and better analysed than at present. Also, the space is worth watching to see what responses will come from those Carter criticises: academics who for decades have been writing on global sport and sports labour migration but who also have been central to the development of sports studies as a discipline. I shall watch that ‘more dynamic articulated space’ (p.5) with great interest.</p>
