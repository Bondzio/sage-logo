<abstract>
<p>Pharmacomechanical thrombolysis (PMT) is an emerging treatment option for symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT). This may obviate the need for systemic or catheter-directed thrombolysis. PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane database search of PMT in acute and chronic symptomatic DVT was undertaken. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, procedural details, DVT characteristics, and procedural and clinical outcomes are presented. A total of 8 case series (n = 2528; 1998-2009) qualified for inclusion. Lower extremity symptomatic DVTs constituted the majority of the cases (&gt;80%). Both acute (&lt;14 days) and chronic (&gt;14 days) DVTs were included. Procedural success was 59% to 100% and catheter-directed thrombolysis was used as an adjunct in 16% to 53%. No deaths or major bleeding complications were reported. Pharmacomechanical thrombolysis leads to the immediate resolution of clinical symptoms of DVT in the majority of patients. Pharmacomechanical thrombolysis may be a safe and novel method, when appropriate expertise and resources are available, for the treatment of symptomatic acute and chronic DVT.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is associated with adverse outcomes (eg, pulmonary embolism [PE], chronic venous insufficiency, and the postthrombotic syndrome [PTS]). Treatment with anticoagulant therapy alone does not resolve thrombus promptly, and evidence suggests that early removal of thrombus burden can prevent both short- and long-term sequelae.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003319711410050">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003319711410050"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0003319711410050"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0003319711410050"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0003319711410050">5</xref></sup> Various treatment modalities are available to achieve thromboreduction; however, some strategies such as systemic thrombolysis and catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) are associated with an unacceptable risk of bleeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0003319711410050">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0003319711410050"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0003319711410050">8</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Pharmacomechanical thrombolysis (PMT) is the latest strategy that seems to be associated with lower complication rates, especially the risk of systemic bleeding. The safety and efficacy of PMT has been documented in several small-scale studies but randomized clinical trials are lacking. Therefore, we conducted a review of the literature with an aim to determine the safety profile and clinical success of PMT.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0003319711410050">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane database search was conducted with the following combination of terms (acute deep vein thrombosis OR chronic deep vein thrombosis AND [Trellis OR Angio Jet] OR pharmacomechanical thrombolysis AND Humans). The search was not restricted to the English language only. All retrospective studies, prospective studies, and registry/industry-based data, which were specifically designed to determine the baseline demographic and clinical features, angiographic, and clinical outcomes of PMT strategies, in both acute (≤14 days) and chronic (&gt;14 days) symptomatic DVT, were included. No case reports were included. Any study that was judged relevant on the basis of its title was retrieved in the abstract form, and if relevant, in full-text form. All available studies were independently analyzed by the investigators for appropriate inclusion. Disagreement about eligibility was resolved by discussion. We extended our search by reviewing references from the retrieved articles.</p>
<p>After all studies were reviewed, a comprehensive data extraction was undertaken and several variables were collected and the data were tabulated. The corresponding authors were contacted individually to obtain information on the missing data. Additional data sent to us by the corresponding author were included in the data summary. Each study was carefully analyzed for methodology, inclusion and exclusion criteria, report of follow-up, and outcomes prior to inclusion in the systematic review. The studies/series needed to have had the following: baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of patients presenting with acute and chronic symptomatic DVT, indications for PMT, venographic characteristics (including the location of DVT), details on percutaneous endovenous interventions (including the description of the type of mechanical thrombectomy device, treatment characteristics, concomitant use of thrombolytic therapies with their respective doses, and duration of therapy), venographic or duplex outcomes, and/or clinical end point examinations.</p>
<p>The Angio Jet system (Possis Medical, Minneapolis, Minnesota) consists of 3 components: a single-use catheter, a single-use pump set, and a pump drive unit. The 6F catheter operates over a 0.035-inch guide wire. The dual-lumen catheter design consists of 1 lumen supplying pressurized saline to the distal catheter tip, and a second lumen incorporating the first lumen, guide wire, and particulate debris removed from the thrombus. The pump drive unit generates high-pressure pulsatile saline flow that exits the catheter tip through multiple retrograde-directed jets. These high-velocity jets (using the power spray techniques described previously) create a localized low-pressure zone (Bernoulli effect) for thrombus aspiration and maceration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0003319711410050">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0003319711410050">10</xref></sup> The Angio Jet has been associated with hemolysis, hyperkalemia, and distal embolization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0003319711410050">9</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The Trellis device (Covidien Inc, Dublin, Ireland) is a 6F or 8F multilumen dispersion catheter that can be passed over a 0.035-inch guide wire, and it is available in lengths of 80 to 120 cm with treatment zone lengths ranging between 10 and 30 cm. The external portion of the device has 5 separate entry ports. Two are used to inflate compliant balloons located at either end of the infusion and dispersion segment. The balloons, which can be inflated, isolate the treatment zone, maintain concentration of the thrombolytic agent (tissue plasminogen activator [tPa] being the most commonly used thrombolytic agent infused through a third port), localize thrombolytic delivery, and prevent distal embolization. The fourth port, which is the proximal end hole, directs the dispersion wire (nitinol cable with a sinusoidal-shaped region) into the central lumen, where it resides within the isolated treatment zone. The dispersion wire is connected to a handheld oscillation drive unit, which serves to oscillate the dispersion wire (can be confirmed fluoroscopically), thereby optimizing mechanical dispersion of the thrombolytic agent as the clot is fragmented. After 10 minutes, the liquefied thrombus is aspirated through a fifth port, which is located immediately proximal to the distal balloon. The Trellis device via the use of proximal and distal balloon inflation to achieve isolation allows for a lower dose of the thrombolytic, increases the concentration of the thrombolytic within the isolated segment, and also prevents distal embolization and is therefore sometimes referred to as isolated PMT (IPMT).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The search yielded a total of 62 articles, including case reports, of which only 8 case series/registries (n = 2528) were eligible for inclusion in this systematic review (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0003319711410050">Figure 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0003319711410050">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0003319711410050"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0003319711410050"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0003319711410050"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0003319711410050"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0003319711410050"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0003319711410050"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0003319711410050">18</xref></sup> These 8 case series specifically assessed the utility of a pharmacomechanical strategy utilizing either the Trellis or the Angio Jet system. The study periods were from 1998 to 2009, with all of them being retrospective analysis/registry data. Baseline demographic characteristics of the patient population are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0003319711410050">Table 1</xref>. There were a substantial proportion of females (43%-82%) in each of the series. The majority of the reported DVTs were secondary to malignancy (19%-74%) or hypercoagulable states (6%-35%).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which consists of PE and DVT, is an underdiagnosed disease spectrum that is associated with high mortality and morbidity. Postthrombotic syndrome may occur in 50% of patients, months to years after an acute episode of DVT despite anticoagulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003319711410050">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0003319711410050">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0003319711410050">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0003319711410050">19</xref></sup> Postthrombotic syndrome occurs as a result of venous valve damage caused by persistent thrombus and inflammation. It involves the development of edema and skin changes manifesting as hyperpigmentation, lipodermatosclerosis, atrophie blanche, and in the most advanced cases, venous stasis ulcer. Female gender, obesity, recurrent proximal (iliofemoral) DVT, older age, and presence of varicose veins are risk factors for PTS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0003319711410050">5</xref></sup> There is a 44% incidence of valve damage if there is persistent thrombus at 6 months, which may be attributable to the increased prevalence of PTS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003319711410050">1</xref></sup> Approximately 60% of patients with first-time symptomatic proximal DVT develop PTS, and compression stockings plus anticoagulation can reduce this by only approximately 50% at 24 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0003319711410050">20</xref></sup> The average overall direct medical costs of late complications of DVT have been reported to be approximately $10 000 per person. The cost of treatment of PTS is approximately $300 million per year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0003319711410050">3</xref></sup> This has led to alternative treatment paradigms that involve early thromboreduction with the goal of reducing PTS and other morbidities associated with DVT.</p>
<p>There are several indications that have been reported for which acute thromboreduction has been performed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0003319711410050">Table 5</xref>). Several treatment strategies have been utilized to manage DVT and these include anticoagulation, surgical thrombectomy, systemic thrombolytics, catheter-directed thrombolytics, and PMT. In 1984, Plate and colleagues assessed the long-term efficacy of surgical thrombectomy versus anticoagulation alone. The patency rate was significantly better in the surgical arm compared to the anticoagulation arm at 10 years (84% vs 41%) coupled with a reduction in PTS at 6 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0003319711410050">21</xref></sup> The drawbacks to the surgical strategy include the need for general anesthesia, wound infection, prolonged recovery time, and bleeding complications. Systemic thrombolytics emerged as the next treatment tool for acute VTE. A pooled analysis of 13 randomized studies evaluating systemic thrombolytics versus anticoagulation in patients with acute symptomatic proximal DVT found that the use of systemic thrombolytics significantly reduced PTS morbidity and leg ulcers at 48 months but were associated with a 10% to 50% systemic bleeding risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0003319711410050">22</xref></sup> In an effort to reduce this unacceptably high bleeding risk, CDT was developed. It involves localized delivery of thrombolytics and thereby a reduction in the total dose of thrombolytics. However, it involves prolonged intensive care unit stay with an indwelling catheter for thrombolytic infusion and has a reported 10% risk of major bleeding. In the largest multicenter registry study evaluating CDT, it was found that 64% of patients achieved patency at 1 year, however, the risk of major bleeding was 11% and the mean infusion time was 53 hours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0003319711410050">8</xref></sup>

<p>To overcome these drawbacks, PMT, a catheter-based technique that combines both pharmacologic and mechanical thrombolysis was developed. The advantages of PMT include a reduction in overall dosage and duration of thrombolytic therapy compared with CDT. Pharmacomechanical thrombolysis can be an elective procedure with an anticipated discharge within 24 to 48 hours, and it is potentially more cost-effective compared with CDT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0003319711410050">13</xref></sup> Pharmacomechanical thrombolysis involves multiple strategies with utilization of primarily 2 types of devices: Angio Jet rheolytic thrombectomy and the Trellis thrombectomy system.</p>
<p>There are no randomized controlled trials that either compare PMT versus CDT or compare one PMT device with another, that is, Trellis versus Angio Jet. Retrospective studies and a single registry-based study describing the outcomes with PMT have been published and are summarized in this review.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0003319711410050">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0003319711410050"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0003319711410050"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0003319711410050"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0003319711410050"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0003319711410050"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0003319711410050">17</xref></sup> However, the limited methodological and reporting quality and also the interstudy heterogeneity precluded the performance of a meaningful meta-analysis. Our analysis indicates that PMT may be effective in achieving procedural success (degree of lysis) in patients with both acute and chronic symptomatic DVTs with no systemic bleeding complications or mortality. The degree of success was quite variable, with each series having a different criterion to define procedural success. Some of the series categorized the degree of lysis into grade I, II, and III (using the thrombus removal scale system described previously), which represent achievement of &lt;50% lysis, 50% to 94% lysis, and &gt;95% lysis, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003319711410050">23</xref></sup> Despite the variability in achieving higher procedural success, majority (74%-98%) of the patients had an immediate resolution of symptoms (pain, swelling, etc). Follow-up was inconsistent across the studies and long-term data on development of PTS were lacking. It is well known that PTS can develop months to years after an episode of acute DVT; therefore, results of long-term follow-up are pertinent. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has sponsored the first ongoing multicenter, phase III, randomized controlled trial called the ATTRACT (acute venous thrombosis: thrombus removal with adjunctive catheter-directed thrombolysis) to evaluate PMT plus standard oral anticoagulation versus standard oral anticoagulation alone in patients with symptomatic proximal lower extremity DVT (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00790335). This study will incorporate the use of both the Angio Jet and Trellis devices. It is designed to assess whether PMT prevents postthrombotic syndrome over a 2-year follow-up period and will simultaneously determine the safety and cost-effectiveness.</p>
<p>Rao et al evaluated the use of PMT with either the Angio Jet or Trellis in patients with contraindications to systemic thrombolysis due to a high risk of hemorrhagic complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0003319711410050">17</xref></sup> Successful lysis was achieved in 95% of patients and symptom resolution in 93%. There were no major systemic bleeding complications or deaths, but access site hematoma occurred in 2 patients and worsening rectus sheath hematomas in 2 others. Freedom from DVT recurrence and reintervention was 95% at 9 months. This study demonstrated that perhaps PMT can also be safely and effectively used for patients with subacute iliofemoral DVT who have contraindications to systemic thrombolytic therapy; however, prospective clinical trials are needed to substantiate this. Long-term follow-up evaluating the incidence of PTS and venous patency rates was lacking based on our review.</p>
<p>Currently, the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) recommends the use of CDT or PMT in patients with extensive acute iliofemoral DVT, symptoms of &lt;14 days (acute onset), good functional status, and a life expectancy ≥1 year, who have a low risk of bleeding, if appropriate expertise and resources are available (level of recommendation 2B which is a weak recommendation with moderate quality of evidence).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0003319711410050">24</xref></sup> Moreover, PMT is preferred over CDT alone to shorten treatment time, while mechanical thrombectomy as a stand-alone therapy is preferably avoided. In addition, the ACCP suggests the correction of underlying venous lesions using balloon angioplasty and stents. Currently, there is no evidence to support the routine prophylactic use of inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement during PMT procedures. The recently published TORPEDO trial documented an extremely low incidence of periprocedural pulmonary embolism during endovenous intervention for lower extremity DVT, most likely due to the fact that retrievable IVC filters were placed preemptively in all patients prior to venous thrombectomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0003319711410050">25</xref></sup> The rationale was to avoid iatrogenic PE. None of the patients undergoing the intervention had fatal or nonfatal PE, compared with the control group. Factors that need to be considered prior to intervention include extent and location of DVT, age of DVT, presenting symptoms, bleeding risk, need for temporary IVC filter placement, and cost-effectiveness. Moreover, factors that need to be considered after intervention include degree of lyses achieved, long-term incidence of venous patency, long-term incidence of PTS, quality-of-life measures, and relief of symptoms. The TORPEDO trial concluded that the development of PTS (after percutaneous endovascular interventions) at 6 months was significantly higher in the control group (27.2% vs 3.4%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) coupled with greater severity of PTS. The rates of recurrent VTE were also lower in the group that received percutaneous venous intervention (2.3% vs 14.8%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0003319711410050">25</xref></sup> Although this trial was not specifically designed to assess the utility of either Angio Jet or the Trellis systems, a substantial proportion of the patients (38%) were treated using these modalities.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Pharmacomechanical thrombolysis may be an emerging treatment option for acute and chronic symptomatic DVT and can be achieved with either Trellis or the Angio Jet systems. Pharmacomechanical thrombolysis may obviate the need for systemic thrombolysis or catheter-directed thrombolysis, although the latter may be used as an adjunct to achieve better procedural end results in those with incomplete thromboreduction. Pharmacomechanical thrombolysis may be a safe method for the treatment of symptomatic acute and chronic DVT with excellent rates of patency reported, when appropriate resources and expertise are available. Larger scale prospective randomized trials are warranted to assess the long-term impact of such therapies.</p>
