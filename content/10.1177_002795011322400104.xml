<abstract>
<p>This paper investigates whether intangibles might explain the UK productivity puzzle. We note that since the recession: (a) firms have upskilled faster than before; (b) intangible investment in R&amp;D and software has risen whereas tangible investment has fallen; and (c) intangible and telecoms equipment investment slowed in advance of the recession. We have therefore tested to see if: (a) what looks like labour hoarding is actually firms keeping workers who are employed in creating intangible assets; and (b) the current slowdown in TFP growth is due to the spillover effects of the past slowdown in R&amp;D and telecoms equipment investment. Our main findings are: (a) measured market sector real value added growth since the start of 2008 is understated by 1.6 per cent due to the omission of intangibles; and (b) 0.75 per cent per annum of the TFP growth slowdown can be accounted for by the slowdown in intangible and telecoms investment in the early 2000s. Taken together intangible investment can therefore account for around 5 percentage points of the 16 per cent productivity puzzle.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Between 2007 and 2009 real UK market sector value added fell by 7.4 per cent. Market sector hours worked fell by 3.5 per cent and hence market sector productivity fell by 4 per cent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-002795011322400104">1</xref></sup> In 2010, hours started to grow again, but output has grown very slowly. Between 2011 and 2012Q3, the latest period for which market sector data are available, hours have grown by 3.4 per cent but market sector value added by 0 per cent. Hence productivity has fallen by 3.4 per cent. Market sector output per hour is now around 16 per cent below its pre-crisis trend. Why?</p>
<p>The standard explanation for the <italic>initial</italic> fall in productivity is labour hoarding. In most previous recessions, firms cut output but kept labour in reserve for the recovery. Productivity, output per worker, falls at first, but then recovers as the firm uses the reserve inputs. Strictly speaking the fall in productivity is mismeasurement since the output per utilised input is the same, but with utilisation typically poorly measured this shows up as a fall, then rise, in productivity.</p>
<p>This explanation seems to carry less and less weight for the post-2008 years, for it seems very unlikely that firms are still carrying underutilised workers four years on. Further, as we document below, during the recession and since, firms have upskilled at a much faster pace (skill-adjusted labour composition rose at 0.5 per cent per annum 2005–8, but at 1.1 per cent after 2008).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-002795011322400104">2</xref></sup> Thus if firms are holding onto workers, it is the high skilled, not the low skilled.</p>
<p>A number of different explanations of the UK productivity puzzle have been put forward. First, there are the arguments on labour hoarding and labour utilisation noted above. Second, that this recession has come at a time of greater labour market flexibility so that declines in real wages have allowed firms to keep on less productive workers. At the same time the financial crisis may have increased the cost of capital so that at the margin firms are substituting away from capital and towards labour, thus reducing labour productivity. Third, that the financial crisis has impaired the re-allocation of capital and that there is less migration of capital away from low return activity to higher returns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-002795011322400104">Broadbent, 2012</xref>). Fourth, that a greater degree of forbearance and also increased risk aversion on the part of banks has resulted in less entry and exit since the recession, with ‘zombie firms’ maintained and few high productivity entrants. Fifth, that a decline in business investment has reduced the capital–labour ratio and therefore labour productivity. We consider here a potential sixth explanation to do with the role of intangible investment in terms of both measurement and its impact on growth.</p>
<p>A broad range of intangible assets is included, under three main intangible asset classes, based on the definitions first developed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-002795011322400104">Corrado, Hulten and Sichel (2005)</xref>. Firstly, computerised information (mainly software), secondly, innovative property (covering scientific and non-scientific R&amp;D) and finally firm-specific resources (company spending on reputation, human and organisational capital).</p>
<p>To examine the role of intangibles, our starting point is the observation that whilst investment in <italic>tangibles</italic>, plant/vehicles/buildings has fallen and stayed low, a point perhaps not noticed is that <italic>investment in intangibles, specifically Research and Development (R&amp;D) and software has risen</italic> since the recession (software fell and has since been rising, R&amp;D was flat and then rose). Consider then a firm which has reduced production but maintained investment in intangibles. Its skill level rises, since intangible investment typically requires high qualified workers. Its measured output falls, since the output of e.g. R&amp;D projects might not manifest itself for a few years. Thus labour productivity falls, in a pattern <italic>that looks just like labour hoarding.</italic></p>
<p>There is a second effect. Although intangible investment has been relatively robust over the recession, it fell before 2008. This was because there was a huge surge in intangible investment in the late 1990s around the introduction of the internet, with new software, machinery etc. In addition, as is well known, R&amp;D investment as a share of GDP has been falling for quite some time in the UK. If such investment has spillovers, and they take some time, then it might be that productivity/total factor productivity (TFP) would have fallen in the late 2000s anyway, due to the slowdown in intangible investment in the early 2000s.</p>
<p>This paper then reviews these hypotheses. It therefore attempts to add an additional hypothesis to the literature on the UK productivity puzzle. There is a wide range of commentary and articles written on the productivity puzzle and offering a number of different explanations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-002795011322400104">3</xref></sup> For example, the productivity puzzle has been discussed in various speeches by MPC members including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-002795011322400104">Dale (2011)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-002795011322400104">Broadbent (2012)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-002795011322400104">Weale (2012)</xref> and by other commentators such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-002795011322400104">Martin and Rowthorn (2012)</xref>.

See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-002795011322400104">Disney <italic>et al.</italic> (2013)</xref> for a review of most of the explanations put forward to explain the productivity puzzle.</p>
<p>Our main conclusions are as follows. First, measured market sector real value added growth since the start of 2008 is understated by 1.6 per cent due to the omission of intangibles. Second, TFP growth would have slowed down anyway by around 0.75 percentage points per annum. The actual slowdown has been much larger than this, since TFP has gone from a pre-recession average of 1.39 per cent per annum (2002–7) to −2.29 per cent per annum (2007–10).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-002795011322400104">4</xref></sup> Taken together this accounts for around 5 percentage points of the 16 per cent productivity puzzle.</p>

Output per hour is around 16 per cent below its pre-crisis trend. Mechanically, there has been weak output growth combined with a much more robust labour market than most people expected.

The data show the well-known collapse in buildings and plant investment after 2007 and the remaining low investment levels. Less well-known, however, are the levels of R&amp;D and software investment. Both hardly fell over the period and indeed are higher than in 2007.</p>

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>Data for growth in labour productivity, measured as growth in value-added per hour worked, are presented in column 1. The story they tell is by now familiar. Labour productivity fell sharply in the recession of 2008 and 2009, but has remained weak in the recovery and the decline in productivity in the second recession of 2012 is even greater than that in either year of the initial recession itself.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-002795011322400104">
<title>Capital/labour substitution and labour hoarding</title>
<p>Columns 2 and 3 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-002795011322400104">table 1</xref> show the contributions to labour productivity growth of growth in capital services per hour and labour services per hour. Both columns shed light on two hypotheses concerning the labour market. One is that the decline in real wages has lowered the relative price of labour to capital, thus incentivising substitution away from capital towards labour. At the same time, tightening of credit conditions since the financial crisis might have further increased the relative price of capital.</p>
<p>The data here give some slight support for this view. As column 3 shows, the contribution of capital services per hour up to the recession was 1 per cent per annum.</p>
<p>In 2009, that contribution rose strongly, that is, labour was reduced more than capital. In 2010 by contrast, the contribution fell quite markedly, suggesting that firms are, relative to before, substituting towards labour. This pattern is reflected in columns 4, 5, and 6 which show TFP growth. As we set out below, TFP growth measures labour productivity growth controlling for capital/labour inputs. TFP growth declined very sharply in the recession, suggesting that labour productivity did not just fall due to capital/labour substitution.</p>
<p>A second view is labour hoarding. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-002795011322400104">Martin and Rowthorn (2012)</xref> advance the view that the fall in labour productivity is due to labour hiring behaviour. Consider a firm with ‘overhead’ and ‘variable’ labour. An initial fall in demand causes overhead labour to be hoarded and variable to be fired, though these effects are moderated with a fall in real wages. Productivity falls as overhead labour is under-utilised. A recovery in demand, at low wages, causes variable labour to be hired. Productivity rises as overhead labour utilisation recovers, but might fall as more labour is hired. To get an overall fall in productivity and then no rise in the employment recovery, they posit high and low productivity sectors. In the initial recession the high productivity sector fired variable labour and kept on overhead labour at low utilisation. In the recovery, that sector hired few new workers and raised utilisation: a jobless recovery with rising productivity in that sector. The low productivity sector by contrast fired both types, so that in the recovery they hired both types, lowering overall productivity via a mix effect. They present evidence that the recovery in employment since 2008 has been entirely in the low productivity sector (see their Chart 14 and Table 12, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbr.cam.ac.uk/pdf/BM_Report3.pdf">www.cbr.cam.ac.uk/pdf/BM_Report3.pdf</ext-link>. Their high productivity sectors are manufacturing, financial and business services, low productivity are agriculture, construction, distribution, hotels and restaurants).</p>
<p>One way to look at the Martin/Rowthorn hypothesis is via labour composition indices. These are indices of labour hours adjusted for various dimensions of labour composition (e.g. skill, age, gender). In practice they are driven by skill levels so that if the index of labour composition rises (labour services per hour worked), then firms are increasingly hiring more skilled workers per hour worked. ONS data for the contribution of quality-adjusted labour services per hour worked are presented in column 2 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-002795011322400104">table 1</xref>. If low-skilled labour had been hoarded, we would expect the contribution of labour composition either to grow less fast or even to decline. But growth in the contribution of labour composition in 2009 and 2010 has been extremely strong, suggesting the opposite has occurred, that is, that firms have hoarded high-skilled labour at the expense of low-skilled. This is borne out in the analysis contained in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-002795011322400104">Acheson (2011)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-002795011322400104">Acheson and Franklin (2012)</xref>. Note that this is also consistent with the data for R&amp;D investment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-002795011322400104">figure 1</xref>, and other categories of intangible investment, all consistent with the idea that it is the higher skilled ‘knowledge workers’ that have been kept on by firms.</p>
<p>However, the Martin/Rowthorn view is across different sectors. In the recession, they argue, the high productivity sectors have hoarded relatively more skilled labour and let go relatively more unskilled. Thus they should have a relatively large rise in labour composition. In the recovery, the high productivity sector employs more fully their hoarded skilled workers and takes on relatively few unskilled. The low productivity sectors take on relatively more low skilled labour. So again, the high productivity sector should have a relatively high rise in composition. The data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-002795011322400104">Acheson and Franklin (2012)</xref> do not support this version of the Martin/Rowthorn view. In the initial recession, growth in labour composition was 1.6 per cent per annum and 2.5 per cent per annum in the high and low productivity sectors and in the recovery 1.9 per cent and 2.0 per cent. Thus, in the recession, the low productivity sectors retained relatively more skilled than the high productivity and in the recovery have hired relatively more skilled workers than the high productivity sectors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-002795011322400104">6</xref></sup> The data used to make this comparison are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-002795011322400104">table 2</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>Looking at the years prior to the recession, utilisation adjusted TFP was higher than measured TFP in the early 2000s. The adjustment in the years immediately before the recession was very small. The major interest is in 2008 to 2009. As the graph shows, adjusting for utilisation removes some of its impact from TFP, suggesting TFP did not fall as fast as in the measured data. The adjustments are not that large however. The reason is that in 2009 TFP (ONS) was −3.6 per cent. In that year Δln(<italic>H/N</italic>) (ONS) was – 1.6 per cent. Our UK estimate for <mml:math id="mm1-inline1-002795011322400104"><mml:mover><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>∘</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math> is 0.39. The contribution of utilisation in 2009 is therefore (0.39*–0.016=)–0.6 per cent, thus adding 0.6 per cent to TFP. Note that if the UK estimate of <mml:math id="mm2-inline2-002795011322400104"><mml:mover><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>∘</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math> were more similar to that found in the US, say <mml:math id="mm3-inline3-002795011322400104"><mml:mover><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>∘</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math> = 1.008,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-002795011322400104">9</xref></sup> the contribution of utilisation would be (1.008* −0.016=)–1.6 per cent and would explain around 44 per cent of the fall in TFP.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-002795011322400104">10</xref></sup></p>

We consider the full range of intangible assets proposed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-002795011322400104">Corrado, Hulten and Sichel (2005)</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-002795011322400104">11</xref></sup> Since our intangibles dataset only extends to 2009, some assumptions to extend the series have been made.</p>
<p>First we assume that the intangible investment share (excluding software, mineral exploration and artistic originals), <mml:math id="mm5-inline5-002795011322400104"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Q</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math>, is the same in 2010, 2011 and 2012 as it was in 2009 (at 0.09). Second we assume that real intangible investment is growing at the same rate as real R&amp;D investment in 2010 and 2011, and that the rate for real R&amp;D investment is the same in 2012 as in 2011. Estimates of real measured growth and changes in the output deflator have also been extended with the latest ONS data. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-002795011322400104">Figure 5</xref> presents an estimate of this bias term.</p>

</fig>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-002795011322400104">Figure 5</xref> shows that in the late 1990s, when there was an intangible investment boom, the term is positive, that is value-added including intangibles was growing faster than measured value-added. In general for much of the 2000s the term is negative, with growth in intangible output weaker than measured final output, suggesting growth was being overstated during that time. However in 2009 the term is positive and suggests an understatement to output growth of 0.1 per cent. The terms for 2010 and 2011 suggest an understatement of 0.12 per cent and 0.5 per cent respectively. In 2011 and 2012 market sector GVA growth was 1.17 per cent and −0.26 per cent per annum respectively. <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-002795011322400104">12</xref></sup> Thus the bias of 0.57 per cent for 2012 means output growth would instead be 0.31 per cent per annum rather than negative.</p>
<p>The impact of this in terms of labour productivity can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-002795011322400104">figure 6</xref>. There the red line is an index of market sector labour productivity (GDP per hour) as conventionally measured, and the dashed line an index of labour productivity with the underlying output measure adjusted to treat intangible spending as capital investment. As can be seen, by 2012, not accounting for intangibles results in the index of labour productivity being underestimated by around 1.6 index points.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-002795011322400104">13</xref></sup> The reason is that market sector growth since the start of 2008 is −4.4 per cent, but adjusted market sector growth is approximately −2.8 per cent.</p>

<title>Spillovers</title>
<p>Intangible investment affects the productivity growth of the firm undertaking the investment. But it has an additional effect if there are spillovers. There is a large body of work suggesting that R&amp;D has spillover effects to other firms: see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-002795011322400104">Griliches (1973)</xref> for a survey, concentrating mostly on US work, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-002795011322400104">Goodridge, Haskel and Wallis (2012b)</xref> for recent work for the UK.</p>
<p>A number of US authors (e.g. Fernald, 2012) have noted a slowdown in US TFP growth before the 2008 recession, which they ascribe in turn to a slowdown in intangible investment in the early 2000s following the heavy burst of intangible investment in the late 1990s internet/computer boom. In the UK, there has also been a sustained slowdown in UK R&amp;D/GDP spend noted by a number of authors and policymakers. We thus examine the data for the UK; was there an intangible investment slowdown and might that have slowed down underlying TFP growth before the recession?</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-002795011322400104">Figure 7</xref> sets out intangible and tangible investment as a proportion of market sector GVA. Intangible investment rose since the 1980s, but slowed down in the early 2000s. Tangible investment has generally been in decline throughout the 2000s. So if there are spillovers from intangible investment to TFP and if they take, say two years to show up, then TFP growth in the late 2000s would slow. Of course, it might well slow down before the shock of 2008 and the shock might have an additional effect, but even so, there remains the possibility that at least some of the slowdown might be due to a feed-through from the earlier slowdown in intangible investment.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-002795011322400104">Figure 8</xref> shows the changes in capital stocks as a result of this investment, along with changes in R&amp;D capital and telecoms equipment. The latter bears some comment. One way of thinking about the internet is that it is a (very large) piece of communications capital equipment, building on older telecoms capital and being augmented by broadband and mobile technologies. If one thinks of such equipment as building networks it is very natural to ask if there is any evidence of spillovers from telecoms equipment. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-002795011322400104">Corrado (2010)</xref> points out, there are many channels through which communications capital deepening may have contributed to improved growth in TFP, e.g. improved opportunity and ability for collaboration; more effective communication and increased quality of information communicated both within and between organisations; improved access to freely available knowledge via the internet; and improved organisational and business processes, including within supply chains, derived from each of the previous effects described. Such spillovers could be even more substantial in more knowledge-oriented economies. In fact, recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-002795011322400104">Adams, Black, Clemmons and Stephan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-002795011322400104">Ding, Levin, Stephan and Winkler, 2010</xref>) have shown a positive impact from the internet on academic collaboration and productivity.</p>

</fig>
<p>The figure shows growth in capital services for each of these intangible groups. Growth in R&amp;D capital was very high in the 1980s before slowing, speeding up again around 2000 and then slowing. Growth in telecoms capital was low, even negative, in the early 1990s before growing very fast in the late 1990s and then slowing. In general growth in capital for these assets slows down in the early 2000s relative to the late 1990s. If there is a lagged effect on TFP, this would slow down TFP in the late 2000s.</p>
<p>How big might these effects be? <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-002795011322400104">Table 3</xref> sets out our estimates. In this table, TFP growth is measured including R&amp;D as an intangible (excluding all other intangibles) to study the possible effects from R&amp;D spillovers. We confine ourselves to R&amp;D since R&amp;D spillovers seem quite well established in the literature. The table reads as follows. Column 3 sets out TFP growth, estimated including R&amp;D, for four year-spans, starting in the trough of 1991. As the table shows, TFP sped up between the late 1990s and mid 2000s (1998/2002 and 2002–7, 0.12 per cent per annum), but then slowed down severely in the latest period (–3.68 per cent).</p>

<fn id="table-fn3-002795011322400104"><p>Notes: Columns 1 and 2 indicate years and peak to trough or trough to peak. Columns 3, 4, and 5 are DlnTFP, DlnK(R&amp;D) and DlnK(telecoms equipment). Column 6 is DlnTFP slowdown, that is the respective row less the row above it. Columns 7 and 8 are the indicated coefficient times the slowdown in DlnK in the previous periods. So for example, −0.47 in column 7, final row equals 0.25*(DlnK(R&amp;D)(2002–7) – DlnK(R&amp;D)(1998–2002)). Data are from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-002795011322400104">Goodridge, Haskel and Wallis (2012a)</xref>.</p></fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>Interestingly, as columns 4 and 5 show, lagged growth in the capital stock for R&amp;D and telecoms equipment shows a suggestive pattern. Both sped up in the late 1990s relative to the early 1990s and then slowed down again. Both of these were followed by an acceleration in TFP growth. And both slowdowns were followed, this time in the current cycle, by a slowdown in TFP growth. The final two columns show the contribution to the TFP growth speedup and slowdown, and are a coefficient times the lagged growth in the capital stock. The coefficients are drawn from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-002795011322400104">Goodridge, Haskel and Wallis (2012b)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-002795011322400104">Goodridge, Haskel and Wallis (2013)</xref> and are the elasticities of TFP growth to changes in the capital stock. As the final columns show, the 2002–7 slowdown is overpredicted, but the current slowdown is underpredicted. In fact, the effect from the changes in the stock of R&amp;D and telecoms equipment account for 20 per cent ((0.47+0.26)/3.68) of the current slowdown. So a slowdown in current TFP growth of around 0.75 per cent per annum is predicted but these data are insufficient to predict the whole very large slowdown. Of course, much of that slowdown is dominated by the massive fall of around 5 per cent of measured TFP in 2008.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We have investigated whether intangibles might explain the UK productivity slowdown. We have noted that since the recession</p>
<list id="list1-002795011322400104" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>firms have held onto their more skilled workers and decreased their unskilled workers at an increasing rate,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>intangible investment in R&amp;D and software has risen whereas tangible investment has fallen,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>intangible investment and telecoms equipment slowed in advance of the recession.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>We have therefore tested to see if</p>
<list id="list2-002795011322400104" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>what looks like labour hoarding is actually firms retaining workers who are employed in creating intangible assets (e.g. R&amp;D teams); whose current output is therefore zero and whose contribution to total investment is unmeasured since intangibles are treated as expenses not investment,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the slowdown in current TFP growth is due to the spillover effects of the slowdown in R&amp;D and telecoms equipment investment in the past.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Our main findings are:</p>
<list id="list3-002795011322400104" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>measured market sector real value added growth since the start of 2008 is understated by 1.6 per cent due to the omission of intangibles,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>0.75 percentage points per annum of the TFP growth slowdown can be accounted for by the slowdown in intangible and telecoms investment in the early 2000s,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>taken together intangible investment can therefore account for around 5 percentage points of the 16 per cent productivity puzzle.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Does that mean the UK still has an output gap? If potential output growth is determined by TFP growth, as it is in many models, our spillover results suggest that potential output growth has fallen. But potential output growth is not a given, since intangible investment may be amenable to policy levers. One of those levers might be Keynesian demand expansion. Others might be more on the supply side, e.g. expanding the R&amp;D tax credit to other intangible assets. Whichever it is, we believe that unmeasured intangibles are part of the explanation of the productivity puzzle, but not all of it.</p>

Labour input is then N×G(E,H), where G transforms the bundle of E and H into per worker effort-hours. A firm wishing to raise E or H will face some costs of doing so. Assume they are a function of EH and that firms are optimising on all margins. Then the first order condition holds: dG/dH(H/G)=dG/dE(E/G).

A new building for example raises ΔlnK. But if is it unoccupied, then its rent income is zero, hence s<sub>K</sub><sup>Q=0</sup> and so it has no impact on ΔlnQ. Thus insofar as utilisation is reflected in prices, the income share controls for underutilisation. Berndt-Fuss-Hulten point out that when the operating surplus is calculated residually asset compensation reflects the actual marginal product of capital, in this case zero, thus partly accounting for utilisation in the estimation of TFP.</p></fn>
