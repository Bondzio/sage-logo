<abstract>
<p>The low transfection efficiency of nonviral gene delivery systems limits their applications. In this study, we demonstrated a simple method to modify poly(ethyleneimine)/DNA complexes with a nuclear location signal peptide via bis(succinimidyl) penta(ethylene glycol) coupling. The amount of grafted nuclear location signal peptide was controlled within a range of 0–9 µg for poly(ethyleneimine)/DNA complexes containing 10 µg DNA and 100 µg poly(ethyleneimine) by adjusting the grafting agent and peptide feeds. The particle size and surface zeta-potential of the complexes were largely retained after nuclear location signal immobilization. Based on the results of the flow cytometry measurements, the nuclear location signal–modified poly(ethyleneimine)/DNA complexes were internalized into at bone marrow stem cells at a significantly faster rate and a higher amount than the unmodified complexes. In vitro transfection experiments, using plasmid DNA encoding bone morphogenetic protein 2, indicated that the nuclear location signal peptide–modified poly(ethyleneimine)/DNA complexes have significantly higher gene transfection ability toward bone marrow stem cells than unmodified complexes. The porous collagen scaffolds loaded with nuclear location signal–modified poly(ethyleneimine)/plasmid DNA encoding bone morphogenetic protein 2 complexes successfully transfected tissue cells and induced the human bone morphogenetic protein 2 expression in a rat. The modification of the poly(ethyleneimine)/DNA complexes with nuclear location signal peptide was effective in enhancing gene transfection of complexes in vitro and in vivo, thus indicating potential applications for bioactive scaffolds with enhanced tissue regeneration performance.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A number of nonviral vectors have been developed for gene therapy because most viral therapies, although efficient, are risky to some, such as the oncogenic potential of the virus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883911513483507">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883911513483507"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883911513483507">3</xref></sup> Although many kinds of cationic polymers, such as poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI), chitosan, and poly(<sc>l</sc>-lysine) (PLL) and liposomes have been developed as gene vectors to protect the DNA from nuclease degradation to enable its passage through the cell membrane, gene transfection efficiency comparable to viral systems has not yet been achieved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883911513483507">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883911513483507"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883911513483507">6</xref></sup> Many challenges stand in the way of effective nonviral gene therapy, to induce (but not limited to) cellular internalization, the delivery of DNA to the nucleus, sustained long-term gene expression, and spatial and temporal controls of that expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883911513483507">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Among the various polycations, PEI has emerged as a favorable candidate for gene delivery because of its effectiveness both in vitro and in vivo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883911513483507">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883911513483507">9</xref></sup> PEI is the second polymeric transfection agent discovered, after PLL; both are polycations in aqueous solutions at pH &lt; 7.4.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883911513483507">10</xref></sup> PEI condenses DNA into positively charged particles and protects the DNA from degradation by nucleases, which bind to anionic cell surface residues and are brought into the cell via nonspecific endocytosis. Following internalization, PEI/DNA nanocomplexes are known to efficiently escape from endosomes due to the proton-sponge effect and transport toward the perinuclear region of cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883911513483507">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883911513483507"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883911513483507">13</xref></sup> Although PEI is effective for in vitro gene delivery, the gene delivery is greatly reduced in vivo. This is partially due to the unmodified PEI/DNA complexes interacting with albumin, fibrinogen, immunoglobulins, erythrocytes, and components of the complement system in vivo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883911513483507">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883911513483507">15</xref></sup> The complexes are covered by proteins with negative charge and possibly aggregate, which reduces the internalized by cells. In addition, PEI/DNA complexes were not efficient enough to transfect bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) due to a lack of an intrinsic capacity to enter the nucleus, release its DNA payload, and activate transcription.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883911513483507">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883911513483507">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>In view of this, a number of derivatization methods, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG)ylation and conjugation of ligands, have been proposed to improve transfection and reduce the toxicity of PEI in vitro and in vivo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883911513483507">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883911513483507"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883911513483507"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0883911513483507">21</xref></sup> Among these strategies, conjugation of ligands that are able to bind specific receptors on cell membrane could largely enhance the targeting ability and the transfection efficiency of PEI/DNA complexes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883911513483507">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883911513483507"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0883911513483507">21</xref></sup> Many ligands such as transferrin, monoclonal antibody, folate acid, growth factors, and sugars have been adopted to prove this concept. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are short peptides, which facilitate cellular uptake of various molecular cargos (from small chemical molecules to nanosize particles), have also been used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0883911513483507">22</xref></sup> For example, the HIV-1 twin-arginine translocation (Tat) peptide with the sequence of RKKRRQRRR, derived from the “transduction domain” of Tat protein, has been successful in delivering a large variety of cargos, from small particles to proteins, peptides, and nucleic acids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0883911513483507">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0883911513483507"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0883911513483507"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0883911513483507"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0883911513483507"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0883911513483507">28</xref></sup> Suk et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0883911513483507">29</xref></sup> modified PEI/DNA complexes with Tat peptides and found that they are easily internalized by differentiated neurotypic cells and showed enhanced gene transfection efficiency up to 14-fold.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0883911513483507">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>The efficient nuclear import of DNA is another crucial step after entering into the cell. In nondividing cells, transport of DNA into the nucleus occurs via the nuclear pore complex across the nuclear membrane. It is well known that the nuclear pore (~9 nm) allows for passive diffusion of ions and small molecules (&lt;40 kDa), while large molecules require active transport.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0883911513483507">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0883911513483507">31</xref></sup> However, large molecules can be imported into the nucleus from the cytoplasm using appropriate signals. Nuclear location signals (NLSs), typically peptide-based targeting sequences, are able to selectively recognize and bind to importin, which plays important role in nuclear importation. The classical NLSs for nuclear transport are composed of one (monopartite) or two (bipartite) clusters with four or more basic amino acids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0883911513483507">32</xref></sup> The most studied monopartite NLS is discovered with the sequence PKKKRKV from the SV40 large T-antigen.</p>
<p>NLS peptides have been covalently attached to DNA molecules. A significantly (10-fold to 1000-fold) enhanced gene expression was obtained by conjugating a NLS peptide to one or both ends of a linear DNA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0883911513483507">33</xref></sup> Yoo and Jeong<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0883911513483507">34</xref></sup> conjugated NLS to psoralen, a nucleic acid–intercalating agent. The DNA/PEI complex consisting psoralen–NLS conjugates, which can be physically associated with DNA, showed significantly increased transfection efficiencies on monkey kidney fibroblast-like cells (COS-1 cells).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0883911513483507">34</xref></sup> Zhang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0883911513483507">35</xref></sup> demonstrated that introducing of NLS–poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)–acridine conjugates could effectively increase nuclear accumulation of plasmid DNA (pDNA) and transgene expression levels for lipoplex-mediated or polyplex-mediated transfection of slowly dividing cells such as murine brain capillary endothelial cells in the presence of serum. Another approach to NLS covalent conjugation is to attach to a gene carrier. Shiraishi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0883911513483507">36</xref></sup> conjugated NLS peptide with acridine, which significantly enhance transfection efficacy as well as nuclear localization of pDNA. Jeon et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0883911513483507">37</xref></sup> showed that the immobilization of a NLS peptide on poly(<sc>l</sc>-lactide-<italic>co</italic>-glycolide) nanospheres enhanced their gene transfection efficiency on human dermal fibroblasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0883911513483507">37</xref></sup> Opanasopit et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0883911513483507">38</xref></sup> suggested that the high gene expression with the negligible cytotoxicity can be achieved on HeLa cells by adding the NLS peptide to chitosan/DNA complexes at an optimal ratio. Hu et al. used NLS peptides to covalently modify PEI-based biodegradable polymer composed of low-molecular weight PEI (600 Da) cross-linked by β-cyclodextrin molecules. The conjugation of NLS can effectively improve gene transfection in dividing and nondividing cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0883911513483507">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although NLS has been widely used in nucleic acid delivery and modification of vectors, it has not been used to modify PEI/DNA complexes. The majority of the previous study focused on proof-of-concept studies of model cells in vitro. The transfection of BMSCs, which are important in tissue regeneration and gene manipulation such as adjustable expression level of growth factors, has not been thoroughly studied. In this study, a low-molecular-weight branched PEI containing primary, secondary, and tertiary amino groups, which has good gene transfection efficiency and low cytotoxicity, was used to form vector/DNA particles. The PEI/DNA complexes were then modified with NLS peptide (PKKKRKVEDPYC) via bis(succinimidyl) penta(ethylene glycol) grafting. The physicochemical properties and gene transfection of NLS-modified PEI/DNA complexes were examined in vitro. Finally, the NLS-modified PEI/plasmid DNA encoding bone morphogenetic protein 2 (DNA-BMP2) complexes were incorporated into collagen scaffolds, whose in vivo transfection ability was studied in a Sprague Dawley (SD) rat model.</p>

<title>Materials</title>
<p>Branched PEI (Mw = ~800 Dalton), papain, Hoechst 33258, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA. DNA (fish sperm, sodium salt, used as a model to study the physicochemical properties of PEI/DNA complexes) was purchased from AMRESCO, Solon, USA. The NLS peptide NH<sub>2</sub>-PKKKRKVEDPYC was purchased from Bachem AG, Bubendorf, Switzerland. DNA-BMP2 was provided by Fulengen, Guangzhou, China. The plasmids were amplified in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China) and purified by a differential precipitation method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0883911513483507">40</xref></sup> The DNA concentration and purity were assessed via ultraviolet (UV) optical intensity at 260 and 280 nm, respectively. The pDNA was lyophilized and stored at −20°C for use in transfection experiments. All other reagents were of analytical grade and were used as received. Triple distilled water was used throughout the study.</p>
<p>The rat BMSCs were isolated by short-term adherence to plastic, as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0883911513483507">41</xref></sup> Briefly, after the SD rat (source, country) was killed, its tibia was punctured with a 16-gauge needle. Through a sterile tube, 0.4– 0.5 mL of bone marrow was aspirated into a 10 mL syringe containing 5000 U of heparin. The bone marrow was centrifuged to remove fat and heparin. The precipitated cells were cultured in a low-glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Gibco, Grand island, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, v/v), 100 µg/mL penicillin, and 100 U/mL streptomycin. After a confluent cell layer was formed, the cells were detached using 0.25% trypsin and routinely passaged. The phonotype of BMSCs was characterized by the surface antigens (Figure S4) and identification of differentiation ability (Figure S5).</p>

<sec id="section4-0883911513483507">
<title>Preparation of PEI/DNA complexes</title>
<p>Fish sperm DNA was used as a model for studying the physicochemical properties of PEI/DNA complexes. DNA-BMP2 was used for in vitro and in vivo transfection. The mass ratio of PEI to DNA in this study was fixed at 10 since the PEI/DNA complexes with this ratio have the highest transfection efficiency in vitro (Figure S1). PEI and DNA were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.2) to form solutions of 10 and 1 mg/mL, respectively. The solutions were sterilized by filtering through a syringe filter with a pore size of 220 nm. A mixture containing a 1 mL volume of the PEI solution added into a 1 mL volume of the DNA solution was vortexed violently for 30 s and incubated for 30 min at 37°C.</p>

<sec id="section5-0883911513483507">
<title>Grafting NLS peptide onto polyethylimine (PEI)/DNA complexes</title>
<p>The NLS peptide was linked to PEI/DNA complexes via bis(succinimidyl) penta(ethylene glycol) (BSP, Sigma, St. Louis, USA) induced grafting between amino groups from NLS peptide and PEI. PEI/DNA complexes containing 10 µg DNA were mixed with specific amounts of BSP, and the mixture was allowed to react at room temperature (RT) for 4 h. The excess grafting BSP was then separated by a centrifugation dialysis tube (cutoff M<sub>w</sub> = 3000 Dalton, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The complexes were reacted with a specific amounts of NLS solution for 4 h at RT. Finally, 20 µL of a 10 mg/mL lysine solution was used to terminate the unreacted succinimidyl groups. The NLS-modified PEI/DNA complexes were stored at −20°C until use.</p>

<sec id="section6-0883911513483507">
<title>Quantification of NLS grafting</title>
<p>The bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method using BCA is very effective and sensitive to determine minor amounts of surface-immobilized proteins and peptides. In this analysis, Cu<sup>2+</sup> ions are reduced to Cu<sup>1+</sup> ions by protein or peptide bonds. One Cu<sup>1+</sup> ion combines with two BCA molecules to give a purple-colored complex that exhibits a strong absorbance at 562 nm. The reaction occurs whether the proteins are free or immobilized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0883911513483507">42</xref></sup> After grafting, a solution of PEI/DNA complexes containing 10 µg DNA was diluted to 2 mL and centrifuged at 25,000g for 1 h to isolate the PEI/DNA complexes. After washing twice with PBS, the precipitate was dispersed in 20 µL of PBS and mixed with 200 µL of BCA test solution. After reacting at 37°C for 30 min, the absorbance of the supernatant was measured using a microplate reader (model 550; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) at 570 nm with PEI/DNA complexes as a negative control. The amount of NLS grafted on PEI/DNA complexes was obtained from a standard curve.</p>

<sec id="section7-0883911513483507">
<title>Characterization of complexes</title>
<p>The size of the complexes in 10 mM NaCl solution was measured at 25°C by dynamic light scattering (DLS) on a particle size analyzer. The zeta-potential measurements were performed using a Zetasizer 3000 (Malvern Instruments, Southborough, MA, USA) equipped with an aqueous dip cell operated in the automatic mode. The complex suspension was mixed with an equal volume of 20 mM NaCl solution or 2× PBS. The pH value of the solution was adjusted to 7.4. All data were averaged from three to five parallel measurements.</p>

<sec id="section8-0883911513483507">
<title>Toxicity of the complexes</title>
<p>The BMSC (200 µL) suspension in DMEM/10% FBS was seeded in a 96-well polystyrene plate, with a final cell number of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> cells/well. After 24 h, 20 µL particle suspension in PBS was added into the culture medium with a final DNA concentration of 10 µg/mL. The culture medium containing the same concentration of complexes was changed every 2 days. Cell proliferation was measured using the methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) method. The absorbance was recorded at a wavelength of 570 nm by a microplate reader (model 550; Bio-Rad). Cells without particles were used as control. Three parallel experiments were conducted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0883911513483507">
<title>Cellular uptake of the particles</title>
<p>The DNA was labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) to determine the cellular uptake of the PEI/DNA particles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0883911513483507">40</xref></sup> The BMSCs were seeded onto a 24-well plate (Corning, New York, USA) at a density of 2 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well in 1 mL culture medium. After 24 h, 40 µL particle suspension in PBS was added into the culture medium with a final DNA concentration of 20 µg/mL and was coincubated with the cells at 37°C. At determined time intervals, the cells were washed three times with PBS, trypsinized, and resuspended in the medium. The fluorescence intensity of the cells was analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM) with untreated BMSCs as a negative control.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0883911513483507">
<title>In vitro gene transfection</title>
<p>BMSCs were seeded into a 24-well plate 24 h prior to transfection at a density of 2 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well in 1 mL complete medium. At the time of transfection, the medium in each well was replaced with 1 mL serum-free DMEM. The complexes containing 1 µg DNA-BMP2 were added to each well and incubated with the cells for 8 h. The culture medium was then replaced by complete medium, and the cells were further cultured for a certain time period (4, 8, and 16 days). The culture media were replaced every 2 days. The extent of BMP2 expression in vitro was quantified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) Kit (R&amp;D, Minneapolis, MN, USA) following the procedures described in the user’s manual. The cell number was determined by DNA quantity using a fluorometer (LS55; PerkinElmer, UK) with the fluorescent dye Hoechst 33258.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0883911513483507">42</xref></sup> After correlating the DNA quantity with the cell number by a standard curve, the average BMP2 expression level per 10<sup>4</sup> cells was calculated. All data were averaged from four parallel measurements. Untransfected BMSCs were used as negative controls.</p>

<sec id="section11-0883911513483507">
<title>In vivo transfection</title>
<p>To study the in vivo gene transfection, different PEI/DNA complexes were combined with porous collagen scaffolds (15 mm diameter, 2 mm thickness, and ~3.2 mg weight). In brief, the scaffold was prepared by freeze drying of 0.4 mL 0.8% bovine type I collagen solutions (0.5% acetic acid) in a 24-well plate with 98% porosity. Then, the dried collagen scaffold was immersed into 0.4 mL PBS containing 1 mg/mL DNA of different PEI/DNA complexes, which was maintained at 4°C overnight for incorporation of the complexes into the scaffold. The DNA-loaded scaffold was washed twice in PBS and then used for further experiments. To test the DNA amount incorporated in collagen scaffold, each of the collagen scaffolds containing the PEI/DNA complexes was immersed into 1 mL 50 mg/mL papain/PBS solution containing 5 mg/mL EDTA and digested overnight at 60°C. The quantity of DNA immobilized on the collagen scaffolds was tested by fluorometer (LS55; PerkinElmer) with the fluorescent dye Hoechst 33258 (Sigma, USA).</p>
<p>The in vivo transfection abilities of various PEI/DNA complexes impregnated into the scaffold were accessed by a subcutaneous implantation test in SD rats under institutional guidelines. The adult SD rats with the age of 3 months and weight of 107 ± 7 g were purchased from the Laboratory Animal Center of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China. One night before the experiment, the backs of the SD rats were denuded with 10% Na<sub>2</sub>S aqueous solution. The rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (Sigma, USA) via intraperitoneal injection in a dosage of 30 mg/kg, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The DNA-containing scaffolds were implanted into the subcutaneous tissue of the back of the SD rats. Four scaffolds were implanted into each rat with the distance of 3 cm between each scaffold. Three time intervals for each group and four parallel scaffolds for each time interval were set. After 4, 8, and 16 days of implantation, samples were retrieved, fixed in 4% formaldehyde/PBS solution at 4°C, dehydrated with a graded series of ethanol, embedded into paraffin, and sectioned at 5 µm. Immunohistological staining of human BMP2 (the antibody was purchased from Cambridge, MA, USA) was used to characterize the secreted BMP2.</p>
<p>Western blotting (WB) and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were used to quantify the BMP2 expression level. After a certain time period post implantation, the animals were killed, and the scaffolds were removed and immediately preserved in liquid nitrogen. Then, each frozen specimen was homogenized and resuspended in 1 mL lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl/0.1% Triton X-100/2 mM EDTA/100 mM NaCl/1 mM protease inhibitor) at 4°C for 30 min. The solution was then centrifuged at 5000g for 15 min at 4°C to separate soluble fraction from insoluble fraction. The protein concentration in the supernatant was measured spectrophotometrically by the BCA method. A 40 µg protein sample was fractionated by 4%-20% gradient of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Bio-Rad), which was transferred to poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membranes (Millipore). The blot was blocked with 5% milk powder in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), incubated overnight with rat monoclonal BMP2 antibody, and developed with peroxidase-conjugated goat-antirat secondary antibody (Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, USA).</p>
<p>For quantitative real-time RT-PCR, total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, country), and ~1 µg of the total RNA was used for reverse transcription into complementary DNA (cDNA) with the Omniscript RT Kit (Qiagen, Dusseldorf, Germany). The primer sequences specific for the BMP2 and the internal control gene (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)) used for qRT-PCR are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883911513483507">Table 1</xref>. Real-time PCR was performed in an ABI 7300 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Grand island, USA) with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Grand island, USA) under the conditions of 15 s at 90°C and 60 s at 60°C, and the fluorescence intensity was recorded for 40 cycles. The relative gene expression values were calculated with the comparative DDCt (threshold cycle) method and normalized to the housekeeping gene.</p>

<title>Characterization of NLS–(PEI/DNA) complexes</title>
<p>A fixed NLS peptide feed amount of 10 µg was reacted with PEI/DNA complexes containing 10 µg DNA and 100 µg PEI. The immobilized NLS amount (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883911513483507">Figure 1(a)</xref>) initially increased with increasing amount of grafting agent (BSP) and then leveled off when the BSP amount is higher than 40 µg. When the amount of BSP is fixed at 40 µg, the immobilized NLS peptide amount linearly increased along with its feeding amount and reached a plateau when the feeding amount is higher than 20 µg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883911513483507">Figure 1(b)</xref>). These results indicated that the immobilized NLS amount is adjustable due to the feed amount of peptide and grafting agent. In our study, the highest NLS amount that can be immobilized on PEI/DNA complexes is about 9 µg. The PEI/DNA complexes containing 3 and 9 µg NLS are denoted as NLS3–(PEI/DNA) and NLS9–(PEI/DNA), respectively.</p>

<p>The surface charge of the vector/DNA complexes is very important for the cellular internalization and gene delivery. Positively charged particles can electrostatically adsorb on the negatively charged cell membrane, and then clathrin-dependent or receptor-induced endocytosis is responsible for the cellular uptake of the particles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0883911513483507">30</xref></sup> Due to the weak positively charged nature of the NLS peptide (five amino group residues in one peptide molecule), both its grafting density and environmental conditions might influence the surface charge density of the resultant particles. Therefore, their zeta-potentials were measured in PBS, a buffer solution to mimic cell culture environment. Compared to the relatively high surface charge of pristine complexes (about +40 mV), the surface charge was reduced after the treatment of BSP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0883911513483507">Figure 2(b)</xref>), which could be attributed to the consumption of amino groups. The surface charge increased again after the immobilization of positively charged NLS, indicating that the zeta-potential of the PEI/DNA complexes does not change much after NLS grafting regardless of the peptide amount, suggesting that its influence on the gene delivery can be safely ruled out.</p>

<title>Toxicity of NLS-modified PEI/DNA complexes</title>
<p>The cytotoxicity of modified complexes was tested using the MTT assay. Viable cells convert MTT into formazan, whose optical density (OD) is proportional to the cytoviability. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0883911513483507">Figure 3</xref>, almost no difference of the cell viability was found between the cells incubated with PEI/DNA, NLS3–(PEI/DNA), NLS9–(PEI/DNA) complexes, and complex-free control. This indicated that the original PEI/DNA complexes and NLS peptide–modified complexes are nontoxic and suitable for further biomedical application.</p>

<title>Cellular uptake of PEI/DNA complex</title>
<p>To make the PEI/DNA complexes detectable via FCM, the DNA was labeled with a fluorescent dye FITC. Loading of a trace amount of FITC did not significantly influence particle size, morphology (Figure S2), or surface charge. Normalization of the fluorescence intensity of each of the FITC-labeled complexes was performed for quantitative measurements by FCM. In the FCM measurement, the logarithmic fluorescence intensity of untreated cells was set between 10<sup>0</sup> and 10<sup>1</sup>, and those cells with the intensity larger than 10<sup>1</sup> were considered as the positive ones (the cells uptaking the PEI/DNA complexes). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0883911513483507">Figure 4</xref>, the fluorescence intensity recorded from the cells was very weak after in vitro culture for 1 h, indicating that very few PEI/DNA complexes, regardless of the NLS decoration, were adsorbed on the cell membranes or taken up by the cells. During the next 11 h, the fluorescence intensity increased rapidly. After that, the PEI/DNA complexes reached a plateau, while further increase was found for the two NLS-modified complexes. At the same culture time except for the first hour, the NLS-modified complexes always had significantly stronger fluorescence intensity than that of the PEI/DNA complexes. At the initial stage (before 5 h), sharper increases of the fluorescence intensities were found for the NLS-modified complexes, especially the one with larger NLS peptide amount. These results confirm that the NLS-modified PEI/DNA complexes have a faster cellular uptake rate than that of the pristine complexes, implying a different uptake pathway. As shown by quantitative analysis, at 12 h, the average fluorescence intensity per cell from the NLS3–(PEI/DNA) and NLS9–(PEI/DNA) groups is 2.2 and 3.5 times higher than that from the PEI/DNA group, respectively. Thus, the results confirm that with more NLS peptide on the particles, a larger number of complexes are internalized at the same culture time, while the bare PEI/DNA complexes have the weakest ability to be internalized. It is worth noting that the FCM methodology in this study analyzes the overall fluorescent signal of the cells, and thus cannot distinguish whether the signal is originated from the cell membranes or from the cell interiors. In this sense, the complexes attached to the cell surfaces are included in the overall fluorescence intensity.</p>

<title>In vitro gene transfection</title>
<p>The transfection efficiency of DNA-BMP2 in BMSCs was evaluated using the ELISA method to quantify the transgene expression level of human BMP2, which cannot be synthesized by rat BMSCs. A quantity of 1 µg DNA-BMP2 was used to transfect BMSCs in all the in vitro experiments. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0883911513483507">Figure 5</xref> using PEI as the vector, secreted human BMP2 protein reached a concentration of about 535 pg/mL at this DNA-BMP2 dosage 4 days post gene transfection and increased to 687 pg/mL at day 8 and then decrease to 389 pg/mL at day 16, while naked DNA-BMP2 did not obviously induce the expression of this protein in all the time periods tested (data not shown). After modification with NLS peptide, the BMP2 expression level reached 1358 and 2573 pg/mL in NLS3–(PEI/DNA) and NLS9–(PEI/DNA) complexes 4 days post gene transfection, respectively. The BMP2 expression level further increased to 2479 and 4328 pg/mL 8 days post transfection and slightly decreased to 2278 and 3568 pg/mL 16 days post gene transfection. In comparing the cell uptake results with the gene transfection results, the NLS peptide–modified complexes presented only 2.2 and 3.5 times higher cellular uptake than the PEI/DNA complexes, whereas the NLS peptide–modified complexes presented much stronger gene transfection ability of about 3–10 times higher than the peptide-free complex (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). This could be attributed to the NLS peptide not only functioning as a cell-penetrating signal but also as a nuclear targeting signal, because nuclear targeting is also a key step for successful gene transfection.</p>

<title>In vivo gene transfection</title>
<p>The porous collagen scaffold (Figure S3) strongly adsorbs the DNA complex. The DNA-loaded scaffold was easily obtained by dropping the dry scaffold into liquid mixtures containing PEI/DNA or NLS–(PEI/DNA) complexes. Each piece of the collagen scaffold (3 mg) adsorbed about 56 µg DNA using a feed concentration of 0.25 mg/mL. NLS modification did not significantly affect the adsorbed amount of DNA.</p>

<p>In vivo expression of the human BMP2 mRNA was further quantified by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0883911513483507">Figure 7</xref>). The human BMP2 mRNA level for naked DNA treatment was very low during the whole experimental period. The PEI/DNA-BMP2 complexes significantly elevated the expression level of human BMP2 mRNA and reached its highest value 8 days post surgery. The transgene expression of human BMP2 was decreased using PEI/DNA-BMP2 treatment after 16 days. The human BMP2 mRNA expression in the scaffolds containing NLS-modified PEI/DNA complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0883911513483507">Figure 7</xref>) was significantly stronger than the unmodified PEI/DNA complexes during the whole experiment period, while the higher NLS grafting amount induced higher transgene expression of BMP2 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The transgene expression level increased with time and did not decrease after 16 days in the NLS-modified cases. The NLS modification not only elevated the transgene expression level but also extended its expression time in vivo.</p>

<p>WB analysis of the tissue extracts was conducted to directly detect the BMP2 amount in the implanted scaffolds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0883911513483507">Figure 8</xref>). At days 4, 8, and 16, the intensity of the immunoreactive bands of NLS-modified PEI/DNA treatments was similar and apparently darker than treatments using unmodified PEI/DNA complexes and naked DNA. These results qualitatively confirmed that the DNA-BMP2 could induce the secretion of BMP2 in tissue after in vivo transplantation of scaffolds with both PEI/DNA and NLS-modified PEI/DNA complexes. There was no trace of human BMP2 in the implanted scaffold with naked DNA due to its low gene transfection ability. Since NLS-modified PEI/DNA complexes have higher transfection ability, they are able to transfect the cells in the surrounding tissue and the infiltrated cells, thus elevating the BMP2 expression level in situ.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The NLS peptide was covalently immobilized onto the PEI/DNA complexes with a ~150 nm. The immobilized amount of the NLS peptide was increased along with the amount of grafting agent and feeding peptide, and at most 9 µg peptide could be immobilized onto PEI/DNA complexes containing 10 µg DNA and 100 µg PEI. No obvious change of the particle size or zeta-potential of the complexes was observed after NLS grafting. Both the cell uptake rate and the final uptake amount of the PEI/DNA complexes were significantly enhanced by the attached NLS. Based on the results of the in vitro transfection data the NLS peptide–modified PEI/DNA-BMP2 complexes have significantly higher gene transfection ability in BMSCs than unmodified complexes without detectable cytotoxicity. The porous collagen scaffolds loaded with NLS-modified PEI/DNA-BMP2 complexes were able to induce the expression of human BMP2 after implantation into SD rats. Therefore, the NLS peptide–modified PEI/DNA-BMP2 complexes, which possess high gene delivery efficiency and low toxicity, could function as an alternative of viral vectors and have potential applications in regenerative medicine.</p>
