<p>Scholars such as Mitchell Stephens have long called for a global focus to the American-centric journalism history prevalent among US scholars. In his essay ‘A Call for an International History of Journalism’, Stephens illustrates his point with a 1679 edition of a London newspaper called <italic>Domestick Intelligence</italic> that hangs on his living room wall. Its publisher: Benjamin Harris. ‘In other words, this newspaper was published by the man who would, eleven years later, publish America’s first newspaper’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1464884911434888">Stephens wrote in <italic>American Journalism</italic> in 2000</xref>. ‘And this is hardly the only evidence of the absurdity of delaying the start of the history of journalism, as we too often do, until 1690, when a newspaper first appears in England’s American colonies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1464884911434888">2000</xref>: 98).</p>
<p>Stephens’ point is that US journalism today and throughout its history has been influenced by the global industry of news production. Yet US scholars – and many of their international counterparts – specialize so narrowly that they are ignorant of even the most obvious international influences. ‘Our narrowly nationalistic journalism histories’, Stephens wrote, ‘not only obscure crucial connections and lineages and ignore telling comparisons, they leave us unable to approach fundamental questions. We must internationalize our conferences, our journals, our graduate programs and our research’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1464884911434888">2000</xref>: 100).</p>
<p>This observation has been equally true of literary journalism studies, a ‘critically marginalized’ field which had suffered the additional challenge of being the subject of the ‘historical ambivalence of the journalism community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464884911434888">Hartsock, 1998</xref>: 62). Thus, it is astonishing to see not only the growth of literary journalism as a field of study, but also the progress toward an international scholarship evident in <italic>Literary Journalism across the Globe: Journalistic Traditions and Transnational Influences</italic>.</p>
<p>This book is dedicated to the new International Association of Literary Journalism Studies (IALJS) and is being published just five years after the organization’s founding in 2006. The text not only opens up the relatively overlooked field of literary journalism studies in the United States; it also privileges an international perspective as fundamental to this field of scholarship.</p>
<p>The 16 essays are divided into three parts. Part one addresses issues associated with defining the form and includes several essays from leading US scholars. John Hartsock explores the origins of European literary reportage in comparison with the literary journalism with which most US scholars are familiar. David Abrahamson questions the journalistic dimensions of globalization. And Norman Sims discusses the future of international literary journalism in today’s media climate.</p>
<p>But the book’s strength lies in the work included from leading international scholars. For example, Jenny McKay, the director of journalism studies at the University of Stirling in Scotland and one of the founding members of the IALJS, draws on her own educational experience to describe the invisibility of journalism as literature in the UK. Bill Reynolds, another IALJS founding member and an assistant professor at Toronto’s Ryerson University, describes the differences in the form between Toronto and Vancouver. Like New York, Toronto’s literary journalists tend to document wealth and power, while Vancouver’s literary journalists are engaged in a relentless search for meaning.</p>
<p>This emphasis is continued in part two of the book, which features histories of the genre in the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, China, Brazil and Finland. These histories document independent developments of the genre in countries such as Spain, where the form was first recognized in 1845 (p. 134), and Finland, where Gonzo journalism pre-dates the US form traced to Hunter S Thompson (p. 190). These essays also trace international cross-pollination of the genre, as in the case of Britain and Portugal at the turn of the 20th century (p. 118). Part three, the final section, further explores transnational influences by offering five case studies of 20th-century literary journalism in New Zealand, Slovenia, Australia, Poland and the United States.</p>
<p>This book is one of only three written in English that focus on international literary journalism (p. 18, f3). For instructors of literary journalism eager to go beyond the US canon of Wolfe, Mailer, Thompson, Didion and McPhee, the essays provide a pool of new writers to explore.</p>
<p>But it also opens up avenues of scholarship for scholars of literary journalism and history. These essays, for example, make visible areas of inquiry such as the literary reportage of the international communist movement, a largely unknown genre in the United States because of Cold War politics (p. 28). The essays also provide more material with which to reflect on reality boundaries as defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464884911434888">Norman Sims (2009)</xref>. These sometimes blurry lines between fact and fiction seem particularly interesting to explore in the context of early Dutch pamphlets (p. 105) or in the case of Slovenian journalists who used fiction techniques to avoid government censorship (p. 239). As the book’s editor, John S Bak, argues in the introduction, these essays do much to advance scholarly conceptualizations of literary journalism from mere ‘genre’ and ‘form’ to pedagogically defined ‘discipline’ (p. 18).</p>
