<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There has been a significant increase in the detection of renal cysts due to the more frequent use of abdominal ultrasound and cross-sectional imaging. It is estimated that the incidence of renal cysts in patients over the age of 50 is more than 50% in autopsy studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2051415813476700">1</xref></sup> and over 27% on computed tomography (CT) imaging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2051415813476700">2</xref></sup> The majority of these cysts are incidental and asymptomatic.</p>
<p>Although the majority of these cysts are simple, a considerable number of patients may have more complicated lesions. Differentiating complex renal cysts that require surgical intervention from those that do not is a common dilemma for radiologists and urologists alike.</p>
<p>Bosniak classification is used to provide guidance for the management of complex renal cyst. The classification was introduced by Morton Bosniak in 1986<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2051415813476700">3</xref></sup> and initially divided cysts into four categories based on tri-phasic CT imaging.</p>
<p>Category I (simple benign cysts), which do not require any further imaging or intervention, and category IV (cystic carcinoma), which obviously require surgical management, can easily be recognised; however, the difficulties lie in distinguishing type II and III cysts and also in identifying those patients with type II cysts who require follow-up due to potential risk of progression: a differentiation which has significant impact on the clinical management decision, as type III cysts require surgical intervention due to the high risk of malignancy while type II cysts have a very small risk of malignancy and progression rate and therefore can either be followed up or discharged.</p>
<p>To address these difficulties Bosniak updated his classification in 1993<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2051415813476700">4</xref></sup> when he added an extra subcategory (IIF) to identify those type II cysts that are more complex and have some worrisome features but still not enough to warrant surgical intervention (i.e. type III).</p>
<p>Despite the fact that adding the IIF category increased the incidence of malignancy in the surgically treated category III lesions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2051415813476700">5</xref></sup> there has been significant inter-observer variation in distinguishing II/IIF and III cysts among radiologists and it is still highly reader dependent despite clear definition of each category.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2051415813476700">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2051415813476700"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2051415813476700">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>At present there remains considerable confusion as to whether Bosniak IIF cysts pose a significant malignant risk and how often these cysts require surveillance. We therefore performed a retrospective study in order to gain further understanding of this difficult subject.</p>
</sec>

<title>Patients and methods</title>
<p>We retrospectively analysed patients diagnosed with complex renal cysts classified as a Bosniak IIF on contrast CT imaging in our centre (Leicester General Hospital) between March 2003 and September 2008. The initial diagnosis was made by a radiology consultant based on contrast CT imaging and all the images of patients included in our study were further reviewed and verified by a uro-radiology consultant and a senior radiology trainee. Contrast CT and ultrasound (US) images were used to assess progression during follow-up. When suspicious features were seen on ultrasound, such as an increase in size or the presence of a solid component, CT imaging was performed. In our institution we use CT imaging to classify any complex renal cyst using Bosniak classification. We then follow up type IIF cysts using CT or US scan every six months for the first year then yearly for five years. Images of Bosniak IIF cysts were reviewed to determine radiological progression and clinical outcomes. Progression was defined as increased complexity, that is, Bosniak III/IV or the presence of a solid component within the cyst.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-2051415813476700" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 40 patients with 42 Bosniak IIF cysts were included in our study. The median follow-up of our group was 29 months (range 5–77 months). The median age was 68 years (range 38–88) with a male (M) to female (F) ratio of 2.6:1 (M= 29, F=11). All patients had a contrast CT scan at the time of diagnosis; three patients, however, required additional MRI imaging to further characterise the cysts due to inconclusive findings on CT scanning. Thirty-nine patients had a single cyst of interest; one patient had three synchronous cysts requiring follow-up. The median size was 53.5 mm (range 13–138 mm) at diagnosis and 58 mm (range 7–134 mm) at the last follow-up scan. The median number of follow-up studies per patient was three (range 1–10). The size increased in 22 cysts (mean 10.7 mm, range 3–41 mm), decreased in 10 (mean 7.9 mm, range 3–17) and remained stable in 10 cysts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2051415813476700">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Over the course of surveillance, only one patient was confirmed to show evidence of radiological progression to Bosniak III cyst after a follow-up period of 42 months, with a total progression rate of 2.5%. This cyst had grown in size from 45 mm to 56 mm during follow-up and its wall had become thicker and nodular. The patient did not undergo surgical resection due to multiple co-morbidities and high risk of surgery. In addition, this patient had a synchronous Bosniak III cyst in the contralateral kidney, which was also managed conservatively.</p>
<p>Five patients died during follow-up; none of them had the cause of death attributed to renal cancer or its complications.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Bosniak divided renal cysts based on the evaluation of their density; nodularity or the presence of solid components; wall thickness; the number and thickness of septations; the presence of calcifications and their amount and character, on tri-phasic CT imaging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2051415813476700">3</xref></sup> Later, Israel and Bosniak (2002)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2051415813476700">9</xref></sup> showed that the presence of calcification alone is not enough to classify the cystic lesions as surgical (type III).</p>
<p>Bosniak<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2051415813476700">4</xref></sup> further updated his classification in 1993 when he added IIF cysts (F stands for follow-up) to identify those cysts with potential to progress into malignancy and he suggested that these cysts should be followed up with interval contrast CT imaging to detect any signs of progression. However, there is still uncertainty over the natural progression of these cysts and there is no consensus on a follow-up protocol.</p>
<p>One limitation of Bosniak classification is the inter-observer variations among radiologists and urologists. Siegel et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2051415813476700">6</xref></sup> showed that the inter-observer variability mainly occurred in distinguishing between category II and III cysts. Weibl et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2051415813476700">7</xref></sup> analysed the inter-observer variability in the diagnosis of complex renal cystic masses and showed that the highest variability was noted between two groups of radiologists in the Bosniak category II and IIF and between the initial reporting radiologists and an experienced urologist in Bosniak II and III.</p>
<p>The progression rate for Bosniak IIF cysts has been reported in few studies in the literature. Israel et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2051415813476700">10</xref></sup> in a retrospective analysis of 42 moderately complex cystic renal masses (Bosniak category IIF) with a median follow-up of five years, showed that two cysts progressed and became more complex due to thickening of the septa and both proved to be cystic renal cell carcinoma on histopathology (4.7% progression rate). The first case showed progression at three years from the initial diagnosis while the second cyst progressed over a follow-up period of 16 months. All patients were followed up with serial contrast enhanced CT scans.</p>
<p>Weibl et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2051415813476700">7</xref></sup> reported that two out of 15 Bosniak IIF cysts showed evidence of radiological progression (progression rate 13.3%) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) was confirmed in both cases.</p>
<p>O’Malley et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2051415813476700">5</xref></sup> in their study of 81 Bosniak IIF cysts, showed an overall progression rate of 14.8% over a median follow-up of 15 months, with a median time to progression of 11 months. Most progression occurred in the first 18 months with only two cysts progressed after a follow-up of four years. In addition to this, all resected malignancies were low grade, early stage tumours.</p>
<p>In our series, only one out of 42 Bosniak IIF cysts progressed in radiological complexity to Bosniak III after a follow-up of 42 months from the time of diagnosis to progression, with an overall progression rate of 2.5%. This patient was not fit for any surgical intervention; therefore we did not have a histological confirmation of malignancy. None of the patients was diagnosed with renal cancer and there were no deaths attributed to renal cancer or its complications.</p>
<p>There is also no consensus regarding the optimal follow-up intervals and duration for type IIF cysts. Bosniak recommended an initial follow-up imaging at six months followed by repeated imagings on a yearly basis to ensure that the cyst is stable with no change in appearance or size.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2051415813476700">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The regular follow-up for all type IIF cysts with contrast CT scan can result in a marked increase in radiation exposure and contrast related complications, especially in older age group patients with other co-morbid conditions. It also carries the potential risk for developing secondary malignancies in younger age group patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2051415813476700">12</xref></sup> which has led some authors to suggest using a combination of MRI and US for follow-up instead of CT in patients younger than 50 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2051415813476700">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>In our institution contrast CT imaging is used to classify complex renal cyst. We then follow up Bosniak category IIF cysts using CT or US scans every six months for the first year and then yearly for five years. If the cyst increases in size or a suspicion of a solid component is found on US scan, a contrast CT is performed to further characterise the lesion and decide further management. This may explain our low progression rate as upgrade based on enhancement will not be detected on US. We assume that if the renal cyst is malignant, it will either increase in size or develop solid soft tissue mass which can be detected on US and then CT images can be obtained to further assess and characterise the cyst. This approach has been used in small renal tumour surveillance and we believe that it can be valid for renal cysts. None of the patients in our study developed local metastases on follow-up imaging and despite the fact that one cyst progressed we do not have a definitive histology to confirm the malignant nature of that cyst and the patient had not developed any distant metastasis during surveillance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we believe that improvement in US allows experienced radiologists to monitor progression of Bosniak IIF cysts without exposing patients to the radiation risks of CT scans and the potential nephrotoxicity of contrast material. US is able to detect the nodularity and the thickening in the cysts and visualise any mass within the cyst. More recently, novel approaches such as contrast enhanced US have been shown to be appropriate for renal cyst classification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2051415813476700">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>This study has several limitations. The data were collected retrospectively with a relatively small number of patients and short follow-up period. US scan was used for follow-up in the majority of patients, which obviously will not be able to detect change of enhancement as one of the criteria for progression.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-2051415813476700" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our study demonstrates that surveillance for Bosniak IIF cyst is a safe strategy. It shows that the majority of Bosniak IIF cysts are clinically benign and follow-up may not be necessary for all patients. Due to the short surveillance period in this study we recommend that younger patients (&lt; 60 years) could be considered for surveillance. Larger prospective studies with a unified surveillance protocol are needed to better understand the natural history of these cysts.</p>
