<p><italic>Purpose</italic>: Plantar plate injuries have been identified as a cause of forefoot pain and deformity. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and musculoskeletal ultrasound (US) have been suggested as appropriate imaging modalities for this pathology. A comparison of these two modalities utilizing intra-operatively pathology as the reference standard has not been published. <italic>Methodology</italic>: 51 feet of 42 consecutive patients presenting to clinic with forefoot pain and a suspected unilateral plantar plate tear at the 2nd metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint were identified. A two plane (longitudinal and transverse) US was performed on the painful second MTP joint. Longitudinal ultrasound images were graded as ‘torn’ or ‘intact’. Transverse ultrasound images were used to localize pathology. All ultrasound exams were performed by the same reconstructive foot &amp; ankle fellow. A pre-operative MRI was performed on these patients and read by a Fellowship Trained Musculoskeletal Radiologist. The physicians reading US and the MRI were blinded to each other’s findings. <italic>Results</italic>: All 51 feet were examined intra-operatively. 46 plantar plate tears were identified. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative value of MRI were 73.9%, 100%, 100%, 29.4% respectively while the same values for US were 91.5%, 25%, 91.5%, 25% respectively. MRI identified 4 collateral ligaments tears not identified on ultrasound. <italic>Discussion &amp; Conclusions</italic>: Both MRI and US are appropriate modalities for imaging of the plantar plate. While US is a highly sensitive exam, MRI is a more specific exam. Overall these results do not suggest that MR should be replaced by US in all cases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The plantar plate has historically been a difficult structure to image, and because this structure has been noted to cause pain and forefoot deformity, imaging becomes more important. The plantar plate is a broad, thick, trapezoidal ligamentous structure that spans the plantar aspect of the (MTP) joint.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640012463061">1</xref></sup> Composed primarily of type 1 collagen, the dorsal aspect of the plantar plate forms the firm, distal attachment to the proximal phalanx via medial and lateral longitudinal bundles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640012463061">2</xref></sup> The plantar aspect of the plantar plate’s collagen bundles are arranged transversely, forming lateral attachments to the deep transverse intermetatarsal ligament.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640012463061">2</xref></sup> The more mobile, proximal attachment of the plantar plate blends with the capsular tissue of the lesser MTP joint and the periosteum of the lesser metatarsal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640012463061">2</xref></sup> Cadaveric anatomy of this region can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1938640012463061">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Normal MRI Appearance of the Plantar Plate</title>
<p>The plantar plate appears similarly in the coronal, transverse, and sagittal views of the MRI. On the sagittal images, the plantar plate is a broad area of decreased signal extending from the base of the proximal phalanx to the plantar aspect of the metatarsal head and continuing on to blend with the periosteum of the plantar aspect of the respective metatarsal. A comparison of cadaveric anatomy with a sagittal MRI can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1938640012463061">Figure 1</xref>.</p>
<p>On the short axis (or coronal images), the plantar plate appears as a broad area of decreased signal extending from the base of the proximal phalanx, cradling the plantar aspect of the metatarsal head, and blending with the periosteum of the lesser metatarsal proximally. With smaller cuts through the metatarsal head, the lateral aspect of the plantar plate will be continuous with the collateral and suspensory ligaments of the lesser MTP joint (extending superiorly) and the deep transverse intermetatarsal ligament (extends laterally). The plantar plate will lie directly superior to the flexor tendons and will have a thin attachment to the flexor tendon sheath.</p>
<p>On the long axis (or transverse images), the plantar plate is a broad area of decreased signal that will lie in the image between the flexor tendons and the metatarsal head. This structure should be directly over the metatarsal head, covering the entirety of the metatarsal head.</p>
<p>The plantar plate has a homogeneously decreased signal on both the T1, T2, and STIR sequences. The T2 and STIR sequences may highlight the plantar plate if physiological fluid is present in the joint because this will have an increased signal. The combination of the increased signal of the fluid and decreased signal of the plantar plate might cause this effect. Examples of images of the plantar plate on MRI can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1938640012463061">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1938640012463061">3</xref>.</p>

<p>In addition, because MRI can allow clear visualization of the collateral ligament structures, discontinuities in the collateral ligaments can allow for diagnosis of collateral ligament tears.

<title>Normal Longitudinal Ultrasound (US) Appearance of the Plantar Plate</title>
<p>On the longitudinal image, the plantar plate is a slightly echoic band with a grainy but homogeneous appearance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640012463061">7</xref></sup> extending from the proximal insertion on the plantar aspect of the distal metatarsal shaft to the base of the proximal phalanx. A relaxed position of the foot will show a curvilinear structure adjacent to the metatarsal head. Dorsiflexion of the toe causes the curvilinear structure to become more taut7 allowing for dynamic evaluation of the integrity of the plantar plate. A comparison of cadaveric anatomy with a longitudinal US can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1938640012463061">Figure 1</xref>.</p>
<p>The flexor tendon overlies the plantar plate in the longitudinal view. This tendon has a fibrillar echotexture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640012463061">7</xref></sup> that is distinct and separate from the plantar plate. Sagittal plane movement of the lesser digit will reveal the plantar plate becoming more taut, whereas the flexor tendon has a gliding motion. Normal longitudinal US of the plantar plate can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1938640012463061">Figure 5</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>On the short-axis (or transverse-plane) images, the plantar plate appears as a curvilinear, slightly echoic, and more mottled structure overlying the metatarsal head with less delineated and more subtle borders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640012463061">7</xref></sup> The plantar plate is more mottled in this view because of the nature of the longitudinal collagen bundles that form the dorsal two-thirds of this structure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640012463061">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938640012463061">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The flexor tendons can be seen adjacent to the plantar plate on the transverse section as well.

<title>Abnormal US Appearance of the Plantar Plate</title>
<p>Abnormal appearance of the plantar plate can have a few different characteristics. Loss of homogeneous appearance can occur where normal echoic tissue is replaced with focal hypoechoic defects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640012463061">7</xref></sup> The plantar plate is most likely to tear at the distal insertion (base of the proximal phalanx); therefore, a defect in this area would suggest a tear. Similarly, if the plantar plate appears intact but there is a defect noted with dorsiflexion of the digit, a plantar plate tear may be present.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640012463061">7</xref></sup> Vascularity present in the region may suggest inflammation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640012463061">7</xref></sup> and the presence of fibrosis may alter the appearance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640012463061">7</xref></sup> or the thickness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938640012463061">9</xref></sup> of the plantar plate and the surrounding tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640012463061">7</xref></sup> Similarly, tendonisos or tenosynovitis can increase the aechoic region surrounding the tendon sheath with loss of sharpness of the edges of tendons and surrounding osseous structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640012463061">7</xref></sup> Pathology of the plantar plate can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1938640012463061">Figure 7</xref>.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>A total of 52 feet of 42 consecutive patients with forefoot pain were included in this study.</p>
<sec id="section7-1938640012463061">
<title>Musculoskeletal US Protocol</title>
<p>All US examinations were conducted by the same examiner in 2 planes using a Sonosite M-turbo US (Sonosite, Inc) and a linear 15-6 MHz transducer. The longitudinal US images were used to identify whether a tear was present or tear accuracy. This image answered the question, “Is the plantar plate torn?” As such, images were graded as either intact or ruptured.</p>
<p>Transverse US images were used for localization pathology or the ability of the US to correctly show and the examiner to correctly read the location of the tear. This US image answered the question, “Where is the plantar plate torn?” Images were graded as intact, partial medial rupture, partial lateral rupture, complete rupture, or unable to identify location.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1938640012463061">
<title>MRI Protocol</title>
<p>All MRI examinations were conducted in a 0.3 T extremity coil and performed without intra-articular or intravenous contrast. Sagittal, short-, and long-axis images were acquired for all feet. T1, T2, and STIR images were acquired in the sagittal, coronal, and axial planes. Slice thickness for these images was 2 mm.</p>
<p>In addition, a metatarsal planar reconstruction image was created in the sagittal plane. This image sequence used a 0.2mm slice thickness, decreasing the volume average effect and allowing superb visualization of smaller structures at the MTP joint. Each MRI was read and findings documented accordingly.</p>
<p>The physicians reading the US and the MRI were blinded to each other’s results as well as to clinical and radiographic exam findings. MRI and US were analyzed for identification accuracy, which was defined as the ability of the imaging modality to identify the presence of pathology. Additionally, MRI and US were analyzed for localization accuracy or the ability of the images to correctly localize the pathology. The results of each imaging modality were compared with the pathology of the plantar plate found on intraoperative examination.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Because plantar plate pathology is coming to be more recognized as a source of forefoot pain and deformity, imaging for this small, difficult-to-image forefoot structure has been investigated more often for accuracy and reliability. Although arthrography was initially used to image the plantar plate,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938640012463061">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938640012463061">14</xref></sup> MRI came to the forefront of plantar plate imaging because it was thought to be better than arthrography for detection of plantar plate tears if a small coil was used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938640012463061">4</xref></sup> An early study found a focal hyperintense signal in 8 of 13 patients where plantar plate ruptures were suspected. These ruptures were confirmed on all 5 patients who elected to have surgery for this problem.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640012463061">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>A study of MR joint arthrography for plantar plate tears found that many of the patients suspected of having plantar plate pathology actually had capsular pathology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1938640012463061">15</xref></sup> The authors of this study concluded that capsular tears at the distal lateral border of the plantar plate were more common than actual plantar plate tears and that the dorsal interosseous tendon may be abnormal in this situation. Furthermore, the authors concluded that MR arthrography of the lesser MTP joint clearly delineated the capsular tears and associated abnormalities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1938640012463061">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>MRI has been found to be both a highly sensitive and a highly specific modality for imaging of the plantar plate. This study was the first to use the metatarsal planar reconstruction image. Preoperative MRIs were obtained in 45 patients and compared with intraoperative findings. MRI was found to be 96% accurate, with 95% sensitivity, 100% specificity, a positive predictive value of 100%, and a negative predictive value of 67%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938640012463061">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>MRI is clearly a good imaging modality for the plantar plate; however, it can be a costly exam that can be uncomfortable for the patient, particularly if an extremity coil or an open machine is not available. Therefore, musculoskeletal US has been investigated as a potential alternative for imaging.</p>
<p>US has been investigated in patients with metatarsalgia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938640012463061">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1938640012463061">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1938640012463061"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1938640012463061"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1938640012463061">19</xref></sup> High-resolution US has been advocated for the use of differentiating nerve entrapments from other forefoot pathologies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1938640012463061">18</xref></sup> and operational characteristics for diagnosis of Morton’s neuroma have been established.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1938640012463061">16</xref></sup> US has shown a high correlation between images obtained and histopathological examinations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1938640012463061">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1938640012463061">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>US imaging of the plantar plate has a sparse presence in the current scientific literature despite the previously mentioned studies investigating metatarsalgia. A previously published US perspective of metatarsalgia provided a description of the plantar plate as a slightly echoic band, with a grainy but homogeneous appearance on the longitudinal images and the plantar plate appearing more mottled in the short-axis view because of the different arrangement of the collagen bundles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640012463061">7</xref></sup> This article further defines the appearance of pathology of the plantar plate. These features include loss of the homogeneous appearance and replacement of the normal echoic tissue with focal hypoechoic defects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640012463061">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The correlation between MRI, US, and histology has been studied. Gregg et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640012463061">6</xref></sup> aimed to correlate MRI and US imaging with histology on 6 soft-embalmed cadavers (24 plantar plates. MRI and US images were obtained prior to dissection and sampling for histology. The MRI protocol used a 1.5-T magnet and included 2-mm slices through the forefoot with a 0-mm gap.</p>
<p>In all, 23/24 plantar plates inspected were found to have tears. MRI detected 22/23 tears, falsely reported 1 tear, and failed to detect 1 tear. US detected 23 tears but failed to report 1 tear. MRI was found to have a sensitivity of 96%, a specificity of 0%, a positive predictive value of 96%, and a negative predictive value of 0%, and it was found to have an overall accuracy of 92%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640012463061">6</xref></sup> US was found to have a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 0%, a positive predictive value of 96%, and a negative predictive value of 0%; the overall accuracy of US in this study was found to be 96%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640012463061">6</xref></sup> The authors concluded that US was better able to identify and evaluate the plantar plate, particularly in deformed toes because the US probe can be moved around to see the anatomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640012463061">6</xref></sup> MRI, contrastingly, usually cannot do this, particularly if the technician performing the exam does not have the ability to alter the axis of the image in the MRI protocol.</p>
<p>A 2006 prospective study compared the ability of US and MRI to detect plantar plate pathology in both symptomatic and asymptomatic feet.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938640012463061">11</xref></sup> The MRI protocol used a 1.5-T magnet with a 2-mm/no-gap slice thickness. MRI detected 56/140 tears in symptomatic feet and 142/160 tears in asymptomatic feet. This translated to a sensitivity of 87% with poor specificity. Comparatively, US detected 75/160 and 139/160 torn plantar plates in the asymptomatic and symptomatic feet, respectively. This translated to a sensitivity of 96% with poor specificity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938640012463061">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The intraoperative exam was performed on a small number of patients in this study. The authors statistically demonstrated that MRI had only fair correlation with intraoperative findings, longitudinal US images correlated moderately with intraoperative findings, and transverse US had a higher correlation with intraoperative findings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938640012463061">11</xref></sup> Taken together, these findings suggest that US had a higher resolution than MRI for imaging of the plantar plate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938640012463061">11</xref></sup> However, it should be noted that the correlations with intraoperative findings were only available for 10 of the 160 metatarsals involved, a weakness of this study’s design.</p>
<p>The current study has unique parameters. First, MRI, US, and intraoperative examination were available for all patients enrolled in the study. Second, the MRI protocol used here included significantly smaller slices than the standard forefoot MRI, allowing for a much clearer visualization of small forefoot structures. This may account for the ability of this exam to detect collateral ligament tears.</p>
<p>In the current study, MRI and US were both able to detect the presence of plantar plate pathology in a large number of patients. Although this number is lower than in other studies, the ability to detect pathology of the plantar plate in this number of patients is clinically significant.</p>
<p>Both MRI and US had a high sensitivity, with US being the more sensitive test for plantar plate pathology. Specificity of the exams, however, was very different. MRI had a 100% specificity in this study, whereas US had a very low specificity. This is consistent with other studies of both modalities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640012463061">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938640012463061">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>When analyzing the ability of MRI to identify and localize the pathology, there were differences noted between detection of tears for both the imaging modalities and the types of tears. Intact plantar plates were detected more readily and accurately by MRI. Contrastingly, US was better able to detect both grade II and grade III tears. However, MRI was better for localization of tears in both cases. Additionally, MRI was correctly able to identify collateral ligament pathology when US was not able to do this.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Both MRI and US are appropriate soft-tissue imaging modalities for the plantar plate when the anatomy is understood by the technician and the radiologist. Both modalities can detect and localize plantar plate pathology. MRI is better able to identify intact plantar plates and better able to localize pathology with grade II and grade III tears. Therefore, although US is a less costly, quicker, and more comfortable procedure, US should not replace MRI in all cases.</p>
