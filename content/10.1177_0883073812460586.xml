<p>My wife Susan and I moved to Kijabe, Kenya, September 1, 2010, to do and teach pediatric neurosurgery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073812460586">Figure 1</xref>). When we came, we thought we would be here 2 to 3 years, but after being here a few months it became clear that we would probably need 6 years to establish a self-sustaining pediatric neurosurgery department at the AIC Kijabe Hospital. I had taught and done pediatric neurosurgery for 25 years at the Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, before moving to the University of Wisconsin, in Madison, Wisconsin, in 2006. Susan had been a nurse for 26 years and a pediatric neurosurgery nurse practitioner for 12 of those years before we moved to Kijabe. We are Christians and had done short-term medical mission trips for several years, including several trips to Kijabe Hospital. In 2008, we both felt that God was leading us to move to Kijabe, to do and teach pediatric neurosurgery. Thirty years ago, before I left for the first medical mission trip, a retiring missionary told me, “There are 3 keys to having a good experience there: have low expectations, be flexible, and have a sense of humor.” He was right, but to those I would add, “be patient,” and for Westerners—especially Western physicians accustomed to having every whim satisfied “right now,” and even more so for Western neurosurgeons—that requires an adjustment.</p>

</fig>
<p>Africa has approximately one billion people and 1200 neurosurgeons; 857 in North Africa, 160 in South Africa, and 142 in sub-Saharan Africa for the 723 million people there (1 neurosurgeon/5 million people). There are approximately 15 neurosurgeons in Kenya, for its population of 38 million people. All Kenyan neurosurgeons are in Nairobi except 1 in the western part of the country and 2 of us in Kijabe. In spite of the fact that approximately half the population in most African countries is less than 18 years old, there are only 10 to 12 pediatric neurosurgeons in Africa. That dearth is attributable primarily to the absence of pediatric neurosurgeons on neurosurgical faculties, and to a lesser extent, to the fact that African neurosurgeons prefer—just as in the United States—to treat patients with more lucrative conditions. In spite of their lack of training in pediatric neurosurgery, African neurosurgeons take care of children in their practices.</p>
<p>Kijabe, a village of about 5000 people, is located approximately 30 miles—a 1-hour drive—from downtown Nairobi. AIC Kijabe Hospital (www.kijabehospital.org) is a 280-bed general hospital owned by the Africa Inland Church. It focuses on providing good quality health care, particularly to poor people. Its medical staff consists of 11 Kenyan doctors and 13 expatriate missionary doctors.</p>
<p>Equipment in the hospital is dated; the x-ray machine is approximately 30 years old. The majority of the hospital’s daily operating costs are covered by patient fees, but much, if not most, of the equipment in the hospital has been donated from developed countries, including operating microscopes, a computed tomography (CT) scanner, and a recent Wi-Fi system. Hospital supplies are also supplemented by donations of supplies and equipment which are brought by short-term volunteers that come on a monthly basis. The hospital could not provide health care to the poor if it charged fees that would allow the purchase of all the necessary supplies and equipment. The hospital’s first CT scanner (donated) arrived in June 2012 and is expected to be operational by November 2012. It is unlikely that a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine will ever be available. If patients need an MRI, they are transported to Nairobi where 4 to 5 units are available. CT scans without sedation and without contrast cost about US$75 and MRI scans about US$200, prices that seem unbelievably low but are unaffordable for many patients. An electroencephalography (EEG) machine was recently donated to the hospital, and efforts are being made to have EEGs evaluated via telemetry by pediatric neurologists in the United States.</p>
<p>Medications are limited, particularly oral antibiotics and anticonvulsants, and the preparations that are available—for example, cephalosporins, nitrofurantoin, ciprofloxacin, phenobarbital, and phenytoin—are not available in pediatric sizes. The pharmacy stocks phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproic acid; levitiracetam can be obtained from Nairobi; clonazepine, ethosuxamide, felbamate, topirimate, and vigabatrin are unavailable.</p>
<p>Nursing at Kijabe is quite different from that in the Western world. There are 2 shifts: 8 <sc>am</sc> to 6:30 <sc>pm</sc> and 6 <sc>pm</sc> to 8 <sc>am</sc>. That is influenced by the need to keep the nurses from traveling to and from work in the dark—it is light from about 6:15 <sc>am</sc> to 7 <sc>pm</sc> all year round. Nursing on the wards is done almost exclusively by diploma-level nurses, who work with nurse-to-patient ratios of 1 nurse to 12 to 16 patients, compared to 1 nurse to 4 to 6 patients in the United States. The rare nurses with baccalaureate degrees work almost exclusively in administration. Kenyan nursing curricula stress skill development over critical thinking and problem solving; evidence-based nursing is in its infancy. The mothers of the children feed their children, make the beds, give the oral medicines after the nurses distribute them, and launder the children’s clothes—including the cloths used as diapers. There is only cosleeping here, and babies breast-feed when their mothers are asleep. It is not uncommon for a child with a myelomeningocele and Chiari II malformation to aspirate during a night feeding, and then have a respiratory arrest. Equipment such as oxygen tanks, nasal cannulae, suction machines, and endotracheal tubes is frequently not accessible during an emergency. It has been necessary to chain equipment to the wall to keep it from disappearing.</p>
<p>One of the most critical problems is that nurses do not feel empowered to speak to physicians, whether to question an order or to clarify the clinical condition of a child. We are encouraged, though, in the development of the nurses during the time we have been in Kijabe. Through the efforts of missionary pediatricians, training in resuscitation takes place weekly for the pediatric nurses. A new pediatric nursing director has brought professionalism and accountability. Many nurses want to give good care and have begun to ask questions, participate in rounds, and even offer suggestions for the plan of care.</p>
<p>As previous articles in <italic>Journal of Child Neurology</italic> have documented,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812460586">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812460586">2</xref></sup> there are few pediatric neurologists in East Africa, and Kijabe Hospital has no neurologist or pediatric neurologist, only visiting neurologists from the United States once or twice a year. As a result, Susan and I are asked to see substantial numbers of children with neurological disorders—many with seizure disorders, though almost none with migraine (which is apparently rare here). Pediatric neurologist friends in the United States have given us invaluable advice via email. I am asked to evaluate and treat adults with Parkinsonism and a few other neurological disorders, and to treat adults with neurosurgical disorders such as brain tumors, tuberculomas, and trauma. Because of the large number of pediatric neurosurgical patients needing operations each week and the length of many adult operations, we limit adult operations to one per week.</p>
<p>We frequently see children with pediatric diseases that have neurological consequences, disorders such as meningitis, malaria, and rickets. Meningitis in most Kenyan hospitals is diagnosed on clinical grounds, without a lumbar puncture or cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and treated empirically with antibiotics for a few days—a practice that results in a high frequency of ventriculitis and postinfectious hydrocephalus. In Uganda, the most common form of hydrocephalus is postinfectious. Malaria and cerebral malaria, so common in many sub-Saharan countries, are uncommon in Kijabe because its altitude, 7200 feet, is too high for malaria-bearing mosquitoes. Rickets is common because the fluoride content of nearby water is so high that it impairs calcium absorption, and because a common porridge contains a grain that impedes calcium absorption. Rickets is associated with macrocephaly, and we are often asked to evaluate an infant for a large head when the underlying, and undiagnosed, disorder is rickets. Treatment of rickets with 6 months of calcium supplements containing vitamin D costs US$50, which many families cannot afford when their daily income is US$2.</p>
<p>Because of patient/family poverty, infants and children often present late for care. Infants with spina bifida are almost never seen within 24 hours after birth and often do not come until they are 2 to 6 months old—partly because the parents did not have enough money to bring the child on a trip from the periphery of the country, partly because the infant was taken first to the practitioner of traditional medicine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0883073812460586">Figure 2</xref>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0883073812460586">
</xref>), and partly because the infant may have been admitted for several days or weeks to a governmental hospital that provided a hospital bed but was unable to provide neurosurgical care. Poverty also results in infants who at presentation are malnourished, anemic, and dirty—dirty usually because they have no running water in their home or village. Maasai infants traditionally do not have their scalp washed until they are 1 year old, so if the child presents with hydrocephalus, cleaning the scalp before a shunt requires considerable effort. Several tribes are virtually unaware of calendars, so that birthdates are unknown, although the year of birth usually is.</p>

</fig>
<p>Several sociological factors required our adjustment. People’s first language is their tribal language, but there are 42 different tribes in Kenya, so it is common that none of the nurses speak a patient’s particular tribal language. People’s second language is usually Swahili and their third English, so conversations with patients often go from English to Swahili to tribal language, back and forth. We have many patients come from Somalia and some from Sudan, and their languages are even less likely to be understood. Occasionally, no one in the hospital speaks the patient’s language. Obtaining a history is distinctly more difficult than in the United States, and the information obtained through translators often changes during the interview.</p>
<p>In Kenya, it is culturally considered taboo to give bad news; consequences of that taboo range from a nurse being unwilling to tell us if she did not give a patient the medicine as ordered to a custom of not telling a parent that their child has a malignant brain tumor. We usually tell parents if treatment of their child would be futile. If we did not, parents might impoverish both their family and much of their village to pay for care that would give the child no chance of having a meaningful life. A hospital chaplain helps us with those conversations, and parents often say that they appreciate being told the truth.</p>
<p>Westerners are considered to be rich, and compared to most Kenyans, we are, although Susan and I receive no salary and live here primarily on social security income. We receive requests for money on a weekly basis, requests ranging from 1000 shillings (US$12) to help pay for an upcoming wedding to 60,000 shillings (US$714) to pay for one semester of university tuition, and the innumerable requests are one of the hardest aspects of living here. It is considered ill mannered to respond to a request with a flat “no,” so a negative answer needs to be put in a form such as, “I cannot help you now.” Sometimes, if a child needs postoperative radiotherapy to have a good chance of being cured of a brain tumor, but his or her family is destitute and has no possibility of obtaining the money for radiotherapy, we have chosen to provide it anonymously. Those decisions obviously cannot be made frequently; craniospinal radiotherapy for a medulloblastoma costs about US$2500.</p>
<p>We established a one-year fellowship in pediatric neurosurgery that has been supported by the Medtronic Foundation and the International Society of Pediatric Neurosurgery. The fellowship is being validated by the University of Nairobi. Ugandan neurosurgeon Humphrey Okechi completed the fellowship in November 2011 and has become a consultant on the Kijabe hospital staff. Our hope was to train one pediatric neurosurgery fellow per year, but there have been few appropriate applicants. African neurosurgeons seem to prefer more lucrative adult practices, particularly practices with spine instrumentation, just like most American neurosurgeons.</p>
<p>Neurosurgery residents from the training programs in Nairobi rotate in Kijabe for 1 to 3 months to receive their pediatric neurosurgical training. In Nairobi, neurosurgery residents learn primarily from books, from operating with other residents, and from observing consultants, but the Western practice of attending physicians/faculty operating with residents rarely occurs. Several neurosurgery residents from programs in the United States have come to Kijabe for 2- to 6-week rotations. During those visits they see and help treat large numbers of children with congenital disorders such as hydrocephalus, spina bifida, and encephaloceles, in far greater numbers than they would see during their entire neurosurgical residency in the United States. In addition, they are exposed to medicine as it is practiced in a developing country and, for most, exposed to real poverty and its consequences for the first time. (And they often bring Cheerios, Fritos, and grape jam, which are unavailable here and are cherished reminders of home.)</p>
<p>In 2011, Dr Okechi and I performed 1328 operations, including 410 shunt operations, 131 endoscopic third ventriculostomies, 253 operations for spina bifida, and 69 operations for brain tumors. (The most operations I had ever done in the United States in one year was 330.) The huge number of patients with hydrocephalus and spina bifida is a consequence of the work of Dr Dick Bransford, a missionary general surgeon who developed an interest in treating children with those disorders. No other place in Kenya was interested in their multidisciplinary care, and as word of the care given in Kijabe spread throughout the country, the numbers increased accordingly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0883073812460586">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Children with hydrocephalus and spina bifida generate the most frequent, and the most difficult, medical and ethical questions, and on an almost-daily basis. We struggle to decide if an infant with gram-negative ventriculitis secondary to a shunt infection should receive a more potent, more costly, antibiotic if he or she has not responded to ceftriaxone; to decide how long to give antibiotics to an infant whose initial cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count was &gt; 1000/ μL but the gram stain and culture were negative; and to decide whether to discharge a 5-day-old baby with an unrepaired myelomeningocele and untreated hydrocephalus because the parents request the discharge but their returning of the infant for treatment is doubtful.</p>
<p>Several conditions are treated differently here than they are in the United States because of social or medical factors. Many children are operated on without any diagnostic imaging, and for most of them that is reasonable. For example, a 5-year-old child who presents with a lipomeningocele can be expected to have a spinal cord tethered distally into the lipoma, and intraoperatively the procedure will be done by dissecting from normal spinal cord into the abnormal region. Neurosurgeons who have done many similar procedures, particularly if scans were available, can be comfortable operating without a preoperative MRI. That said, one sometimes encounters unexpected pathology, such as a split cord malformation, that requires an intraoperative adjustment.</p>
<p>Children with hydrocephalus are much more likely to receive an endoscopic third ventriculostomy and choroid plexus coagulation in hopes of treating their hydrocephalus without a shunt. Most children with brain tumors cannot receive postoperative radiotherapy, so if it is likely that a child has a malignant tumor, for example, a medulloblastoma, the decision about whether to operate needs to take into account how the cost of the operation and hospitalization could impoverish not only the family but their village as well, and the probability that even if the operation is done, the child will die within a few months if irradiation is not given. Cranipharyngiomas are almost never completely resected because almost no family can afford postoperative lifelong multihormone replacement.</p>
<p>There are numerous frustrations in the theatre (operating room), including electricity going off in the middle of a tumor operation, being handed a power drill to make burr holes only to find that the drill does not work and the holes need to be made by hand drills such as were used in the 1960s, and finding that the ultrasonic tumor dissector will not work that day so the tumor has to be removed with pituitary rongeurs, suction, and cautery, as in the 1960s. Most of those frustrations occur when we are in the middle of an operation and are handed instruments that we expect to work but do not. Because almost all our neurosurgical instruments—ultrasonic surgical tumor aspirators, Midas Rex power drills, and microscopes—were donated after considerable use in the United States, they break or stop working frequently, often while in use, and most of the time they cannot be repaired here.</p>
<p>Although hydrocephalus and spina bifida cases compose perhaps 70% of the operations, the remaining cases include extraordinary examples of both common and rare conditions, as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0883073812460586">Figures 4</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0883073812460586"/>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0883073812460586">6</xref>. In addition to publishing case reports, it has been possible to begin a prospective clinical trial comparing outcomes of hydrocephalus treated with conventional and with antibiotic-impregnated shunts and to develop the third edition of the textbook, <italic>Principles and Practice of Pediatric Neurosurgery</italic>.</p>

</fig>
<p>The costs of medical care are paid from 3 main sources: NHIF, BKKH, and the children’s parents. NHIF, the National Health Insurance Fund, pays 2400 Kenya shillings (US$29) per day toward the hospital bill. BKKH, Bethany Kids at Kijabe Hospital (www.Bethanykids.org), is a Christian philanthropic organization that contributes to the bills of children with pediatric surgical or neurosurgical disorders. Children’s parents ask for contributions from their relatives, friends, and communities, and some have to sell their goats or land to pay the bills.</p>
<p>So what has it been like living here? Kijabe and Kenya are beautiful, and our view of the Great Rift Valley is extraordinary. The weather is generally good, with high temperatures of 75 to 80 degrees most days and nighttime lows of 60 to 65. We work with some wonderful people, Kenyans and missionaries. Susan had an endoscopic cholecystectomy that went as well as it could have in the United States, for US$500. We drive to Nairobi on Sunday mornings for meaningful worship services, for lunch in a restaurant, and for groceries, and those excursions are refreshing week after week.</p>
<p>We take Swahili lessons, but given the limited amount of time available to learn it, there is little chance that we will become fluent in the 6 years we hope to be in Kijabe, though we have learned enough to ask basic medical questions such as “Do you have headache?” and “Is the baby vomiting?”</p>
<p>It has not been difficult to go from a large salary to social security, but has been harder than I anticipated to leave the perks of academic medicine in the United States—traveling business class and lecturing across the United States and abroad—to go from being well-known to being unknown. It has been hard to see our children and grandchildren so rarely.</p>
<p>People often ask us if we enjoy it here. On one hand, the work is physically hard—beginning with morning rounds every day at 6:30 <sc>am</sc> and finishing 5-6 operations per day around 5:30 <sc>pm</sc>—and emotionally hard because of the poverty, the difficult treatment decisions that have to be made, and the stresses of patient care that is often not what we want for our patients or would want for ourselves. On the other hand, the work is challenging, sometimes gratifying, and we have an inner sense of peace that we are where we should be, doing what we should be doing, and we give thanks for that. We cannot always say we enjoy it, but we love it.</p>
