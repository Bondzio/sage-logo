<sec id="sec5-1741134312458519"><title>UK Court finds VEGF patent valid and supports broad claim scope</title>
<sec id="sec6-1741134312458519"><title>Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc v Genetech Inc; Bayer Pharma AG v Genetech Inc. [2012] EWHC 657 (Pat)</title>
<sec id="sec7-1741134312458519"><title>Overview</title>
<p>In a first instance decision from the Chancery Division, English Patents Court, Genetech’s patent relating to VEGF was challenged on grounds of lack of novelty and lack of inventive step over a single prior art citation and insufficiency of description. The judge found that the invention disclosed a principle of general application, described by the US House of Lords (now Supreme Court) in <italic>Biogen Inc v Medeva plc [1997] RPC 49</italic>, and as such the claim was allowed to be expressed in correspondingly general terms. Further to this, a product produced by Regeneron and marketed by Bayer, subject of a counterclaim of infringement by Genetech, was found to infringe Genetech’s patent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1741134312458519"><title>Background</title>
<p>Genetech’s patent concerned therapeutic agents for the treatment of diseases by preventing growth of blood vessels associated with them, particularly related to agents inhibiting the action of vascular endothelial growth factor (commonly known as VEGF), which was known as one of several angiogenic growth factors. Angiogenesis is linked to diseases such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and diabetic retinopathy, and the patent explained that a number of molecules had been reported to induce proliferation of endothelial cells amongst which are fibroblast growth factors (FGF); platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor (PD-ECGF); and VEGF. The central claim of the patent was for use of an anti-VEGF antibody, receptor antibody, antibody fragment or an isolated VEGF receptor in the preparation of a medicament for treatment of such disease or disorder as described above. The patent was addressed to a team, including a vascular biologist and a molecular biologist, concerned with the development of a therapeutic agent for use in the treatment of non-neoplastic neovascular conditions.</p>
<p>The claimant company Regeneron had been planning to bring to market a treatment for age-related macular degeneration of the eye, and Bayer was a licensee of Regeneron for this product. The two claimant companies, Regeneron and Bayer applied to revoke the patent on grounds of lack of novelty and lack of inventive step over a single prior art citation and insufficiency of description. Genetech counterclaimed for infringement of its patent by Regeneron’s product and Regeneron and Bayer in response also sought a declaration that their product did not infringe.</p>
<p>The issues for the court to determine were what a skilled person in this field would have understood the language of the patent claim to have meant, and whether Regeneron’s product was an isolated VEGF receptor effectively meaning that it had infringed Genetech’s patent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1741134312458519"><title>Judgment</title>
<p>Floyd J concluded that the skilled person would not have understood that the treatment would necessarily have dealt with other aspects of a disease, one characterised by excessive undesired angiogenesis that had been independent of that angiogenesis. The invention was found to be an inventive step over the closest prior art, a paper entitled ‘<italic>The vascular endothelial growth factor proteins: identification of biological relevant regions by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies</italic>’. Floyd J rejected all of the obviousness and insufficiency cases against the patent, of which there were a number, concluding that there had been nothing by way of a concluded view as to which of the growth factors identified in the prior art would have been the correct or most successful one to target for therapeutic purposes: there had been no way of predicted which growth factor would have been necessary for pathological angiogenesis. The judge considered that the patent disclosed a principle of general application within the meaning of <italic>Biogen Inc v Medeva plc [1997] RPC 49</italic>; namely, antagonism as a treatment for all non-neoplastic diseases. As such, the invention was sufficiently described and could be claimed in broad terms.</p>
<p>Floyd J concluded that the claimants’ product was an effective antagonist of VEGF and that it bound VEGF sufficiently to achieve a therapeutic effect, clearly within the language of the claim of the patent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1741134312458519" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Comment</title>
<p>Since <italic>Biogen</italic> there has been little in the way of practical guidance from the courts as to how broad or narrow the principle of general application may be. In this case, the claim was broadly defined and further that VEGF was known as an angiogenic growth factor at the priority date of the patent. What this case turned on was that it was unknown that VEGF was necessary for pathological angiogenesis, and as such what the therapeutic effect of a VEGF antagonist would be. Floyd J stated that a patent is not insufficient simply because it may take a great deal of work to develop, and that experimentation consisting of trial and error is a normal factor in this industry. Floyd J considered this an appropriate case.</p>

<sec id="sec12-1741134312458519"><title>Opinion of Advocate General Trstenjak</title>
<p>Court of Justice of the European Union Case C–130/11</p>

<sec id="sec15-1741134312458519"><title>Overview</title>
<p>Supplementary protection certificates (SPCs) provide extensions of patent term to compensate patentees for any loss of term due to the regulatory approval process for medicinal products. Two main requirements for grant of an SPC are that the product mentioned in the SPC application must be protected by a basic patent and there must be a marketing authorisation to place the product on the market which is the ‘first marketing authorisation for that product’.</p>
<p>This case relates to a reference by the UK Court of Appeal to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) seeking clarification on whether later authorisations involving the same active agent could qualify as ‘first marketing authorisation for that product’ for grant of a SPC. Previous cases have interpreted the SPC Regulation strictly and have held that ‘first marketing authorisation’ means the very first authorisation for the active ingredient in the medicinal product irrespective of use, patient population, dosage, formulations, etc.</p>
<p>Advocate General Trstenjak has recently provided her opinion on this reference stating that upon a purposive interpretation of the SPC regulation, ‘first marketing authorisation for that product’ refers to ‘<italic>The first authorisation which permits that product to be placed on the market as a medicinal product which is within the scope of protection conferred by the basic patent designated by the applicant.</italic>’ This interpretation would mean that a later marketing authorisation can be used as the basis of a SPC so long as that authorisation is the first authorisation that is within the scope of the basic patent being extended. If accepted by the CJEU, this interpretation will mark a significant departure from the existing view on what constitutes a ‘first marketing authorisation’ for the purpose of obtaining a SPC and will potentially result in a substantial increase in the number of SPCs granted for products with the same active ingredient.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-1741134312458519"><title>Background</title>
<p>This reference relates to the requirement contained in Article 3(d) of the SPC regulation (Council Regulation (EC) No.469/2009) under which the authorisation to place the product on the market as a medicinal product must be the <italic>first authorisation to place that product</italic> on the market.</p>
<p>Neurim applied for a SPC for a medicinal product for the treatment of insomnia in humans. The active ingredient in this medicinal product is melatonin, which had previously been authorised as a veterinary product for the regulation of reproductive cycles in sheep. Neurim based their SPC application on an authorisation issued in June 2007 to place the melatonin formulation in question on the market as a medicinal product for human use. The basic patent relied upon by Neurim claimed specific human use of melatonin and did not cover melatonin <italic>per se</italic> or the veterinary use of melatonin as per the previous authorisation.</p>
<p>The hearing office at the UK Intellectual Property Office (IPO) relied primarily on three previous judgments of the CJEU and held that a SPC could not be granted because the marketing authorisation in respect of treatment of insomnia in humans was not the first authorisation as required by Article 3(d) of the SPC Regulation since the veterinary authorisation counted as the first authorisation for melatonin. On appeal the UK Patents Court agreed with the hearing officer. However, the Court of Appeal ordered a referral to the CJEU on the basis that the law in this respect was not clear. In its judgment referring questions to the CJEU, the Court of Appeal indicated its view by stating ‘<italic>We consider that Neurim’s arguments are not only tenable: in our view they are right’.</italic></p>
<p>The main question posed by this referral is whether Article 3(d) precludes the grant of an SPC where an earlier marketing authorisation for a product not protected by the basic patent exists. Another question referred by the Court of Appeal asked whether it will make a difference if the later marketing authorisation required a full application for marketing authorisation. The Advocate General answered both these question in the negative.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-1741134312458519"><title>Advocate General’s opinion</title>
<p>The Advocate General acknowledged that a purely literal interpretation of Article 3(d) would lead to a conclusion that no SPC can be based on later marketing authorisations involving the same active ingredients as a previous authorisation. However, she took the view that Article 3(d) should be given a purposive interpretation keeping the scheme and objectives of the SPC Regulation in mind. She also relied upon other clauses of Article 3 and noted that Article 3(a), (b) and (c) of the Regulation, in principle, permit the grant of more than one SPC for a product.</p>
<p>The Advocate General concluded that ‘<italic>In this overall context, Article 3(d) of Regulation No 1768/92 does not, in my view, seek to preclude without exception the grant of a supplementary protection certificate based on an authorisation to place a product on the market… where there is an earlier authorisation to place that product on the market as a medicinal product in that Member State. Furthermore, such an absolute preclusive effect of Article 3(d) would be not compatible with the objectives of Regulation No 1768/92.</italic>’</p>
<p>Having arrived at this more liberal interpretation of Article 3(d), the Advocate General provide her view on what factor should determined whether or not a SPC can be granted based on a later authorisation actually depends on the scope of claims of the basic patents being used for the SPC application. She stated that ‘<italic>The crucial factor… is that the first use of an active ingredient which is authorised as a medicinal product is not within the scope of protection conferred by the patent which has been designated by the applicant as the basic patent.</italic>’ Therefore, her opinion is that a SPC should be granted based on a later authorisation provided that authorisation is <italic>the first authorisation within the scope of protection conferred by the basic patent</italic>. She also states that, in her opinion, it does not matter whether the later authorisation required a full or abridged application.</p>
<sec id="sec18-1741134312458519" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Comment</title>
<p>The CJEU judgment which will decide this issue is expected around September 2012 and it remains to be seen whether the CJEU will uphold the Advocate General’s opinion in full or in part.</p>
<p>This opinion appears favourable for patentees and provides hope that SPC may soon be available in Europe for new uses, formulations, dosage regimens, etc., which require separate marketing authorisations. If this happens then in order to utilise the opportunity for SPCs based on later authorisations, Patentees will need to be vigilant about the scope of their patent claims to ensure that the claims in later patents directed to new uses, formulations etc. do not to cover medicinal products of previous authorisations.</p>
<p>The fact that the Advocate General made no distinction between full and abridged applications appears surprising at first. However, on further consideration this may not be significant if shorter SPC terms result from abridged approval process.</p>

<sec id="sec19-1741134312458519"><title>UK Court of Appeal applies CJEU ruling to hold that Medeva patent did not ‘protect’ the product mentioned in SPC applications</title>
<sec id="sec20-1741134312458519"><title>Medeva BV v. Comptroller General of Patents [2012] EWCA Civ 523</title>
<sec id="sec21-1741134312458519"><title>Overview</title>
<p>This decision applies the ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on Medeva’s applications for supplementary protection certificates (SPC) relating to combination vaccines. The CJEU ruling issued on 24 November 2011 held that the active ingredients of the product as defined in the SPC application must be specified in the claims of the basic patent for a SPC to be granted on that patent.</p>
<p>The Court of Appeal (Court) decided that the product of Medeva’s four SPC applications was not specified in the claims of the basic patent. Therefore, a SPC could not be granted on any of these four applications. A fifth SPC application, in which the product definition in the SPC application had active ingredients limited to those protected by the basic patent, was withdrawn and was not considered by the Court.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec22-1741134312458519"><title>Background</title>
<p>Medeva filed five SPC applications for extension of a patent claiming a method for the preparation of a vaccine ‘comprising’ two specified active ingredients. The patent claims made no express reference to other active ingredients that may be present in the vaccine.  In support of these applications, Medeva submitted marketing authorisations for medicinal products which contained other active ingredients in addition to the combination of two antigens as claimed in the patent. Three of the five SPC applications defined the product as vaccines against five diseases: whooping cough, diphtheria, tetanus, meningitis and polio. The other two applications omitted one or more of these vaccines from the product definition.</p>
<p>The main legal provision relevant to this decision is Article 3 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 469/2009 (‘the Regulation’) concerning the conditions for grant of a SPC. Article 3(a) requires that ‘the product is <italic>protected</italic> by a basic patent in force’ while Article 3(b) requires that ‘a valid authorisation to place the product on the market as a medicinal product has been granted’.</p>
<p>The Hearing Officer at the UK Intellectual Property Office (IPO) rejected four of these SPC applications on the basis that all the active ingredients specified in the vaccine were not protected by Medeva’s Patent. In the case of the fifth application, although the product definition in the application was limited to active ingredients protected by Medeva’s patent, the marketing authorisation covered a combination vaccine which included vaccines against other diseases. In other words, the Hearing Officer held that in the case of all five applications there was a mismatch between the product protected by the patent and the medicinal product for which the relevant market authorisations had been granted. Medeva appealed to the High Court and their appeal was dismissed. On appeal, the Court referred several questions to the CJEU including a question which seeking clarification on the meaning of a product being ‘protected’ by a basic patent for the purposes of Article 3(a) of the Regulation.</p>
<p>The CJEU held that Article 3(a) must be interpreted as precluding the grant of a SPC relating to active ingredients, which are not specified in the wording of the claims of the basic patent. Hence, the CJEU linked the requirement in Article 3(a) to the specific subject matter in the claims of the basic patent. In doing so, The CJEU rejected the so called ‘infringement test’ previously applied by some national courts which considered the requirement of Article 3(a) to have been met if the product infringes the claims of the basic patent.</p>
<p>The case came back to the Court to be decided on the basis of the principles set out in the CJEU decision.</p>
<p>Medeva argued that the CJEU ruling entitled them to the grant of SPCs on the first four of its applications since the word ‘comprises’ or ‘comprising’ in patent claims permits the inclusion of additional elements to those expressly referred to. Hence, those additional elements were to be taken as being "specified" in the wording of the claim. Medeva also argued that if their cases could not be allowed then further references to the CJEU were needed.</p>
<p>The IPO argued that the active ingredients of the vaccines against diseases other than whooping cough were part of the product definition in the SPC applications but not protected by the basic patent as these active ingredients were neither named nor described in the wording of the claims of the basic patent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec23-1741134312458519"><title>Judgement</title>
<p>The Court of Appeal rejected Medeva’s arguments, dismissed the appeal and did not feel it necessary to refer any further questions to the CJEU in this case.</p>
<p>The Court held that the issue to be determined was whether the active ingredients forming part of the product definition in the SPC applications are specified in the wording of the claims. The court stated that ‘<italic>the ambit of ‘specified’ may range from express naming, through description, necessary implication to reasonable interpretation. Where on that scale the dividing line is to be drawn will necessitate further references in due course in the light of the facts of the cases in which the issue arises.’</italic></p>
<p>The Court did not consider a further CJEU reference necessary in this case because ‘<italic>wherever the dividing line is to be drawn the active ingredients relating to the product in Medeva’s SPC applications could not considered to be specified in the claims of the basic patent.’</italic> There was no wording in the claims of the patent to indicate that the active ingredients of the vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, meningitis and polio – which formed part of the product definition in the SPC applications – are included.</p>
<p>The Court also stated that Medeva’s approach would have the effect of applying the ‘infringement test’ to the interpretation of Article 3(a), which test had been rejected by the CJEU.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec24-1741134312458519" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Comment</title>
<p>This decision highlights the lack of clarity regarding the level of disclosure in patent claims that would be sufficient for a SPC to be granted for a combination product. It is only a matter of time before further references are made to the CJEU to clarify the ambit of the terms ‘specified in the wording of claims of the patent’.</p>
<p>This decision also reinforces that this requirement for the SPC product to be ‘specified in the wording of the claims’ may render many SPCs in respect of combination products which were granted before the CJEU ruling vulnerable to invalidity challenges.</p>
<p>Medeva has sought permission to appeal to the UK Supreme Court and it will be interesting to see whether the UK’s highest court expenses their view and to follow any further twists and turns to the Medeva story.</p>

<sec id="sec25-1741134312458519"><title>Spanish commercial courts issue divergent rulings in patent infringement cases with equivalent underlying facts</title>
<sec id="sec26-1741134312458519"><title>(i) <italic>Pfizer Inc. and Pfizer S.L.U. v Kern Pharma, S.L. et al and (ii) H. Lundbeck A/S and its licensees v Sandoz Farmacéutica S.A. et al.</italic></title>
<sec id="sec27-1741134312458519"><title>Overview</title>
<p>The holders of the European Patents on Sildenafil and Escitalopram sought an injunction ruling to prevent the marketing of certain generics based on those active ingredients. The patent holders relied on a set of Judgments by the Supreme Court of Spain of November 2010 (reversing decisions by the Spanish Patents Office) that permitted the publication of revised translations broadening the scope of protection of those European Patents.</p>
<p>Though Barcelona Commercial Court 7 granted the interim injunction application filed by Pfizer, Commercial Court 4 of the same city rejected the similar application by Lundbeck.</p>
<p>These disputes revolve around the interpretation and application of articles 27 and 70 of the TRIPS Agreement to Spanish validations of method patents of European Patents that claimed both the product and the method.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec28-1741134312458519"><title>Background</title>
<p>Due to the reservation made by Spain when ratifying the European Patent Convention (‘EPC’) in 1986, the Spanish Patents Act prohibited until 7 October 1992 the patentability of pharma-chemical products. Consequently, European Patents which claimed both a method and a product had to be validated in Spain as regards the method claim(s) only. Validation requires a translation into Spanish of the patent.</p>
<p>In light of a creative, and ultimately successful, interpretation of articles 27.1 and 70 of the TRIPS Agreement, several patentees tried to modify the scope of protection of their Spanish validations. They did so by filling before the Spanish Patents Office revised translations of the Spanish validations. These translations added to the method patent the products claim/s of the European Patents. The revised translation would produce <italic>erga omnes</italic> effects only upon its publication in the Official Gazette.</p>
<p>The first part of this story resulted in administrative decisions issued by the Spanish Patents Office rejecting publication of the translation. Some patentees then launched infringement proceedings against generics requesting that the courts apply articles 27.1 and 70 TRIPS and enforce the revised translation by alleging its <italic>inter partes</italic> effect. This litigation strategy led to a second part of the story in which a Court hearing consolidated cases dismissed all claims arguing that the publication of the translations were a compulsory pre-requisite for asserting the product claims of the revised translation.</p>
<p>In parallel, some patentees appealed before the decisions of the Spanish Patents Office, and were ultimately successful before the Supreme Court (see e.g. the November 2919 decision in the Sildenafil case). Following this case, patentees filed revised translations again. The Spanish Patents Office was forced to publish the revised translations to comply with the decision of the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The story continues as the patentees that had revised translations published, such as Pfizer (Sildenafil) and Lundbeck (Escitalopram), have asserted the product claims against a large number of generics.</p>
<p>The nature of these disputes is heavily juridical and legally complex.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec29-1741134312458519"><title>Judgement</title>
<p>Despite the obvious parallelism between the reviewed cases, the outcome of the interim injunction proceedings has differed as the applied interim measures have only been granted to Pfizer.</p>
<p>The Barcelona-Commercial Court 7 in a decision dated 21 February 2012 on the interim injunction application filed by Pfizer (Sildenafil) followed the interpretation of the Supreme Court about the right of patentees to get the broader protection given by articles 27.1 and 70 TRIPS. In addition, the court dismissed the defendants’ argument that the preparatory acts for the marketing of the generics started earlier than the revised translation was filed before the Spanish Patents Office and before its publication.</p>
<p>More recently, on 7 May 2012 the Barcelona Commercial Court 4 pronounced a different decision as regards the interim injunction application filed by Lundbeck (Escitalopram). Surprisingly, the court dismissed Lundbeck’s application on the basis that the effect of the revised translation was to amend the European patent which exceeded the power of the Spanish Patents Office as such powers are vested exclusively on the European Patent Office. In addition, the Court stated that there is no contradiction with the Supreme Court jurisprudence about the issue of the revised translations because the Supreme Court itself declares that it is for the civil court to consider the scope of the revised translation and whether there is a conflict between the original text and the text of the revised translation.</p>
<p>Finally, one peculiarity of this first instance injunction decision is that it has been co-jointly discussed and decided by three Judges due to the relevancy and complexity of the case. These Judges are the nominal Judges of Commercial Courts 1, 4 and 5, the only ones in Barcelona as of January 2012 with competence and jurisdiction for patent conflicts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec30-1741134312458519" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Comment</title>
<p>The nature of the juridical discussions in the analysed decisions is indeed complex and the conflict itself shows a wide grey zone open to interpretation. There is a thin line between one side and the other. Are we lost in translation? Although the decisions were ruled in interim injunction proceedings, the case is purely juridical, thus the appeal decision will determine the result of the litigation in the merits. Indeed, it is desirable to have clarification from the Court of Appeal on both the legal effects of the revised translations published by the Spanish Patents Office and the ‘legality’ of a collective decision pronounced by first instance Judges.</p>
