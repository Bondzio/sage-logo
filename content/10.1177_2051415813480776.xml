<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Radical cystectomy is recommended for T2–4 N0 M0 and high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. This form of radical surgery is associated with a morbidity rate of up to 30% and a hospital stay of approximately 15 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2051415813480776">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2051415813480776">2</xref></sup> Minimally invasive techniques such as laparoscopic or robotic-assisted radical cystectomy may shorten the post-operative recovery but the majority of cases are still performed as a conventional open procedure. Standard operative technique involves prolonged small bowel handling as the approach is mainly intra-peritoneal and enteral feeding is often delayed until the return of bowel function. Developments in our understanding of peri-operative physiological changes and anaesthetic techniques have led to a change in the peri-operative management of patients undergoing major surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2051415813480776">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2051415813480776"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2051415813480776">5</xref></sup> This has been applied in colorectal surgery where the perceived benefits of keeping patients nil by mouth after surgery were found to be unjustified and enhanced recovery protocols have reduced mean hospital stay by two days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2051415813480776">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2051415813480776">7</xref></sup> In major urological surgery, the principles of early ambulation and feeding have only been discussed in the context of laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and laparoscopic radical nephrectomy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2051415813480776">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2051415813480776"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2051415813480776">10</xref></sup> but not in radical cystectomy.</p>
<p>The concepts of fast track surgery described by Kehlet encourage improved anaesthetic and analgesic techniques aiming to provide pain and stress free surgery: these techniques are combined with pre-operative patient education, minimal use of tubes and drains, and early initiation of oral feeding and mobilisation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2051415813480776">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2051415813480776">5</xref></sup> When applied to major abdominal surgery, a faster post-operative recovery has been described without an increase in the readmission rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2051415813480776">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2051415813480776">11</xref></sup> The aim of this study was to apply the pre-, peri- and post-operative concepts of fast track surgery and combine these principles with a modification in the operative technique, to develop a multimodal pathway for patients undergoing radical cystectomy and urinary diversion.</p>

<title>Patient inclusion</title>
<p>All patients undergoing radical cystectomy with curative intent at a single urology unit between June 2005–March 2009 were included in the study. All operations were performed by one of two surgeons. The key components of our protocol are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2051415813480776">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<sec id="section8-2051415813480776">
<title>Pre-operative care</title>
<p>Once the decision had been made that the patient would undergo a radical cystectomy, a dedicated cancer nurse specialist was assigned to the patient. This provided psychological support, education in the theory and potential benefits of fast track surgery and a point of contact for any questions. The nutritional status of the patient was assessed, by calculating the body mass index (BMI). If the BMI was 15% below the expected value, additional enteral feeding was commenced preoperatively in the form of enteral supplements. Dietary advice was also given to those patients with a BMI&gt;30. The anaesthetic assessment took place as soon as possible but at least three weeks prior to surgery in all cases, allowing optimisation of co-existing medical problems. Patients were also encouraged to stop smoking and reduce their alcohol intake.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-2051415813480776">
<title>Peri-operative management</title>
<p>Patients were admitted the day before surgery. In contrast to our previous practice, routine bowel prep was not utilised. High calorie enteral supplements Ensure® (Abbott, Illinois, US) were encouraged in all patients up to 12 hours before surgery and patients were allowed clear fluids until six hours prior to their surgery.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-2051415813480776">
<title>Anaesthesia</title>
<p>Patients were encouraged to have an epidural combined with a general anaesthetic. Core body temperature was maintained using a Bair Hugger® and attempts were made to minimise peri-operative opiate use by encouraging patients to use an epidural and non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as an alternative. Fluid balance was monitored closely throughout the procedure. In contrast to our previous practice, nasogastric (NG) tubes were not used.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-2051415813480776">
<title>Surgical technique</title>
<p>An infra-umbilical incision extending to the pubic symphysis allowed an initial extra-peritoneal approach as for a radical prostatectomy or anterior urethral dissection in females. Following the division of Santorini’s plexus, a bilateral nerve-sparing approach was developed. If a neobladder was to be constructed, the urethra was transected and anastomotic sutures placed. This was followed by a retrograde bladder mobilization and dissection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2051415813480776">Figure 2</xref>). Once the bladder had been fully mobilised, a pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed to the level of the common iliac bifurcation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2051415813480776">Figure 3</xref>). The bladder was detached from the peritoneum leaving a small window in the peritoneum at the level of the umbilicus: this allowed the ureters to be mobilised together with the formation of an ileal conduit or neobladder using a hand sewn anastamosis for the small bowel and uretero-ileal anastomosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-2051415813480776">Figure 4</xref>). This technique ensured minimal bowel handling and mobilisation throughout the procedure. The peritoneal window was closed at the end of the procedure. Once all of the lateral spaces had been closed, the uretero-ileal anastomosis was retroperitonealised.</p>

<title>Post-operative care</title>
<p>Patients were transferred to the high dependency unit overnight for close monitoring. Clear fluids of up to 30 ml/hr orally were allowed immediately post operatively. Chest physiotherapy was commenced on day 1 and oral intake was increased to allow alternating clear fluids and enteral supplements. By day 2, the epidural was removed and the patient could sit out. At this stage, enteral feeding was increased to 60 ml/hr irrespective of bowel function. On day 3, patients were encouraged to mobilise and, by day 4, a full diet was encouraged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-2051415813480776">Figure 5</xref>). Patients were discharged when fully mobile, tolerating a full diet and able to self-care.</p>

<title>Patient characteristics</title>
<p>A total of 46 patients (mean age 64.7 years, range 34–79; 39 male) underwent a radical cystectomy with curative intent between June 2005–March 2009 using the multimodal pathway described above. Thirty-three of the 46 patients (71.7%) were diagnosed with muscle-invasive disease (Stage T2 or above; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2051415813480776">Table 1</xref>): the remainder underwent cystectomy for high-grade tumours with carcinoma in situ (CIS). After patient counselling and a discussion of the options of urinary diversion, 42 patients underwent an ileal conduit and a neobladder was constructed in four patients. All cases were discussed at a regional multidisciplinary team meeting and eligible patients were offered neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Overall, 11 patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with MVAC (methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, cisplatin), while three patients had already been treated with radiotherapy and therefore were undergoing a salvage cystectomy. After histological examination of the specimen, three patients had positive margins (one urethra, one ureter, one right lateral wall).</p>

One patient had a urinary leak from the uretero-ileal anastomosis; another patient had dehiscence of the small bowel anastomosis, underwent a laparotomy, subsequently had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on day 11; a patient with a wound dehiscence underwent emergency surgery and was discharged on day 20; the fourth patient with a major complication was readmitted with obstructive renal failure, managed with ureteric stent placement and made a full recovery. Patients with superficial wound infections and urinary tract infections were successfully treated with oral antibiotics. Five patients were readmitted within 30 days (10.6%), four of these patients were pyrexial on admission and were successfully treated for a urinary tract infection with antibiotics: the fifth patient is that with obstructive renal failure described above.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Until recently, the peri-operative management of radical cystectomy patients has utilised historical techniques based on experience and largely without an evidence-based approach. This study has applied the experience gained in colorectal surgery using an enhanced recovery program, and has demonstrated that these principles can also be applied to patients who are undergoing a radical cystectomy.</p>
<p>The introduction of the fast track protocol has, in our experience, established and simplified a multidisciplinary approach to radical cystectomy. Importantly, patients managed under the fast track protocol stayed in hospital for an average of eight days. This compares favourably to the standard length of stay for patients undergoing radical cystectomy published by Dr Foster/HES (Hospital episode statistics) and our own previous unpublished series of patients (<italic>n</italic>=46) undergoing radical cystectomy between 2000–2005 using standard peri-operative and operative care, who had an average length of stay of 17 days. Early mobilisation reduces muscle loss, improves pulmonary function and minimises the risk of thromboembolism, while early discharge is associated with reduced post-operative morbidity, fewer negative psychological effects and also represents a more rapid return to normal diet and ambulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2051415813480776">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2051415813480776">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Arumainayagam and colleagues recently investigated the impact of introducing an enhanced recovery program for patients undergoing radical cystectomy and focused on bowel preparation, feeding and analgesic regimes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2051415813480776">14</xref></sup> In our series, we have also incorporated a change in the surgical technique in order to allow patients to return to a full diet in a shorter time period and it is notable that the average length of inpatient stay in Arumainayagam’s enhanced recovery series was 13 days as compared to eight days in our patients. By utilising the extra-peritoneal approach, and also by avoiding the use of NG tubes, prolonged ileus caused by inhibitory neural sympathetic visceral and intestinal inflammatory responses is likely to reduce, allowing early enteral feeding to be better tolerated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2051415813480776">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2051415813480776">16</xref></sup> Furthermore, at the time of surgery and during the recovery period, a variety of measures were used to offset the surgical stress response. Smaller incisions are associated with reduced pain and a shorter recovery time and this may be improved further by using a transverse rather than a midline incision. Optimisation and close monitoring of patient temperature has been associated with a threefold increase in wound healing, reduction in blood loss, decrease in cardiac events and a reduction in nitrogen excretion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2051415813480776">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Optimisation of both anaesthesia and analgesia is crucial in fast track surgery. Appropriate use of short-acting anaesthetic agents ensures minimal carry over of the effects of opioids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2051415813480776">12</xref></sup> The use of local anaesthetics reduces the pituitary, adrenocortical and sympathetic response to surgery and therefore improves post-operative nitrogen economy and continued local/regional blockade for 24–48 hr post surgery also markedly reduces the post-operative stress response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2051415813480776">4</xref></sup> In addition to the intra-operative measures described, our protocol also included adaptation of the pre-operative assessment process, through earlier anaesthetist input (to evaluate and optimise the patient’s clinical condition)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2051415813480776">19</xref></sup> and through early contact with a cancer nurse specialist to offer psychological support and manage patient expectations.</p>
<p>We have demonstrated the feasibility of running a pre-operative, intra-operative and post-operative fast-track protocol in patients undergoing radical cystectomy, which may lead to shortened hospital stay. While the protocol we used appears safe, further study is required. For example, our extra-peritoneal approach did not seem to compromise the exposure to the pelvic lymph nodes and was technically feasible for all the patients in this series. However, the approach may be criticised since it may not allow a full inspection of the liver and peritoneal contents at the time of surgery, although with routine pre-operative staging using computed tomography (CT) scans it is unlikely that a significant lesion will be missed by not examining the intra-abdominal contents. It is unclear from our study as to which factor contributed most to the improved recovery in these patients and, as we have assumed that recovery is multifactorial and subjective, further studies would be required to elicit the specific benefits. There are insufficient numbers in our study to support the selection of patients for enhanced recovery programs based upon co-morbidity and pre-operative assessment. Therefore, the enhanced recovery protocol has become the default protocol for patients considered fit enough to undergo radical cystectomy and urinary diversion in our unit. Ultimately, the success of fast-track surgery must also be judged by satisfactory oncological outcomes and patient safety, therefore additional research is required to fine tune fast-track surgery and a randomised controlled trial should now be performed to create an established evidence-based national standard of care in patients undergoing radical cystectomy.</p>
