<abstract>
<p><italic>Objective:</italic> Ketorolac is a non-triptan, non-opioid, mixed cyclooxygenase (COX)1/2-inhibitor for short-term management of moderate-to-severe acute pain. This trial evaluated an intranasal formulation of ketorolac tromethamine (SPRIX®) containing 6% lidocaine (ROX-828) for the acute treatment of migraine with and without aura as defined by the International Headache Society.</p>
<p><italic>Methods:</italic> Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to self-treat with intranasal ROX-828 (31.5 mg ketorolac tromethamine/200 µL, containing 6% of lidocaine) or placebo (with 6% lidocaine) within four hours of a new migraine attack rated ≥ moderate in pain intensity. Assessments included headache intensity and associated migraine symptoms (nausea, vomiting, phonophobia, photophobia) measured at baseline and at regular intervals through 48 hours post-dosing, and global impression of efficacy (seven-point scale) measured at two hours.</p>
<p><italic>Results:</italic> Randomized patients who had a migraine attack (<italic>N</italic> = 140) were evaluable (ROX-828, <italic>N</italic> = 68; placebo, <italic>N</italic> = 72). Patients receiving ROX-828 showed a significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) improvement in pain relief at all time points except 0.5 and 24 hours compared with those who received placebo. More patients achieved pain-free status with ROX-828 than with placebo at 1.5, 3, 4, 24 and 48 hours (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05); significance at the two-hour time point, which was the primary endpoint, was not met. Patients’ global impression of efficacy showed statistically significantly better results for patients receiving ROX-828 than for those receiving placebo. Associated migraine symptoms were significantly improved (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) with ROX-828 relative to placebo at several time points throughout the observation period. The most frequently reported adverse events in both groups were associated with nasal discomfort.</p>
<p><italic>Conclusion:</italic> Self-administered intranasal ROX-828 was well tolerated. While the primary endpoint was not met, the results provide preliminary evidence that ROX-828 improves migraine pain.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0333102412451359" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Routes of administration that avoid the gastrointestinal tract and that have high bioavailability may offer significant advantages to oral migraine medications. Nausea and vomiting during a migraine can be particularly severe and incapacitating, and can be among the most problematic symptoms experienced by migraineurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0333102412451359">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0333102412451359">2</xref>). Ninety percent of migraineurs have experienced nausea during migraine episodes as determined by patient survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0333102412451359">3</xref>). For the majority of migraine occurrences, a significant percentage are associated with nausea (52%) and vomiting (22%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0333102412451359">3</xref>). Migraine-related nausea can cause patients to delay or avoid taking oral medication, resulting in decreased therapeutic efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0333102412451359">3</xref>). The gastric stasis in migraineurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0333102412451359">4</xref>) can also affect drug absorption after oral medications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0333102412451359">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0333102412451359">6</xref>) and result in compromised therapeutic efficacy.</p>
<p>Intranasal formulations of migraine medications, including triptans (5-HT1 receptor agonists), are currently available for use when oral treatment is not desirable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0333102412451359">7</xref>). Although triptans are widely used for migraine, non-triptan intranasal drugs that provide rapid relief of migraine symptoms are needed when triptans should be avoided (e.g. patients with vascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension or hemiplegic migraine) or are ineffective. For example, in patients who experience allodynia, non-triptan options are used when additional pain medication is necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0333102412451359">8</xref>).</p>
<p>Intranasal ketorolac (ketorolac tromethamine, SPRIX®) is a non-opioid, mixed COX1/2-inhibitor non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) approved in adults for short-term (up to five days) management of moderate-to-moderately-severe pain that requires analgesia at the opioid level. The pharmacokinetics of intranasal ketorolac are similar to those following intramuscular ketorolac administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0333102412451359">9</xref>). Intravenous ketorolac has shown promising efficacy in the acute treatment of migraine in a small comparative study against intranasal sumatriptan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0333102412451359">10</xref>), but no clinical studies have been conducted with intranasal ketorolac in migraineurs. The intranasal formulation is well tolerated. The most frequent adverse events in clinical trials were transient episodes of nasal burning or stinging, the majority of which were rated mild in severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0333102412451359">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0333102412451359">14</xref>). Comparison of intranasal formulations of ketorolac with and without lidocaine indicated that the addition of low concentrations of lidocaine (5% or 6%, but not 4%) significantly decreased the time to T<sub>max</sub> without affecting the C<sub>max</sub>, and in addition improved local tolerability (data on file, Luitpold Pharmaceuticals). The objectives of the present study were to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of a single dose of intranasal ketorolac tromethamine (SPRIX®) containing 6% lidocaine (ROX-828) in patients with migraine.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0333102412451359" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>Patients were enrolled in a phase 2, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Protocol ROX-2007-01; registration number for the EU Clinical Trials Register: 2007-001431-58) evaluating the efficacy and safety of ROX-828 in patients with a history of recurrent migraine. Enrollment was from September 2007 to February 2008 at 16 centers in Germany (10 sites) and Finland (six sites). The study protocol and the informed consent form were approved by the institutional review boards of each participating center (German sites: Ethik-Kommmission der Bayerischen Landesärztekammer; Finnish sites: Helsinki and Uusimaa Hospital District/Ethics Committee for Obstetrics and Gynecology, Otology and Ophthalmology, Neurology and Neurosurgery). The trial was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of all responsible institutional and national committees on human experimentation and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000. All enrolled patients provided informed consent.</p>
<p>Men and women 18–65 years old were eligible if they had a history of migraine with or without aura according to International Headache Society (IHS) criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0333102412451359">15</xref>), onset of migraine history prior to age 50 years and between two and eight moderate or severe migraine headaches per month. Use of migraine prophylactic drugs was permitted if used at stable doses for at least 12 weeks prior to study entry. Patients were excluded if they had a medical or psychiatric condition, or circumstance which, in the opinion of the investigator, would adversely affect their participation in the trial. Other exclusion criteria were continuous use of aspirin or NSAIDs, and use of another NSAID for the migraine attack for which study drug was used.</p>
<p>During the screening visit, patients underwent medical history and clinical evaluations. Patients meeting entry criteria were randomized 1:1 to the ROX-828 or IN placebo groups using a blocked randomization schedule within each investigative site. The ROX-828 and placebo nasal solutions were provided in disposable, multidose, metered-spray devices that were identical in appearance. All doses were administered as one spray containing 100 µL into each nostril (i.e. one spray into the left nostril and one spray into the right nostril). Each spray of ROX 828 delivered 15.75 mg of ketorolac tromethamine, for a total dose 31.5 mg. Both ROX-828 and the placebo control also contained 6% lidocaine, 0.02% sodium ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and water.</p>
<p>Patients were instructed to use study medication within four hours of a new migraine attack that was rated ≥ moderate in pain intensity. Patients were to use study medication as the first treatment and not to use rescue medication until at least two hours after taking study medication. Patients recorded the time and date of onset and characteristics of the attack (headache severity, aura, nausea, vomiting, photophobia/phonophobia, clinical disability). Once an attack was treated, patients recorded responses over 48 hours using diary cards. Patients had a follow-up visit within seven days of treatment for physical examination, hematology and serum chemistry evaluations and questioning regarding adverse events and concomitant medication use.</p>
<p>Efficacy analyses were performed on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, defined as patients who took study medication except those who did not use study medication as the first treatment, or who did not have a time of dosing. The primary endpoint of the study was the proportion of patients who became pain-free (i.e. a grade 0 on the (IHS) scale where 0 = no pain, 1 = mild pain, 2 = moderate pain and 3 = severe pain) two hours after dosing.</p>
<p>Secondary endpoints included presence or absence of migraine-associated symptoms (nausea, vomiting, photophobia and phonophobia), meaningful pain relief (defined as a reduction of a moderate or severe headache to mild or none), freedom from pain (defined as a reduction in pain to none), global impression of efficacy (measured two hours after taking study medication using a seven-point scale where 1 = very much better, 2 = much better, 3 = a little better, 4 = no change, 5 = a little worse, 6 = much worse and 7 = very much worse), time to rescue medication use (recorded on the subject diary card) and clinical disability (rated by the patient using a four-point scale where 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate and 3 = severe). Times to meaningful pain relief, freedom from pain and use of rescue medication were determined using Kaplan-Meier time-to-event analyses.</p>
<p>Safety analyses were performed for all subjects who self-treated with study medication (safety population). Safety assessments included reported and observed adverse events, and results of physical examinations, vital sign measurements, hematology, blood chemistry and urinalysis.</p>
<sec id="sec3-0333102412451359"><title>Statistics</title>
<p>A sample size of 65 provided 90% power based on a two-sided test at the 5% level of significance. All continuous variables were summarized using descriptive statistics including number, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, maximum and minimum. All categorical variables were summarized using frequency counts and percentages.</p>
<p>The primary variable, the proportion of subjects pain-free two hours post-dosing, was compared between the active and placebo groups using an asymptotic Pearson’s Chi-square test, based on a two-sided 5% level of significance using the ITT population. Descriptive statistics were provided for secondary variables and the Pearson’s Chi-square test compared proportions of subjects between treatment groups. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals for the differences between groups in freedom from pain and pain relief were calculated. The 95% confidence intervals have not been corrected for multiplicity and should be viewed as descriptive, as statistical analysis of secondary endpoints was considered exploratory. Clinical disability was compared between the placebo and active treatment group using the asymptotic Pearson’s Chi-square test (without continuity adjustment). Time-to-event analyses using Kaplan-Meier methods were compared with the log-rank test.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0333102412451359" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>Screening of 176 patients resulted in randomization of 173 patients to the ROX-828 (<italic>N</italic> = 87) and placebo (<italic>N</italic> = 86) groups. The disposition of subjects is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0333102412451359">Figure 1</xref>. The number of patients with migraine who self-treated with study medication was 142 (safety population), and 140 patients were evaluable for efficacy analysis: 68 in the ROX-828 group and 72 in the placebo group (ITT population). The majority of patients who used study medication completed the study (136/142, 96%).

<p>Demographics and migraine characteristics were similar in the two groups, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0333102412451359">Table 1</xref>. Median age was 40 (range 18–60) and with the exception of one patient in the placebo group, all patients were Caucasian. Patients had migraines for a mean of 20 years, with three to four headaches per month. Approximately three-quarters of patients in both treatment groups experienced migraine attacks without aura. Migraine attack characteristics before dosing with study medication were similar in the two groups, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0333102412451359">Table 1</xref>. The majority of patients reported the severity of the treated migraine attack to be of moderate intensity, and clinical disability was most frequently reported to be of moderate intensity. At least half of the patients in both groups reported nausea, photophobia and/or phonophobia. Patients self-treated with study medication within one hour of onset of moderate or severe pain.

The most commonly used (used by at least 4% of patients) types of rescue medication were similar in the two groups, and overall were triptans (62%), followed by anilides (14%), propionic acid derivatives (8%) and salicylic acid derivatives (4%).</p>

Patients in the ROX-828 group had numerically fewer migraine-related symptoms at all time points for all symptoms. Statistically significant differences between the ROX828 and placebo groups occurred at three hours and later for nausea and vomiting and four hours and later for photophobia.

<p>The results of this double-blind, placebo-controlled study indicate that intranasal ROX-828 (ketorolac tromethamine, SPRIX® containing 6% of lidocaine) is effective in the treatment of acute migraine. Although several studies have shown that intravenous ketorolac tromethamine is effective in reducing headache pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0333102412451359">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0333102412451359">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0333102412451359">17</xref>), this is the first study to assess the effect of intranasal ketorolac tromethamine on migraine pain. The onset of efficacy of intranasal ketorolac in treating acute migraine associated with moderate-to-severe headache pain was very rapid, and the differences in response rates between the ROX-828 and placebo groups at 1.5 hours were comparable to those observed in placebo-controlled trials with triptan therapy at two hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0333102412451359">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0333102412451359">19</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the primary variable, freedom from pain at two hours post-dosing, did not achieve statistical significance, substantially more ROX-828-treated patients achieved a pain-free status two hours post-dosing compared to the placebo group. In general, the times to freedom from pain and meaningful pain relief were shorter with ROX-828 than placebo treatment, beginning at one hour and persisting over 48 hours. Although the study was not powered to determine significance of secondary endpoints, confidence intervals for the differences in freedom from pain and pain relief between groups at the majority of time points did not include zero, consistent with the treatments being different. The 95% confidence intervals have not been corrected for multiplicity and should be viewed as descriptive, as all secondary variables were considered exploratory. Effective and realistic adjustments for multiplicity are based on the complete set of comparisons that were made. The complete set of comparisons was not defined prospectively, and thus any multiplicity correction at this time would be post hoc.</p>
<p>Subjects participating in this study had headache characteristics reflective of a typical population of migraineurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0333102412451359">20</xref>). Headaches were associated with moderate disability and associated symptoms of nausea/vomiting, photophobia and phonophobia. Symptoms other than headache pain contribute significantly to disability caused by acute migraine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0333102412451359">1</xref>). Both disability and health-related quality of life worsen with increasing migraine symptom severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0333102412451359">21</xref>). Significant improvements in the ROX-828 group versus placebo were seen in patients’ global impression of efficacy at two hours, in clinical disability beginning at 1.5 hours and throughout the study, and in migraine-associated symptoms, including nausea and vomiting beginning at three hours.</p>
<p>The use of rescue medication was allowed after two hours post-dosing, thus differences between the placebo and ROX-828 groups in improvements in related symptom data were more difficult to demonstrate, but results trended toward improvements in the ROX-828 group for most symptoms. The mean time for use of rescue medication in the placebo group was between three and four hours, and indeed, the proportion of patients with improvements in associated symptoms increased in the placebo group after three hours. However, there were consistent trends or significant differences in the ROX-828 group compared to placebo for the majority of time and endpoints even with rescue medication use in the placebo group. Patients in the ROX-828 group had significantly longer times to use of first rescue medication (mean 17 hours) after dosing compared to placebo (mean 3.8 hours).</p>
<p>Both ROX-828 and the placebo control contained lidocaine. Several studies have shown that lidocaine may provide relief in acute migraine attacks, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0333102412451359">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0333102412451359">24</xref>) although there are conflicting data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0333102412451359">25</xref>) and large, controlled studies are lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0333102412451359">26</xref>). While we cannot rule out that the presence of lidocaine had an effect on pain relief, the ROX-828 group showed consistently better efficacy that was significantly different from that of the placebo group.</p>
<p>ROX-828 treatment was well tolerated and most adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. The most common adverse event was transient nasal discomfort that was not associated with abnormalities of the anterior nares. Nasal discomfort is a frequently reported event with nasally administered medications from a variety of different classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0333102412451359">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0333102412451359">27</xref>). While migraine patients may be particularly sensitive to stimuli such as this, in previous studies of intranasal ketorolac tromethamine, mild nasal irritation was of short duration and was not associated with any changes in nasal mucosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0333102412451359">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0333102412451359">14</xref>). Nasal discomfort was observed in the ROX-828 group despite the presence of lidocaine. Hypoesthesias attributable to the presence of lidocaine occurred in both the ROX-828 and placebo groups, and intranasal and pharyngeal hypoesthesia occurred at a greater incidence in the placebo group.</p>
<p>Current acute treatments for migraine management include analgesics, including oral NSAIDs and migraine-specific abortive treatments such as oral and non-oral triptan formulations. New treatment options are still needed when oral medications and/or triptan therapy are not preferred or are contraindicated. Parenteral ketorolac is widely used to treat moderate-to-severe pain. Parenteral ketorolac is effective for treating migraine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0333102412451359">10</xref>), and is used as a first-line option for managing migraine in the emergency department (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0333102412451359">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0333102412451359">29</xref>), particularly for patients with allodynia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0333102412451359">16</xref>) or for whom triptans are not appropriate. A recent study showed that 50% of patients with migraine seen in the emergency department had contraindications that prevented them from receiving triptans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0333102412451359">29</xref>). Thus, an intranasal ketorolac tromethamine formulation may be useful in any setting when triptans fail or are not appropriate, and in emergency departments to avoid use of parenteral ketorolac.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0333102412451359" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This is the first study to assess a single dose of ROX-828 (the intranasal formulation of ketorolac tromethamine, SPRIX®, containing 6% of lidocaine) in reducing migraine pain. While statistical significance for the primary endpoint of freedom from pain at two hours was not reached, the data provide sufficient preliminary evidence that self-administration of intranasal ROX-828 can relieve migraine pain and these results warrant further investigation. Intranasal ROX-828 was well tolerated and nasal discomfort was the most common adverse event. Gastrointestinal tract absorption is often significantly delayed during the acute phase of a migraine attack, and nausea and vomiting can be prominent features of migraine attacks. ROX-828 avoids the gastrointestinal tract and has good bioavailability that may be advantageous in the acute management of migraine.</p>
