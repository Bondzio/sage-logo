Abstract
Evangelical `mega-churches'
are awakening to the importance of tackling poverty and social issues even
as they continue their focus on evangelism and church planting. As a result,
they are moving into carrying out their own development efforts globally,
emphasizing direct relationships with churches in the developing world. This
is changing their engagement with the `professional' evangelical development
organizations, leading the mega-churches to search and experiment with development
methods, approaches, and choice of issues, and bringing them up against questions
and challenges inherent in development work.

Rick
Warren, pastor of Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, California and author
of New York Times bestseller The Purpose Driven Life and complementary educa-
tional materials, is arguably the most prominent evangelical in the USA today.
Not only have his publications reached millions, Warren also hosted presidential
candidates John McCain and Barack Obama at the Saddleback Civil Forum, the
first and only joint campaign event prior to their parties' respective conventions
(Perkes, 2008). And, most recently, he was tapped by Barack Obama to deliver
the invocation at the president-elect's inauguration.
105
But
Warren is concerned with far more than church growth and American politics,
as witnessed by Saddleback's ambitious plan to `promote reconcili- ation,
equip leaders, assist the poor, care for the sick, and educate the next generation'
(P.E.A.C.E, n.d.).1 This P.E.A.C.E Plan, launched in 2005, aims to address
the world's most significant spiritual and social problems through local churches.
Warren and Saddleback's P.E.A.C.E. Plan is a prime example of the growing
phenomenon of evangelical `mega-churches' carrying out their own development
efforts globally. In the past, the bulk of evangelical international development
efforts have been the terrain of Christian development organizations, also
known as non-governmental organizations (NGOs). While NGOs have had close
rela- tionships with churches, the mega-church approach to development emphasizes
long-term relationships between churches themselves, in which church members
engage in hands-on ministry as opposed to funding the more `professional'
devel- opment organizations. This article is a brief description and analysis
of this growing trend in the evan- gelical reawakening to the social mandate
of the gospel. The primary purpose of this article, a modest one, is to point
to the importance of this movement its impli- cations, and areas for future
research. It begins with a review of the possible sourc- es and roots of this
trend, examines three cases of mega-churches involved in this process and
considers the potential promises, tensions and difficulties that await this
movement. Finally, this article points to areas for future research into how
the mega-church development movement might be most effective as mega-churches
utilize new means and methods to create church-based development models. Roots
and Sources of Mega-Church Engagement in Development The increasing involvement
of evangelical mega-churches in development is the result of a variety of
recent and historical trends. Foremost among the recent trends are (1) the
emergence of mega-churches, (2) the shifting paradigm of Christian missions,
including an increasing awareness and buy-in by the evangeli- cal community
into the importance of a Scripturally mandated `holistic' approach to engagement
with society that goes beyond just evangelism and the explosion of congregationally-based
short-term missions trips, and (3) the rise of evangelical international development
organizations and the contributions to the evangelical `reawakening' to social
issues by specific leaders in the evangelical movement. While it is beyond
the scope of this article to review any of these trends in depth, a quick
look at how they have fed into each other is in order. The first is the dramatic
rise of the international mega-church movement. Scott Thumma of the Hartford
Institute for Religion Research generally defines a mega-church as a `Protestant
congregation with a sustained average weekly attendance of 2000 persons or
more in its worship services'. While large churches are not a new phe- nomenon,
`some researchers suggest that this church form is a unique collective response
to distinctive cultural shifts and changes in societal patterns throughout
the industrialized, urban and suburban areas of the world' (Thumma, n.d.).
In fact, the rapid growth and proliferation of mega-churches internationally,
and their common characteristics and the networks of affiliation they form,
suggest that the world is witnessing a mega-church movement. Mega-churches
are changing the global makeup of Christianity to the extent that some scholars
are characterizing them as the harbingers of `The Next
106
Christendom'
and the `African Century of Christianity'. Asia has the larg- est known mega-church
in the world, the Yoido Full Gospel Church (YFGC) in South Korea, and many
other mega-churches have sprung up in China, Malaysia, India, Indonesia and
Singapore. The Asian mega-church movement is largely Pentecostal, growing
mainly in secularized and urbanized societies that allow reli- gious freedom.
However, it is from Africa and Latin America that mega-churches are now driving
the global mega-church movement in growth, enthusiasm and cash flow. In these
regions, mega-churches are growing twice as fast as Catholic and Anglican
congregations, and as in Asia they are largely Pentecostal (Gifford, 2004).
Mega-churches have also changed the face of the North American church since
the 1980s. Spanning a vast array of styles and ministry approaches, there
are currently over 1300 mega-churches in the USA alone. These mega- churches
tend to share common characteristics, including a conservative theol- ogy,
a high-profile senior pastor, and a variety of ministries for their members
(Thumma, n.d.). The rise of mega-churches has taken place in, and been influenced
by, the con- text of a major shift in mission paradigms in the modern era.
First, perhaps more than anything else, changes in the demographics of the
Church have reshaped Christian missions, especially in the shift of the center
of Christianity from Europe and North America to the global south.2 Today,
more than half of all Christians live in the developing world and nearly 70
percent of evangelicals live in the non- western world. Recent years have
seen, further, a dramatic increase of indepen- dent, nondenominational Christians
from 9 to 19 percent, most in the global south (Myers, 2003: 54). These Christians
of the global south, including the mega-church movement, are changing the
face of Christianity with local insights and interpre- tations, sending missionaries
abroad themselves and challenging Christians of the world to reconsider old
paradigms. Second, as a result, in the modern mission era, mission thinking
and para- digms have evolved from an emphasis on the Church as a civilizing
or western- izing agent to the Church as `pilgrim community' (Myers, 2003).
Specifically, missiology has begun to disciple the nationals for spiritual
and social trans- formation. Recognizing the centrality of holism, emerging
mission paradigms focus on transforming all of life for all of the people
of God (Bosch, 1991). This emphasis on holism has crept up among missionaries,
their sending agencies and, as a result, on the churches and mega-churches.
While evangelical mis- sionaries have continued to raise their support through
churches and to be sent through a host of different mission sending agencies,
they also have begun to gravitate more towards seeing the importance of understanding
local cultures and customs as well as the situation of poverty and how that
affects people's spiritual condition and their receptivity to the gospel message.
This movement, or reawakening to the social mandate of the gospel, has also
happened apace in the sending agencies themselves. Finally, in addition to
being affected by the shift in demographics and the rethinking of missions
along holistic lines, mission paradigms have also been reshaped by the tremendous
growth in international short-term mission trips by youth and adults from
evangelical churches all over the USA. This movement has fed into the openness
towards holism in missions, sparking an interest and passion for working on
issues of poverty and social change in churches large and small, and mega-churches
have not been exempt from this impact.3
107
While
the involvement of mega-churches in development can be explained by their
growth as a movement in the context of a shift in mission paradigms, espe-
cially the trend towards seeing the social aspects of the gospel as part and
parcel of missions, the analysis would not be complete without pointing to
the impact made in this process by two other variables. The first is the significant
history and track record of evangelical development organizations such as
Compassion International, Samaritan's Purse, Tearfund, World Relief, and World
Vision, and their tie-in with the churches and mega-churches through a variety
of channels. The second is the `against the grain work' on social issues carried
out by leading evangelical figures such as Tony Campolo, Rene Padilla and
Ron Sider as far back as the 1970s, joined more recently by young leaders
such as Shane Claiborne, that set forth the Scriptural and theological framework
for such a framework in a variety of settings, including in documents such
the `Chicago Declaration of Evangelical Social Concern' in 1973 and the `Lausanne
Covenant' a year later. In particular, the Lausanne Covenant, signed by a
host of evangelical entities, affirmed the importance of a holistic or `integral'
approach to Christian mission. With respect to `Christian Social Responsibility',
it stated: We affirm that God is both the Creator and the Judge of all men.
We there- fore should share his concern for justice and reconciliation throughout
human society and for the liberation of men and women from every kind of oppression.
Because men and women are made in the image of God, every person, regardless
of race, religion, colour, culture, class, sex or age, has an intrinsic dignity
because of which he or she should be respected and served, not exploited.
Here too we express penitence both for our neglect and for having sometimes
regarded evangelism and social concern as mutually exclusive. Although reconciliation
with other people is not rec- onciliation with God, nor is social action evangelism,
nor is political libera- tion salvation, nevertheless we affirm that evangelism
and socio-political involvement are both part of our Christian duty. For both
are necessary expressions of our doctrines of God and man, our love for our
neighbour and our obedience to Jesus Christ. The message of salvation implies
also a message of judgment upon every form of alienation, oppression and discrimination,
and we should not be afraid to denounce evil and injustice wherever they exist.
When people receive Christ they are born again into his kingdom and must seek
not only to exhibit but also to spread its righ- teousness in the midst of
an unrighteous world. The salvation we claim should be transforming us in
the totality of our personal and social respon- sibilities. Faith without
works is dead. (The Lausanne Covenant, 1974) While this theological groundwork
was extremely important, and has gained purchase over time among more and
more evangelicals, the relationships between evangelical development organizations
and the evangelical churches in this context have been more complicated. The
case of World Vision, for example, is instructive. World Vision was started
by Bob Pierce in order to respond to the suffering of children after the Korean
War. Prior to founding World Vision, Pierce traveled to needy communities
and brought compelling video footage back to churches in the USA, where he
would appeal for donations. He would then send the money to missionaries or
mission organizations working in these commu- nities. The first child sponsorship
program began in Korea in 1953, and later
108
expanded
across Asia and throughout Latin America, Africa, Eastern Europe and the Middle
East (World Vision, n.d.). As World Vision (WV) continued to expand, it decided
that stronger ties with foundations and private donors were needed if WV was
going to be able to advance as a leader in the relief and development sector.
This decision came about as a result of the realization that with rapid turnover
of pastors in churches, many partnership efforts with churches ended abruptly,
as new pastors often did not share the sense of global mission or concern
for the poor. According to Steve Haas, WV's Vice President of Church Relations,
`As a busi- ness decision, it was brilliant … We probably tripled in
size in that time period. But about eight or nine years ago there was a real
concerted look at what our mission was, and … [we realized] that if
we were in fact going to maintain our Christian identity, one of the clearest
ways to do that was to maintain a much more aggressive partnership with the
church'.4 As Haas emphasized, `We were growing relationships with the church,
not only in terms of partnering with what we were doing internationally, but
as a resource agent so they could realize a world vision'. More than a brand,
according to Haas, the term signifies `a global understanding of what God
is doing in the world'. The effort seems to be paying off; WV's partnerships
with churches have grown dramatically, and Haas expects this trend to continue.
Churches of all sizes are actively involved in WV's various programs, such
as child sponsorships and the 30 Hour Famine (The 30 Hour Famine, n.d.), but
most partnerships tend to be in conjunction with mega-churches. Larger churches
have greater resources, a more developed international ministry strategy,
and often even have a better understanding of the ways in which their members
are gifted – all of which lend themselves well to large-scale partnerships.
As Haas explains, `These are all wonderful ingredients for us ... We can meet
a variety of skill sets or experi- ences because we're also a much larger
organization'. Therefore, while child spon- sors come from a variety of places,
WV's work has benefited extensively from the proliferation of mega-churches
and from their increasing interest in social issues. In fact, according to
studies by the Hartford Institute of Religion Research, mega-churches are
showing increased interest in a more holistic approach to ministry, with noticeable
shifts during the past decade alone. For instance, more than half of all mega-churches
are now making efforts to focus on community outreach and social justice (Thumma
and Bird, 2008). While these findings are largely reflective of local outreach,
mega-churches are increasingly implementing similar strategies internationally.
What, then, explains the trend of Saddleback and other mega-churches choos-
ing to bypass existing Christian development organizations, instead preferring
to operate in a more direct, church-based manner, often in partnership with
local churches in poor areas and with non-western organizations? There are,
in short, three main reasons. The first is their lingering suspicion of evangelical
develop- ment organizations and their commitment to evangelism. As with other
churches in the evangelical movement, mega-churches are still cautious about
becoming involved in what up until recently were viewed as activities that
were the domain of theologically liberal groups and carried with them the
pejorative connotation of `social gospel' endeavors: the emphasis on taking
care of the poor at the expense of preaching the message of salvation. And,
in many evangelical quarters, WV and other evangelical development organizations
have come under suspicion along those lines. According to Haas, in fact, this
tension can be seen when some
109
mega-church
pastors express concern about WV's approach to development, saying, `I'm not
hearing enough Jesus'. The second reason is the belief by leaders of the mega-churches
that they can do development work better and more efficiently than the development
organi- zations, and that by working on their own they give their own members
more opportunities to be directly involved in these efforts. Haas himself,
in his former capacity as Extension Coordinator at Willow Creek, held the
point of view that after learning how to do development through a partnership
with an NGO, the church could engage in development work more efficiently
on its own. And, along with this, there is a shift away from a traditional
`pay, pray, and get out of the way' approach to international ministry by
the mega-churches. Church members, many of whom have now embraced a theological
understanding of biblical holism and who have been taught that they are uniquely
gifted for a particular purpose, are seeking opportunities to get more directly
involved in development work. In summary, the trend of mega-church involvement
in development can be explained by the rise and increasing force of the mega-church
movement in the context of a shifting paradigm of mission that is part and
parcel of the evangelical reawakening to its social responsibilities. What
stands out about this trend is the complex relationship the mega-churches
have with the evangelical development organizations as they seek to make their
way into this field of holistic mission, and a brief look at the case studies
of three mega-churches in the USA will help give greater insights into the
dynamics of these relationships and efforts and what the future might hold.
Mega-Church Case Studies The three mega-churches that will be examined as
case studies of mega-church involvement in development are Calvary Church
in Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Emmanuel Faith Community Church, in Escondido,
California; and Willow Creek Community Church, in South Barrington, Illinois.
These three churches were chosen to represent three different areas of the
USA, and interviews were conducted with officers of each. Additional material
and information was pulled off their websites. Calvary Church, Lancaster,
PA From its inception at a missions' conference in the 1930s, Calvary Church
has prioritized sending its own members as cross-cultural missionaries. In
the words of founding pastor Frank C. Torrey, `Missions is a matter of life
and death for the local church. The missionary enterprise is well defined
in Scripture. It is the love of God in action. It is the stewardship of life,
gospel, prayer and money. It is preaching and teaching. It is Christ Himself'
(Rohrer, n.d.) Rooted in this conviction, Calvary Church (CC) currently supports
over 120 full-time missionaries serving in a variety of roles in the USA and
throughout the world. `The church has tried to create a kind of missionary
environment where people could go overseas', says Missions Pastor Steve Beirn.
`From the very begin- ning, part of that has been a good incarnational ministry
model'.5 Historically, CC has made a strong distinction between `missions'
and `devel- opment' for fear that the latter would entail `a social gospel
approach to ministry' that focused on good works alone, to the neglect of
verbal proclamation. In recent years, however, the church has begun to realize
its `inherent weakness in terms of understanding or even implementing holistic
or transformational ministry'. With
110
this
in mind, Beirn and two other leaders in the church plan to take a distance-
learning course to get a better understanding of what a more holistic ministry
might look like for CC. This shift in ministry understanding, albeit gradual,
is already beginning to emerge in a variety of ways. In 2006, for instance,
the church entered into a multi- year partnership in Cambodia with World Relief,
a major evangelical develop- ment organization, along with five other churches
around the USA. This initiative represented a new ministry approach for the
church, but momentum has been building as more and more members have had the
opportunity to visit Cambodia for themselves, whether teaching English to
Cambodian staff members or leading a leadership retreat for the staff and
their families. Those who visit Cambodia then have the opportunity to report
back on what they experienced, which, according to Beirn, `continues to add
legitimacy to the development side of ministry for us'. Seeing the cell church
movement that grew out of practical ministry in poor Cambodian communities
helped CC overcome `traditional hang-ups' and provid- ed `real assurance that
if we attempt to speak into the ends and see things as min- istry platforms,
then it really is all legitimate, sound, Christ-honoring ministry'. In addition
to the Cambodia partnership, the church is exploring new ave- nues for ministry.
One new initiative is in conjunction with a western organiza- tion with strong
local church ties in the Quito, Ecuador area, working especially with the
residents of the garbage dump. At the same time, CC is beginning to partner
with an Indian mission organization to provide indigenous training to 40 pastors
who will then seek to plant churches in the Kolkata area. This will represent
the church's first partnership with a non-western organization, and is being
approached as a learning experience and pilot project, expecting it to be
a mutually beneficial relationship followed by similar partnerships with other
non- western organizations. CC will continue to send missionaries through
traditional mission agencies, but even these organizations have taken a more
holistic turn, a process charac- terized by Beirn as one of `maturation'.
Some of CC's preferred organizations, working in parts of Africa, for example,
have begun ministries to orphans, the hungry, and those with HIV/AIDS. `These
organizations we're working with are going through this evolution of change
like we are', Beirn says, `and because they are heading in the same direction
organizationally, because their vision for ministry is the same as [ours],
and because they have good field supervision of missionaries and member care
track records, we want to work with these orga- nizations and [they] are going
to become strong alliances in ministry for us in the days ahead'. Beirn makes
clear that the ministry of development will not be replacing evan- gelistic
or church-planting efforts for the church: `What we're really striving to
do is to get a better integration between faith and service, between body
and soul ministries … [W]hether it's development or traditional church
planting, we're really trying to view all of these things as viable ministry
platforms. We see them as a means to end and not an end in themselves'. As
the church explores ways to be involved in development, it also seeks to focus
its missionary efforts in the so-called `least reached' parts of the world.
Beirn believes these two shifts will coincide. `In some of these areas of
the world, [devel- opment] is a very appropriate first response to establishing
a credible witness … '. `The gospel can then be shared and the church
can eventually be established where the gospel is shared. So I'm not saying
the distinction between the two has been
111
completely
broken down … [but] in the last five years the church has made some
pretty significant strides'. Ultimately, Beirn hopes that CC's mission and
development efforts will become sustainable over the long term, and much more
focused on local churches, with the desire that these non-western churches
might become `more holistic than we are'. Emmanuel Faith Community Church,
Escondido, CA Like Calvary Church, Emmanuel Faith Community Church (EFCC)
is roughly 70-years old and has historically been a missionary sending church
as well. Today the church has over 100 missionaries serving in a variety of
ways in over 20 coun- tries, and although these missionaries serve throughout
the world, the church has recently tried to focus its international ministry
in areas that have less access to the gospel. `We try to do more sending into
the Middle East, North Africa, Central Asia – broadly speaking, into
the 10–40 Window if we can – but we do not limit ourselves to
that', says Outreach Ministries Pastor Dave Hall.6 One shift in the church's
cross-cultural ministry focus is its increasing desire to partner directly
with local churches. `We are probably still on an upward learn- ing curve
on how to more effectively partner with the emerging church around the world',
Hall says. `How do we bring resources and partner with them? We're doing that
in some cases, and we're also providing some financial support for missionaries
being sent out from other countries'. For example, EFCC supports some Arab
workers through a partnership with these workers' home church in North Africa,
though Hall acknowledges there is still a lot yet to learn about how to do
these sorts of partnerships. He hopes that in the future EFCC will be able
to partner with more and more local churches around the world. EFCC is also
seeking to do more in terms of holistic ministry. In addition to evangelism,
church planting, and leadership development, Hall indicates a desire to do
a better job in community development, which he considers one aspect of missions
rather than a distinct new undertaking. `As a church we have histori- cally
tended to emphasize more of the proclamation, preaching, evangelism, and discipling
of people as mission', he says, indicating that the church has `not gotten
intentionally all that much involved in things like healthcare, agriculture,
[and] human trafficking'. This has been due in part to the fact that like
many evangelical churches, EFCC has at times tended to view such efforts,
in the words of Hall, as `unrelated to the gospel'. Beliefs and opinions may
vary from one generation to the next but, Hall says, `We are trying to fight
through [the distinction between physical and spiri- tual] both locally and
globally and seeing that the two were never really intended to be disengaged
from one another … [W]e're trying to bring them back together, as one
informs and relates to the other'. Doing so, Hall believes, is part of `trying
to bring God's rule, reign, and authority over all of life, and to reclaim
what has been corrupted by sin and the evil one'. However, Hall makes clear
that `we're not just interested in creating well-fed, healthy individuals
who are comfortable on the way to an eternity apart from God, either … We're trying to go in as whole people, letting people know we're doing these
things because we're followers of Jesus Christ and that our hope is only to
be found in him, and tell them about it'. Hall has hope that these various
aspects of EFCC's changing focus will con- verge in the near future in Senegal.
The church plans to send a full-time missionary couple to the West African
country, where they will be serving in partnership with
112
local
churches under Senegalese leadership. They will also be engaged in holistic
community development ministries, addressing needs such as clean water, health
care, and agriculture. This five-year initiative represents a new type of
ministry for EFCC, with the focus on transforming one particular community
rather than sup- porting missionaries in disparate parts of the world indefinitely.
While the size of EFCC and its history in international ministry have made
this sort of partnership possible, Hall also says that since a church of its
size does not change its way of thinking lightly, this is a very significant
step. While not to the same extent as this partnership with churches in Senegal,
EFCC has also looked to Christian development organizations on a project basis.
For instance, after Cyclone Nargis devastated Myanmar, the church chose to
part- ner with WV in an effort to relieve some of the suffering of the Burmese
people. Hall says that the church is also discussing the possibility of entering
into a more long-term partnership with World Relief. EFCC has no desire to
abandon its focus on sending its own missionaries in more traditional ways,
however. EFCC continues to look to traditional mission organizations to provide
supervision and oversight for the missionaries the church sends around the
world. And while the extent of relationships between mission organizations
and sending churches may vary, Hall desires to foster active communication
and active involvement in the missionary-sending process, which he believes
is indicative of a healthy partnership. Willow Creek Community Church, South
Barrington, IL One of the most prominent mega-churches in the USA, Willow
Creek Community Church emerged in the 1970s out of a dynamic youth ministry
in the Chicago area. Seeing the impact that services featuring contemporary
music, drama and applicable teaching were having in the lives of teenagers,
a group of leaders – including a young Bill Hybels, currently Senior
Pastor – decided to start a similar church for adults (Willow Creek
Community Church, n.d.[a]). In addition to over 100 ministries and an average
weekly attendance of 23,500,7 the church has formed the Willow Creek Association,
a network of more than 12,000 churches spanning 90 denominations in 45 countries.
`These churches, and others we serve, represent a wide variety of sizes, denominations,
and back- grounds, and are ministering in literally every corner of the world'.
Clearly, Willow Creek's influence is substantial not just among North American
mega- churches, but throughout the world as well, in churches of all shapes
and sizes. `There is nothing like the local church when the local church is
working right', says Hybels. `The local church has been entrusted with carrying
the life-changing message of Jesus Christ, and it's the only hope I see for
this hurting and broken world. There's nothing else like it' (Willow Creek
Community Church, n.d.[b]). It should come as no surprise, then, that Willow
Creek's international ministry efforts have a decidedly local church focus.
Warren Beach,8 Director of Global Connections, emphasizes that local churches – when working biblically – will address both material and spiritual
needs. `Evangelism and community develop- ment', says Beach, `are two sides
of the same coin'. This belief is captured in the Global Connections mission
statement: `The mis- sion of our global connections ministry is to fight global
poverty and HIV/AIDS through serving and partnering with churches in the developing
world who are passionately committed to the holistic transformation of their
communities' (Willow Creek Community Church, n.d.[c]).
113
Willow
Creek (WC) focuses its international ministry in Africa and Latin America,
working at times in conjunction with missionary and development organizations,
but more often through partnerships with local churches in these locations.
Beach says that in looking for `transformational' churches or networks of
churches with which to partner, WC tries `to go as listeners and learners,
to see what the church has determined to be their calling … and to
be a part of that transformational pro- cess [by coming] alongside them and
see how we can play a role'. According to Beach, `the bulk of our resourcing
and energy is to help [local churches] serve the poor and marginalized in
their community materially' in areas such as income generation, job training,
education, and care for those affected by HIV/AIDS. When seeking out partnerships,
however, WC looks for churches whose practices include `orally proclaiming
the gospel as well as discipling their flock … while not neglecting
the material realm'. WC began its work in Latin America by putting a staff
in place in the Dominican Republic, which Beach describes as WC's first `serious
global initiative'. These staff members, having been equipped with theological
training, served as `scouts' in search of churches that shared WC's vision
for embracing both the physical and the spiritual components of the gospel.
In time, they established a network of churches throughout Latin America that
were committed to holistic ministry. In Africa, WC did not feel it had the
luxury of taking years to develop a church network from scratch, and through
a South African church affiliate from the Willow Creek Association, it discovered
that a network of hundreds of local churches was already in place. WC then
specifically sought out partnerships with black-led churches in the townships
of South Africa that were on the frontlines of combating the AIDS crisis in
their communities. WC's work has since expanded to other countries throughout
Africa, and includes efforts in conjunction with development organizations
in addition to local churches. For example, WC partners with Bright Hope,
an American orga- nization working specifically in communities whose residents
live on less than a dollar per day, and RISE International, which works in
Angola to develop com- munities through education. Due to WC's global influence
and fame, one can only postulate that many other churches will take note of
WC's efforts. In all of these initiatives, however, Beach is forthcoming with
the fact that mistakes will be made along the way. `A humble spirit and the
willingness to learn from our mistakes is extremely necessary in this game',
he says, `because everyone will make them, and hopefully, grow from them'.
Conclusions Despite the relatively recent emergence of the mega-church phenomenon
and the rapid changes taking place within the movement, all indicators are
that mega- churches will remain a substantial part of American evangelicalism
for the foreseeable future. As can be seen from these case studies, mega-churches,
as the world of evan- gelical churches as a whole, are awakening to the importance
of tackling poverty and social issues even as they continue their focus on
evangelism and church planning. As they begin to act on their newfound conviction,
mega-churches are choos- ing their way carefully and their partnerships deliberately.
While they are forging ahead slowly with their own programs and staff on the
ground that emphasize direct relationships with churches in the developing
world, they continue, in large part, to support a large number of missionaries
through missionary agencies who are also caught up in the evolution towards
a more holistic ministry. This does not
114
mean,
however, that they are completely casting aside relationships with evan- gelical
development organizations: in fact, it appears that in some cases they are
strengthening their ties with organizations like WV and World Relief who they
used to regard with substantial suspicion. On the other side, evangelical
development organizations are taking steps to shore up their relationships
with the mega-churches and overcome the lingering doubts from the past. WV,
for example, every quarter takes 10 to 20 pastors of US mega- churches to
Africa to see WV's work first-hand. During the orientation to these trips,
according to Haas, it is not uncommon for these pastors to express that they
are `really looking forward to winning some folks to Christ'. But once these
pastors get out to visit actual villages, they find that many of the community
members are already Christians and come to realize that `the way in which
the gospel is imparted is so much more deep and broad and meaningful than
I thought'. The Christian beliefs of the villagers, according to Haas, are
the result of villagers getting to know the Christian development workers
and learning about the gospel through these relationships. `They're seeing
that lived out holistically, incarnationally', says Haas. `You know, [it's]
Jesus with skin for 15–18 years. A lot of heads get turned by that'.
In summary, as Haas explains, the evangelical development organizations are
seeking to shore up their relationship with the mega-churches: `You're going
to see a greater movement among the larger organizations like ours in finding
ways to utilize the gifts and skills of those in the local church … I do believe that partnership is the name of the game and what we're trying
to do is positioning ourselves to be the best possible partners we can be'.
The case studies also show that as the mega-churches move more into develop-
ment, they are searching and experimenting with methods and approaches and
the choice of issues they take on in the vast spectrum of development and
social change activities. Community development activities and assistance
to the more vulnerable sectors of the population, such as orphans, appear
to predominate, although leaders of the mega-churches express a vision for
becoming involved in more. In looking to the future, for example, Steve Beirn
of Calvary Church referred specifically to the possibility of becoming involved
in disaster relief, HIV/AIDS ministry, human trafficking, and micro-finance
banking. However, in considering the various issues, methods, and approaches
being con- sidered, both Beirn and Dave Hall from Emmanuel Faith Community
Church gave special mention to the `business as mission' movement and the
importance of incor- porating that approach into their ministries. In their
estimation, business as mission would address the challenge of doing mission
work in certain `closed' countries, a challenge that they saw as becoming
more and more difficult. It also would help address the increasing challenge
of funding missions endeavors by helping to par- tially or totally sustain
the missionaries financially through their employment in various locations
throughout the world, and especially in least reached areas, a need that is
becoming more acute because of the dwindling older generation on whose support
the missionaries have depended. Finally, as Beirn stated, the busi- ness as
mission movement will provide unique opportunities for Christians to serve
throughout the world, and represents one of the many factors that are `going
to break down the very neat and sanitized and traditional ways we've looked
at ministry and really force people to look at things differently'. As the
mega-churches become more and more involved and committed to development work
as part of their ministry, the questions and challenges they will face in
this endeavor will be the same as those faced by all of those who have
115
significant
experience in development work. To cite just a few, how do you go about best
establishing relationships and partnerships with those with whom you are working
at the local, national, and international level, whether they be churches
or other actors? To what extent do you collaborate with other actors in development,
even if they do not share your same principles and beliefs? How do you avoid
falling into the temptation of assuming an attitude of superiority and falling
prey to blind spots in terms of assumptions about the people with whom you
are working? What kinds of techniques, methods, and approaches do you use
in this kind of work to give you the best results, ranging from issues of
planning, to management, to evaluation, to fundraising? And, finally, what
do you do when you come up against the fact that development has inherent
political overtones that will require, in one way or another, dealing with
local powers and govern- ment authorities, many times in a way that is not
to their liking? There are signs that the mega-churches are beginning to consider
these questions, seeking the advice and expertise of development organizations,
academics, and others with experience in this field, and are hiring people
with training and skills in development work. In short, it appears that they
are in the process of building up their capacities in this area, much like
other organizations have done before them, and much like their counterparts
in the developing world are doing as well. Once again, Haas from World Vision
sheds some light on this process: `There's a number of [mega-churches] that
I can think of right off hand that I think have jumped right into the development
game, only to find out, okay, which end is up?'. According to Haas, mega-churches
are learning to identify and mobilize key leaders in com- munities and to
work in partnership with churches of all varieties, not as those with all
the answers but as learners. Many, according to Haas, realize once they have
begun doing development work that it is much more complicated and difficult
than it appears, and they will need to learn from those who have made mistakes
in the past. Mistakes, Haas says, are inevitable in development. The question,
he says, is whether churches that have made mistakes will return: `In other
words, once burned, will they give up and go back to just local ventures and
kind of squeeze out a couple of bills [for international development]? Or,
will those groups say, “You know, I really learned a valuable lesson,
and I'll either walk with somebody who's already been there doing it, or I'll
retrench my efforts and get a little training”'. Finally, Haas believes
that what we see unfolding today is ultimately the result of prayer. `I would
say, in terms of the grand experiment of megachurches and mission organizations
like ours, the beauty is that we've been praying for years. I'm standing on
the shoulders of spiritual giants who were praying a lot longer than I have
been about the church awakening to issues of the poor … And out of
them, many of the top leaders are waking up. The question is, are they doing
it just like us, are they doing it with us? In some cases yes, in some cases
no. Is that a good thing? Well, that depends on how you look at it. You know,
we prayed, and they are doing it. God's awakening the body … I can't
say it's widespread but it's certainly moving in a positive direction'. Directions
for Future Research This article has been a preliminary attempt to articulate
the present move of the mega-church movement into the field of development
and missions. Considerable research remains be done to ascertain more fully
the nature and scope of mega- church involvement in development, to learn
from the possible innovations they are coming up with as they engage in this
process, and to help the mega-church
116
movement
learn from past experiences and challenges faced by those who have spent much
time working in development. For example, the international ministry efforts
of churches such as Saddleback and Willow Creek are nationally and even internationally
known. However, it is not clear to what extent their ministries reflect those
of the majority of mega-churches. Are other mega-churches more, equally, or
less committed to holistic ministry and engaged in development throughout
the world? Are there examples of mega- churches even more innovative than
the aforementioned well-known examples? In the same way, Calvary Church and
Emmanuel Faith Community Church, though they have separate histories and are
located on opposite sides of the country, seem to have similarities that might
not be common to the majority of mega-churches. Namely, both churches describe
a focus on sending missionaries as central to their minis- try. How much of
this has to do with the fact that both churches are approximately 70-years
old, whereas the majority of mega-churches have much shorter histories? While
the three churches examined are fairly representative of the mega-church movement
in suburban locations, there are a considerable number of other mega- churches
with varying demographics. For instance, do African-American mega- churches
look and function in unique and distinctive ways when it comes to international
ministry? Do charismatic or fundamentalist churches show greater or lesser
commitment to development work? Are mega-churches that are affili- ated with
denominations more or less likely to engage in development? Which denominations
are the most likely to be involved? Does `prosperity gospel' teach- ing – which is common in some mega-churches – lead to greater or lesser empha-
sis on development? Are mega-churches in one region of the USA more likely
than churches in other regions to be actively engaged in international holistic
ministry, or churches in urban settings as compared with the suburbs? While
we have only examined churches in the USA, as noted in the first part of this
article there are rapidly growing mega-churches throughout the world. How
do the international ministries of mega-churches in Latin America, Africa,
and Asia compare to their western counterparts? What similarities and differences
exist in mega-churches in different regions of the world? Do non-western mega-
churches, on the whole, work directly in development or do they seek to partner
with development organizations? Finally, as the center of gravity in the church
continues to shift from North and West to South and East, what impact will
this have on traditionally northern Christian development organizations? In
the end, future research pursuing these and other questions needs to be focused
on helping these churches, and the evangelical movement as a whole, to be
effectively obedient to the full mandate of the gospel. It is tremendously
encour- aging that the leaders of the evangelical churches are stepping up
and becoming involved in holistic ministry, focusing on their relationships
with churches in the developing world, and encouraging their congregations
to do the same. There is no doubt that the church is the place where holistic
discipling should occur, both in the developed and the developing world, and
one of the weaknesses of the evangelical development organizations has been
that many times they have shied away from establishing strong and healthy
relationships with the churches in the developing world. If the mega-churches,
the local churches, and the development organizations can forge healthy partnerships
between themselves, using their respective gifts and talents to nurture and
encourage each other and bathing their relationships them in prayer, God is
sure to use this movement in great ways to bring people to Him and to minister
to their needs.
