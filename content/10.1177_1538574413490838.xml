<abstract>
<p>Mycotic pseudoaneurysms are relatively infrequent entities, and the best means of management of them remain to be elucidated due to their small number and medical complexities surrounding them. We present here an interesting case of a mycotic pseudoaneurysm of the superficial femoral artery along with our management of the case and a brief review of the available literature. The particular presentation of this patient will hopefully reinforce the use of prolonged antibiotic therapy for mycotic disease and judicious reexamination of patients whose clinical picture does not immediately fit the framework of our most common diagnoses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Although treatment of aneurysmal disease has become relatively routine in the modern surgical world, treatment of mycotic aneurysms remains a challenging problem. Fortunately, mycotic aneurismal disease is relatively much more rare than nonmycotic disease,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574413490838">1</xref>
</sup> but given the association between mycotic disease and arterial trauma along with increasing rates of endovascular procedures and the ever present degree of intravenous (IV) drug abuse, we are likely to deal with this problem more in the future. We present here a case of mycotic superficial femoral artery (SFA) and popliteal pseudoaneurysms with associated popliteal occlusion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1538574413490838">
<title>Case Presentation</title>
<p>The patient is a 25-year-old female with a history of coarctation of the aorta repaired at age 9 with polytetrafluoroethylene interposition graft and subsequent aortic stenting at age 16 who presented to an outside hospital with complaints of chest pain radiating to her back as well as left lower extremity pain and paresthesia for about 1 month prior to the presentation, roughly correlating with the time when she stopped taking her daily Aspirin and Plavix. Of note, patient’s history also includes IV drug abuse since 2008 leading to endocarditis requiring mitral valve repair in 2009 as well as left femoral artery stenting for unknown reasons in September 2011, 1 month prior to the presentation. Computed tomography imaging at the outside hospital demonstrated “interval progression of soft tissue fullness surrounding the descending thoracic aorta with extravasation of contrast beyond the confines of the intravascular stents, concerning for pseudoaneurysm, possibly mycotic, given patient’s history” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574413490838">Figure 1A</xref>). Further, ultrasound at the time of admission demonstrated decreased ankle-brachial index (ABI) and toe pressures bilaterally (0.79/81 mm Hg right and 0.46/38 mm Hg left), with abrupt velocity decrease on the left in the region of distal SFA suggestive of upstream stenosis or occlusion of the popliteal or superficial femoral arteries not visualized on ultrasound. Given multiphasic pedal signals, lack of signs of extremity ischemia, presence of aortic disease deemed more pressing and fungemia, it was determined to delay vascular intervention until after resolution of fungemia and aortic pathology.</p>

<p>Patient was medically optimized including antibiotic treatment for <italic>Candida albicans</italic> fungemia, and when repeat imaging 10 days after admission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574413490838">Figure 1B</xref>) showed interval increase in pseudoaneurysm with possible extravasation operative intervention was undertaken before optimal resolution of fungemia. The cardiothoracic surgical team excised the stents and old graft material and resected native aorta back to grossly clean margins before reconstruction with a GORE-TEX graft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574413490838">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>Repeat ultrasound 9 days after aortic repair demonstrated a left groin hematoma attributable to groin dissection during aortic repair and no signs of pseudoaneurysm. As patient stabilized postoperatively, she was taken for diagnostic angiogram (postoperatively day 15, hospital day 25), which demonstrated a pseudoaneurysm at the distal extent of the left SFA stent and pseudoaneurysm and occlusion of the distal popliteal artery with reconstitution of the peroneal and posterior tibial arteries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574413490838">Figure 2</xref>). Operative intervention was thus planned and on hospital day 31; she was taken to operating room for repair. Significant inflammatory reaction was visualized around the SFA stent, and it was fully excised along with SFA pseudoaneurysm and repaired with end-to-end anastamosis using approximately 15 cm of reversed saphenous vein from the common femoral artery to the SFA. Additionally, the below-knee popliteal artery pseudoaneurysm and occlusion were resected. Reversed saphenous vein was used to reconstruct the vessels with end-to-end anastomosis to the popliteal artery and end-to-side to the posterior tibial artery. Follow-up ultrasound revealed improved ABI of 0.73 and toe pressure of 87 mm Hg on the left.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Repair of mycotic disease is a perpetual challenge, as using new graft material to reconstruct excised vessels leaves the patient susceptible to infection of the new graft (cited in one review as being greater than 32%<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574413490838">2</xref>
</sup>), and these patients often do not have usable native vein. Fortunately our patient had saphenous vein, but in situ repair for false aneurysms due to IV drug abuse still maintains a nearly 24% rate of early hemorrhage and 29% chance of early infection.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574413490838">2</xref>
</sup> Of note these numbers are based on infection of previously normal native vessel, not for vessels that have already been infected, intervened on, and reinfected.</p>
<p>Obviously, in a high-risk surgical candidate a case could be made for endovascular intervention of the SFA pseudoaneurysm. Instinctively, the thought of placing prosthetic material into a known infected environment does not seem appropriate; however, this has been described by Parodi as early as 1995.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574413490838">3</xref>
</sup> Endovascular repair of mycotic aneurysms has demonstrated late complications of 20% and early mortality of 5.5%.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574413490838">4</xref>
</sup> This is higher than the incidence of complications associated with open repair, and our patient required general anesthesia and open surgical repair of the popliteal artery, however, thus justifying our chosen treatment.</p>
<p>The largest series of mycotic femoral artery pseudoaneurysms found by literature search presented just 11 cases in a 5-year period,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574413490838">5</xref>
</sup> and only single cases have been reported demonstrating mycotic pseduoaneurysm formation related to stenting of the carotid and coronary arteries.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574413490838">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574413490838">7</xref>
</sup> Only one example of in-stent femoral artery pseudoaneurysm was found, but it was related to a defect in the stent rather than to an infectious process.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538574413490838">8</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In addition to the relative infrequency of this patient’s disease process, the case is particularly interesting for its presentation. Another case of in-stent mycotic pseudoaneurysm formation of the SFA has not been described to our knowledge. Furthermore, the time course of presentation is remarkable given the presence of aortic aneurysm and popliteal aneurysm and occlusion 2 weeks prior to progression to the formation of the SFA mycotic pseudoaneurysm in spite of treatment of the fungemia as well as removal of the presumed source of continued infection in the form of aortic graft removal leading to overall clinical improvement. This progression despite antibiotic treatment serves as a reminder for the underlying dangers of graft infection even when clinical improvement is seen and the importance of watching and treating patients with artificial graft material longer than the average patient with disseminated infections.</p>
