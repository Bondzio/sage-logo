<p>Tadeusz Konwicki’s literary and cinematic treatment of the Palace of Culture and Science has had a significant influence on the perception and meaning of this Stalinist edifice. In his novels, <italic>Wniebowstąpienie</italic> [Ascension] (1967) and <italic>A Minor Apocalypse</italic> (1979), Konwicki uses the Palace as a means of critiquing communist ideology by adopting a Christian discourse that, in turn, invokes and questions the Polish Romantic messianic and martyrological tradition. In the 1989 film <italic>Lawa: Opowieść o “Dziadach” Adama Mickiewicza</italic>, Konwicki’s presentation of the Palace visually explodes into what seems to be the author’s “final” statement on the signification of the Palace. By examining the poetics of the Palace of Culture in <italic>Wniebowstąpienie, A Minor Apocalypse</italic>, and <italic>Lawa</italic>, this essay considers how over a period of twenty years Konwicki appropriated the meaning of the Palace by playing on the tension between the intended original signification of the building (as a Stalinist structure) and its function as a dynamic edifice that could be redefined in a localized (Polish), urban (Varsovian), and historical context.</p>

<body>
<p>In 1986, the author-director Tadeusz Konwicki (b. 1926) said the following about Warsaw’s tallest and best known Stalinist structure, the Palace of Culture and Science: “I try . . . to make the Palace of Culture stand for something more than it really does. I inspire my world [with it] [“dopinguję swój świat”]. I try to rescue it as best I can, but really, my efforts are all for nothing.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0888325412469664">1</xref></sup> As is often the case with Konwicki’s assessments of his own literary or cinematic goals, his statement about the Palace is simultaneously cryptic and complex. What does Konwicki mean when he says that he tries to make the Palace of Culture “stand for something else”? How and why does one “rescue” a building, poetically, rhetorically, or discursively, as in Konwicki’s case? And, considering that some critics identify Konwicki’s poetics as having shaped an entire generation’s perception of this oft-hated and criticized edifice, the claim that his “efforts are all for nothing” is—in typical Konwicki fashion—disingenuous.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0888325412469664">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Few readers of such novels as <italic>Wniebowstąpienie</italic> (Ascension) (1967) and <italic>A Minor Apocalypse</italic> (1979), or viewers of Konwicki’s film <italic>Lawa: Opowieść o “Dziadach” Adama Mickiewicza</italic> (Lawa: A Tale of Adam Mickiewicz’s Forefathers’ Eve) (1989) can forget the vivid linguistic and visual images of the Palace of Culture presented in these texts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0888325412469664">3</xref></sup> From the description of the Palace as an “obelisk” or “lit-up pyramid” that incessantly towers over the Warsaw skyline in <italic>Wniebowstąpienie</italic>, to the representation of the edifice as the shoddy architectural work of Soviet construction in <italic>A Minor Apocalypse</italic>, to the twentieth-century image of the Palace of Culture presented in conjunction with Adam Mickiewicz’s <italic>Forefathers’ Eve</italic> (1820–1832), Konwicki has latched onto the Palace as a synecdoche for what Katarzyna Zechenter called a process of “coming to terms with post-war Polish history and politics.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0888325412469664">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the case of Konwicki, such a “coming to terms” can mean many things, but is most often a function of the author’s continual reassessment of the wartime experiences of his youth as they relate to the establishment of the communist system in the post-war period. Joining the Polish Home Army or <italic>Armia Krajowa</italic> (AK) in 1944, Konwicki fought against the Nazis and then Soviets in what is now Lithuania, only to escape to Poland and embrace socialism and the socialist realist aesthetic in the aftermath of the war. As with other intellectuals of his generation, the trauma of these years—as described in his novel <italic>Rojsty</italic> (Marshes) (1956)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0888325412469664">5</xref></sup>—precipitated a shift away from the popular Polish cultural paradigm of patriotic martyrology (i.e., messianism) toward socialism. After 1956, however, Konwicki entered a period of ideological skepticism, reassessing his personal and professional relationship to the communist regime. Beginning in 1966, Konwicki lost favor with the regime after signing a letter of support for philosopher Leszek Kołakowski, who had been expelled from the Polish United Workers’ Party; by the mid-1970s, Konwicki was publishing in <italic>drugi obieg</italic> (“second circulation” or the underground press), starting with <italic>The Polish Complex</italic> (1977);<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0888325412469664">6</xref></sup> and in the mid-1980s, he once again published in the official press, creating texts that openly poked fun at the censorship office.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0888325412469664">7</xref></sup> As this very brief outline of Konwicki’s intellectual biography indicates, his reassessment and critique of the ideological systems around him—be they “socialism” or “messianism”—are important to understanding his literary and cinematic oeuvre.</p>
<p>It is in this context that a reader can best understand Konwicki’s literary play with such communist symbols as the Palace of Culture and Science. In some of Konwicki’s Warsaw narratives, like <italic>The Polish Complex</italic> and <italic>The Anthropos-Specter-Beast</italic> (1969),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0888325412469664">8</xref></sup> the Palace appears to exude its ideological implications, but not structure the space in the novels; in these texts, Konwicki does not extensively develop a poetics around the Palace. In other texts, such as <italic>New World Avenue and Vicinity</italic> (1986),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0888325412469664">9</xref></sup> the Palace does not appear, despite its relative proximity to the organizational concept of the text, the Warsaw street <italic>Nowy Świat</italic>, and the Palace’s looming (though not visible) presence on the Warsaw skyline. In <italic>Wniebowstąpienie, A Minor Apocalypse</italic>, and <italic>Lawa</italic>, however, Konwicki incorporates the Palace into his texts as a vital part of his Varsovian poetics, calling our attention to the edifice’s height and monumentalism, as well as to its symbolic nature, that is, as a symbol of the totalitarian state and post-war history, on the one hand, and on the other, as a counterideological space.</p>
<p>In <italic>Wniebowstąpienie</italic> and <italic>A Minor Apocalypse</italic>, Konwicki uses the Palace as a means of fleshing out his critique of communist ideology by adopting a Christian discourse that, in turn, invokes and questions the Polish Romantic messianic and martyrological tradition in popular (not literary) culture. In <italic>Lawa</italic>, however, what is presented in <italic>Wniebowstąpienie</italic> and <italic>A Minor Apocalypse</italic> as a critical discursive treatment of both the Palace of Culture and the messianic paradigm, visually peaks and explodes into what seems to be Konwicki’s “final” statement on his resignification (i.e., “rescuing”) of the Palace of Culture and what may seem as a surprising and naive embracing of Mickiewicz’s messianic/martyrological message. By examining Konwicki’s portrayal of the Palace of Culture in <italic>Wniebowstąpienie, A Minor Apocalypse</italic>, and <italic>Lawa</italic>, this essay considers how over a period of twenty years Konwicki redefined and appropriated the meaning of the Palace by playing on the tension between the intended original signification of the building (as a Stalinist structure) and its function as a dynamic architectural edifice that could be redefined in a localized (Polish), urban (Varsovian), and historical context, while simultaneously grappling with the legacy of the Polish Romantic paradigm that was so influential on Konwicki’s generation.</p>

<title>The Palace of Socialism</title>
<p>Completed in 1955, the Palace of Culture and Science was dedicated originally to Yosif Stalin. One of the most important material representations of the newly enforced communist ideology in post-war Poland, the Palace competed in its symbolism only with the likes of Nowa Huta, a new, socialist city built in the 1950s to counter the traditionalism of Kraków. Based on the design of Moscow’s Stalinist skyscrapers, the Palace was a “gift” from Stalin symbolizing Poland’s communist future and the “brotherhood among nations.” Located in the center of the capital, the construction of the Palace was part of the post-war project to rebuild Warsaw as “an antidote to the pre-war city . . . characterized in official discourse as a fragmented, socially alienated and poverty-stricken environment under the conditions of capitalism.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0888325412469664">10</xref></sup> In addition to representing the authority of the communist ideology, the building was to provide an architectural space that would forge a new type of Pole, turning peasants into proletarians. “Socialist in content and national in form,” the Palace nominally borrowed elements of traditional Polish architecture and was built using Soviet design, laborers, and materials.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0888325412469664">11</xref></sup> In a capital that was razed during World War II, the design of the Palace centralized, both practically and symbolically, many aspects of post-war Varsovian life. Fitted with sports facilities, museums, cinemas, and theaters, the practical value of the building was closely paired with its ideological function, becoming a “didactic symbol of Communism’s imminence.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0888325412469664">12</xref></sup> The Palace was the site of communist party congresses and military parades that were held at the foot of the building on the <italic>Plac Defilad</italic>, the largest parade square in Europe. In the minds of most Poles, however, the Palace remained a symbol of the imposition of communist rule.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0888325412469664">13</xref></sup> Most morally reprehensible was the displacement of over 4,000 residents in order to make room for this ideology-driven project at a time of post-war housing shortages.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0888325412469664">14</xref></sup> Aesthetically, the edifice was simply considered ugly. Culturally and socially, the Stalinist building clashed with Poland’s engrained sense of a noble past and distracted from the reconstruction of Warsaw’s Old Town (rebuilt in the 1950s) and the eventual reconstruction of the Royal Castle (which was not rebuilt until the 1970s).</p>
<p>Despite the best efforts of communist propaganda, when the Palace of Culture officially opened on 22 July 1955, the skyscraper immediately became a dynamic architectural and rhetorical space that provoked public discourse, rather than one that emanated a monolithic or stable communist ideology. Over time, the signification of the edifice referred more to the flaws of the communist system, a fact that was reflected in an active reshaping of its meaning through visual, literary, and other cultural representations. As a symbol of an imposed ideology, the Palace might have easily suffered from discursive neglect as did many Imperial Russian structures ignored by nineteenth-century Polish authors,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0888325412469664">15</xref></sup> or as happened with the Palace itself after the October Thaw in 1956 when the building disappeared from official propaganda.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0888325412469664">16</xref></sup> Whether because of its size, central location, or aesthetic qualities, the Palace became the sight of a critical cultural and political discourse. This shifting signification of the Palace of Culture occurred, in large part, under the pen of Konwicki, whose literary and cinematic treatment of the Stalinist edifice shaped an entire generation’s perception of its symbolism and meaning.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0888325412469664">17</xref></sup></p>

<title>The Palace of Ascension: <italic>Wniebowstąpienie</italic></title>
<p><italic>Wniebowstąpienie</italic> (1967) is set in Warsaw on the eve of the Harvest Festival (<italic>dożynki</italic>) being celebrated at the <italic>Stadion Dziesięciolecia</italic> (The Tenth Anniversary Stadium), located east of the Palace of Culture, across the Vistula River.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0888325412469664">18</xref></sup> The main character of the novel, Charon (named after the mythological ferryman who accompanies the dead into Hades), awakens under a bridge with amnesia and a fist-sized hole at the back of his head. The novel follows him through the city, accompanied by criminals, prostitutes, homosexuals, and peasants, as he searches (albeit half-heartedly) for his identity. This realist description of the text, however, does not take into account that Charon is half-dead. He wanders through Warsaw in a purgatory-like state, existing in the space between life and death.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0888325412469664">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>In <italic>Wniebowstąpienie</italic>, the Palace of Culture is present as the central, vertical axis of the city. Its force is so strong that even the amnesiac, Charon, has a preexisting memory of the structure: it is the only building in Warsaw that he remembers by name. The force exerted by the Palace, however, does not come from its ideological rationale, but rather from the building’s verticality, which is reinterpreted by Konwicki. From the perspective of Stalinist architecture, the vertical axis of the Palace and similar buildings was to represent the power of the state and progress over the pre-communist past. Konwicki, however, reinterprets this vertical axis in religious terms. He inscribes onto the Palace a tension between upward and downward forces and recasts the edifice as a cathedral-like conduit between heaven and earth (with certain hellish aspects). This is implied, of course, by the title of the novel, <italic>Wniebowstąpienie</italic> (Ascension), which indicates an internal, divine function of the Palace and dynamic upward motion, in contrast to the quasi-divine function of the Palace in socialist terms (i.e., the verticality of the building as representing the “New Faith,” to borrow Czesław Miłosz’s phrase).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0888325412469664">20</xref></sup> This vertical, religious imagery is further exploited when Konwicki describes the Palace’s elevators as “cathedral-like confessionals” (“katedralne konfesjonały”), that go up, but not down.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0888325412469664">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>In opposition to the upward movement indicated by the title of the novel, Konwicki further undermines the intended ideological significance of the Palace by describing the bowels of the building through which Charon enters on two occasions. The most detailed descriptions of the building’s interior focus on a fictional, secret underground passage that begins in the <italic>Śródmieście</italic> Train Station (located on the northwest corner of the <italic>Plac Defilad</italic>) and leads to the basement of the Palace. It is only in the context of this fictional passage that the “great donor” of the Palace of Culture, “Józef Wissarionowicz” or in other words Stalin, is mentioned.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0888325412469664">22</xref></sup> Charon enters the Palace through this passage, making his way into “a bathroom, full of fancy baroque stucco” covered by “a layer of black dust”; he passes through a dark and defunct engine room with only one light bulb; and walks past a room of convoluted pipes “shining with dew like rime” and rhythmically dripping water that smells of rust.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0888325412469664">23</xref></sup> This decrepit image of the Palace and its mechanical systems also works in opposition to the title of the novel by introducing an earthly and even downward focus (i.e., a focus on hell), and indicates that the Palace is neglected and deteriorating at its core.</p>
<p>The resignification of the building in religious terms is further underscored by Konwicki’s use of a religious discourse to describe the areas around the Palace. Charon compares the <italic>Plac Defilad</italic> with the Valley of Josaphat, the site of the last Judgment in the Book of Joel.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0888325412469664">24</xref></sup> He also experiences a sacramental cleansing in the fountain located at the foot of the Palace, which brings him a sense of health and wholeness:
<disp-quote>
<p>Silvery water gushed forth from rusted fountains. I walked up to the first fountain that was surrounded by a stone pool. . . . I entered the pool and stepped deeper and deeper into this rain full of light. I finally knew . . . that the inconceivable state in which I found myself the previous afternoon had passed. I waited for the moment when my memory, locked by a sudden cramp, would re-open.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0888325412469664">25</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Charon’s cleansing and renewal are, unfortunately, short-lived. At the end of the novel, Charon and his companions gather on the thirtieth-floor viewing terrace of the Palace hoping to catch an eastward glimpse of the harvest festival taking place across the river; however, a monotonous gray sky obscures their view.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0888325412469664">26</xref></sup> Because the elevators do not seem to work, the thirtieth floor of the Palace becomes their eternal purgatory from where they look upon a city that is scarred by the vagaries of history.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0888325412469664">27</xref></sup> From the viewing terrace, Charon sees a city that suffers in perpetual ruins and is covered by wounds and ulcers. The aerial view of Warsaw provided by the Palace of Culture reveals (rather than masks) the lack of “healing” and progress promised by the communist system. From the viewing terrace, Warsaw looks like a city experiencing the final agony of life with no hope of resurrection.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0888325412469664">28</xref></sup> At the end of the novel, the cathedral-Palace is defunct—as both an ideological symbol and a religious one—for despite the height of the building, the view toward Moscow (and ideological salvation?) is obscured and the viewing distance is limited by the contingencies of weather. Any hope of ascension is dashed.</p>

<title>The Road to Golgotha: <italic>A Minor Apocalypse</italic></title>
<p>Written in 1979, <italic>A Minor Apocalypse</italic> is the first-person narrative of a second-rate dissident writer chosen by the opposition to self-immolate as a political protest in front of the Palace of Culture. The condemned man spends his final day circling the edifice and narrating the events leading up to his self-immolation. Similarly to Charon in <italic>Wniebowstąpienie</italic>, the narrator encounters people from all walks of life: a young Russian woman (who is a specialist in the technology of self-immolation and the granddaughter of Lenin’s lover); a paralyzed soldier of the Polish Home Army or <italic>Armia Krajowa</italic> (AK); dissidents, whose opposition to the communist regime is questionable; party officials and secret policemen, who beat and interrogate the narrator; and a group of women sitting around a bonfire in downtown Warsaw. In addition, the writer is followed throughout the novel by a young fan, Tadzio Skórko, who carries a blue gas canister filled with the deadly liquid and a book of matches. Near the end of the novel, Tadzio reveals himself as an agent of the secret police.</p>
<p>The novel is set on 22 July during a Party Congress held in honor of an unnamed anniversary of the Polish People’s Republic. Called the National Holiday of Poland’s Rebirth, 22 July was a holiday designated by the communist government to commemorate the 1944 Manifesto of the Polish Committee of National Liberation, which asserted the legitimacy of a communist, Moscow-backed leadership in Poland. In addition to the elaborate parades usually held on this day, 22 July was reserved for occasions and unveilings of particular import to the authorities. For example, in 1952 the name “People’s Republic of Poland” and a new constitution were adopted, while the previous day the ground was broken for the foundations of what was to become the Palace of Culture. For the city of Warsaw, this date became filled with the anniversaries of numerous “openings” associated with the rebuilding of Warsaw. On 22 July, the following projects were handed over for public use: the new Poniatowski Bridge (1946); the opening of the <italic>Trasa W-Z</italic> (the east-west corridor) (1949); the completion of the Palace and the <italic>Stadion Dziesięciolecia</italic> (1955); and the 1974 opening of the main thoroughfare, <italic>Trasa Łazienkowska</italic> (The Łazienkowska Way). Thus, 22 July commemorated multiple stages of the “rebirth” of Warsaw and the communist endeavor to claim the capital.</p>
<p>As in <italic>Wniebowstąpienie</italic>, the poetics of <italic>A Minor Apocalypse</italic> reclaims the space around the Palace of Culture through highly charged religious imagery. Like Charon, the narrator compares the <italic>Plac Defilad</italic> to the Valley of Josaphat.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0888325412469664">29</xref></sup> More striking, however, is that in <italic>A Minor Apocalypse</italic>, the Palace of Culture is assigned the role of a sacrificial site or as a communist-era “Golgotha.” While the term “Golgotha” is not used in the text, this implication is indicated by the narrator’s reference to the streets that circle around the Palace and the events that take place in the novel as his “stations of the cross” (“stacje męki”).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0888325412469664">30</xref></sup> The parallel between the events of the novel and the Christian narrative of Jesus Christ’s persecution (particularly the Roman Catholic version as portrayed by the Stations of the Cross) are direct, though distorted. The blue gas canister stands in for the crucifix;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0888325412469664">31</xref></sup> Tadzio Skórko, who carries the canister for most of the novel and betrays the narrator to the Secret Police, represents a merging of the figures Simon of Cyrene (“Station 5: <italic>Simon of Cyrene helps Jesus carry the Cross</italic>”) and Judas. Other parallels between <italic>A Minor Apocalypse</italic> and the Stations of the Cross include the following: the narrator is chosen by his colleagues to die (“Station 1: <italic>Jesus is condemned to death</italic>”); Tadzio Skórko says to the narrator: “I should wipe your face. But I don’t have a kerchief.” (“Station 6: <italic>Veronica Wipes the Face of Jesus</italic>”);<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0888325412469664">32</xref></sup> the narrator meets a group of women (who all happen to be former girlfriends) around a bonfire (“Station 8: <italic>Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem</italic>”);<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0888325412469664">33</xref></sup> and the narrator is mugged on the streets of Warsaw (“Station 10: <italic>Jesus is stripped of his garments</italic>”).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0888325412469664">34</xref></sup> The novel ends with the narrator walking toward the Palace of Culture, just before self-immolation. Though the parallel with the Christian narrative of the “Passion,” ends before crucifixion, death, and resurrection, we can see that Konwicki is engaging in a redemptive-like discourse with the Palace of Culture literally and figuratively in the center of the text. In this narrative context, the edifice is endowed with the <italic>potential</italic> of becoming a sacred site, but not in the way ideologically intended.</p>
<p>In <italic>A Minor Apocalypse</italic>, referring to the streets as the Stations of the Cross counterbalances the communist discourse that the Palace and its surrounding environs represent. The rewriting of Warsaw streets as a personal experience of the Via Dolorosa rhetorically pushes against the numerous 22 July demonstrations, mini-parades, and commemorative banners that the narrator witnesses along the path from his apartment to the Congress Hall of the Palace where the Party Congress is being held. Despite the importance of the communist holiday, each banner that the narrator reads indicates a different anniversary year (one reads “30th,” another “40th,” yet another “50th”). Most importantly, however, almost all the banners read “We have built socialism!” (“Zbudowaliśmy socjalizm!”), a paraphrase of the 1950s propaganda slogan “We are building socialism!” (“Budujemy socjalizm!”). By changing the phrase from the imperfective, present tense to the perfective past, Konwicki pulls together the abstract concept of building socialism on an ideological level with the concrete act of building communist state enterprises and rebuilding Warsaw—both considered to be physical manifestations of communist ideology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0888325412469664">35</xref></sup> Through rewriting such a key propaganda phrase, Konwicki attacks the communist regime on multiple levels, pointing out its ideological failures by presenting “new” “socialist” Poles on the streets of a city that—when seen from the thirtieth-floor viewing terrace of the Palace in <italic>Wniebowstąpienie</italic>—is scarred and broken. At the same time, the narrator’s experience of the propaganda-filled streets as a personal road to martyrdom shows how the meaning and symbolization of space is fluid and malleable, and reveals the limits of the effectiveness of propaganda.</p>
<p>Note that the narrator’s potential suicide act works on an abstract, ideological level (as political protest), while Konwicki’s use of a religious metaphor to narrate his character’s final hours rewrites the Varsovian space around the Palace, rhetorically claiming it away from a communist discourse. On the pages of <italic>A Minor Apocalypse</italic>, the space that was rebuilt purportedly according to the language of socialism is now recast in the martyrological language of the Catholic Church, inevitably (in the Polish context) evoking the civic martyrology of Polish Romanticism. On the one hand, Konwicki engages this religious discourse to rescue the Palace of Culture by giving it a “redemptive” meaning, but because the religious discourse is so highly associated with the nineteenth-century Polish Romantic, messianic tradition, à la Adam Mickiewicz, his attempts are thwarted. Thus, the narrator’s self-immolation constitutes a <italic>potentially</italic> significant and secularly redemptive act of protest against the Communist Party that will <italic>hopefully</italic> “liberate” Poland.</p>
<p>Such a result, however, is doubtful. The value of the self-sacrifice is wrought with uncertainty not only because the narrator recognizes the futility of his act, but because he also recognizes the complicity of his fellow dissidents in the perpetuation of the communist regime.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0888325412469664">36</xref></sup> Furthermore, the code of civic messianism no longer holds credence in the post-war era. When the narrator asks the paralyzed soldier of the Home Army (an embodiment of the messianic imperative), who spent a decade in Soviet gulags, whether or not he should self-immolate, the soldier cannot give him an answer: “Then we knew everything, and now we know nothing. The world was simple then. Now it’s deformed. It either deformed itself or it was deformed by that long draft of ideology that came through like a hurricane.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0888325412469664">37</xref></sup> The soldier’s answer suggests that in a new age, the cultural legacy of the revolutionary Romantic spirit is no longer valid. Konwicki similarly interrogates and questions this cultural paradigm in <italic>The Polish Complex</italic>, where a flashback to the January Uprising (1863) ends with the question “Was it worth it?”—a question posed regarding the value of personal sacrifice for the cause of Polish independence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0888325412469664">38</xref></sup> The communal messianic sacrifice as defined by Mickiewicz and which led to generations of Poles culturally indoctrinated to sacrifice themselves for the cause of Poland becomes diluted in <italic>A Minor Apocalypse</italic> as the personal sacrifice of a second-rate dissident, who is uncertain whether or not he can go through with the act of self-immolation; who questions the value of the act; and who recognizes that his self-sacrifice will have little or no redemptive effect on Polish society.</p>
<p>In <italic>A Minor Apocalypse</italic>, therefore, the narrator’s pending self-immolation is simultaneously a protest against communism, as well as a rejection and refutation of the enactment of the Polish Romantic paradigm and its directive. After all, the narrator neither willingly nor heroically walks to his death; he is not eager to redeem his countrymen; and the value of his death to the dissident movement is questionable. I should also mention that from a historical and intertextual perspective, the act of self-immolation in <italic>A Minor Apocalypse</italic> alludes directly to the suicide of Ryszard Siwiec, who set himself on fire during the 1968 Harvest Festival at the <italic>Stadion Dziesięciolecia</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0888325412469664">39</xref></sup> Though <italic>Wniebowstąpienie</italic> was written prior to Siwiec’s act, the gaze of Charon and his companions from the viewing terrace of the Palace toward the stadium where the Harvest Festival is being held becomes an extra-textual historical reference in <italic>A Minor Apocalypse</italic>, in which the self-immolation of the narrator, like Siwiec’s own act, will be suppressed by the authorities and thus fail in its impact. In sum, the Palace of Culture as a vertical conduit between heaven and earth in <italic>Wniebowstąpienie</italic>, and as Golgotha in <italic>A Minor Apocalypse</italic>, calls attention to the martyrological narrative of Polish Romantic Messianism, while at the same time employing a Christian discourse (sullied by Mickiewicz’s messianic message) to “rescue” the Palace from its socialist signification.</p>

<title>Rescuing the Palace: <italic>Lawa</italic></title>
<p>In 1989, Konwicki filmed <italic>Lawa: Opowieść o „Dziadach” Adama Mickiewicza”</italic>, an adaptation of the nineteenth-century Romantic drama <italic>Forefather’s Eve</italic> by Adam Mickiewicz (1798–1855).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0888325412469664">40</xref></sup> In the film, Konwicki juxtaposes a traditional visual interpretation of the play utilizing period costumes and settings, against brief street shots and panoramic views of contemporary Warsaw with a focus on the Palace of Culture. As the subtitle of the film suggests, <italic>Lawa</italic> demands to be read as a layering of interpretations and historical events associated with <italic>Forefathers’ Eve</italic> from its creation to the 1989 film adaptation. In <italic>Lawa</italic>, the image of the Palace becomes the key to understanding Konwicki’s interpretation of the play and, through his lens, the edifice reaches a new level of signification.</p>
<p>Considered the greatest work of Polish Romantic drama, <italic>Forefathers’ Eve</italic> consists of four parts written between 1820 and 1832. Loosely connected by the old Slavic custom of <italic>dziady</italic> (communicating with the dead), the play explores such Romantic themes as the exultation of folk tradition and the cult of death (here, expressed in the pagan ritual of <italic>dziady</italic>) and the individualism of the heroic poet-bard. Most influential on the Romantic legacy in Polish culture is Part III, written in 1832 and called the <italic>Dresden Forefather’s Eve</italic>. It is based on Mickiewicz’s arrest in 1823 and depicts Polish revolutionary Romanticism through the story of a young man and his schoolmates arrested under conspiracy charges by the government of Tsar Aleksandr I. Part III famously contains the “Improvisation,” during which the main character, Konrad, rails against God for His silence and indifference to humanity, and—as a self-proclaimed poet-bard—demands from God “mastery over souls” (<italic>rząd dusz</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0888325412469664">41</xref></sup> It is in Part III that Adam Mickiewicz expressed in dramatic form his ideas of Messianism—the Polish Romantic paradigm of self-sacrifice for the service of one’s country.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0888325412469664">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>By creating a film version of this quintessentially messianic drama, Konwicki seems to abandon his critique of the martyrological imperative which occurs on the pages of such novels as <italic>Rojsty, The Polish Complex</italic> and <italic>A Minor Apocalypse</italic>. However, in a conversation with Tadeusz Sobolewski on the making of the film, Konwicki explained that the film was in part due to his impatience with the Polish messianic paradigm. He stated that “even if throughout history we have yielded to deformity, we can’t constantly say that we were distorted by history. We must stand on our own two feet.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0888325412469664">43</xref></sup> Furthermore, Konwicki described his adaptation of <italic>Forefathers’ Eve</italic> as an insolent project that does not end tragically with a vision of Konrad as a wounded exile in Siberia, but rather one that ends with a “happy ending,” a matter to which I return below.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0888325412469664">44</xref></p>
<p>While it is always important in the case of Konwicki to question the author’s often self-effacing and ironic assessment of his work, the above statements are consistent with Konwicki’s general rejection of the Polish martyr complex. As such, what could be misconstrued as a whole-hearted embracing of the Romantic paradigm (i.e., making a film based on <italic>Forefathers’ Eve</italic>) must be interrogated a bit more deeply. Like in <italic>Wniebowstąpienie</italic> and <italic>A Minor Apocalypse</italic>, I suggest that Konwicki’s critique of the messianic paradigm overlaps with his critique of communism, precisely in the image of the Palace of Culture. Through skillful incorporation of the Palace into the diegetic structure of the film, Konwicki sets out on a multipronged, expansive mission of cultural and political critique: (1) to create a film that is a historical vessel by presenting partitioned Poland, World War II Poland, and the People’s Republic as one long story; (2) to put an end to ideology—“socialist” and “messianic”; and (3) to “rescue” the Palace of Culture (which is a synecdoche for “Warsaw,” and which is, in turn, a synecdoche for “Poland”) in the service of achieving points 1 and 2.</p>
<p>In order to achieve these goals, Konwicki masterfully merges the four disparate parts of the drama, reordering the lines of the play into a unified screenplay. He also underscores the play’s continued relevance through a historical reading that juxtaposes the nineteenth-century text with images from World War II. For example, Konrad’s debate with God over His silence and inhumanity is visually punctuated by documentary footage from World War II, including Auschwitz, the Warsaw Uprising of 1944, executions, and emaciated corpses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0888325412469664">45</xref></sup> Through the careful selection and integration of these images into the film, Konwicki reinterprets and adapts Mickiewicz’s drama for a new era.</p>
<p>Enter Konwicki’s Palace of Culture. Konwicki relies on the viewer of <italic>Lawa</italic> to read the Palace as a palimpsest. The edifice appears in the film three times, with the first image reprised at the end of the film. Presented during the opening credits, the Palace is shown from the distance as the center of the Warsaw skyline, while the Guardian Angel (played by Grażyna Szapołowska) rushes toward the city. The angel’s trajectory and gaze is on a linear, diagonal path directly toward the Palace (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0888325412469664">Figure 1</xref>). This shot comes immediately after the Poet’s (played by Gustaw Holoubek) recitation of the first lines from the Preface to Part III, which outlines the martyrdom of Poland at the hands of Tsar Aleksandr I and N. N. Novosiltsev.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0888325412469664">46</xref></sup> The next shot of the film shows the Guardian Angel on a crowded Warsaw street, followed by a sequence of images presenting Jewish, Muslim, Roman Catholic, and Russian Orthodox cemeteries in Warsaw and Vilnius.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0888325412469664">47</xref></sup> These first shots and sequences use the Palace as a signal to the viewer that the film transgresses historical periods. Furthermore, the presence of the angel on the contemporary streets of Warsaw acts as a symbol of Mickiewicz’s continued “presence” in Polish culture even during the communist period.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0888325412469664">48</xref></sup> Juxtaposed against the cemetery images, the view of the Palace of Culture also calls our attention to Warsaw not as a capital rebuilt under the watch of the communist authorities but rather as a symbolic (and real) cemetery.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0888325412469664">49</xref></sup> In this way, Konwicki integrates into his film Poland’s pre-war multiethnic and multidenominational population. The second image of the Palace of Culture—a view through the window of Gustaw’s prison cell—further underscores the importance of the edifice to Konwicki’s reading of <italic>Forefathers’ Eve</italic> as a text that is dynamically present in and relevant to contemporary Polish culture.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0888325412469664">50</xref></sup> After all, in Mickiewicz’s version of the play, a view of Warsaw (yet alone the Palace of Culture) from the prison cell is impossible; in the play, Konrad is imprisoned in Vilnius. In Konwicki’s rendition, the visual juxtaposition of nineteenth-century Vilnius and twentieth-century Warsaw establishes the cinematic text as a distillation of nineteenth- and twentieth-century Polish history read through the messianic paradigm.</p>

</fig>
<p>Konwicki adds to the layering of the Palace’s resignification, which he begins in <italic>Wniebowstąpienie</italic> and <italic>A Minor Apocalypse</italic>, by explicitly integrating into his film an overt reference to the events of 1968, when the production of <italic>Forefathers’ Eve</italic> at the <italic>Teatr Narodowy</italic> (National Theater) was shut down for its anti-Russian (and therefore, anti-Soviet) sentiments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0888325412469664">51</xref></sup> There is no doubt that Konwicki used <italic>Forefathers’ Eve</italic> as a synecdoche for these events, counting on his audience to make the connection between the 1989 production of the film and 1968. Konwicki explicitly refers to these events by casting Gustaw Holoubek (1923–2008)—who played the young Gustaw/Konrad in the <italic>Teatr Narodowy</italic> production—as an older Gustaw/Konrad, and as the Hermit and Poet, repeatedly underscoring the film as a bridge between the events of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, equating the Soviet regime with Poland’s partitions.</p>
<p>The final image of the Palace in <italic>Lawa</italic> once again engages the edifice as a heteroglossic synecdoche, presenting a four-part sequence of documentary shots from the papal mass celebrated at the end of Pope John Paul II’s 1987 pilgrimage to Poland.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0888325412469664">52</xref></sup> Held on the <italic>Plac Defilad</italic> at the foot of the Palace of Culture, this mass presented an unforgettable visual symbol of the “Polish Pope’s” (and, by extension, the “Polish Nation’s”) victory over the communist authorities. In 1989, the documentary images of the papal mass with the Palace of Culture looming in the background inserted into Mickiewicz’s <italic>Forefathers’ Eve</italic> simultaneously evoked and rejected the memory of the many ideologically driven communist events that took place in and around the Palace of Culture, beginning with the opening of the Palace in 1955 and Władysław Gomułka’s October 1956 speech that announced the Polish thaw.</p>
<p>The first shot of this final “Palace” sequence depicts a crowd of people during an International Workers’ Day demonstration (1 May) on the <italic>Plac Defilad</italic>; next we see a close-up of priests in gold vestments processing up the steps of an outdoor altar; the third shot is a close-up of this altar clearly located on a city square (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0888325412469664">Figure 2</xref>); the final shot of the sequence reveals the full view of the altar built for the papal mass against the backdrop of the Palace of Culture (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0888325412469664">Figure 3</xref>). During this sequence, we hear the following words from the Preface to <italic>Forefathers’ Eve Part III</italic>: “What are all the past cruelties in comparison with that which the Polish nation now suffers and upon which Europe looks indifferently! The author wanted only to preserve for the nation a faithful souvenir of Lithuania’s history from recent years.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0888325412469664">53</xref></sup> The martyrological tone of Mickiewicz’s text contrasts distinctly with the hopeful and powerful image of the Palace of Culture as the background to the papal altar, while simultaneously indicating the cinematic text as Konwicki’s historical vessel. And it is this image, chosen by Konwicki quite consciously and with purpose, that negates the paradigm of Polish suffering. This is, according to Sobolewski, no doubt the “happy ending” to which Konwicki refers, for the suffering message of the greatest Polish Romantic poet is incongruous with the redemptive image of a Stalinist edifice being used as an altar prop.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0888325412469664">54</xref></sup></p>

<p>This cinematic crescendo toward the final image of the Palace in <italic>Lawa</italic> represents the apotheosis of Konwicki’s discursive redefinition of the Palace. The contrast of the altar and cross against the façade of the Palace of Culture inserted into Mickiewicz’s text provided Konwicki with the discursive, visual power to “kill” three birds with one stone: the messianic paradigm, communist ideology, and the socialist symbolism of the Palace. While in hindsight, the crowds gathered on the <italic>Plac Defilad</italic> in 1987 were a sign of the end of communism,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0888325412469664">55</xref></sup> the final image in <italic>Lawa</italic> of the Palace of Culture with the altar and cross at its base becomes Konwicki’s symbolic, cinematic end of the “Polish screenplay of defeat.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0888325412469664">56</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Konwicki’s literary and cinematic representations of the Palace of Culture undoubtedly had a lasting effect on the meaning and symbolism of the edifice. In <italic>Wniebowstąpienie, A Minor Apocalypse</italic>, and <italic>Lawa</italic>, he used the Palace as a synecdoche for the post-war history and politics of Poland, exploiting its ideological signification to comment on communism, messianism, and ideology (in general). In order to do this, in <italic>Wniebowstąpienie</italic> and <italic>A Minor Apocalypse</italic>, Konwicki placed a veneer of Christian discourse onto the Palace of Culture, attempting to undermine the communist discourse that it was meant to represent. In <italic>Wniebowstąpienie</italic>, the potential for “ascension”—portrayed on the vertical axis as the tension between heaven and earth—is limited by the horizon and the cloudy landscape as seen from the viewing terrace of the Palace. In <italic>A Minor Apocalypse</italic>, the discursive power of the Christian narrative—portrayed on the horizontal axis as the symbiosis between the Palace (Golgotha) and the streets surrounding the Palace (Via Dolorosa)—also fails. The process of self-immolation is not portrayed in the text and the reader is left with some certainty that the sacrifice of the narrator is of little value to the course of Polish history. In <italic>Lawa</italic>, however, Konwicki indulges in a redemptive act by presenting the Palace of Culture in the context of the 1987 papal mass, with all its historical, political, discursive, ideological, and even anti-ideological implications, creating a discursive endpoint in the redefinition of the Palace of Culture and a cinematic farewell to communism and Mickiewicz’s messianic tradition. Here, Konwicki did not need to fabricate a veneer of Christian discourse, history handed it to him on a plate.</p>
<p>Almost a quarter of a century after the fall of communism, the Palace of Culture continues to act as a dynamic discursive space, generating new meanings in the context of post-communist democratization and economic transition. It still dominates the center of Warsaw and there is little evidence to suggest that this will change any time soon. While some political leaders, like the Minister of Foreign Affairs Radosław Sikorski, have vociferously proclaimed that the building must be torn down, others have sought to designate the Palace as a historical landmark or to open a museum of communism at its base.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0888325412469664">57</xref></sup> The Palace has become the setting of new novels, films, television series (most notably the third season of the crime drama <italic>Ekstradycja</italic> in 1999), and even contemporary youth music (like the song “Pałac Kultury” by the international, Poland-based band Yoga Terror).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0888325412469664">58</xref></sup> Konwicki, however, remains strangely silent on the matter of the infamous Stalinist edifice that he sees from the balcony of his apartment every day. After all, it would seem that his artistic project of rescuing the Palace is complete.</p>

<p>Tadeusz Konwicki, <italic>Wniebowstąpienie</italic> (Warsaw: Biblioteka Gazety Wyborczej, 2010). In Konwicki’s writing, nature often signifies a return to the “mythic homeland” and therefore to an earlier, purer self. See Czapliński, <italic>Tadeusz Konwicki</italic>. See also Przemysław Czapliński, Karen Underhill, and Tomasz Tabako, “The ‘Mythic Homeland’ in Contemporary Polish Prose,” <italic>Chicago Review</italic> 46, no. 3/4 (2000): 357–65. In <italic>Wniebowstąpienie</italic>, the <italic>dożynki</italic> represent the distortion of nature and the “homeland” by urbanization and communism. Under communism, these festivals were held as a celebration of the working class; Konwicki’s text shows a clash between the ideological underpinnings of the Harvest Festival and the peasants in traditional folk dress roaming the streets of 1960s Warsaw.</p>

<p>While Konwicki never explicitly states that Charon is dead, numerous elements of the text prevent a strictly realist reading; some critics have even labeled the novel as “surrealist.” Descriptions of Charon and his companions focus on grayness or pale skin tones, hoarse voices, and lips and limbs that are blue and cold. Also, Charon does not bleed or feel pain. The sense of the novel as a mysterious, spiritual journey also contributes to a nonrealist reading of the text.

<p>According to Crowley, Bolesław Bierut’s 1949 Six Year Plan for the Reconstruction of Warsaw underscored “a kind of faith in environmental determinism, that is the notion that, in reshaping city space, new kinds of cultured citizens would be fashioned.” See Crowley, <italic>Warsaw</italic>, 32–33.</p>

<p>Consider, e.g., the characterization of the filmmaker, Bułat, whose film, <italic>Transfuzja</italic>, is a critique of life under communism. In the novel, the film is “clandestinely” premiered at a centrally located cinema during the narrator’s final hours. The narrator implies that Bułat’s ability to create films is a form of complicity with the regime.</p>

<p>Ryszard Siwiec’s self-immolation occurred on 8 September 1968, predating the self-immolation of the Czech student, Jan Palach, in January 1969. As Siwiec’s act was suppressed by the communist regime, there is little indication that the two events were connected in any way other than through the act of political protest.</p>

<p>Mickiewicz also articulated his philosophy of Messianism in <italic>Księgi Narodu Polskiego i Pielgrzymstwa Polskiego</italic> (<italic>Books of the Polish Nation and the Polish Pilgrimage</italic>) (1832) where he cast Poland in the role of “Christ among Nations” (“Chrystus wśród narodów”), and as the savior of a Europe that had been brutally corrupted by the three great powers: Austro-Hungarian, Prussian, and Russian. According to Mickiewicz, Poland’s restoration as a nation was to bring European-wide redemption from this “Satanic Trinity” (“trójca szatańska”). See Adam Mickiewicz, “Księgi Narodu Polskiego i Pielgrzymstwa Polskiego,” in <italic>Dzieła</italic>, vol. 5, <italic>Proza artystyczna i pisma krytyczne</italic>, ed. Zbigniew Nowak and others (Warsaw: Czytelnik, 1996), 15. Mickiewicz’s philosophy sought to alleviate the scars left by the failures of the November Uprising (1830–1831). In combination with the rise of Nationalism and Romantic revolutionary ideas, his messianism contributed to a cult of individual martyrdom for the sake of the Polish (and therefore, European) collective. This cultural pattern, highly popularized by the end of the nineteenth century, became deeply engrained in Polish collective consciousness and was called upon during the January Uprising (1863), and again during World War II (especially the Warsaw Uprising of 1944). An excellent example of the influence of this cultural paradigm is Józef Piłsudski (1867–1935), who described the influence of the Polish Romantic bards (Adam Mickiewicz, Juliusz Słowacki, and Zygmunt Krasiński) on his intellectual and spiritual development. See Józef Piłsudski, “Polish Illegal Publications under Russian Rule,” in <italic>Polish Civilization: Essays and Studies</italic>, ed. Mieczysław Giergielewicz and Ludwik Krzyżanowski (New York: New York University Press, 1979), 216–17.</p>

<p>Holoubek recites the following first lines from the Preface to <italic>Forefathers’ Eve Part III</italic>: “For half a century, Poland represents, on the one hand, tireless and unrelenting brutality of tyrants, and on the other, boundless sacrifice and stubborn persistence of the people, such as has not been seen since the persecution of Christians. It seems as though kings have a Herod-like premonition of the manifestation of a new light on earth and of the nearness of their downfall, while the people believe more and more strongly in their rebirth and resurrection.” In the remaining lines of the Preface, Mickiewicz identifies the start of the “persecution of the Polish people” as 1822 (a year before his arrest), stating that “The history of Poland’s martyrology spans many generations and countless victims. . . . The epic verse, which we declare today, presents a few detailed sketches of this enormous picture, a few incidents from the time of persecution under the emperor Aleksandr. . . . At that time a general persecution of the Polish people . . . began. Senator Novosiltsev . . . entered the scene.” Adam Mickiewicz, <italic>Dziady</italic>, 121.</p>

<p>The closing of the play led to a series of student protests throughout Poland, which were brutally repressed; students active in the protests were expelled from the University of Warsaw and high-profile professors, like Leszek Kołakowski, were fired. By March of that year, the social turmoil spurred by government propaganda and conflicts within the communist party culminated in the expulsion of the majority of Poland’s post-war Jewish community. These events led to an overhaul in the party hierarchy, as well as the political awakening of a new generation of young Poles, who felt the brutality of the communist authorities.
