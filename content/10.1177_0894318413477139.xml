<abstract>
<p>The author of this paper examines emerging implications of holding ideas about evidence and evidence-based practice. Evidence has a very specific role in the delivery of safe clinical care, but it is creating a serious problematic for the practice of nursing. It is proposed that: evidence-based practice be re-situated or reconstructed as a collective and organizational responsibility and not the responsibility of individual nurses in practice; nurses re-focus on articulating a more ethical foundation for praxis, one that emerges from nursing philosophy and one that is co-constituted with persons/families/groups; and nurse leaders and educators establish teaching-learning and practice environments that enable a peer-to-peer process of critical review and curious inquiry of available evidence in the contexts of shared work.</p>

<body>
<p>Evidence plays an important role in the delivery of modern healthcare, especially care involving clinical procedures, drug protocols, and even public and social messaging aimed at promoting population health. When persons are offered, or subjected to, healthcare interventions, the procedures and protocols need to be as safe as possible. And, when we know as a society that smoking is harmful, that drunk drivers are dangerous, and that violence against women is wrong, we have an obligation as concerned citizens to support public health messaging based on evidence and shared mores. There is no question that evidence has a place in these instances, and in life in general. However, there is a compelling problematic with the current movement of evidence-based practice (EBP) within nursing and further discussion is warranted in order to examine “the implications of holding certain ideas” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0894318413477139">Thorne &amp; Hayes, 1997</xref>, p. xii). The emergence of disturbing implications affiliated with ideas of EBP has helped to define the problematic addressed in this paper.</p>
<p>I chose the word problematic in keeping with the definition in the <italic>Oxford Companion to Philosophy</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894318413477139">Honderich, 1995</xref>) that states a problematic is perplexing and questionable. There are persisting perturbations about the evidence-based movement and I must admit that sometimes I feel like <italic>Alice</italic> (in Wonderland) struggling to make sense of the evidence-based underworld and its claims to practice. Other authors (see for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894318413477139">Baumann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894318413477139">French, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894318413477139">Kemmis, 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0894318413477139">Kitson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0894318413477139">Rolfe &amp; Gardner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894318413477139">Smith &amp; McCarthy, 2010</xref>) are also perturbed about the placement of evidence in contemporary arenas of nursing practice and education. In order to portray some of the perplexing messages of EBP, I compiled a list with a sampling of some of the more salient and repeating perspectives on evidence from the literature. These are:</p>
<list id="list1-0894318413477139" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>“Nurses increasingly have been encouraged to get involved in research and adopt an evidence-based practice (EPB). EBP is broadly defined as the use of the best clinical evidence in making care decisions …there is general agreement that findings from rigorous studies constitute the best type of evidence for guiding nurses’ decisions and actions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0894318413477139">Loiselle, Profetto-McGrath, Polit, &amp; Beck, 2011</xref>, p. 3).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“Nursing practice that is relational and responsive to the uniqueness of people/families must be informed by multiple knowledges including experiential, contextual, spiritual, theoretical, biomedical, ethical, and ideological knowledge” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477139">Doane &amp; Varcoe, 2006</xref>, p. 7).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“Most RCTs focus on clinical questions and management of ideas. Many of the major determinants of health or illness, such as absolute or relative poverty, social class, literacy, transportation, or other infrastructure, are not amenable to medical interventions. RCTs can only answer questions for which quantitative results are applicable …. Many things that really count, cannot be counted” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894318413477139">Jadad &amp; Enkin, 2007</xref>, p. 9).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“The term theory-based is rarely heard now because the era of evidence-based practice has replaced it …. Research is now regarded as central to the determination of what constitutes best practice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0894318413477139">Pringle, 2006</xref>), p. 272).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“Theoretical thinking is essential to all professional undertakings” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0894318413477139">Meleis, 2005</xref>, p. 8).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“A component of thinking nursing is an interdependence of skills, knowledge, attitudes, values, and professional identity that allows complex thinking to occur” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0894318413477139">Thorne &amp; Hayes, 1997</xref>, p. 126).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>”Nurses need to consistently use a nursing framework that fully respects the dignity and worth of each individual patient, and have an open mind that can synthesize knowledge from diverse sources to guide practice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894318413477139">Baumann, 2010</xref>, p. 226)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“Five inextricably connected components of gerontological nursing are theory, evidence base, caring values, relational care, and later life conditions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0894318413477139">Tolson, Booth, &amp; Schofield, 2011</xref>, p. 238).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“The evidence-based view makes practice almost unrecognizable from the perspectives of professional practitioners whose intentions, values, and commitments are crucial in the conduct of their work …. The technicist view threatens to empty practice of its moral dimension. This is a price professional practitioners should not be prepared to pay for the ‘certainties’ allegedly given by the particularly restricted range of ‘evidence’ that ‘counts’ in the evidence based approach” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894318413477139">Kemmis, 2007b</xref>, p. 25).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“All professional nurses, from the new graduate to the seasoned veteran, should have the ability to apply research findings to practice …. Particularly staff nurses who are at the bedside caring for patients on a daily basis, must have the tools to critically analyze research in order to make EBP decisions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894318413477139">Boswell &amp; Cannon, 2007</xref>, pp. 88-89).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“The concepts of a gold standard of research and a hierarchy of evidence are inappropriate for the discipline of nursing, and …the RCT provides only a limited source of evidence on which to base nursing practice. We believe that the practice of nursing is fundamentally different from the practice of medicine and requires a fundamentally different view not only of evidence, but of what it means” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0894318413477139">Rolfe &amp; Gardener, 2005</xref>, p. 300).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Clearly present in the messages are at least three distinct streams of thinking—one view that locates evidence as <italic>the</italic> central guide for nursing practice, a second that situates evidence within a bounded zone of specific clinical relevance—a zone that exists within a larger foundation of philosophical and theoretical knowledge, and a third that situates evidence as a sociopolitical tool that provides little actual direction for nursing practice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0894318413477139">Waters, Rychetnik, Crisp, and Barratt (2009)</xref> identified similar diverging views on evidence in their inquiry with nursing and midwifery leaders in Australia.</p>
<p>This paper has two main sections. In the first I detail some perplexing aspects and questions affiliated with evidence-based ideas. Following exploration of three implications of ideas affiliated with EBP, I propose the following: (a) evidence-based practice (EBP) be re-situated or reconstructed as a collective and organizational responsibility and not the responsibility of individual nurses in practice; (b) nurses re-focus on articulating a more ethical foundation for praxis, one that emerges from nursing philosophy and one that is co-constituted with persons/families/groups; and (c) nurse leaders and educators establish teaching-learning and practice environments that enable <italic>a peer-to-peer</italic> process of critical review (considering social determinants of health, social justice, and politics) and curious inquiry of available evidence in the contexts of shared work, patient/family situations, and organizational resources.</p>

<title>Exploring the Problematic of Holding Evidence-Based Ideas</title>
<sec id="section2-0894318413477139">
<title>Emerging Implications for Nursing Education</title>
<p>One emerging implication of the EBP ideology is that some nurses educated over the past decade have been indoctrinated with the mantra that research evidence is knowledge and individual nurses require evidence to be competent professionals. This is not surprising since accrediting bodies in several countries require integration of EBP in baccalaureate level education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894318413477139">Smith &amp; McCarthy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0894318413477139">Waters et al., 2009</xref>). Student nurses engage with ideas that evidence is needed for decision-making about how to <italic>be</italic>, and how to <italic>do</italic>, as a nurse in practice. An unsettling story recently shared by a nurse practicing on a medical unit in a Canadian teaching hospital sheds light on one of the emerging implications of embracing the EBP ideology. The discussion involved a man who was suffering following a series of strokes that left him with bilateral paralysis, aphasia, and intense loss and grieving for an absent family and career. The nurse described a sense of concern that she did not know the evidence about how to be with him, about how to be a nurse with someone suffering. When asked what she would do, she said, “well I might form a personal relationship with him, but that is discouraged now that we are evidence-based.” She left me wondering if her reluctance and uncertainty might signal emerging implications for nurses indoctrinated with the idea that evidence guides how nurses think and act in practice.</p>
<p>I am concerned that graduating nurses feel ill-prepared for engaging persons unless they have evidence or a best practice guideline (BPG) to tell them how to be a nurse. This concern has been validated in recent discussions with other nurses who describe uncertainty about how to approach and be in relation with persons and families. One mid-career nurse described a hesitancy and reluctance when thinking about a home visit with an elderly woman diagnosed with depression because the nurse did not know what evidence to use to intervene. If these examples ring true for other educators and nurses, then we need to seriously re-visit the implications of embracing the idea that nursing practice is primarily informed by evidence. I am in agreement with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894318413477139">Kemmis (2007b)</xref> who proposed that nurses should not settle for such a narrow view of practice and the evidence-based movement may pose a serious threat that humankind cannot afford. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894318413477139">Kemmis (2007a)</xref>, practice exists among densely woven patterns of cultural-discursive, material-economic, and social-political pre-conditions that form practice architectures for supporting or restricting individual and group practices. In other words, the practice of nursing coexists with layers of complexity and meaning that go far beyond the simplistic and perhaps idealistic portrayals of EBP.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0894318413477139">
<title>Idealistic Portrayals of Evidence</title>
<p>Idealistic portrayals of existing evidence link with a second perturbing implication affiliated with the EBP movement. There is a widespread belief that evidence actually exists to guide nursing practice. Perhaps evidence about clinical issues such as spread of infection, drug errors, effects of immobility—to name several—is thought of as evidence for nursing practice, but as already articulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894318413477139">Cody (2006)</xref> there is an important distinction between evidence-based clinical care—that informs various professional groups—and values-based nursing care/practice. A review of published papers and systematic reviews on the Cochrane Library website consistently demonstrates that questions linked with nursing practice issues are just not addressed or are addressed but evidence is frequently reported to be inconclusive. Even when I turned to a fairly simple question linked with helping cancer patients experiencing debilitating fatigue, the evidence indicated that only exercise out of a dozen or more possible recommendations met the criteria required for action in practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0894318413477139">Mitchell, Beck, Hood, Moore, &amp; Tanner, 2007</xref>). This could be why so many examples in the literature promoting EBP use examples from drug trials or generic clinical care to make points about the effectiveness of EBP.</p>
<p>For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894318413477139">Melnyk and Fineout-Overholt (2005)</xref> offer an example of a clinical question in the following way. “In teenagers (the patient population), how effective is Depo-Provera (the intervention) versus oral contraceptives (the comparison intervention) in the prevention of pregnancy (the outcome)” (p. 9). This question is a general clinical question within the scope of medical or shared clinical practice for physicians/pharmacists/nurse practitioners with the legal mandate to prescribe birth control interventions. And, certainly, if nurses working with teens are asked a question about effective birth control, they could pursue the answer, but the evidence of effective birth control is not a guide for nursing practice that is relational—that requires a human with human process that evolves through relationships. A question relating to nursing practice in a similar situation might be: what are the central concerns for teenagers using birth control? When I went to the Cochrane Library, there were no reviews that examined concerns of teenagers taking birth control. After 30 minutes of browsing I was able to locate two connected reviews—one on the effectiveness of home visits with teens with reported drug and alcohol abuse, and another that evaluated the effectiveness of interactive computer programs to enhance sexual health. Both reviews proposed that home visits and computer interactions <italic>may</italic> be helpful but more study was needed to justify that either has benefit. I searched other sources relating to the topic of teen concerns about birth control but found no evidence.</p>
<p>To digress for a moment, I did locate an impressive virtual library of qualitative research and participant video experiences for many different situations at the following site: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.healthtalkonline.org/">http://www.healthtalkonline.org/</ext-link>. The site has a sister site where I found a full menu of stories and qualitative research on issues important to young people, their sexual activities, body image, and other health-related issues (see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.youthhealthtalk.org/Sexual_Health_of_Young_People/">http://www.youthhealthtalk.org/Sexual_Health_of_Young_People/</ext-link>). These sites are dedicated to explicating personal experiences of health/illness for professionals and the public. The stories enhance understanding and provide context for thinking about personal health and nursing practice in light of disciplinary knowledge.</p>
<p>To the point of evidence-based healthcare and the illusive nature of evidence-based nursing practice, I must point out the degree of the perplexing drift in the literature that substitutes generic clinical healthcare for nursing practice. Again, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894318413477139">Melnyk and Fineout-Overholt (2005)</xref> appeal to skeptics of EBP to consider real life scenarios for <italic>undeniable proof</italic> that evidence changes practice. They stated, “Many primary care providers continue to prescribe antidepressants as the sole treatment for adolescents when systematic reviews of their effectiveness have indicated that medication alone is not beneficial in treating mild to moderate teenage depression” (p. 18). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0894318413477139">Rycroft and colleagues (2004)</xref>, offered an example about the uptake of low molecular heparin post-operatively to illustrate how evidence is more powerful if aligned with clinical experiences. I wonder how these examples link with nursing practice. Or, are the clinical and pharmacological examples provided merely to offer clarity about how evidence based on causal relationships can guide decision-making in generic healthcare situations? Interestingly, Melnyk and Fineout-Overholt included a chapter on how patient concerns and choices influence EBP, but an example provided involved a surgeon’s decision about whether to conduct spinal surgery on a 93-year old woman. The elderly woman wanted to have the surgery because she believed she might dance again, but the evidence did not support her as a good candidate for success. The hospital found a surgeon willing to do the surgery and the woman recovered nicely. The example demonstrated patient-centred healthcare, perhaps, and how surgical risk needs to be considered within the context of the individual. But how does the example link with the practice of nursing?</p>
<p>Which begs the question: Is nursing becoming an evidence-controlled activity? And, does the generic healthcare perspective of EBP contribute to the persistent presence of modernist controls and techniques that compress human experiences (of nurses and persons/families) in order to maximize efficiency and control? Do different health professions embody unique domains of knowledge and skill, or have we already moved to a generic inter-professional matrix where boundaries and domains of knowledge are no longer useful in the current model of healthcare service? Taylor’s control of the pig iron workers through time and motion studies comes to mind here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894318413477139">Doll, 2008</xref>). His work inspired development of managerial science, a science focused on efficiency, effectiveness, compliance, and measurement. Are these modernist values affiliated with the beliefs and actions of EBP?</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0894318413477139">Rycroft-Malone (2006)</xref> considered the political implications of the EBP movement and pondered the managerial control of all practitioners through the delegated research protocol. Equally well articulated is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318413477139">Clegg’s (2005)</xref> critical realist view that EBP is a technical tool of the government that undermines professional wisdom and the living of values in practice. She purported that, “Evidence-based practice serves an ideological function that is disguised through the rhetoric of independence and the idea that policy is disinterested and objectively informed” (p. 419). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0894318413477139">Winch, Creedy, and Chaboyer (2002)</xref> considered EBP from Foucault’s concept of governmentality and proposed that evidence is a government technique directed at control and manipulation. The authors suggested that nurses will benefit from a critical analysis of evidence-based issues linked with power, knowledge, and practice. It is interesting that a Cochrane review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0894318413477139">Thomas and others (2009)</xref> supported the substitution of professionals with the use of evidence-based guidelines to reduce cost and decrease variability in practice. The issue of cost-benefit analysis based on evidence is raising questions of control over professional practice and the issue has recently entered the public media.</p>
<p>For instance, an article in the <italic>Wall Street Journal</italic> addressed how some physicians are voicing concerns about the recent decision in America to stop testing for prostate cancer because the outcomes do not justify the costs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203388804576617310963936364.html">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203388804576617310963936364.html</ext-link>). And consider the following report about healthcare in Greece: “This Saturday, one of Greece’s most respected newspapers, <italic>To Vima</italic>, reported that the nation’s largest government health insurance provider would no longer pay for special footwear for diabetes patients. Amputation is cheaper, says the Benefits Division of the state insurance provider” ( see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dailycaller.com/2010/10/11/greek-health-system-opts-for-amputation-as-money-saver/#ixzz1bFtfBeNq">http://dailycaller.com/2010/10/11/greek-health-system-opts-for-amputation-as-money-saver/#ixzz1bFtfBeNq</ext-link>). It is noteworthy that more than a decade ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318413477139">Colyer and Kamath (1999)</xref> suggested that patient choice and autonomy would decrease as EBP advances. Are these decisions by government bodies and insurance agencies reflective of the emerging implications of embracing the ideology of EBP? One wonders how evidence will support nursing <italic>care</italic>, or any care for that matter, for persons with incurable diseases, such as advanced cancer or dementia since the outcomes will surely not justify the costs. If recent decisions to withhold or deny healthcare offer insight into the implications of embracing ideas of evidence as a foundation for practice, will nurses continue to embrace evidence as the privileged informant for practice? Can the evidence-based ideology prepare nurses for the ethical challenges emerging in practices rationing healthcare? Even if definitions of evidence are extended to include values, expertise, and experiences, will it serve to help or hinder nursing practice?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0894318413477139">
<title>Expanding Definitions of Evidence—Extending the Problematic</title>
<p>In the beginning, evidence-based medicine defined a hierarchy of evidence that held the randomized control trail (RCT) as the gold standard, since then the RCT has been trumped by the systematic review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318413477139">Clegg, 2005</xref>). RCTs work well with drug trials and in labs where controls are possible, not so well in real life situations. The narrow definition of evidence may have contributed to the trend to develop broader definitions of evidence for nursing practice. However, extending the inclusion criteria of relevant evidence may add to the problematic of EBP. If qualitative research findings, patient values and preferences, and clinical experiences/expertise can also count as evidence, how can there be any clarity or confidence regarding health decision-making. Meanings, values, experiences, narratives, and theoretical interpretations provide different ways of coming to know—ways that are not like evidence. Viewing truth in the moment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894318413477139">Parse, 2008</xref>) or truth as emergent reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894318413477139">Eriksson, 2010</xref>) as instances of unfolding evidence for nursing science, provides some appeal, but truths and realities taken into the frame of <italic>evidence</italic> will not enlighten the pre-destined attitude of objectivity, judgment, value, and worth. Evidence is already intertwined within a discourse that includes habits of interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894318413477139">Davis &amp; Sumara, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The idea of a pre-destined attitude or frame of reference is captured in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318413477139">Bolt’s (2011)</xref> analysis of Heidegger’s insights about science. She stated, “objectification and mastery go hand in hand. Through its ability to reduce everything to an object, science-as-research enframes us: it sets a limit on what and how we think and how we interact with the world” (p. 149). Enframing for Heidegger is a process of destining that limits other views and possibilities. Enframing for nurses and other health professionals may restrict responsive practices that are open to emerging events and relationships. Perhaps we will miss seeing the forest for the trees, miss seeing persons for the evidence, miss seeing ourselves as human beings engaged with other human beings.</p>
<p>Although broader definitions of evidence may have been intended to avoid missing things, everything seen as evidence is subject to its destining frame. Therefore, the more specific and rigorous we can keep the definition of evidence, the more likely we can truly examine its usefulness for care. If we can separate nursing practice from evidence-based clinical care we may be able to bring additional sources of nursing knowledge into view—especially philosophical and theoretical views that offer a qualitatively different approach—different enframing and destining. Further sources for coming to know such as the imagination and art may better enable nurses to relate with persons in life and health-enhancing ways. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318413477139">Bolt (2011)</xref> reminded us that art is what connects us with ethics, relationships, and truth—not science. Perhaps we need a counter movement called humanities-based nursing. The arts and humanities provoke a deeper looking and connecting that does not enframe what we can know to past discoveries. Evidence, on the other hand, requires a looking behind for solid footing that leads to a third problematic of EBP.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0894318413477139">
<title>Knowledge Discovered and Knowledge Invented</title>
<p>A third perplexing implication of embracing EBP is that decision-making tends to exclude thoughts and actions that are aligned with creativity and innovation, emergence and imagination, responsiveness and relation. Many post-modern thinkers in philosophy and education, especially those informed by complexity science, contend that the modernist reliance on evidence and knowledge based solely on what can be discovered from the past has outlived its usefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894318413477139">Davis &amp; Sumara, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318413477139">Doll, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894318413477139">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0894318413477139">Westley, Zimmerman, &amp; Patton, 2006</xref>). Perhaps the relevance of evidence for nursing is already past—it may have helped us define who we are not.</p>
<p>Regrettably, the ideas of emergent discovery, responsive/reflexive practice, and innovation in the interpersonal relations of practice are lacking in many texts and papers on evidence-based nursing practice. How can nurses be in relation with other persons experiencing complex realities of health and illness if they cannot imagine and picture their approaches and dialogues based on what might be? Is the purpose of knowledge not to enable us to know how to be in the future within the unique situations we know exist? Recall the stories from nurses described earlier in this section–they were not able to imagine <italic>nursing</italic> practice in the absence of evidence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894318413477139">Baumann (2010)</xref> suggested that “it is understandable that clinicians would like to have a solid ground upon which to guide their clinical decision-making, but the reality is that no such ground exists” (p. 227). There are many uncertainties for professional nurses that exist at multiple levels as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894318413477139">Kemmis (2007b)</xref>.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894318413477139">Kemmis (2007b)</xref> provided a provocative analysis of the individualistic and the extra-individual (organizational) features and dimensions of professional practice, but few authors in nursing have tackled the reality that mutual relationships among nurses and persons they work with require an openness, a willingness to participate with the interplay of messages and actions, a responsiveness to the particular person and family. Relational nursing with unique human beings requires a foundation of knowledge and skill informed by philosophy, values, theory, experience, and imagination. EBP does not embrace the reality that human beings create and invent ways of living when challenged by life happenings and when engaged in relationships with others. Nor does it take advantage of the reality that most learning and growth happen in relationship with others through dialogue and curious inquiry involving imagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894318413477139">Doll, 2008</xref>). Learning, growth, dialogue, and curious inquiry conjure a different set of implications from those affiliated with evidence.</p>
<p>In summary, the first section of this paper has been considering some of the implications of aligning with EBP ideas. Proposed implications for the nursing community include the following.</p>
<list id="list2-0894318413477139" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>EBP as an ideology and foundation for nursing practice may be contributing to nurses’ feelings of discomfort and uncertainty about the relational foundations of practice.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>EBP as a requirement of educational and practice organizations forces a limiting and potentially harmful framework for nursing practice.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>EBP as a frame for professional practice excludes other ways of knowing through destining—whether explicit or not, knowledge is also theoretical, values-based, and aligned with particular philosophical and personal assumptions</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>EBP encourages a generic view of healthcare practice where boundaries and contributions among different kinds of services become blurred and unrecognizable in the shadow of the research protocol</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Evidence is a sociopolitical tool as much as a clinical tool and recent government bodies and insurance agencies are forecasting serious and far-reaching implications for human health and healthcare.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>These implications invite nurses to reconsider and re-situate evidence and its relationship with nursing practice.</p>

<title>Re-Situating Evidence in Nursing Practice and Education</title>
<p>In the second half of this paper, three ideas for additional consideration by nursing colleagues are proposed. The ideas are not necessarily new but may extend thinking of others who have clearly articulated the complex realities of relational practices (see for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894318413477139">Kemmis, 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894318413477139">Smith &amp; McCarthy, 2010</xref>). The three ideas are that:</p>
<list id="list3-0894318413477139" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>EBP be re-situated or reconstructed as a collective and organizational responsibility and not the responsibility of individual nurses in practice.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Nurses—especially nurse educators and leaders—re-focus on articulating a more ethical foundation for praxis, one that emerges from nursing philosophy and one that is co-constituted with persons/families/groups.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Nurse leaders and educators establish teaching-learning and practice environments that enable <italic>a peer-to-peer</italic> process of critical review (considering social determinants of health, social justice, and politics) and curious inquiry of available evidence in the contexts of shared work, patient/family situations, and organizational resources.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Each of these ideas requires some additional consideration about the implications they may engender.</p>
<sec id="section7-0894318413477139">
<title>Re-Situating EBP to the Collective and Organizational</title>
<p>The amount of literature suggesting that individual nurses are responsible for EBP is growing and may be contributing to a generation of nurses who are expressing uncertainty and unknowing when facing the complex and ambiguous realities that constitute relational practices with human beings. It is not responsible, and may indeed be harmful, to continue the rhetoric that knowledge equals evidence and evidence guides practice. Even in the realm of care, individual nurses should not be expected to identify clinical problems, on their own, conduct literature reviews, place gathered evidence in a hierarchy of credibility, and change practice on their own. Reflecting on more than 30 years of practice experience, I cannot think of one situation where such individual activity is possible or even desirable. Even nurses practicing at the graduate level, who may have the time to conduct and evaluate evidence, need to discuss changing a clinical protocol with peers and leaders, as well as patients and families involved in the situation. I have imagined many occasions and have asked colleagues and nurses in practice to describe situations when a review of evidence would lead one nurse to change practice in a clinical situation. In each situation described, peers, clinical leaders, policies, politics, economics, traditions, and persons/families need to be consulted and considered. And even then there is a mix of ambiguity that requires responsiveness, relationality, and emergence in the moment.</p>
<p>Frustration with assumptions that the absence of evidence application in nursing is, at least in part, the fault of individual nurses who do not have the knowledge or the skill to conduct research reviews for purposes of guiding practice has been ardently expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0894318413477139">Mitchell, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894318413477139">1999</xref>). These claims continue and now extend to the educators who teach nurses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0894318413477139">Stichler, Fields, Kim, &amp; Brown, 2011</xref>). These authors stated that many faculty “do not have the knowledge, attitudes, or competencies in EBP to include the content in their coursework or student assignments” (p. 93). Further, the authors reported that doctorally-prepared nurses have the most negative attitudes toward EBP. Should we not then question the assumption that faculty should be teaching EBP or that nurses should be using evidence in practice. Perhaps evidence, beyond informing clinical protocols/procedures, is just not meaningful for nursing practice.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894318413477139">Estabrooks and colleagues (2005)</xref>, in their study of sources of practice knowledge among nurses, addressed the issue of regarding evidence over other forms of knowing. These authors report that nurses draw on multiple sources of knowledge and that a primary source is the knowledge that emerges in their interactions with each other and persons and families. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894318413477139">Gerrish and Clayton (2004)</xref> reported similar findings from the United Kingdom. This means that nurses’ lived realities of practice are more consistent with views of knowledge informed by complexity science. Complexity science views knowledge as potential, as the co-created ability to know how to go forward amid ambiguity and complexity through relationships and dialogue with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894318413477139">Davis &amp; Sumara, 2006</xref>). If nurses know how to be with others by being with others, their practices can be seen as emergent and self-organizing. Emergent nursing practice shows the give and take, the questions and answers, the silence and speaking of contemplative relating in ways that attend to the issues and concerns of persons and families. Emergent knowledge that unfolds in relationship cannot be contained in prescriptive protocols that typify EBP.</p>
<p>The process of consultation for developing evidence-based protocols takes time, sometimes months to generate and evaluate sufficient evidence to inform a collective of recommended changes in practice. But even then, the change or guideline generated needs to be considered within the larger context/reality of the practice situation. In Ontario, Canada, the Registered Nurses Association of Ontario (RNAO) has conducted extensive reviews and consultations over years to compile best practice guidelines for nurses and organizations. And nursing societies representing several specialized groups in America are also developing evidence-based guidelines (see for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0894318413477139">Mallory, 2010</xref>). This level of engaged scholarship is where EBP belongs, as well as in hospitals and other healthcare settings where clinical protocols and policies guide interventions. Healthcare organizations bear responsibility to create collectives of professionals who spend their paid time at work reviewing and developing evidence-based procedures, protocols, policies. It is reckless and unacceptable to place this burden on individual nurses, especially at the baccalaureate level, and the time seems right to stop the talk of evidence as <italic>the</italic> guide to practice for individual nurses.</p>

<sec id="section8-0894318413477139">
<title>Re-Focusing on the Discipline and Purpose of Nursing</title>
<p>Instead of broadening the meanings and kinds of acceptable evidence, it is proposed here that nurses align with the narrow definition of evidence, with its hierarchy of credibility for informing generic clinical decision-making. Evidence belongs with collective clinical decision-making, and we need to re-situate nursing practice in the disciplinary knowledge of wholeness, consciousness, caring, pattern, transformation, transcendence, relationship, and meaning—the concepts emerging from intersections of unitary nursing theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318413477139">Cowling, Smith, &amp; Watson, 2008</xref>). The purpose of nursing is to care for human beings experiencing changes in life that influence their health and well-being. Nursing is a relational practice involving a relational inquiry that evokes responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477139">Doane &amp; Varcoe, 2006</xref>). Nurses happen to assist with clinical care and protocols in certain settings. Clinical protocols and interventions make appearances in practice, but they are not foundational components of nursing practice. Philosophy and theory are essential and the defining foundations of nursing practice—essential because our purpose is to care for human beings in situations that are emerging, ambiguous, complex, and dynamic.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894318413477139">Smith and McCarthy’s (2010)</xref> impassioned exposé of how some nursing associations and educational institutions in the United States are limiting the role of nurses to the clinical and evidence-based scope—is a trend also happening in other countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0894318413477139">Rycroft-Malone, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0894318413477139">Waters et al., 2009</xref>). Limiting nursing practice to an evidence base dehumanizes nurses and our service to society. Ultimately, the technical and the evidence-based protocols will be automated or, as is happening today, will increasingly become the responsibility of persons and family members themselves. If nurses are not in practice/service to attend to humanness, to lived experiences of health and illness, to contribute to ethical care and quality of life through relationships that are helpful and supportive, then nursing need not be considered a profession or a discipline for it will meet the purposes and standards of neither.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894318413477139">Kanes’ (2010)</xref> thoughtful consideration of professionalism provides different ideas about professional practice—ideas that may generate different implications than those emerging with the ideas of evidence. He suggested that professionals know how to translate and interpret generalized, abstract knowledge and make it meaningful in specific contexts. Professionals practice holism by interpreting detail in light of a broader context and they are responsive to emerging changes, ideas, constraints, and meanings. For Kanes, professionals bring an ethical enrichment that involves “interpreting knowledge helpfully, engaging with knowledge openly, acknowledging uncertainty about knowledge frankly, and sharing knowledge appropriately—against an overriding value of caring for patients” (p. 197). How might these ideas inform nursing practice and education?</p>

<sec id="section9-0894318413477139">
<title>Enabling Teaching-Learning and Practice Environments</title>
<p>Nursing leaders and educators are called to continue the dialogue about the realities of enabling teaching-learning and practice environments that restore the philosophical and relational foundations of nursing. We have an obligation to address the question of what implications are emerging within the culture and ideology of EBP. Individual nurses are responsible for using the knowledge of the discipline to know how to be with persons in situations that are unfolding within occasions of changing health patterns. Leaders and educators are responsible for enabling environments that generate knowledge and understanding of our humanness. This knowledge and understanding emerges from philosophy and theory. Nursing relationships are “based on partnership, presence, and shared meaning” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894318413477139">Smith &amp; McCarthy, 2010</xref>, p. 46) not evidence.</p>
<p>Evidence-based practice is an organizational, collective, and interdisciplinary affair that has a place in clinical decision-making. If EBP is not kept firmly situated in its place, it also has the potential to harm as is already happening in the abyss of cost-benefit and measurable outcomes. Evidence is most certainly a political tool that is manifesting power of persons concerned with efficiency and control—power that can compress and even remove voice and presence from nursing practice and human care.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894318413477139">Kemmis (2007b)</xref> addressed the issue of evidence and politics as do <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0894318413477139">Rycroft-Malone (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318413477139">Colyer and Kamath (1999)</xref>. It is important for nurses to ask provocative questions about the use of evidence to sustain the status quo for instance, or to extend colonization of dominant ideologies and agendas. World leaders and politicians do not practice evidence-based policy-making unless it meets their desired ends. For instance, the evidence indicates that poverty is a social determinant of health that adds significant personal and societal burden—in the areas of health inequities, chronic disease, and healthcare resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894318413477139">Raphael, 2006</xref>). Nurses have moral courage and we can help by questioning assumptions and by exploring who is benefiting from decisions based on power and agenda? I hope we can continue to examine the implications of EBP and reject it as a foundational concept for nursing and humanity.</p>
