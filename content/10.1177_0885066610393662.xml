<p>
<bold>Background</bold>: Prematurity is a recognized risk factor for morbidity and mortality following cardiac surgery. The purpose of this study was to examine short-term outcomes following cardiac surgery in premature neonates adhering to our institutional philosophy of supportive care allowing for weight gain and organ maturation. <bold>Methods</bold>: Retrospective review of all neonates undergoing cardiac surgery from January 2002 to May 2008. A total of 810 neonates (&lt;30 days of age) were identified. Prematurity defined as less than 36 weeks of gestation. Neonates undergoing ductus arteriosus ligation alone were excluded. In all, 63 neonates comprised the premature group. Term group comprised 244 randomly selected term neonates in a 1:4 ratio. Outcome variables were compared between the 2 groups. <bold>Results</bold>: Median gestation 34 weeks, range 24 to 35 weeks. Defects: 2 ventricle, normal arch (41% premature vs 44% term; <italic>P</italic> = .7), 2 ventricle, abnormal arch (24% vs 22%; <italic>P</italic> = .8), single ventricle, normal arch (21% vs 15%; <italic>P</italic> = .2), single ventricle, abnormal arch (14% vs 19%; <italic>P</italic> = .4). Premature neonates were older and smaller at surgery. Cardiopulmonary bypass procedures were performed less frequently in premature neonates (49% vs 69%; <italic>P</italic> = .004). Length of mechanical ventilation at our institution (6 days [0.5-54) vs 4 days [0.5-49); <italic>P</italic> = .06); postoperative hospital stay at our institution (17 days [1-161) vs 15 days [0-153); <italic>P</italic> = .06); and mortality (16% vs 11%; <italic>P</italic> = .2) was not different between the 2 groups. <bold>Conclusion</bold>: Early outcome seems independent of weight, prematurity, cardiopulmonary bypass, and type of first intervention. Importantly, there was no statistical difference in mortality between the 2 groups, regardless of how they were treated. Further long-term follow-up is needed in this patient population.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>The incidence of congenital heart disease among newborns in industrialized countries is estimated to be approximately 12 per 1000 live births.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885066610393662">1</xref></sup> When cardiac surgery is indicated in the newborn period, prematurity is a risk factor for morbidity and mortality following surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885066610393662">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885066610393662"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885066610393662"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885066610393662">5</xref></sup> Lung prematurity, body weight, and other organ immaturity and dysfunction all contribute to the increased risk associated with undergoing cardiac surgery. Therefore, cardiac surgery is often delayed, substituted by supportive care to allow the premature neonate to gain weight and the organ systems to mature. Although this strategy is common, studies by Reddy et al and Chang et al have shown a significant mortality with supportive care alone, and no benefit to delaying surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885066610393662">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885066610393662">7</xref></sup> However, the decision-making process for the timing of surgery is subjective, and still varies among institutions. With no universal standard of care, it is difficult to predict the risks verses benefits of cardiac surgery in the premature neonate versus supportive care while waiting for weight gain and organ system maturation. The purpose of the current study was to examine the short-term outcomes following cardiac surgery in premature neonates adhering to our institutional philosophy of supportive care allowing for weight gain and organ maturation prior to cardiac surgery.</p>

<sec id="section2-0885066610393662">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This retrospective review was performed with approval of the institutional review board at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta with waiver of informed consent. The cardiac surgical database was reviewed for all neonates undergoing cardiac surgery from January 2002 to May 2008. Neonates were defined as less than 30 days of age at the time of cardiac surgery. Prematurity was defined as less than 36 weeks of gestation. Neonates who underwent ligation of ductus arteriosus alone were excluded from analysis. A total of 810 neonates were identified. Of the 810 neonates, 63 (8%) meeting entrance criteria comprised the study group of premature neonates. The control group comprised 244 randomly selected term neonates. These neonates were selected in a random fashion using a 1:4 ratio from the remaining 747 term neonates in an attempt to reduce selection bias. We believed that the 244 selected control neonates would provide a reasonable sample size that was not too disproportionate to our premature neonate group and yet still provide a good representation of our term neonate population. Our institutional philosophy is one of supportive care for premature neonates in order to allow for weight gain and organ maturation, with a goal weight of 2 kg prior to cardiac surgery. Thus, the patients born with birth weights less than 2 kg were medically managed at the birth hospital and not referred to our institution, a free-standing children’s hospital with no birthing facility, until reaching the weight of 2 kg. If referral for cardiac surgery was after 30 days of age, the patient did not meet entrance criteria for this study. Preoperative, operative, and postoperative variables were examined and compared between the 2 groups. Mortality was included if death occurred within 30 days postoperative from cardiac surgery or prior to hospital discharge if the patient remained in the hospital for more than 30 days.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Data are expressed as median values and ranges. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher exact test for categorical variables or Mantel-Haenszel for dichotomous variables where appropriate. Statistical significance was defined as <italic>P</italic> value ≤.05. Due to the large number of term neonates (747) in comparison to the small number of premature neonates (63) that met the entrance criteria, we choose the control population in a 4:1 ratio from an alphabetical list of the 747 term neonates. We believe that the 244 selected control neonates would provide a reasonable sample size that was not too disproportionate to our premature neonate group and yet still provide a good representation of our term neonate population.</p>

<title>Preoperative and Operative Variables</title>
<p>The median gestational age for the premature group was 34 weeks with a range from 24 to 35 weeks. Ninety percent of the premature neonates were between 31 and 35 weeks of gestation; 8% were between 25 and 30 weeks of gestation; and only 2% were less than 25 weeks of gestation. Anatomic defects were classified as follows: 2 ventricle normal arch; 2 ventricle abnormal arch; single ventricle normal arch; and single ventricle abnormal arch. There was no significant difference between the premature versus term neonates in the classification of their anatomy. Premature neonates were older, weighed less at time of surgery, and underwent cardiopulmonary bypass procedures less frequently than term neonates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0885066610393662">Table 1</xref>
). Incidence of preoperative mechanical ventilation did not differ between the 2 groups (premature neonates 41% vs term neonates 38%; <italic>P</italic> = .6). Unfortunately, secondary to the retrospective nature of this study, information was not available from the birth hospital regarding the reason for initial intubation in all patients (elective secondary to prostaglandin initiation, apnea, cyanosis, respiratory insufficiency) although none of the patients suffered cardiac arrest prior to transport to our institution or prior to cardiac surgery. Operations were classified by risk adjustment for congenital heart surgery (RACHS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885066610393662">8</xref></sup>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0885066610393662">Table 1</xref>). The most common operations were coarctation repair (premature neonates 17% vs term neonates 14%), Norwood (premature neonates 13% vs term neonates 19%), Blalock Taussig shunt (premature neonates 21% vs term neonates 13%), and arterial switch operation (premature neonate 2% vs term neonate 12%).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Prematurity is a risk factor for morbidity and mortality following cardiac surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885066610393662">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885066610393662"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885066610393662"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885066610393662">5</xref></sup> Cardiac surgery is often delayed, substituted by supportive care in order to allow the premature neonate to gain weight and the organ systems to mature. Although this strategy is common, studies by Reddy et al and Chang et al have shown a significant mortality with supportive care alone, and no benefit to delaying surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885066610393662">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885066610393662">7</xref></sup> Reddy et al, Rossi et al, and Beyens et al separately reported that complete anatomic repair could be achieved with acceptable mortality (10%-22%) in low-birth-weight neonates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885066610393662">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885066610393662">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885066610393662">10</xref></sup> Others, including Dimmick et al, have reported palliative surgical procedures in the neonatal period for low-birth-weight neonates with similar early mortality (16%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885066610393662">11</xref></sup> The decision-making process for the timing of surgery is subjective and varies greatly among institutions. Our institutional philosophy is one of supportive care for premature neonates to allow for weight gain and organ maturation, with a goal weight of near 2 kg prior to cardiac surgery. With no universal standard of care, it is difficult to predict the risk−benefit ratio of cardiac surgery in a premature neonate versus supportive care while awaiting weight gain. Thus, the purpose of the current study was to examine the short-term outcomes following cardiac surgery in premature neonates adhering to our institutional philosophy of supportive care allowing for weight gain and organ maturation prior to cardiac surgery.</p>
<p>In the current study, the median gestational age for the premature group was 34 weeks, which reflects our institutional philosophy mentioned previously. In theory, the philosophy of supportive care allowing for weight gain and organ maturity may decrease the cardiopulmonary bypass risk of intracranial hemorrhage, renal dysfunction, and coagulopathy. However, this philosophy does not take into account the risk of preoperative management of the ductal-dependent premature neonates with prostaglandin, the increased energy expenditure of unrepaired heart disease, nor the effects of abnormal cardiovascular physiology, pressure and volume overload, and/or chronic hypoxia, while awaiting weight gain. The incidence of preoperative mechanical ventilation was similar between the premature and term neonates. Unfortunately, secondary to the retrospective nature of this study, information was not available regarding the reason for initial intubation at the birth hospital in all patients (elective secondary to prostaglandin initiation, apnea, respiratory insufficiency). Our institution is a free-standing children’s hospital with no attached birthing facility, therefore the premature neonates were managed by referring neonatologists and consulting cardiologists at the outside birthing hospital. It was impossible to obtain accurate information on the number of premature neonates who were never referred to our institution. Thus, commenting on the risk–benefit ratio of supportive care allowing for weight gain and organ maturation versus early cardiac surgery is out of the scope of this current study.</p>
<p>The current retrospective study was designed to review short-term outcomes in neonates less than 36 weeks of gestation, who underwent cardiac surgery within the first 30 days of life while receiving supportive care until reaching a weight of near 2 kg. Interestingly, overall, there was no difference in length of mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay, or mortality between premature and term neonates. This leads one to speculate that, at least in our patient population, premature neonates progressed with hemodynamic stability and overall postoperative recovery similar to those of term neonates.</p>
<p>When further classified into neonates undergoing non-cardiopulmonary bypass surgery, and neonates undergoing palliative procedures rather than complete anatomic repair when there was a choice, premature neonates in both the non-cardiopulmonary bypass and the palliation versus complete anatomic repair subgroups had longer mechanical ventilation times compared to their term counterparts. We speculate that the increased mechanical ventilation time in the premature neonates is likely explained by the combined hemodynamic effect of a palliative procedure and prematurity with at least some element of lung disease. Not surprisingly, premature neonates undergoing palliation rather than complete anatomic repair also had longer length of hospital stay than their term counterparts. Importantly, there was no statistical difference in mortality between the groups. Premature neonates undergoing palliative procedure versus complete anatomic repair did not undergo palliation more frequently than complete anatomic repair compared to term neonates. This may represent our institutional philosophy in the general management of those specific defects rather than our philosophy in the particular management of the premature, low-birth-weight neonate.</p>
<p>There was no statistical difference in length of mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay, or mortality in the premature versus term neonates undergoing cardiopulmonary procedures. Further, there was no statistical difference in any outcome variables between premature and term neonates who underwent complete anatomic repair versus palliation in such cardiac defects when there was a choice. This leads one to speculate that a cardiopulmonary bypass procedure is not contraindicated in the premature neonate. Unfortunately, the patient numbers are too small for any further meaningful conclusions or speculations regarding the choice of surgery, complete anatomic repair versus palliation in the premature neonate.</p>
<p>The limitations of this study include the relatively small number of premature neonates (63) and those inherent in any retrospective study. The overall mortality was low and the group sizes disproportionate, therefore making it difficult to draw conclusions. As our hospital is a free-standing children’s hospital with no attached birthing hospital, premature neonates are routinely managed at the referral institution until reaching a weight of near 2 kg before transferring to our facility. Therefore, it was out of the scope of this retrospective study to compare the risk–benefit ratio of the 2 strategies, deferring surgical intervention to allow for weight gain and organ maturity versus early cardiac surgical repair. This study was also not designed to compare the efficacy of surgical treatments, palliation versus complete anatomic repair.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, if the premature infant following our institutional philosophy of supportive care allowing for weight gain and organ maturation prior to cardiac surgery survives to undergo cardiac surgery there was no significant difference in mortality between the 2 groups regardless of how they were treated. Early outcome seems independent of weight, prematurity, use of cardiopulmonary bypass, and type of first intervention. Further long-term follow-up is needed in this patient population.</p>
