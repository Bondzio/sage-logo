<abstract>
<p>The article discusses three versions of context. First, UK Government legislation, the British Cattle Tracing System (CTS), as a context that frames and guides good farming practices to promote accountability for cattle movements and to control disease. It describes how the legislative context creates particular constructions of farmers, cows, and good and bad farming practices. Second, the article creates context as the local farm-based practices of cattle movement and monitoring. Differences and similarities between the legislative requirements and the farm-based practices are discussed. The farming practices are primarily practices of responsibility and care that are embodied, relational, collective, and responsive. The article draws upon feminist insights into responsibility and accountability  that accountability is mundane practices of touch, regard, looking back, and becoming with. Thereby, the article creates a third context in which local farming practices, legislation, and feminism meet and interact with one another. Within this “meta-context” of interferences between contexts, accountability is revisioned as the very condition of farm-based practices of care and responsibility. At the same time, the article revisions context as emergent in interferences and enacts alternative versions of farmers, cows, and good and bad practices.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The legislative context of farming in the United Kingdom has changed considerably in recent years, largely in response to recent disease outbreaks and concerns about food safety. In particular, increasingly demanding systems to promote accountability have been implemented.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0162243911418536">1</xref></sup> I have been researching the “implementation” of one of these systems on a group of farms in North West United Kingdom. The article presents ethnographic data about how the British Cattle Movement Service Cattle Tracing System (CTS) is done on the farm in everyday practices.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0162243911418536">2</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Hence, I begin this article enacting a particular version of “context”—as UK Government legislation on accountability that frames and guides farming practices in relation to cattle movement. The CTS aims to ensure a complete record of accountability for cattle movement in England, Scotland, and Wales and traceability of all cattle. In this sense, the CTS directs and frames farming practices of identifying and monitoring cattle movement and defines accountability for cattle movement as known through effective implementation of the System. Put another way, the CTS creates a <italic>specific context</italic> of accountability, which is a hybrid of particular versions of the person, the animal, and goods and bads.</p>
<p>Donna Haraway’s work, When Species Meet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162243911418536">2007</xref>), revisions accountability as an effect of mundane, prosaic interferences between species. Haraway’s work promotes a particular intellectual and political engagement with the CTS that focuses on its relation with farm-based practices. Attention to embodied practices troubles the assumption that accountability is an effect of the legislative context. Rather, local care practices generate accountability and thereby a second version of context is created—context as local farming practices.</p>
<p>Subsequently, guided by Haraway’s contention that “touch ramifies and shapes accountability” (2007, 36), I discuss farming practices around cattle movement alongside the legislation rather than in a hierarchical relation which assumes that the System directs practices. This goes some way to achieving analytical symmetry in relation to interrogating legislative and farm-based accountability. The farm-based practices of monitoring cattle movement fit with Donna Haraway’s sense of accountability as mundane practices of touch, regard, looking back, and becoming with. Farming practices of good cattle care are primarily practices of responsibility that are embodied, relational, collective, and responsive. Moreover, the System and the local practices of accountability interfere with one another in various ways. That is, farmers have to play, what one might think of as “context games” as the two versions of context—legislation and local practices—interfere with one another.</p>
<p>Thereby I create a third meta-context in which local practices, legislation, and feminist accountability meet and interfere with one another and produce a new version of accountability. Accountability is not a framing abstraction; it is the very condition of farm practices of care and responsibility. This revisioning of accountability does not undermine accountability but rather situates it and exposes the world-shaping consequences of mundane, prosaic practices.</p>
<p>Moreover, the third context is generated in interferences between contexts—local practices, legislation, and feminist accountability and is a revisioning of context that, at the same time, allows alternative constructions of farmers, cows, good, and bads. Context is revisioned as a productive, precarious, and potentially mobile effect of contexts touching that allows articulation of alternative versions of realties and moralities.</p>
<sec id="section2-0162243911418536">
<title>Researching the Contexts of Cattle Movement</title>
<p>In order to better understand farming practices around cattle identification, registration, and tracing, from 2007 to the present, I have carried out participant observation on two family farms and spoken to farmers of five additional local family farms. The family farms are varied in their size, land type (upland and lowland), livestock, crops, family membership, and their relationships to larger businesses. One of the farms has become a part of a consortium of local farms, which enables localized decisions about food production, marketing, and distribution. This farm occupies a position somewhere between agriculture and agribusiness. It is a large and varied, mainly upland, farm with fifty beef cattle, a dairy herd, sheep, and turkeys. The farmers are three generations of the same family and the younger farmer is diversifying into Environmental Stewardship and educational farm visits for groups. The second farm is a lowland farm of around 80 acres of land and seventy beef cattle. It is farmed by a semiretired farming couple who have farmed all of their lives. Two sons and two daughters live near by and help with farming but all are engaged in other professions. The other farms are very varied. For example, one is a medium-sized family farm. The two sons that now manage the farm keep a few beef cattle but have largely diversified to breed game birds and to provide paid storage of caravans and other large vehicles. Hence, the definition of family farm seems to be under negotiation in twenty-first-century Britain, partly in relation to understandings of, and national policies on, agri-environmental issues such as food miles, organic production, and landscape management but also in relation to the need to generate income in ways other than food production. There is also a reported growth in hobby farming and small holders—the differences between these and family farms is ambiguous (National Farmers' Union <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0162243911418536">[NFU] 2007</xref>). There is not a universal constitution of “family farm.”</p>
<p>In addition to the participant observation, I have carried out textual analysis of relevant literature available to farmers such as the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) Web site and advice literature received on the farms and also the various elements involved in farm-based cattle identification and movement such as cattle passports. Furthermore, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0162243911418536">Sally Hackers’ (1990)</xref> study in which she attended a course at an agricultural college to learn about the shift from agriculture to agri-business, in 2007-2008, I attended a taught course at my local agricultural college, part of which offered guidance on cattle identification, registration, and tracing—on implementing the UK Government CTS.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0162243911418536">3</xref></sup>

<title>Context 1: The CTS Legislation</title>
<p>The UK CTS is based in Workington, Cumbria, North United Kingdom and it aims to hold details of the birth, death, and movement of every bovine animal in the United Kingdom (not Ireland). European Union Legislation required all Member States to introduce a computerized tracing system by the end of 1999. The UK CTS was introduced on prior to  September 28, 1998, and has been developed and expanded since then. Recently, “CTS online” was established to enable online reporting of cattle births and movement, although all the farmers I spoke with and observed still used the “paper” system. Further, the European Commission is considering the introduction of electronic tagging for cattle with proposals expected in Autumn 2012 (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0162243911418536">[DEFRA] 2011</xref>). DEFRA states that currently “Great Britain has a registered herd of over 8 million cattle … spread over 90,000 registered holdings. Over 2.5 million cattle are born each year and in 2010 13.5 million movements of cattle were reported.”</p>
<p>The CTS is a key part of the Government response to outbreaks of animal diseases. Lucy, who previously worked for the UK government Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), explains:<disp-quote>
<p>With BSE, Foot and Mouth, Bird Flu, the legislation has been heaped on, and it’s still coming. (Lucy February 6, 2007)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The DEFRA Web site 2011 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ww2.DEFRA.gov.uk">http://ww2.DEFRA.gov.uk</ext-link>) defines the key issues surrounding the health and welfare, identification, and movement of farm animals as:<disp-quote>
<p>Disease outbreaks and the measures to control them can carry wide and costly consequences for public health, the economy and the environment. Vigilance and good stockmanship are vital in the fight against animal disease. Monitoring animals for signs of disease, and following good farming practices are essential ways of reducing the risk of disease and preventing the spread of disease.</p>
<p>As a livestock keeper there are things you must do. For example, you must register as a keeper and correctly identify your livestock. There are also rules about the movements of livestock. These help to prevent the spread or outbreak of animal diseases.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Further guidance is provided via a “business link:”<disp-quote>
<p>Cattle identification and traceability are important for disease control and also for maintaining consumer confidence in farm produce. There are standards and rules for identifying and controlling cattle movement to prevent and trace the spread of disease. (DEFRA, accessed February 2011, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?lang=en&amp;topicId=1082247655)">http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?lang=en&amp;topicId=1082247655)</ext-link></p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The above-mentioned “standards and rules for identifying and controlling cattle movement” that constitute The British Cattle Movement Service CTS are described as a series of things that “keepers have to do:”</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>All cattle born on their holdings are tagged within set time limits</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Cattle passport applications are received by the British Cattle Movement Service within 27 days of birth</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Farm holding registers are kept up to date</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>All movement documentation is completed and welfare rules are observed when movements are undertaken</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Movements comply with the condition of the General License for the Movement of Cattle</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>6 day standstill periods are adhered to and movements are reported within 3 days</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>deaths of cattle are reported within 7 days</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>they cooperate with cattle inspections as and when required (5% of cattle holdings are inspected on a yearly basis. This will fall to 3% from June 2011; DEFRA, February 11, 2011)</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The technologies of the System as experienced on the farm will be described in greater detail below. Suffice to say here, the CTS offers various gains should the UK be gripped by another epizootic. It aims to hold knowledge of all cattle movement and to monitor cattle movement through bringing all those involved into account. It is both a response and an attempt to prevent the reoccurrence of horrors previously experienced, for example, the 2001 UK Foot and Mouth Disease outbreak. This outbreak is associated with funeral pyres of piles of slaughtered animals, a high emotional, social, and financial cost to farming families, limited public access to the countryside, damage to rural economies through detrimental effect on tourism and debates and confusion about cause and treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0162243911418536">Law 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0162243911418536">Mort et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0162243911418536">Convery et al. 2008</xref>). The extent of the outbreak was worsened by lack of knowledge and control of animal movement. The media images traveled widely and portrayed the stench of rotting carcasses and inefficient, “impure” records contaminated by “bad” farming practices of record keeping and poor care of animals.</p>
<p>Many commentators have argued that the responses to the outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease in 2001 were too slow resulting in greater slaughter of animals and loss of livelihoods. The decision making was slow and the spread of disease was poorly understood. The CTS promises the potential for faster decision making. It facilitates good farming practices that are more closely monitored. In turn this will ensure more effective farm record keeping. In the case of a disease outbreak, better records will allow efficient tracking of animals with the disease and hence prevention of the spread of infection. The consequence for farmers could be greater focus of slaughter and hence reduced loss of livestock. The disease could be contained more quickly. Hence, the CTS promises more effective management of disease and many farmers recognize this as one of the goods of the System.</p>
<p>Farmers are also aware that more effective management of disease may also improve sales of beef, especially in Europe. Beef consumption has reduced in recent years due to consumer concerns about human health and cattle welfare. The System aims to ensure that beef is fully traceable in terms of where it comes from, where it has been, where and how it is slaughtered. Food miles can be recorded, places of slaughter and conditions of transport can be monitored, and farm practices can be inspected. DEFRA claims, “Cattle tracing is now an integral part of the Government’s commitment to improve consumer confidence in British Beef” (Rural Payments Agency Web site, February 2011). Further, Lucy, an ex-DEFRA employee states, “I would eat anything now if it is produced in the UK; the systems are very good for the consumer.” (6.2.07)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0162243911418536">4</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The gains and security described above are an effect of the CTS achieving its aim of complete accountability for cattle movement. They also depend on the CTS seen as improving on past farm practices. Lucy, introduced above, describes the System in the following way:<disp-quote>
<p>It holds every bit of information. It was difficult to get this up and running. Now it works incredibly well. We have full traceability of animals. It is a super system. (Lucy 6.2.07)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0162243911418536">5</xref></sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Cattle must be enrolled in the system in order for the farmer to move, eat, or sell the cattle. Lucy said, “If they do not participate in the system their animal is worth nothing.” (6.2.07) The System punishes deviance by withholding payments and preventing sale or movement of livestock. It is claimed that the System provides more comprehensive and accessible records of animal movement than previously available. “We have had to clean up our farm systems, to become pure as pure. Now it’s extremely clean. It’s all about traceability and now we have full traceability of animals. We have excellent systems” (Lucy 6.2.07). Excellent records of cattle movement are associated with “purity and cleanliness” by Lucy because they aim to provide comprehensive knowledge of cattle movement and increased accountability of farmers, animal movers, and sellers and also to be an improvement on past practices that have been related to disease.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0162243911418536">6</xref></sup>
</p>
<sec id="section4-0162243911418536">
<title>Technologies of the CTS</title>
<p>Below I describe what is involved in the System for the farmers. The System enacts itself as the context that frames and guides good farming practices and that if it is effectively implemented, full traceability of and accountability for cattle movement will be achieved, disease will be prevented, and beef sales will improve. Accountability is constructed as an achievement of the CTS being implemented on the farm. The legislation enacts itself as the context that defines and monitors good farming practices and allows accountability to be known. However, it will become evident that the CTS places a burden upon the farmer and the cattle in relation to a series of farm-based practices that include various technologies and “paperwork.”</p>
<sec id="section5-0162243911418536">
<title>All cattle must have ear tags for the CTS to work</title>
<p>Tags are identification ear attachments. They are inserted into the calf’s ear soon after birth by the farmer on the farm. Lucy said, “A tag is for life; it cannot be changed or taken out. It is the identity of the animal” (January 31, 2007 Agricultural College). In dairy herds, the animal must be tagged within thirty-six hours of birth, for beef herds within twenty days from birth. Since  January 1, 1998, all animals must wear two official tags (normally one in each ear). Each tag bears a crown logo, UK prefix (country code), herd number, and the animal’s unique lifetime identification number. The farmer allocates this number according to the herd register. Farmers must buy the tags and there are regulations about the size and character of the tags. The tags have recently risen in price, the price varies by supplier but one farmer described a rise from around 50 pence to 2.50 GBP. As one farmer said:<disp-quote>
<p>One of the worst things about the system is the cost of the tags. I know the old-fashioned tags were smaller and more difficult to read but the new ones get pulled out much easier, then we have the cost of replacing them. We have noticed how much more this is costing us. (CB, April 7, 2011)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The primary ear tag is yellow, plastic, and comes in two pieces. It is a minimum of 45 mm high and 55 mm wide with letters a minimum of 5 mm high. Farmers must ensure that regulation tags are inserted within deadlines, that they remain in place (and are replaced if lost) and that they correspond with written records. The tags are inserted via a handheld gun. The farmers must restrain the young calf (or the cow when replacing a lost tag), hold the gun to the ear, and release the trigger to force the pin through the ear. The calf or cow usually resists the restraint and jumps when the pin is inserted. Some farmers have been injured during this process—either by the calf or cow moving and resisting or by a protective mother cow.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0162243911418536">
<title>All cattle must have a passport</title>
<p>British Farmers must register their cattle and report all births, deaths, and movement within the CTS. Within twenty-seven days of birth (that is within seven days from tagging) farmers must apply for a passport for a calf. The passport contains all the animals details, including the ear tag number, breed, sex, date of birth and genetic dam and the date the passport is issued (and re-issued). When a calf is born, the farmer allocates it one of the passports he has been sent from DEFRA having inserted the ear tag with the matching number. The farmer signs it and attaches one of the farm’s bar code labels. This bar code sticker is the key to how the CTS works. It is a computerized system. The bar code stickers supplied to the farmer include the name and address in English, but the system works by reading bar codes.</p>
<sec id="section6a-0162243911418536">
<title>It is a statutory requirement that a herd register is kept</title>
<p>is up to date for each animal, and has no missing information. It must include the following information to be completed within specific deadlines:</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Most farmers I have met keep a handwritten record. For example, one of the farmers in this study, Jack, keeps a book, the size of an A4 pad, obtained from DEFRA. He reviews it and writes in it daily. He records more information than is deemed essential by the CTS. He makes notes about the individual animals including about their temperament, where they calf, if they have been unwell and any medication. He writes in pencil so that he can correct any mistakes. He keeps the book next to the table in the kitchen so it is easily accessible and so that he can sit down while writing it. Some farmers keep their register in their cattle housing.</p>
<p>Observing Jack it is evident that this formal written record is in addition to the wealth of information that he holds in his head and can retrieve as needed. I witnessed on numerous occasions Jack making a decision about an animal’s health and needs based on knowledge gained from interacting with the animal over time. Furthermore, Jack holds and incorporates his experiential knowledge of and informal evaluation of the body shape, physical build, and temperament of an animal within decisions about breeding and selling.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0162243911418536">
<title>Farmers must keep accurate movement records</title>
<p>When an animal leaves a holding, the farmer must fill in one of the tear out sections in the passport, tick the box for either on or off movement (onto the holding or off the holding), complete the date of movement, attach the sticky holding label, sign the card, and then detach and post the movement card.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0162243911418536">7</xref></sup> The CTS reads the bar code sticker and updates the record for that particular animal. It is a statutory requirement to report all cattle movements through the CTS.</p>
<p>Movement includes moves to and from temporary holdings or between holdings in the same business. As detailed in the table above, there are deadlines to be met. Farm records of movement must be completed within thirty-six hours by both farmers (or by the farmer and the auction). The passport must be returned to British Cattle Movement Service within three days.</p>
<p>The technologies described above are the practices and materials that constitute the implementation of the CTS on the farm. They aim to ensure accountability of farmers and others involved in cattle movement and create good farming practices that prevent disease, promote animal welfare, and facilitate sale of beef. However, at the same time, implementing the technologies on the farm places considerable demands on farming practices.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0162243911418536">8</xref></sup> In fact, a tutor at the Agricultural College suggests that there are tensions between the System and farm practices of care of cattle when she says:<disp-quote>
<p>It is good legislation in that it is there to protect the consumer. But, unfortunately, it has placed a huge burden on the farmer. Whether you farm 3 acres or 3000, the paperwork is exactly the same. (Lucy, 6.2.07, Agricultural College)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In each of the farms I have visited and worked on, the increase in technologies for monitoring farm practices was talked about and lamented by the farmers. Many of the farmers stated that they receive many letters, leaflets, and notices from DEFRA, which outline changes to be made in farming practices. The paperwork is tied to numerous technologies for monitoring farming practices and demands their implementation or the farmers might lose funding and/or their livestock. Many of the farmers expressed feelings of being overwhelmed by the demands of the legislation and of anxiety about missing something or doing something wrong. One farmer says, “It’s a full time job just keeping up with the paperwork…. Keeping the livestock alive is one thing. Keeping on the right side of DEFRA … that’s another.” (Mary, January 2007)</p>
<p>Lucy, the College tutor introduced above who had previously worked for DEFRA, was introduced to the farmers and myself attending the college course as having immense experience and expertise in the “very demanding systems of farm paperwork” (6.2.07, Agricultural College). Lucy began her introductory lecture saying, “Farm Records: There’s always plenty of paperwork!” She then asked the audience, “Could you cope with this?” and listed a selection of paperwork that farmers deal with on a daily basis. For example, movement data, land register, cattle registration, flock record, pesticide record, herd register, inland revenue, soil plan, accounts, medicine record, fertilizer records, milk records, value-added tax (VAT), waste records, and Agric census. In addition, there are optional claim forms that a farmer might pursue, such as single payment scheme (SPS) or the environmental stewardship scheme. Framed by the question, “Could you cope?” Lucy’s introduction and the farmers’ attendance on the course suggest that there has been an unmanageable increase in the amount and the diversity of legislation that has placed considerable demands on the farmer.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0162243911418536">9</xref></sup> Indeed, Lucy states that the UK system of farm records is a very complex system, one of the most complex in the world, especially the systems for movement of animals. There are different systems for movement of different species. The British Cattle Movement Service CTS has been heralded as one of the best systems in the world at achieving complete traceability of cattle.</p>
<p>The above account of the CTS shows that the legislation both enacts and depends upon a specific version of context as that which frames and guides practices. The CTS enacts itself as a context of “knowing” accountability. It aims to direct and control farming practices from outside the farm. The legislation is “real” in that it exists and must be engaged with the farm, otherwise farmers can lose money and cattle. At the same time, it is discursive as it constructs a version of farmers, animals, and good (and bad) farming practices that attempt to transcend specific locations of implementation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0162243911418536">10</xref></sup> Cows are a resource, a source of income. They are also potential disease carriers. They are individualized through their identification number, ear tag, and passport and in many ways they are enacted as independent of their specific location and relationships to their herds and farmers. Farmers are animal breeders, movers, and managers who are individuals, independent of their relationships with their family, animals, land, other farmers, and their own health. They are enacted as in need of education about cattle care. Particular practices of record keeping and of caring for and moving animals are “good” and other practices are not recognized or are “bad” in that they may prevent traceability and facilitate spread of disease. In part, it is through these constructions that the System places considerable physical, social, emotional, and moral demands on the farmers. These are detailed further below through ethnographic data about how the System is done on the farm.</p>

<title>Feminist Accountability</title>
<p>Above I have introduced accountability for cattle movement as a consequence of the legislative system of the CTS. In doing so, I have introduced context as that which frames and directs local practices. I have suggested that the CTS places considerable demands on the farmers through its technologies and its construction of particular versions of farmers, cattle, and good and bad practices. It is these constructions and the associated versions of accountability and of context that I want to interfere with. Recent feminist insights provide a way of revisioning accountability and context.</p>
<p>A commitment to accountability is crucial for much feminist practice and theorizing. For example, in 1988, Donna Haraway, a feminist scholar of technoscience, published what has become a highly influential paper about the nature of feminist knowledge. The paper is:<disp-quote>
<p>… an argument for situated and embodied knowledges and against various forms of unlocatable, and so irresponsible, knowledge claims. Irresponsible means unable to be called into account. (1988/1991, p. 191)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>For Haraway, being able to be called into account is essential and is what distinguishes “good” feminist knowledges from other knowledge claims. In the paper quoted above, Haraway argues that responsible knowledge claims are those that can be called to account. She tells us that responsible knowledges are those that are embedded and embodied, what she terms “situated knowledges.” Situated knowledges is not about being located in one place, it is rather about being embedded in multiple places and spaces. Haraway challenges knowledges that claim legitimacy as a consequence of a lack of embededdness, subjectivity, and specificity. The latter is what Haraway calls the “God Trick” because the legitimacy of the knowledge rests upon claims to speak from nowhere, to be outside of any context, and to be thereby “modestly witnessing” observable facts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0162243911418536">Shapin &amp; Schaffer, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>Haraway argues this claim to omniscience is a trick. She argues that knowledge claims always come from somewhere in particular and the act of witnessing always interferes with that which is witnessed. So, following Haraway, it would seem that accountability is about acknowledging that we are all involved in reality making rather than seeking an observational distance from reality. She urges us to accept this because, “In this way we might be answerable for what we learn to see.” She goes on, “Another way of putting it is when I discuss feminist accountability within the context of scientific objectivity as requiring a knowledge tuned to resonance, not to dichotomy” (1991, 71).</p>
<p>Haraway’s concept of “situated knowledges” thereby challenges claims to legitimacy based upon objectivity, unsituatedness, and distance. Such knowledge claims are unable to be called to account. Rather, Haraway’s feminist knowledge gains objectivity because it is embedded and able to be called to account. In direct contrast to the God’s Eye perspective, Haraway’s “modest witness” is embodied, located, and modest because it is aware that it speaks from embeddedness in multiple locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0162243911418536">Haraway, 1997</xref>). It is tied to places and spaces rather than being outside of them. It witnesses not in a passive, disinterested objective mode but in an active, interested, knowing, embodied, and relational mode that seeks to interfere with, and be accountable for, that which it is witnessing.</p>
<p>More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0162243911418536">Haraway (2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162243911418536">2007</xref>) has developed these arguments in relation to the question of the nature of “humanness” and relations between species and in doing so has written more explicitly about accountability. In particular, she has written about the importance of “touch” in relation to accountability.<disp-quote>
<p>My premise is that touch ramifies and shapes accountability. Accountability, caring for, being affected, and entering into responsibility are not ethical abstractions; these mundane, prosaic things are the result of having truck with each other … Touch, regard, looking back, becoming with—all these make us responsible in unpredictable ways for which worlds take shape … Touch and regard have consequences. (2007, 36)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Touch is multiple. We are touched by things and things touch us— physically, socially, historically, and personally. Accountability is revisioned as a “mundane, prosaic thing” rather than as an abstraction. This troubles the construction of accountability as made through the legislative context of the CTS. Rather, accountability is that which is <italic>done</italic>, through “going on together”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0162243911418536">11</xref></sup> with others in embodied mundane interactions, rather than that which is <italic>known</italic> in the legislative system’s documents and computers. Moreover, this revisioning of accountability creates another version of a context of accountability—context as local embodied practices. This revisioning shifts the research question. It is no longer to ask how is the legislation implemented (or not) on the farm and to explore the implementation gaps between the legislation and farm practices. Rather, the central question becomes, how is accountability for cattle identification and movement done in local practices on the farm? This is the focus of the following sections of this article.</p>

<title>Responsibility to “Things”—Touching and being Touched by Things</title>
<disp-quote>
<p>We had a call the other day, said that one of our cattle was out on the road. It wasn’t one of ours, we thought it was probably one of Steve’s. We put it into our field, called him and he collected it later…. Turned out a car had come off the road the night before, knocked down his fence and drove off without telling him. The cow got out and went for a walk. (Laughs) … A good walk, down to back of beyond. Probably trying to get to the other cows. It was bellowing to get in with em so she (telephone caller) thought it was one of ours… Anyhow, we kept it off the road. (Jack September 1, 2006)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Any movement of cattle outside a five mile radius within a holding or onto another holding where it is likely to mix with livestock from another holding must be recorded in the farm movement record and via the CTS. The movement described above was not recorded in any formal way. It is something farmers are faced with on a fairly regular basis. Here there is a loss of accountability to the CTS.</p>
<p>Loss of accountability is a failure of the CTS because knowledge of all cattle movement is necessary to full traceability. However, full control of cattle movement on the farm is a precarious achievement. It is not possible all of the time. Farmers are often faced with the unexpected. In this example, the fence was no longer a fence, the car did not stay on the road, and the cow did not stay in the field. A specific collision of events and materials led to movement of a cow from one holding to another in an unanticipated and uncontrolled manner. Crucially, in dealing effectively and efficiently with the unanticipated movement, the farmer did not engage with the CTS. It was an instance of cattle movement that the farmer felt was too temporary and unexpected to be reported to the System. Moreover, responsibility to the cow overrode responsibility to the CTS in that if the regulations of the System had been prioritized Jack would have ignored the cow as it did not belong to him, certainly he would not have placed it in his own field for safe keeping.</p>
<p>For the CTS accountability is about control and complete knowledge of cattle movement. On the farm, being accountable is an effect of responsibility to many “things” including the CTS and also the cattle. These practices of responsibility are dynamic as sometimes things that had worked well together begin to compete with one another or unpredictably change, such as the fences, the cars, and the cattle. Cattle farming is embedded in an array of materials that are always unknowable in their entirety and that interfere with the CTS version of accountability.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0162243911418536">12</xref></sup> In farming practice, <italic>responsibility to the cattle</italic> may challenge accountability to the CTS.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section11-0162243911418536">
<title>Responsibility to Collectives—Regard for Others</title>
<p>In the above example, Jack subsequently explained to me that his central concern was for his neighboring farmer, local motorists, and the cow. He wanted to get the cow off the road as quickly as possible; this would prevent accidental damage to the cow, if hit by a car, to a motorist whose vehicle could collide with the cow, and loss of livelihood for his neighbor. Cattle movement on the farm is located in specific relations of responsibility to fellow farmers, their livelihoods and their cows, and to the local community.</p>
<p>Another example of responsibility to collectives is the farm practice of “bull hire.” The CTS regulations state that movement to another holding, even for bull hire, must be recorded in the movement book and via the passports. Bull hire is where a bull is taken to another holding to service the cows. The alternative is to use Artificial Insemination and there is considerable support for this as best practice as it is reduced risk in relation to biosecurity—spread of infection. Indeed, there is a strong argument that keeping a bull is risky on too many grounds—health and safety (they are extremely big and strong animals), economic (they eat a lot for little gain), and biosecurity (they can cross contaminate infections).</p>
<p>On the other hand, some of the small farms I observed keep a bull to run with their herd. Moreover, the bulls travel to other farms to run with other herds. Reasons for this are multiple. Some farmers said that they like having a bull. They like to see a bull in the field, “a magnificent animal when they look their best.” They also talk about it making good sense in relation to greater chance of success in impregnating cows. The reproductive cycle of a cow is central to the success of a dairy or beef cattle farm. Cows must be in calf within a particular time frame following the birth of a previous calf. And cows are fertile for just one day. The signs of fertility can be ambiguous and to identify the day on which the Artificial Insemination (AI) staff must visit to inseminate the cow must be carefully monitored. If the herd runs with a bull, there is less chance of missing the fertile day and less need for close surveillance.</p>
<p>So, some farmers do like a bull to run with their herd and one way to off set the costs of keeping a bull is to share a bull between herds. That is, neighboring farmers borrow a bull for a short time. This alleviates the owner’s costs of keeping a bull slightly. The CTS requires “bull hire” to be fully recorded and monitored. In practice, this does not always happen. In one instance, a bull is walked along a bridleway next to the farm to go to service the cows at the neighboring farm. Having observed this practice, I also know that this presents an opportunity for the farmers to meet, to talk, to discuss their farming practices as well as to update on respective family activities. It is a social activity. The farmer described it as lending his bull to a neighbor, as an informal favor to a friend. The practice is also an exchange of skills and resources in that the neighbor offered future assistance to the farmer when needed in exchange for the loan of the bull. More subtly the farmer reflected on his neighbor’s skills as a good stockman and farmer and his pride that his bull was sought by his neighbor. This suggests that the loan of the bull is also a tacit demonstration of mutual respect and validation of farming skills and care practices. Hence, it seems that this example of unrecorded bull hire is a <italic>practice of responsibility to a collective</italic>. The practice is incompatible with the CTS because it is an informal caring exchange between neighbors. This practice does not fit the CTS demands for accountability because this movement onto another holding is not recorded via the System movement records.</p>
<p>The CTS creates a particular version of cattle. It tends toward individualism—that of the farmer and each cow. However, on the farm, cattle are part of a herd and the farmer and the farming family are part of a farming community. Care of cattle on the farm involves responsibility to the collectives—communities and herds.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0162243911418536">13</xref></sup>

<title>Responsibility to Continuity—Looking Back</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0162243911418536">John Gray (2000)</xref> has written about Scottish border farms and the handing down of farm craft. Bill, a semiretired farmer of a small family farm of sixty beef cattle, spoke about how he learned farming practices when working on his grandparent’s farm. His grandfather was a farmer and butcher in the 1930s.<disp-quote>
<p>He would take my elbow and lead me, without saying anything. Sometimes we walked all the way across a field in total silence. Then he’d show me a nest with young birds in it. He loved the birds and animals and plants. He knew where they all were around the farm. He wanted me to be careful when working around the nest. He would do the same in the fields, if there was an unusual plant growing or something nesting I had to avoid those places when mowing the grass, and he would keep the cattle off them. (Bill February 4, 2007)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>I have many examples of this kind of moving description of farming practices as being passed along generations. Farm practices as learned through doing and as sets of continuities that are practices of responsibility to a past and to a legacy of particular farming practices.</p>
<p>Moreover, the above example suggests that some farming practices are “done” rather than “known.” That is, they may be practiced without being made explicit or even acknowledged. In some ways then, these practices may not be accessible to being made accountable as they are not necessarily articulated. For example, farmers working with cattle that are calving often reflect upon their local knowledge of the cows. The knowledge may not be recorded or articulated and includes the individual history of the cow, how many times she has calved before, what the birth was like, if the cow was a “good” mother, if she is very protective and hence there is a need to be wary and cautious around her. A further example is of a farmer who delayed tagging a calf because he knew, from previous experience of the mother, that she was likely to be aggressively protective and very distressed by the attempt to capture and tag her new born calf too soon. He delayed tagging until the mother was calmer and the tagging was easier and safer. The cows often have a local history that is included in what is best practice in relation to the particular animal in specific situations. These farm practices are <italic>responsibilities to continuity with the past</italic>.</p>
<p>While the CTS generates continuities in terms of traces of the movements of individual animals, at the same time the technologies of the System punctuate farm practices with discrete moments of accountability. It creates beginnings and endings rather than continuities, flows, and links to the past.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0162243911418536">14</xref></sup> Practices that are unarticulated and located in specific knowledge of an animal or an embodiment of years of practice are displaced or colonized by the demands for articulation, explication, and universality of the CTS, such as tagging a calf as soon as possible after birth.</p>

<speaker>Mary:</speaker>
<p>Well we have calves born dead sometimes. Not very often but sometimes.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Vicky:</speaker>
<p>What do you do then; do you have to ear tag?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Mary:</speaker>
<p>No, no you don’t then, you just tell them and that’s okay. But, y’know, well, (hesitates) well, you’re supposed to get the ear tag in quickly and the passport sent off, I think it’s within 7 days. Well, once, we couldn’t do that. We were late. We’d been away and busy. We just said it was born 2 days later than it had been born. You couldn’t do that if it was more than a few days. I mean we wouldn’t do it for any longer. (Mary February 4, 2007)</p>
</speech>
</p>
<p>The CTS expects farm practices to work to a timetable for ear tagging and passport completion. It cuts across the complexities of farming everyday life. Keeping to a strict timetable is not possible on the farm because the farmer has responsibilities to an array of entities that can and do make demands, such as taking a family holiday. Indeed, even though the CTS is located somewhere, in offices in Workington, from the perspective of farm practices it is unsituated and disembodied.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the accountability demands of the System occasionally dovetail with the embodied responsibilities of farm practices and we can see how they “become with one another” in the making of responsible farming practice:<disp-quote>
<p>He (her husband) puts the ear tags in as soon as they are born, usually. It’s easier. You can actually sit on the calf. He gets one of the lads (his sons) to do it, or someone else; he can’t easily do it, especially not on his own, he’s not fit enough. It gets harder if they (the calves) are older and the lads go mad because it’s more difficult. (Mary 02/07)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Tagging soon after birth is deemed best practice by both the System and the farmers, but for different reasons. For the System, it maintains accountability—all births are recorded and the farmer can be held accountable. For the farmer, early tagging enacts responsible care of the calf and the farmer, as the calf is most easy to handle and usually less stressed than when they get older and larger.</p>
<p>The timetable for tagging is enacted differently in the CTS and in the farming practices. In the former, it is linear, disembodied, and calculable. It is made of numbers on a piece of paper and of discrete moments of accountability. In the latter, it is embodied and embedded in a flow of events. It involves responsibility to an array of heterogeneous elements that include the requirements of the CTS but also the size and aggression of the cattle, the needs of the farming family, and the health and strength of the farmer. Sometimes these multiple responsibilities collide with one another and yet this example shows how, at other times, the responsibilities find ways of coconstituting one another in farming practices.</p>

<title>Responsibility is Responsive—“Becoming With …”</title>
<p>The Cattle Identification Inspections on the farm are an especially intense moment when the CTS and the farm practices meet. This is one account:
<speech>
<speaker>Mary:</speaker>
<p>They don’t give you much notice. We’ve had 2. The first one was useless, she just went into the field, well the cattle were out when she came. She walked around with them, counted them and said everything is fine. But the second visit, two came, with a print out with all our numbers on. They were matching their paper with the ear tag numbers with our records…. Then they found a problem…. She said, I have to put it down, nothing will happen, there’s only this one, I just have to mark it down.</p>

<speech>
<speaker>Vicky:</speaker>
<p>What happened?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Mary:</speaker>
<p>… It was that there was a discrepancy between my husband’s book and their records and the ear tag. The ear tag and their records said one number, Jack’s book said another…. He’s a devil for putting an extra naught in. Now I always double check, I say, what’s the number of the mother and then we go from that and check the number of the calf … This time, he looked in his book, and he always writes in pencil, and it had smudged, it looked like a different number, not a naught, with the pencil smudge.</p>

<speech>
<speaker>Vicky:</speaker>
<p>What happened?</p>

<speaker>Mary:</speaker>
<p>We got a letter from DEFRA a few weeks after, telling us we had had a discrepancy and that others could affect our single payment. It frightened him, he said, we could have lost money.

</speech>
</p>
<p>Later that day Jack, in an extremely anxious tone, explains one of the complexities of cattle identification on the farm:<disp-quote>
<p>We get sent 100 passports at a time and then I order the matching ear tags. … Now, our last calf was number 700109, what do you think the number of the next one will be? Well, it’s 100110, and the one after that is 200111. It doesn’t make much sense.</p>
</disp-quote>
His wife adds:<disp-quote>
<p>No wonder he puts in an extra naught, its confusing, it doesn’t follow on and if you get a pencil smudge or an extra naught, well! … but now we are very careful.</p>
</disp-quote>
The farm inspection is a specific instance of the CTS coming face to face with the daily work that is involved in its implementation. Further, that work is exposed as far from straightforward as the numbers do not follow an expected progression and the materials involved are fluid, for example, the pencil marks smudge.</p>
<p>As the previous fieldwork examples have shown, implementing the CTS on the farm depends upon skilled and complex farming practices of responsibility to multiple and diverse entities including the CTS, the cattle, and the farming family. These farm practices involve local materials such as a pencil, a notebook, a kitchen table, cattle, and fields. At any moment, for example, through the farm inspection, the practices can be held to account and examined through the lens of accountability. When this happens, the inevitable precariousness of farming practices are exposed and, moreover, we glimpse that there are important differences between farming practices of responsibility and CTS practices of accountability in relation to cattle movement. The former are located on the farm and are relational, embodied, and materially heterogeneous. They are situated in a historical, social, material, and geographical location. In contrast, the System aims to transcend particular geographical, social, material, and historical locations.</p>
<p>The fieldwork example describes a moment when the System practices and the farming practices hit up against one another and there is discomfort for both the Inspectors and the farmers. Postcolonial Science Studies scholar, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0162243911418536">Helen Verran (1999)</xref>, has written about moments when different knowledge systems collide and create uncomfortable disconcertment. She argues that the moments of disconcertment should be taken seriously as moments when different systems find, in practice, ways to “go on together” that are respectful of the differences between them. In this example, the Inspectors record the discrepancy between their paperwork and the farm practices but note that nothing will happen because there are no other discrepancies and, I think, because they are aware that these farmers are not trying to deceive. So, while this is a moment where practices of responsibility and practices of accountability collide at the same time it is a moment where they find a way of “going on together” and “becoming with” one another as the Inspectors mark the discrepancy while reassuring the farmers.</p>

<title>Interferences</title>
<sec id="section16-0162243911418536">
<title>When Contexts Meet: Legislation, Local Practices, and Feminism</title>
<p>In the previous section, I have given an account of how the farmers play, what we might call, “context games.” They negotiate the legislative context and the local context in their care of cattle.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0162243911418536">16</xref></sup> I too have engaged in context games. I have created a meta-context in which local farming practices, legislation, and feminist accountability touch and interfere with one another.</p>
<p>Paraphrasing the title of Donna Haraway’s recent book, <italic>When Species Meet</italic> (2007), is perhaps an overly mundane and inappropriate consideration of Haraway’s insights, given that she is concerned with the coconstruction of species and the nature of the human. However, much feminist work argues that important questions of ethics and politics are answered in daily activities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0162243911418536">Hacker 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0162243911418536">Haraway 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0162243911418536">Mol 2008</xref>). Articulating the work of living with the CTS on the farms informed by feminist concerns about embodiment and ethics is about articulating good ways to live and thereby relates directly to Haraway’s concerns. In her exploration of humanness through the coconstruction of wolves, dogs, and humans, she asks the question, “who or what do I touch when I touch my dog?” This is a political and ethical question about world making similar to that asked by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0162243911418536">Hacker (1990)</xref> about what is touched by the move from agriculture to agribusiness and in a limited way by myself when I explore who or what is touched by this particular farming legislation.</p>
<p>Attending to “touch” demands attention to practices, to embodied interaction and to co-implication of “species.” In the current study, it has facilitated a symmetrical analysis rather than one focused on how the legislation is implemented (or not) on the farm. The latter assumes that the legislative system directs and defines farming practices. In contrast, my interest is in the co-evolution of the legislation, farming practices, and cattle movement through how they touch one another. This revisions “legislative context” as emergent with local embodied practices rather than being the abstract framing for those practices. Context is constructed within and through entities touching.</p>
<p>I have presented an account of how the System, farmers, and cattle interact and “touch one another.” Through interferences between local practices, the technologies of the legislation, and feminist theorizing, I have shown that the CTS creates specific constructions of farmers, cows, and good and bad farming practices. I have shown how local farming practices sometimes create alternative versions of farmers, cows, and good and bad farming practices. The different versions occasionally collide, at other times they go along together or are productive of new versions.</p>
<p>Lucy, the ex-government farm inspector expresses her ambivalence and her discomfort with the technologies of the legislation and its constructions of farmers and good farming practice when she states:<disp-quote>
<p>The increase in legislation is one of the reasons I don’t work for DEFRA any longer. It felt like a policing bureaucracy. For 30 years I felt that I was helping the farmer. I would go onto farms and they’d offer me a cup of tea and sit down and chat. That stopped…. Later when I was training teams of Inspectors, they would tell me how badly they were treated by farmers. The farmers would be angry and aggressive to the Inspectors. I told them; put yourself in that farmer’s position … We can give only 48 hours notice of Inspection. Many farmers will spend those 48 hours worrying, in a state, they could lose serious money if one cow hasn’t got the right paperwork … The care has gone. (06/02/07, Agricultural College)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In the above quote, Lucy describes a clashing of contexts—the legislation and the local practices—and of versions of the farmer, the animal, and good practice. The legislation, and its version of accountability, has interfered with and damaged practices of care. In place of the care and support provided by the Government workers, there is paperwork, monitoring practices, and technologies and anxiety in the name of the “policing bureaucracy” of accountability. Rather than attention to a relationship between the inspectors and the farmers and apprehension of the located skills, experiences, and emotions of farmers and the government workers, there is an attempt to impose a System, exclusion of different practices, and penalties for deviation.</p>
<p>It seems that the legislative context constructs subjectivity in a particular way, that of the farmers and of the government workers—as rational implementation of guidelines, individualized and independent of personal and social networks, and geographical and historical locations. This subjectivity is troubled when the contexts of local practices, legislation, and feminist theorizing interfere with one another. The subjectivity enacted in the interferences is located, embodied, tied into complex personal, social, geographical, and historical networks. It is responsive and fluid: a <italic>relational subjectivity</italic> rather than an individual one.</p>
<p>The CTS aims to call cattle farmers to account. It enacts itself as the context that guides and controls farm practices of accountability for cattle movement. The System claims to hold information about all cattle movement and to achieve full traceability of cattle through practices of accountability that include tagging cattle, posting passports, and facilitating farm inspections. The local farming practices offer a different perspective on accountability for cattle movement. The practices are embodied, located, relational, and responsive. On the farm we see that accountability for cattle identification and movement is an effect of farmers’ responsibility to a variety of things that include the CTS but also neighboring farmers, livestock, family, and personal health.</p>
<p>Consequently, the System is present on the farm in various ways. It is included in, depends upon, and interferes with farm practices of responsibility all at the same time. Sometimes the System sits outside farm practices (the example of not reporting movement of a cow), sometimes alongside them (the example of the farm inspection), or sometimes displaces and erodes the farming practices (e.g., tagging when the mother is aggressive).</p>
<p>What of the relationship then between accountability and responsibility and Donna Haraway’s insightful claim that “irresponsible means unable to be called to account”? (1991, 191) Being responsible may not primarily be about being able to be called to account. The farmers are engaged in practices of <italic>responsibility</italic> to multiple entities and arrangements. Moreover, the practices of accountability that constitute the CTS are often insensitive to the lived farming practices. Hence I suggest that responsibility should be disentangled from accountability and differences and resonances between them explored. In some instances, it makes little sense to seek accountability and we might more usefully seek to understand how responsibility is practiced apart from accountability and how practices of responsibility interfere with particular practices of accountability.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0162243911418536">17</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>However, farming practices of responsibility are not always damaged by legislative demands for accountability. This account gives too much away to the traditional version of context and the notion that legislation frames and directs embodied practices. Rather, the CTS interferes with farming practices but also<bold> </bold>
<italic>depends upon </italic>them in order to work at all. Hence the farming practices show that:<disp-quote>
<p>Accountability, caring for, being affected, and entering into responsibility are not ethical abstractions; these mundane, prosaic things are the result of having truck with each other … Touch, regard, looking back, becoming with—all these make us responsible in unpredictable ways for which worlds take shape. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162243911418536">Haraway 2007</xref>, 36)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Accountability for cattle movement is the <italic>practices of care and responsibility</italic> for cattle that are done, (down, and dirty) with the cattle and the legislation, daily, on the farm.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0162243911418536">18</xref></sup> Accountability is not an ethical abstraction that provides a framing context for practices. Rather, accountability is a mundane, embodied effect of cattle, farmers, and legislation living together on the farm.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0162243911418536">19</xref></sup> Accountability is the product of located, sometimes difficult, and often skilled, context games, rather than an effect of legislative guidelines. This revisioning is, thereby, a modest political intervention in the contemporary explosion of legislation aiming and claiming to promote accountability. Revisioning accountability to be about caring, touch, and responsibility interferes with notions of what legislation is and how it works. Legislation must be tinkered with in order to work and it must be sensitive to and inclusive of located practices that are responsive, collective, embodied, materially heterogeneous, and embedded in a history.</p>
<p>This article is a specific interference. It is a meta-context in which the CTS legislation, local farm practices, and feminist theorizing touch one another in order to revision both context and accountability.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0162243911418536">20</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Context is not an immobile, external framing device. It is not the legislation that frames what accountability is on the farm. Context is the interferences when different contexts meet. It is clashing of different versions of the farmer and the animal. It is “going on together” of different “accounting” practices. It is complex and dynamic practices in which the legislation and farm practices co-evolve and shape one another as they touch one another on the farm. This is not to deny the power of the legislation as real and directive. The relationship between the CTS and local farming practices is asymmetrical in particular ways, such as in the ability of the legislation to withhold money from farmers. But revisioning context from something given in the order of things to something generated in interferences between contexts makes it potentially mobile and productive of relational goods and bads, responsive versions of the subject and the animal, and embodied versions of accountability and responsibility.</p>

<p> I could have begun with a fourth context—a National context of Accountability and Responsibility. This comment betrays the central point of this article—where to “cut the context” and how might we construct contexts that interfere with constructed realities and moralities? Discussions and legislation promoting accountability and responsibility pervade many aspects of daily life. Accountability has become a central and increasingly visible aim of public administration and legislative development. Nevertheless, the everyday practices of accountability and their relationship to practices of responsibility are poorly understood. Rather, accountability is enacted as framing practices, as an effect of implementing directives, monitoring actions, following orders given at a distance from practice. In contrast, responsibility is a personal and “human” activity, action as a consequence of personal judgment that is “for the greater good.” (See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162243911418536">Dobel 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0162243911418536">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162243911418536">Jackson 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0162243911418536">Savage and Moore 2004</xref> for some relevant discussions).</p>

<p> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0162243911418536">Singleton (1998)</xref> argues that in order for “policies” (broadly understood to include systems, protocols, and directives) to work they must be accompanied by practical instabilities. Research in Science and Technology Studies suggests that technologies, such as the CTS, have effects but not in a deterministic way, they must be tinkered with, in every day practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162243911418536">Berg and Timmermans 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0162243911418536">Morris 2006</xref>). Technologies are not developed and then implemented but are rather perpetually in process and whether they work or not depends upon their being continually done and remade on location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162243911418536">Singleton 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0162243911418536">Moser 2008</xref>).</p>

<p> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0162243911418536">Sally Hacker (1990)</xref>, a feminist sociologist of science, technology, and gender, explored the effects of shifts from agriculture to agribusiness through attending a course at an agricultural college in the US. She describes a shift from family farms, where people who live on the land also work it and make decisions about it, to a system of large corporations that control food production and supply through new technology. She describes how this shift reconstitutes gender and unequal distributions of employment opportunities and earnings, for example, through aspects of the college training in agri-business. Like Hacker I have attended a course at an agricultural college in North-West England in order to learn about new technologies of accountability.</p>

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn4-0162243911418536">
<label>4.</label>
<p> Lucy’s claim is problematic. There are various consumers for whom the System may not be good. For example, what of a consumer such as a rambler who enjoys walking the fields but dislikes the sight of tags in the ears of cattle, finding them ugly.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn5-0162243911418536">
<label>5.</label>
<p> Lucy reminds us that this “super” system of full traceability was difficult to get up and running. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0162243911418536">Latour (1988b)</xref> tells us to follow controversies to open the black boxes of seemingly stable and simple technologies. Lucy tantalizingly suggests such controversies existed but now closure and stability has been achieved. Spending time in the offices of the System would be interesting and might show the inevitable work and negotiation that goes into maintaining the system.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn6-0162243911418536">
<label>6.</label>
<p> I am grateful to the reviewer who suggested the relevance here of the work of Didier Torny who has written about traceability after BSE. Unfortunately, I have been unable to access full papers in English. Some of the work suggests that traceability is a key instrument for controlling practices and reassuring consumers without impeding sales. Although this is not the primary focus of the current article, it would seem that a similar scenario is being played out through the CTS.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn7-0162243911418536">
<label>7.</label>
<p> Note that whereas DEFRA refer to a Holding, farmers more often talk about their farm by its name such as “Dinkling Green” or “Johnsons.” Perhaps this is an important difference. A Holding suggests that the farm can be fully grasped, collected, centered and the CTS claims to “hold” every bit of information. The term conjures a sense of controllability and stability.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn8-0162243911418536">
<label>8.</label>
<p> In many ways, the arguments that I make in this article about the impact of the CTS on farming practices are similar to those made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0162243911418536">Jocelyne Porcher (2011)</xref> in her research on the pork industry and relationships between animals and humans. She argues that considerations on animal welfare do not take into account that livestock farming involves shared suffering between animals and human beings and that the bond between animal and farmer is inevitable and necessary and yet often concealed. Farmers must negotiate contradictory demands of animal production and animal husbandry. I agree with her suggestion that, in animal production “Workers are considered in managerial terms only, whereas it is the very meaning of work with animals that needs to be questioned” (4) and that animals are seen primarily as resources rather than in relationships with farmers.</p>

<p>I grew up on a family beef cattle farm in a large village in North West UK. I have spent a lot of time doing farm work including helping with the seasonal jobs such as hay time and harvesting of fruit, mucking out, feeding, observing, counting, bedding up and moving livestock, and cleaning, fencing, and maintaining the buildings and land. In more recent years, one of my roles is to read and translate some of the many national and local information documents and farm record directives on the farm. Although paperwork has always been an element of farming, it is an increasingly visible and formalized ingredient, primarily in the name of increasing accountability.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn10-0162243911418536">
<label>10.</label>
<p>For a similar argument in relation to pig farming, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0162243911418536">Porcher (2011)</xref>, discussed in Note 8 above.</p>

<p>This term is developed by Science Studies scholar, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0162243911418536">Helen Verran (1999)</xref> in her writing about the coexistence of Western and Yoruba systems of mathematics in classrooms. “Going on together” respects difference while being productive of new ways of being together. I discuss her work further later in this article.</p>

<p>Note that CTS does accept that if you need to get a cow to the vets in an emergency, due to life threatening illness, then it is not necessary to complete movement records. In some senses then even the CTS accepts that there are limits to its mode of farmers being called into account.</p>

<p>The insights of Sociologist Anthony <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0162243911418536">Giddens (1991)</xref> about the nature of self-identity and social institutions in late modernity, neoliberal society is of relevance in that Giddens describes the promotion of enhanced reflexivity at the level of individuals and institutions. Accountability—at the level of self and institutions—feeds into the reflexive project of the self and the development of reflexive society. The subject is created as a rational, independent individual. However, my project is much more specific and modest in that my concern is with empirical explorations in a particular set of locations of the practices of accountability, it is concerned with the construction of subjects and enacts a relational and located subject with responsibility to collectives rather than individual accountability.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn14-0162243911418536">

<p>Note that I stated earlier how the CTS has set itself up as a break with the past in order to claim its superiority in monitoring and recording cattle movement.</p>

<p>The Single Payment Scheme (SPS) is the principal agricultural subsidy scheme in the European Union. The Rural Payments Agency, an Executive Agency of Defra, is the single paying agency responsible for the scheme in England. Farmers’ payments can be withheld if they are deemed not to have implemented the CTS. Also note that a cow without a passport and/or ear tag cannot be moved, sold, or slaughtered and hence is worth little in terms of money to the farmer.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn16-0162243911418536">
<label>16.</label>
<p>In some ways, this is another empirical example of a long known problem that if rules are too closely followed, organizations do not work. As long ago as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0162243911418536">1961, Erving Goffman</xref> argued that “total institutions” such as mental health asylums do not function through rule following. Goffman’s work challenged practices of care through segregation and showed that practices supposedly about protection and care of vulnerable people rather served to protect staff and construct rules as necessary. Work in Science and Technology Studies has similarly demonstrated that guidelines must be adapted and “tinkered with” in practice in order to work (in the medical work see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162243911418536">Timmermans and Berg 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0162243911418536">Singleton 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0162243911418536">Mol 2008</xref>). Further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0162243911418536">de Laet and Mol (2000)</xref> showed that an “object”—a bush pump—achieved durability when it mutated through adaptation in use and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162243911418536">Mol (2002)</xref> argues that all objects are multiple and that stability and objectness is always an effect. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162243911418536">Singleton (2005)</xref> makes a similar point in relation to citizen subjectivities in public health. One key aspect of all of the above work is that stability (of an organization, an object, a protocol, a rule) is an achievement of instability and multiplicity.</p>

<p>If the practices of being called to account are enacted as unsituated, as in the case of the CTS, then they may be irresponsible. By irresponsible, here I mean insensitive to and dismissive of embedded, embodied, and collective practices. It is in these ways that the CTS is irresponsible even though it calls farmers to account. It individualizes farmers and cattle, it displaces, colonizes, and replaces practices of responsibility. The notion of “irresponsible accountability” is developed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0162243911418536">Singleton (forthcoming)</xref>.</p>

<p> The revisioning of accountability that I am proposing here may not fit all farming contexts. Indeed, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0162243911418536">Mol (2008)</xref> convincingly argues, care is an effect of located practices and situated tinkering. On farms constituted differently to the ones I have worked on, which are family farms and relatively nonintensive, caring will be constituted differently. However, the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0162243911418536">Porcher (2011)</xref> on intensive pig farms suggests some similarities in terms of animal/human relationships.</p>

<p> The article is concerned with the <italic>enactment</italic> of context, accountability, cows, and farmers. It is thereby a challenge to individualistic and interpretative modes of understanding and proposes performative intervention. It is concerned with the co-implication of species and the enactment of alternative realities and moralities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162243911418536">Barad’s (2003)</xref> notion of intra-action proposes that “objects” do not precede their interaction. In the current example, I am arguing that legislation, accountability, farmers, and cows emerge through particular intra-actions.</p>
