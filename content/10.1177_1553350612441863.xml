<abstract>
<p>Open splenectomy and esophagogastric devascularization (OSED) is a typical surgery for portal hypertension. Because of the high morbidity associated with it, it is desirable to develop a minimally invasive alternative. To investigate the safety and effect of laparoscopic splenectomy and esophagogastric devascularization (LSED), we performed LSED for 24 patients suffering from portal hypertension with refractory variceal bleeding while conducting OSED for 30 patients. The perioperative data and follow-up results were analyzed. Operation times were similar in both groups. Less intraoperative blood and faster return of gastrointestinal function were found in the LSED group. The LSED group had lower levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and total bilirubin after surgery. In both groups, the levels of platelet count, white blood cell count, or hemoglobin were increased after operation dramatically. During the follow-up period (range = 3-36 months), no patient had recurrent hypersplenism or variceal bleeding. Hence, LSED is a safe and minimally invasive intervention for portal hypertension with refractory variceal bleeding.</p>

<body>
<p>Large numbers of patients in China suffer from portal hypertension secondary to liver cirrhosis because of the high incidence of the chronic hepatitis B and C infection. This syndrome generally results in 2 severe complications—hypersplenism and esophagogastric variceal bleeding. Bleeding from esophagogastric varices is the most common cause of death in patients with portal hypertension because of acute, massive blood loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350612441863">1</xref></sup> Complications of hypersplenism, including decreased white blood cells (WBCs), platelets (Plts), and hemoglobin (Hb), can result in bleeding, infection, and anemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350612441863">2</xref></sup> Open splenectomy and esophagogastric devascularization (OSED) has been widely used in the surgical treatment of portal hypertension in Asia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350612441863">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350612441863">4</xref></sup> and can manage hypersplenism and prevent variceal bleeding. However, the liver function of patients with portal hypertension secondary to liver cirrhosis is usually very poor, and OSED is associated with a high morbidity and mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350612441863">5</xref></sup> Therefore, it is necessary to find a safe and minimally invasive alternative.</p>
<p>Since the first laparoscopic splenectomy (LS) was performed successfully, it has been adopted as the standard operation for most indications for splenectomy around the world.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350612441863">6</xref></sup> Even so, it is controversial to perform LS for patients with portal hypertension because of the splenomegaly and enlarged collateral circulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350612441863">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1553350612441863"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350612441863">9</xref></sup> At our institution, we have performed LS for the management of diverse diseases for more than 5 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350612441863">10</xref></sup> Since February 2007, we have performed laparoscopic splenectomy and esophagogastric devascularization (LSED) for 24 patients with portal hypertension and severe esophagogastric varices. In the present study, we retrospectively analyzed the perioperative data and follow-up results of 24 LSED and 30 OSED cases, which were performed by the same surgical team during the same period at our department in order to determine the safety and efficacy of LSED.</p>

<title>Patients</title>
<p>From February 2007 to January 2010, 54 patients were diagnosed with portal hypertension and severe esophagogastric varices secondary to liver cirrhosis at the Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery of the First Affiliated Hospital of Medical College of Xi’an Jiaotong University. The etiology of liver cirrhosis includes chronic hepatitis B and C. All these patients had a history of refractory variceal bleeding and were resistant to pharmacological treatment or endoscopic banding. No history of hepatic encephalopathy was found. This study was not a randomized trial. During the preoperation discussion, all patients were informed that LSED is a minimally invasive procedure but was in the experimental stage compared with the typical open one. The selection of procedure was based on the patient’s decision; 24 patients received LSED (LSED group), and 30 patients received OSED (OSED group). All operations were performed by the same surgical team. All patients provided written informed consent for surgery, and this study was approved by the institutional review board of our hospital.</p>
<p>Patient demographic and laboratory data before surgery is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1553350612441863">Table 1</xref>. The median age of patients in the LSED group was 43 years, and in the OSED group it was 47 years. No patient in this study had a history of upper-abdominal surgery. All patients in both groups were Child-Pugh class A or B. Although there were more patients of Child-Pugh class B in the OSED group than in the LSED group (46.7% vs 37.5%), no significant difference was found in liver function classification between both groups: ascites, 12 for laparoscopy versus 19 in the open group, with a <italic>P</italic> value of .41, which was underpowered. Prior to the operation, all patients received B ultrasound or CT examination to assess the longest diameter of the spleen. The median longest diameter of the spleen was 18.5 cm in the LSED group and 19 cm in the OSED group. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total bilirubin (TBIL) levels were measured 1 day before surgery, and for the purpose of investigating differences in liver function as a result of the surgery, levels were also measured on the seventh day after surgery. Plt, WBC, and Hb levels were measured during the perioperative period to determine the effectiveness of the surgery in reversing hypersplenism. No significant differences in the preoperative levels of ALT, AST, TBIL, Plt, WBC, and Hb were noted between the groups. All patients were followed for 3 to 36 months (median = 18 months) after surgery.</p>

<title>LSED procedure</title>
<p>After induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was placed in the supine position with Velcro straps and wide cloth tape across the chest and pelvis to allow for changes in table position. The abdomen was insufflated with carbon dioxide (10-12 mm Hg). A 4-port method was used for LSED. First, a 10-mm trocar was placed through the umbilicus for a 10-mm 30° scope, and then under direct laparoscopic vision, a 12-mm trocar was placed in the left midclavicular line just below the costal margin for use of the bipolar cautery vessel-sealing equipment (LigaSure Atlas, Valleylab Inc) or ultrasonic dissectors (Ethicon Endo-Surgery. Inc). Next, 5-mm trocars were placed in the subxiphoid space and the left anterior axillary line halfway below the border of the spleen, allowing the use of a retractor, grasper, and other supplementary instruments. After placing all trocars successfully, the operating table was tilted slightly to the reverse Trendelenburg position. First, a thorough inspection of the abdomen was made to determine if there were other abdominal conditions or the presence of an accessory spleen. The splenocolic ligament, gastrocolic ligament, and splenogastric ligament were divided with the bipolar cautery device to enter the lesser sac and expose the splenic hilum. Once the anterior aspect of the hilum was satisfactorily exposed, the splenic artery was ligated with silk sutures to reduce the volume of the spleen. Then, the splenorenal and splenophrenic ligaments were divided with ultrasonic dissectors. At this point, the spleen remained attached almost entirely by the vascular supply. Next, the splenic artery and vein were transected en bloc with the application of a linear laparoscopic vascular stapler (EndoGIA, US Surgical Corporation), and the spleen was placed into an appropriately sized impermeable retrieval bag. After splenectomy, the patient was turned to the supine position. Starting at the middle of the greater curvature of the stomach, devascularization was performed in an inferior to superior manner between the gastric serosa and dilated veins, with the use of the ultrasonic dissectors (with clips if necessary). The posterior gastric vein, the main branch of the gastric coronary vein, and the left gastric artery were identified and divided with the Hem-o-lok and ultrasonic dissectors. Then, the gastrohepatic ligament was divided, and devascularization of the lesser curvature was performed by the same method. Following devascularization, the esophagus was pulled downward, and the dilated vessels were divided superior to a point 6 cm away from the gastric fundus. The spleen was morcellated within the impermeable retrieval bag and extracted through the 12-mm trocar. Finally, an abdominal drainage tube was placed in the left subphrenic area.</p>

<sec id="section5-1553350612441863">
<title>OSED procedure</title>
<p>The OSED procedure was performed through an “L” incision in the left upper abdomen under general endotracheal anesthesia. Traditional open splenectomy was performed before esophagogastric devascularization. The procedure for esophagogastric devascularization was similar to the LSED procedure.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Data were described as median, range, and interquartile range. The Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test was used to analyze the difference in perioperative data between the 2 groups, and Fisher’s exact test was used for the corresponding proportions. Statistical analyses were preformed with Graphpad Prism software (GraphPad Software Inc, La Jolla, CA). A <italic>P</italic> value of &lt;.05 was considered statistically significant.

<title>Results</title>
<p>All surgeries in both groups were performed successfully, and patients were discharged in good condition. There was no conversion from a laparoscopic to an open procedure. The intraoperative and postoperative details of all 54 patients are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1553350612441863">Table 2</xref>. There was no significant difference in operation time between the 2 groups (<italic>P</italic> = .105; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1553350612441863">Figure 1A</xref>). LSED was associated with less intraoperative blood loss (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1553350612441863">Figure 1B</xref>) and faster recovery of gastrointestinal function (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1553350612441863">Figure 1C</xref>) than OSED. Four patients in the LSED group developed postoperative complications, which included 1 gastric perforation, 2 cases of significant ascites, and 1 abdominal well hematoma. In the OSED group, 10 patients experienced postoperative complications, including 5 cases of significant ascites, 2 cases of pulmonary infection, 2 cases of incision fat liquefaction, and 1 incision infection. Although it appeared that the OSED group had a higher rate of complications, no significant difference was found using Fisher’s exact test (<italic>P</italic> = .218). The patient with the postoperative gastric perforation had a good outcome after being managed with sufficient abdominal drainage, nutritional support, and pharmacotherapy of hepatic encephalopathy for nearly 2 months, as described in our previous report.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350612441863">5</xref></sup></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Portal hypertension, which is hemodynamically defined as a pathological increase in the portal pressure gradient,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1553350612441863">11</xref></sup> is a common condition secondary to liver cirrhosis and is highly prevalent in China. In addition to the common problems associated with liver cirrhosis, such as liver failure and hepatic encephalopathy, patients with portal hypertension often have the life-threatening complications of hypersplenism and esophagogastric variceal bleeding.</p>
<p>Surgery is one of the most important ways in which portal hypertension can be treated, and at present, there are many alternatives, including endoscopic sclerotherapy and banding, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), selective splenorenal shunt, and esophagogastric devascularization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1553350612441863">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1553350612441863"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1553350612441863">14</xref></sup> However, pharmacological treatments and endoscopic sclerotherapy or banding are not suitable for patients with refractory variceal bleeding. Endoscopic sclerotherapy is only used in acute bleeding episodes owing to the poor long-term results with the treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1553350612441863">14</xref></sup> The ideal surgical treatment for patients with portal hypertension and refractory variceal bleeding should not only control bleeding effectively but also correct hypersplenism with little impairment of liver function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350612441863">5</xref></sup> We prefer performing OSED for patients with portal hypertension and severe gastroesophageal varices for 3 reasons: (1) this operation has been proved to be effective in controlling bleeding by a number of studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1553350612441863">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1553350612441863">16</xref></sup>; (2) there is a very low incidence of encephalopathy or liver failure, and patients have a favorable long-term survival rate because of the maintenance of postoperative portal perfusion containing hepatotrophic factors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1553350612441863">17</xref></sup> which is an outstanding advantage when compared with TIPS; and (3) this procedure can also treat hypersplenism at the same time.</p>
<p>Although OSED has been widely accepted,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350612441863">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350612441863">4</xref></sup> it also has some disadvantages such as a large surgical incision and significant morbidity. Hence, it is desirable to develop a minimally invasive surgical procedure. Laparoscopic surgery (LS) is a minimally invasive surgery, which has replaced many types of conventional open surgeries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1553350612441863">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1553350612441863"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1553350612441863">20</xref></sup> Among them, LS has become the method of choice for removal of a normal spleen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1553350612441863">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1553350612441863">22</xref></sup> However, it is more challenging to perform LS for patients with portal hypertension because of the limited surgical area and increased risk of bleeding resulting from thrombocytopenia and well-developed collateral circulation. For this reason, portal hypertension was once considered as a contraindication to LS.</p>
<p>However, with the advances in laparoscopic equipment, especially bipolar cautery and ultrasonic dissectors, LSED seems to be a potential alternative. Moreover, many surgeons have performed LS for patients with portal hypertension successfully.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350612441863">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1553350612441863">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1553350612441863">24</xref></sup> This demonstrates that portal hypertension may no longer be an absolute contraindication to LS, and LSED may be feasible. In the present study, we conducted 24 LSEDs successfully without any perioperative mortality or conversion to an open operation, which indicates that LSED is safe and feasible for patients with portal hypertension.</p>
<p>When comparing the intraoperative data between LSED and OSED, although no significant differences were found, the operation time for LSED was longer, which indicated that LSED was technically more challenging. There are 2 potential reasons for the longer operative time in the LSED group: the narrow working space as a result of splenomegaly and special attention given to the prevention of intraoperative variceal bleeding. Bleeding during laparoscopy is very difficult to control and is also the main reason for conversion to an open procedure. Accordingly, we paid more attention to the prevention of variceal bleeding, which meant that LSED was associated with less intraoperative blood loss in our study. In addition, good visualization under laparoscopy likely contributed to the lower intraoperative blood loss in the LSED group. Additionally, as expected, LSED was associated with significantly faster gastrointestinal function recovery in this study. In theory, this is because of more accurate devascularization and less mechanical stimuli to the gastrointestinal tract during surgery of the splenic hilum. Less intraoperative blood loss and faster recovery of gastrointestinal function are the merits of the minimally invasive LSED procedure. The above-mentioned results of our study are consistent with those of other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350612441863">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350612441863">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1553350612441863">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1553350612441863">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although there have been some reports regarding LSED,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350612441863">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350612441863">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1553350612441863">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1553350612441863">26</xref></sup> few studies have focused on differences between preoperative and postoperative liver function and blood counts when comparing LSED and OSED. However, these 2 indicators could reflect surgical stress and the efficacy of reversing the hypersplenism. In the present study, although there were no significant differences between the 2 groups preoperatively, the LSED group had significantly lower levels of ALT, AST, and TBIL than the OSED group on postoperative day 7, which is further evidence of the merit of LSED. The similar increases in Plt count, WBC count, and Hb in the 2 groups on postoperative day 7 indicates that LSED is as effective in reversing hypersplenism as OSED. In addition, there was no recurrence of hypersplenism in either group during the follow-up period.</p>
<p>Although there was no statistical difference in the postoperative complication rate between the groups, there was no incision fat liquefaction, incision infection, or pulmonary infections in the LSED group. This could be attributed to the small operating incisions and earlier ambulation after surgery because of less postoperative pain. However, there was a serious complication—a gastric perforation—in the LSED group. Gastric perforation is a rare but life-threatening complication after OSED, which has been reported in the literature earlier.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1553350612441863">27</xref></sup> The potential causes of gastric perforation include thermal injury during devascularization of the short gastric veins with the ultrasonic dissectors and the poor ability of the stomach to heal gastric wall injury owing to poor liver function and decreased blood supply to the stomach.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the number of LSEDs we have performed up to now is limited, which did not convince the institutional review board of our hospital to permit us to carry out a randomized controlled trial to investigate the advantages of LSED compared with OSED. Hence, there were no data from randomized controlled trials to support our conclusion, and selection bias existed, which is a limitation of this investigation.</p>
<p>Based on the results of this study, we consider that compared with the traditional open operation, LSED is a safe and minimally invasive alternative for the treatment of portal hypertension with refractory variceal bleeding secondary to liver cirrhosis to manage hypersplenism and prevent variceal bleeding. However, it is unclear whether LSED is better than TIPS (or surgical shunts) for portal hypertension with refractory variceal bleeding because there is a shortage of comparative studies of both procedures; it will be critical to define the indications for LSED in future. In addition, LSED is a new procedure, and randomized controlled trials are needed to further determine its safety and efficacy. It should be emphasized that patients who receive LSED should be selected carefully and the surgery should be performed by experienced surgeons.</p>
