<p><bold>Objective:</bold> The aim of our study was to investigate systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) related protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) in the following areas: clinical features, laboratory, endoscopic and imaging characteristics, treatment and outcome. <bold>Method:</bold> A retrospective analysis was performed. <bold>Results:</bold> From 2001 to 2010, 48 patients had SLE related PLE and their clinical characteristics were: age 40.8 ± 14.3 years, male-to-female ratio 1:8.6, mean symptom duration 4.3 ± 3.4 weeks, initial presentation and concomitant activity of SLE in 21(43.8%) and 37 (77.1%) patients, &lt;20% patients developed gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, mean serum albumin level 24.4 ± 5 g/L. Thirty (62.5%) patients had diffuse non-erosive erythematous GI mucosa with chronic inflammatory cells in lamina propria. Protein leakage was at the small bowel in 15 (31.3%) patients, terminal ileum/caecum in 16 (33.3%) patients and ascending colon in 11 (22.9%) patients. Thirty (62.5%) patients responded initially well to a combination of prednisolone and azathioprine (AZA) and 33 (68.8%) patients were maintained well by the above therapy. Higher potent induction and maintenance therapy were required in patients with: proteinuria (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), history of previous immunosuppressive therapy (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.02) and requirement of higher potent induction therapy (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). PLE as initial SLE presentation was associated with better prognosis. Four reversible adverse events were reported: one had AZA-induced pancreatitis, two developed AZA-induced hypoplastic anemia and one developed steroid psychosis. One patient developed shingles in the fourth month and responded to oral acyclovir. No thromboembolic events were reported and one patient died of SLE nephropathy. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> There appears to be increasing prevalence of SLE related PLE. A diagnosis can be made using 99m Tc-labeled HSA scintigraphy. PLE generally responds well to immunosuppressive therapy.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0961203312438113" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) is a rare disease entity associated with an excessive loss of serum protein into the gastrointestinal tract, which results in hypoproteinemia and peripheral edema. It can be associated with a wide variety of disorders, including cardiac disease, intestinal lymphangiectasia and systemic diseases, such as Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia and systemic amyloidosis. It is also a well reported but uncommon manifestation of systemic autoimmune (SA) diseases. Aoki et al. pointed out that systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) might initially present as PLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203312438113">1</xref></sup> Several postulated mechanisms include mucosal disruption, increase in mucosal capillary permeability as a result of complement- or cytokine-mediated damage and ruptured mucosal lacteals resulting in secondary lymphangiectasia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312438113">2</xref></sup> The exact pathogenesis of PLE associated with SLE remains elusive. In addition, the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of SLE related PLE have been poorly described in the literature as the previous reports involved either isolated cases or a small number of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312438113">2</xref></sup> Further studies are warranted to address this issue in depth so that early diagnosis and timely treatment can be offered. Thus, the aim of our study was to investigate SLE related PLE in the following areas: clinical features, laboratory, endoscopic and imaging characteristics, treatment and outcome.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0961203312438113" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title>
<p>The records of patients discharged from Tuen Mun Hospital in Hong Kong with a diagnosis of PLE (International Classification of diseases code, 579.8) between January 2001 and December 2010 were reviewed. Cases were identified through searching the hospital database (Clinical Management System of Hospital Authority of Hong Kong). Underestimation of actual caseload is possible as coding might not have included patients suffering from the underlying disease.</p>
<p>The clinical diagnosis of PLE was defined based on a combination of:
<list id="list2-0961203312438113" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>Clinical findings suggestive of an underlying disease known to be associated with PLE;</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>The exclusion of alternative causes of hypoalbuminemia.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>False positives of 99m Tc HSA may result from active gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and in vivo breakdown of 99m Tc HSA yielding free pertechnetate from radiolabeling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203312438113">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203312438113">4</xref></sup> The former was excluded by three consecutive negative fecal occult blood examinations and the latter by the absence of stomach or thyroid visualization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203312438113">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203312438113">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>All patients fulfilled at least four of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for the classification of SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203312438113">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Clinical information was collected with regard to the following areas: demographic characteristics, clinical features, laboratory, endoscopic finding and histological features from bowel biopsy, computerized tomography (CT) of the abdomen, treatment methods and final outcomes.</p>
<sec id="sec4-0961203312438113"><title>Assessment of disease activity of SLE</title>
<p>Disease activity of SLE was measured using the Systemic Lupus Erythematous Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI), a validated tool which has been shown to be sensitive to change.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312438113">6</xref></sup></p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0961203312438113"><title>Assessment of clinical response</title>
<p>Complete response of PLE was defined as complete resolution of edema and GI symptoms, together with return of serum albumin to ≥35 g/dl (lower limit of the normal range) for at least three months. Partial response referred to a partial improvement of edema and GI symptoms with an improvement of serum albumin not to the extent of complete response (but ≥ 30 g/dl). Non-response was defined as persistent or deteriorating clinical symptoms with failure of serum albumin to increase to 30 g/dl or more.</p>
<p>Mortality was defined as death resulting directly from the PLE or from a complication of treatment.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0961203312438113"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The data were compiled and analyzed by use of the commercial Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows (version 17.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). All continuous variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Categorical variables were reported as percentages. Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test, χ<sup>2</sup> test, Fisher’s exact test and Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> test were used when appropriate. Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient was used to measure the degree of linear relationship between the two variables of interest. One-way analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) was used for testing the significance of the difference in the time to normal serum albumin, C-reactive protein and complement C3 level. The Levene test of homogeneity of variance was used to test any violation in homogeneity of variance assumption of ANOVA. Post hoc multiple comparisons between the means of these time intervals were performed by the least-significant difference test (LSD) with Bonferroni adjustment to require a significance level of 0.017. A limited number of patients required treatment regimens that were more potent than a combination of prednisolone (Ps) and azathioprine (AZA)/methotrexate (MTX) in induction and maintenance therapy precluded regression analysis of factors associated with it, so χ<sup>2</sup> testing was used to explore any existing association. Their odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. Statistical significance was defined as <italic>p</italic> value of less than 0.05.</p></sec></sec>

<sec id="sec8-0961203312438113"><title>Demographic characteristics</title>
<p>From January 2001 to December 2010 inclusive, a total of 48 patients were diagnosed with SLE related PLE. Forty-three of them were female (male:female ratio, 1:8.6). The mean age was 40.8 ± 14.3 years (range, 17–78 years). The mean duration of symptoms prior to admission was 4.3 weeks (SD, 3.4 weeks; range, 1–20 weeks). Comorbidity included hypertension (<italic>n</italic> = 3 [6.3%]), ischemic heart disease (<italic>n</italic> = 1 [2.1%]), stroke (<italic>n</italic> = 2 [4.2%]). Twenty-one (43.8%) patients had PLE as an initial presentation of SLE. Thirty-seven (77.1%) patients had concomitant disease activity in other organs (shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0961203312438113">Table 1</xref>). The mean SLEDAI score was 12.1 ± 7.5. Antinuclear, anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and anti-extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) antibodies were found in 43 (89.6%), 25 (52%) and 22 (45.8%) patients.

<sec id="sec9-0961203312438113"><title>Clinical and laboratory features</title>
<p>The clinical features of the patients are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0961203312438113">Table 1</xref>. Most patients with SLE related PLE showed peripheral edema, followed by malaise and weight loss. GI symptoms (including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea) occurred in less than one-fifth of all cases. No patients complained of per rectal bleeding on presentation. The accumulation of body fluid in the third space (either ascites, pleural effusion or pericardial effusion) was found in 27 (56.3%) patients.</p>
<p>The laboratory features are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0961203312438113">Table 2</xref>, in which anemia, lymphopenia, high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), and serum hypocomplementia were the common abnormalities in the patients on presentation. Elevation of liver parenchymal enzymes was found in seven (14.6%) patients in which three of them showed moderate to severe elevation (4–10 times upper normal limit) accompanied by myositis on admission, while the other four patients with modest elevation of liver parenchymal enzymes had no evidence of chronic liver disease. In this study, one patient had simultaneous pleural and abdominal tap while five and two patients had diagnostic pleural tap and paracentesis respectively. The indications of these procedures were fever, shortness of breath and abdominal discomfort. Two patients were diagnosed to have exudative pleural effusion. One of them suffered dyspnea and abdominal pain, and the pleural and ascitic fluid analysis was found to be exudate and the patient was subsequently diagnosed to have active SLE-related serositis involving the pleural and peritoneum. The other patient was associated with chylous pleural effusion. For the other six patients with either pleural tap or paracentesis, the biochemistry analysis was found to be consistent with a transudate.

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0961203312438113">Table 3</xref>, about one-fourth of the patients had contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen performed and ascites was the most common abnormality detected. The circumferential bowel wall thickening due to submucosal edema was documented in one (7.7%) patient. Another patient with lupus related active serositis was found to have multiple lymphadenopathy around the mediastinum, stomach and mesentery. 99m Tc-labeled HSA scan documented protein leakage in 46 (95.8%) patients. The mean time for appearance of protein leakage was 7 ± 7.2 hours (median 4.25 hours; range, 1–24 hours) and it did not correlate with the serum albumin level (Pearson correlation coefficient −0.09, <italic>p</italic> = 0.57) and SLEDAI (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.09, <italic>p</italic> = 0.55).

<sec id="sec12-0961203312438113"><title>Management and treatment outcomes</title>
<p>All patients were treated with immunosuppressant therapy initiated with the induction followed by maintenance therapy. Exploratory laparotomy was performed in a patient with acute abdomen and she was diagnosed to have lupus related serositis by evidence of multiple mesenteric lymphadenopathy with chronic inflammatory change in histology. The management and treatment outcomes of the patients are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0961203312438113">Table 4</xref>. Among the 36 (75%) patients treated initially with either Ps or Ps combined with AZA/MTX, six of them were refractory to treatment and required a more potent treatment regimen to achieve clinical response. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0961203312438113">Table 5</xref>, for these 18 (37.5%) cases requiring the induction regimen with the potency greater than the combination of Ps and AZA/MTX, the associated risk factors were proteinuria on admission (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and history of immunosuppressive therapy (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.02). Thirty-three (68.8%) patients were maintained well by the above therapy and the risk factors associated with the requirement of a higher potent regimen include history of immunosuppressive therapy (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and the requirement of the more potent induction therapy (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Patients with PLE as the initial presentation of SLE seem to respond to treatment better than those with SLE who did not show PLE.

<sec id="sec13-0961203312438113" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Contrary to the previous reports about PLE associated with SLE, which involved small numbers of patients, the present study involves a considerably greater number of patients. The mean age of the patients concerned was comparable to three other recent series.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203312438113">7</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203312438113">9</xref></sup> The skewed gender distribution is in keeping with the female dominance of SLE diseases. Mok et al. estimated that the prevalence of PLE was about 3.2% in a Chinese SLE population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312438113">2</xref></sup> The current study, from the same institution, extended the study period to 10 years and 639 SLE patients (581 female and 58 male patients) attended the lupus clinics of the participating hospital, and thus the prevalence increased to 7.5%. In spite of the possibility of referral bias, this figure can reflect the situation to a substantial extent because our hospital is the only hospital in our catchment area, residents in our region have a median household income below the overall average in Hong Kong and they rely heavily on the subsidized health care service provided by us. The increased prevalence may reflect our increased awareness. We agree with Mok et al. that this figure may still be an underestimation because screening of protein leakage from the GI tract is not routinely performed unless there is a clinical indication for unexplained hypoalbuminemia.</p>
<p>As shown in our study and the cases reported in the literature, the common presenting features of SLE related PLE were non-specific, such as malaise, weight loss and fever. As the GI symptoms were infrequent and over two-thirds of the patients had concomitant organ manifestation of SLE on admission, the clinicians may disregard the possibility of underlying PLE. The common laboratory abnormalities, including anemia, leucopenia, lymphopenia, high ESR and CRP, low C3 and non-specific liver derangement were related to the SLE disease activity. Contrary to the general belief that hypoalbuminemia is associated with transudative body fluid accumulation, the present study revealed that the pleural and ascitic fluid can be either transudative or exudative and this in turn depends on the underlying cause and complications (if any) of PLE. The pathophysiology of chylous pleural effusion in SLE is still elusive and one possibility is that this might be related to the inflammatory activity around the lymph vessels causing the acquired form of lymphangiectasia and leading to lymph (lymphocytes, cholesterol and protein) loss in the pleural space.</p>
<p>Several mechanisms may underlie the pathogenesis of PLE in SLE:
<list id="list3-0961203312438113" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Complement-mediated vascular injury.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Intravascular activation of complement has been proposed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203312438113">10</xref></sup> Activated complement together with immunoglobulin re-deposits in the capillary wall of vessels in the GI tract. This may lead to an increase in capillary permeability with the production of PLE. Itoi et al. demonstrated these high-molecular-weight molecules around dilated capillaries with fenestrated endothelial cells in an electronic microscopy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203312438113">11</xref></sup> In our center, electronic microscopic examinations are not routinely performed for colonic tissue, and thus we do not have data about this.
<list id="list4-0961203312438113" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Non-necrotizing mesenteric or intestinal vasculitis.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The vasculitis caused by an immune-mediated disease can cause mucosal ulceration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203312438113">12</xref></sup> However, as with other reports, such histological features were not found in our study. Instead, most of our cases were affected by diffuse non-erosive erythematous GI mucosa with chronic inflammatory cells in the lamina propria.
<list id="list5-0961203312438113" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Acquired form of lymphangiectasia.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Lymphatic compression is caused by disorders causing inflammation of mesentery that will dilate and rupture lacteals within villi to cause lymph leakage into the intestine. In a typical case of lymphangiectasia, the serum albumin, gamma globulin, cholesterol, fibrinogen and lymphocyte count are all decreased.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203312438113">13</xref></sup> However, the intestinal lymphangiectasia is seldom demonstrated in most case series,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203312438113">14</xref></sup> nor was it detected in our retrospective cohort. A full-thickness intestinal biopsy would be required to provide a possible explanation.
<list id="list6-0961203312438113" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Increased microvascular/endothelial permeability.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The lamina propria of the GI tract contains various cells like lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages. Antigenic stimulus results in the expansion of resident immune cell populations, and the release of chemotactic molecules or cytokines will increase endothelial permeability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203312438113">15</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203312438113">17</xref></sup> Existing evidence supporting this mechanism includes a demonstrable increase in capillary permeability by interferon (IFN)-γ and TNF-α, elevation of these cytokines in SLE patients and their blockade by etanercept producing a modest response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203312438113">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203312438113">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>While the exact pathogenesis of SLE– related PLE remains unclear, the present study showed generalized erythematous change along the intestine with increased inflammatory cells in lamina propria and supported that the fourth one would be the most likely underlying mechanism despite the fact that we had not checked for the status of capillary permeability. One interesting observation of the present study is that the time required for the serum albumin level to return to normal was much shorter than those of inflammatory markers. The early recovery of hypoalbuminemia in patients is consistent with our proposed mechanism for SLE related PLE, i.e. the functional increase of capillary permeability.</p>
<p>99m Tc-labeled HSA had very high sensitivity (95.8%) in the detection of protein leakage in our study, comparable to the previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961203312438113">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961203312438113">21</xref></sup> Chau et al. found superior performance of the 99mTc-labelled HSA scintigraphy over fecal AATC with higher sensitivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961203312438113">21</xref></sup> However, there are several pitfalls of 99m Tc-labeled HSA scintigraphy for PLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203312438113">3</xref></sup> Any GI bleeding may result in a false-positive accumulation of enteric 99m Tc HSA activity because the radiotracer can leak into the GI tract through blood. In addition, in vivo breakdown of the radiotracer with resultant free pertechnetate concentrating in the gut may mimic radiotracer exudation. These limitations may be excluded by serial fecal occult blood examination and the absence of stomach or thyroid visualization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203312438113">4</xref></sup> Although it is regarded as an initial diagnostic tool for patients with PLE, two SLE patients in our cohort with negative delayed scan were later confirmed to have PLE by fecal AATC; this suggests the intermittent nature of protein loss from the gut and we recommend it be mandatory to perform fecal AATC in highly suspicious cases with negative scintigraphy. Another piece of evidence suggesting intermittent leakage of serum protein was the poor correlation of the severity of hypoalbuminemia and the early appearance of radioactivity in the scintigraphy. Thus we recommend the 99m Tc-labeled HSA scintigraphy should have serial scanning for up to 24 h to increase its sensitivity and negative predictive value in diagnosing PLE. Previous studies also suggested that it is useful to localize the site of enteric protein loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961203312438113">22</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961203312438113">24</xref></sup> Chau et al. found that positive images in the early phase of the scan are more useful in identifying the primary site of protein loss and detecting multifocal involvement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961203312438113">21</xref></sup> Our observation does not support this finding because most of our patients showed diffuse inflammatory change in the GI tract and the early positive image may represent intermittent protein leakage at this instant only.</p>
<p>As shown in our study and those reported in the literature, PLE patients responded well to immunosuppressive therapy, with about two-thirds of them showing complete response within the first year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312438113">2</xref></sup> Concerning the requirement of more potent immunosuppressive therapy in the induction and maintenance phase, proteinuria, history of immunosuppressive therapy and the history of potent induction therapy are self-explanatory. PLE as an initial presentation of SLE seems associated with better prognosis than that of sequential presentation and this might be accounted for by the distinct pathogenesis of PLE in SLE from those mechanisms of the other SLE organ involvement. It is generally believed that the patients with PLE are prone to have sepsis and thromboembolism. There are several contributing factors for increased risk of sepsis, including immunosuppressive therapy given and GI leakage of lymphocytes, immunoglobulin and complement proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203312438113">19</xref></sup> However, the incidence of major cases of infection in our study was low. This might be because the patients responded well to the therapy. Not much information on the thromboembolism risk in SLE related PLE can be derived from historical cases and in our series no thromboembolic attack was reported, which might be due to an overall low risk in Asian populations. Nevertheless, the prophylaxis for thromboembolic complications should be considered in patients with severe and persistent protein loss, especially if antiphospholipid antibodies are present.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312438113">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>In summary, PLE is a rare complication of SLE and the apparent increases in its prevalence may be due to increased awareness. The diagnosis can be made using 99m Tc-labeled HSA scintigraphy. PLE generally responds well to immunosuppressant therapy.</p></sec>
