<abstract>
<p>Investigators conducted a retrospective epidemiological study of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, a fatal disease caused by measles infection, over the past few years in Japan. Data on 118 cases obtained from a questionnaire sent to attending physicians were analyzed. The annual incidence of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis was approximately 0.03 cases per million from 2001 to 2005. Children infected with measles at a young age (&lt;12 months) showed a high incidence of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, and those infected before 6 months of age showed earlier onset. Because a positive correlation was found between the prevalence of measles and the onset of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, particularly among children infected at an early age, it is vital to eradicate measles infection by vaccination.</p>

<body>
<p>Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis is a slow infection of the central nervous system by a measles virus variant (subacute sclerosing panencephalitis virus) and is known to result in extensive cognitive disorders, a lapse into a vegetative state, and death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811436250">1</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The reported incidence of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis varies by country and ranges from approximately 0.2 to 40 cases per million per year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811436250">2</xref></sup> In the United States, the annual mean incidence of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis was reported to be 1 to 2 cases per million in the late 1980s, but due to increased measles vaccination, this subsequently decreased to approximately 0.01 per million per year. However, reports of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis among foreign-born children in the United States have increased since the late 1990s.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811436250">3</xref></sup> In Canada, only 4 cases were reported between 1997 and 2000, to give an annual incidence of 0.06 per million children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811436250">4</xref></sup> In contrast, annual incidences of 2.0 per million in 2002 to 2004 in Istanbul<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811436250">5</xref></sup> and 2.1 per million in 1983 to 1987 in south India<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811436250">6</xref></sup> were reported. Overall, when measles infection is well controlled, the number of new cases of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis decreases.</p>
<p>In Japan, a compulsory measles vaccination program was introduced in 1978, and the mean number of cases of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis decreased from 15.6 (in 1975-1985) to less than 10 (after 1986) per year,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811436250">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073811436250">8</xref></sup> but 5 to 10 cases are still currently reported every year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073811436250">8</xref></sup> The last nationwide surveys of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis were performed by Nihei<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073811436250">9</xref></sup> 1990 and Nakamura et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811436250">10</xref></sup> in 2003.</p>
<p>In this study, we carried out a questionnaire survey to determine the more recent epidemiological and clinical features of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis in Japan.</p>
<sec id="section1-0883073811436250" sec-type="methods">
<title>Patients and Methods</title>
<p>Medical institutions were selected for inclusion in this nationwide study of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis on the basis of information regarding the purchase of inosine pranobex, which is the only drug licensed for the treatment of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis in Japan. All patients who had been diagnosed with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis by an attending physician before 2007 were included in the study. The diagnosis was based on typical clinical symptoms (ie, character change, myoclonus, and coma), characteristic electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern, and elevation of measles antibody titers in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811436250">1</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>A questionnaire was sent to 98 institutions in 2006, and responses from the attending physicians in each institution were collected by December 2008. The items included in the questionnaire were residence, sex, date of birth, period between measles infection and onset of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, history of measles vaccination, level of measles antibody in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid, cerebrospinal fluid immunoglobulin G index or percentage immunoglobulin G, EEG findings, details of treatment, nutrition management, tracheotomy status, mechanical ventilation status, status of current medical treatment, and stage of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis at the time of diagnosis and at present.</p>
<p>Information on the prevalence of measles was obtained from the annual reports of the Infectious Disease Surveillance Project of the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. Figures for the population aged under 15 years were obtained from data in the 2007 report by the Japanese Ministry of Public Management. The differences in risk for subacute sclerosing panencephalitis by age were assessed using crude odds ratios. The mean periods from measles infection to onset of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis by age at the time of measles infection were compared using the Student <italic>t</italic> test. Spearman correlation coefficient (<italic>R</italic>) was calculated and used to assess the year in which subacute sclerosing panencephalitis patients had measles infection and the number of measles infections reported each year. We defined statistical significance as <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0883073811436250">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 118 patients, including 15 fatal cases, were enrolled. As responses were not obtained for all items on the questionnaire for the fatal cases, the total number of cases for each item listed below varied.</p>
<p>The overall sex ratio was 1.2:1 (65 males and 53 females) and that for the 103 surviving patients was 1.1:1 (54 males and 49 females). The mean age of patients at the time of the study was 21.7 years (range, 4-39 years).</p>
<p>The mean age at death of fatal cases was 19 years (range, 12-35 years), the mean period from onset of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis to death was 9 years (range, 2-21 years), and the mean age at onset of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis was 10 years (range, 1.5-22.9 years).</p>
<p>The annual incidence of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis from 1996 to 2006 is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073811436250">Figure 1</xref>. Twenty-two of the 118 cases were diagnosed between 2001 and 2005, when the annual incidence of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis was approximately 0.03 cases per million. To determine any geographic bias, the incidence of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis per 100,000 children under 15 years of age (the most common age group for the onset of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis) was calculated by prefecture, and the mean was 0.7. Although the incidence of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis was lower than 2.0 in 44 of 47 prefectures in Japan, high incidence rates were observed in 3 southern prefectures—Okinawa (4.8), Kochi (4.4), and Nagasaki (2.5).</p>

<p>A history of measles infection was recorded for 86% (101) of cases. One patient was vaccinated after measles infection, and 5 of 17 patients for whom the history of measles infection was unknown had also received measles vaccinations. Data on age at the time of measles infection were available for 86% (101) of the cases, with a mean of 1.3 years (range, 0.2-6 years), and they were classified into 4 groups accordingly: group I (&lt;6 months of age; 10 cases), group II (7-11 months of age; 34 cases), group III (12-23 months of age; 41 cases), and group IV (&gt;24 months of age; 16 cases). Overall, the mean period from measles infection to onset of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis was 8.7 years (range, 1-21.9 years). The mean period for groups I, II, III, and IV was 5.6, 8.7, 9.3, and 8.8 years, respectively; the mean period for group I was significantly shorter than that for the other groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0883073811436250">Figure 2</xref>). The annual reports of the Infectious Disease Surveillance Project in Japan from 1987 to 2006 indicate that children under 2 years of age accounted for 34% to 46% of all patients with measles infections; however, 84% of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis patients had been infected with measles before 2 years of age. The odds ratio was calculated by age based on the total number of measles patients from 1987 to 1998 and the number of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis patients who had been infected with measles during the same period. The patients who had a measles infection before 24 months of age developed subacute sclerosing panencephalitis more frequently than those who were infected after 24 months (crude odds ratio, 11.2; 95% confidence interval, 4.4-28.4). Furthermore, a comparison between patients in group I + II (&lt;12 months of age) and those in group III (12-23 months of age) showed that the former developed subacute sclerosing panencephalitis more frequently (crude odds ratio, 3.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-5.5) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883073811436250">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>With regard to the clinical course of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis after onset in the 117 cases, aggravation, stabilization of the disease, improvement, aggravation after improvement, and improvement after aggravation were seen in 52, 47, 1, 7, and 10 cases, respectively.</p>
<p>Laboratory findings showed an elevation in measles antibody titers in the serum of 100 of 101 patients and in the cerebrospinal fluid of all 101 patients. Moreover, 36 of 40 patients had an elevated cerebrospinal fluid immunoglobulin G index or percentage immunoglobulin G. The characteristic EEG pattern, consisting of periodic synchronous discharges with bursts of high-voltage slow waves, was observed in 91% (92/101) patients.</p>
<p>Inosine pranobex was administered to 94% (111/116) of the patients and interferon to 75% (88/118) of the patients. The route of administration of interferon was reported as intrathecal, cerebroventricular, intrathecal and cerebroventricular, and unknown for 34, 40, 6, and 8 patients, respectively.

<sec id="section3-0883073811436250">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Because measles can now be controlled by vaccination, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis has become rare in developed countries. However, cases of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis are still reported in Japan every year. A decision was made by the Regional Office for the Western Pacific (including Japan) of the World Health Organization to pursue the eradication of measles by 2012, and various measures are therefore being implemented in Japan. The number of times that children will receive a measles vaccination was increased in April, 2006—from once to twice for children under 7 years of age. In particular, students in junior high school or high school were scheduled to receive a second vaccination between April 2008 and March 2013 to cover the possibility of primary or secondary vaccine failure. Furthermore, to determine the actual number of measles cases, the status of measles in the annual report of the Infectious Disease Surveillance Project in Japan was changed in January 2008 from that of a disease reported by selected medical institutions to that of a disease reported by all medical institutions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073811436250">11</xref></sup> It is hoped that these measures will contribute to a further decrease in the prevalence of measles and the subsequent eradication of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis in Japan.</p>
<p>An analysis of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis by prefecture showed that Okinawa prefecture had the highest prevalence, which appears to be due to a measles outbreak that occurred there in 1990. Hirayasu et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811436250">12</xref></sup> pointed out that the low vaccination rate was one of the factors responsible for the high number of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis cases in Okinawa and urgently needs to be improved. In contrast, several recent reports have suggested that mutations in host interleukin-2, interleukin-4, interleukin-12, myxovirus resistance A, and angiotensin-converting enzyme genes are probably related to the onset of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073811436250">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073811436250"/>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073811436250"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883073811436250">16</xref></sup> However, no data on gene mutation are available from Okinawa, and further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms of onset.</p>
<p>A high proportion of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis patients were reported to have had a measles infection before 2 years of age,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073811436250">11</xref></sup> which is consistent with the results of our study. Furthermore, the study showed that measles infection in children under 12 months of age increased the risk of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis and that infection within the first 6 months of life led to a more rapid onset of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. Studies in animal models have shown that measles virus infection is associated with neuronal immaturity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073811436250">17</xref></sup> and a similar association may also occur in humans.</p>
<p>Early vaccination is necessary to prevent measles, but the current recommendation in Japan is that children should be vaccinated after 12 months of age. Therefore, infants under 1 year old need to be protected from the risk of measles infection. Indirectly, the eradication of measles in children over 12 months of age is thought to be critical because of the positive correlation between the prevalence of measles, which has decreased due to vaccination, and the number of cases of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, for which a similar trend has also been observed recently. Five patients in this study either had received a measles vaccination or had an unknown measles infection. However, the reported number of cases of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis due to measles vaccination is extremely low.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811436250">2</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The proportion of males among subacute sclerosing panencephalitis cases has been reported to be much higher than that of females. In Japan, Nihei<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073811436250">8</xref></sup> reported that the ratio of males to females among subacute sclerosing panencephalitis patients was 2.1:1 before 1981 and 1.4:1 after 1982, and Nakamura et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811436250">10</xref></sup> reported a ratio of 1.2:1 in 2003. In this study, the overall ratio was 1.2:1 (1.1:1 when fatal cases were excluded), showing that the sex difference in subacute sclerosing panencephalitis has gradually decreased in Japan. The ratio of males to females for measles infections in Japan was 1.1 to 1.3:1 from 1999 to 2007 and appears to be related to that for subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. In other countries, the ratio of males to females for subacute sclerosing panencephalitis was higher: 1.2:1 in Papua New Guinea (1997-2000),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883073811436250">18</xref></sup> 1.9:1 in England and Wales (1990-2002),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883073811436250">19</xref></sup> 2.6:1 in Bulgaria (1978-2002),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883073811436250">20</xref></sup> and 2.3:1 in Turkey (1995-1999).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0883073811436250">21</xref></sup> However, there have been no reports of racial differences in subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. To clarify these apparent discrepancies, past measles epidemics should be reviewed in each country.</p>
<p>This study has some potential limitations that should be considered. The total number of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis cases was not determined for Japan because we only collected data from institutions that had purchased inosine pranobex. But it seems that almost all subacute sclerosing panencephalitis patients in Japan take inosine prabonex and almost all diagnosed patients were covered. No detailed investigation about treatment was conducted, and thus no detailed examination such as evaluation of the treatment effect was performed. It is important to perform a prospective surveillance of all new subacute sclerosing panencephalitis cases in Japan in the future. The exact number of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis cases needs to be determined to understand the mechanisms underlying the onset of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis and to develop an effective therapy.</p>
<p>In conclusion, a survey of the prevalence of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis in Japan was carried out over a period of approximately 5 years, and its epidemiological pattern was clarified. From this study, it is clear that continuous surveillance of this disease and that of measles are imperative.</p>
