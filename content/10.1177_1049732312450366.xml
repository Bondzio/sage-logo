<abstract>
<p>Telling stories is essential to the continuous process of creating meaning and to self-understanding. Persons with aphasia are vulnerable to psychosocial problems by their limited ability to talk and interact with others. This single-case study illustrates how a young woman with aphasia and a trained nurse interacted to coconstruct stories within the context of a longitudinal clinical intervention aimed at promoting psychosocial well-being in the first year after a stroke. Data were collected through qualitative interviews and participant observation; they were then analyzed from a hermeneutic-phenomenological perspective. The experience of coconstructing stories made an important contribution to improving the participant’s psychological well-being. The shared construction of the participant’s story evolved as a cumulative process, and it was facilitated by the establishment of trust in the participant–nurse relationship, the systematic use of worksheets and supported conversations, and a specific focus on psychosocial topics and structural organization.</p>

<body>
<p>Storytelling is regarded as fundamental to the continuous process of creating meaning and to self-understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312450366">Bruner, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1049732312450366">Polkinghorne, 1988</xref>). It is a relational activity that is embedded in cultures and contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312450366">Hydén, 1997</xref>). Stories are purposeful and constructed within certain cultural narrative conventions. They are told to someone in a particular way to be listened to, responded to, and acted on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312450366">Frank, 2000</xref>). Exchanging stories can support and affirm personal and social experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312450366">Atkinson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312450366">Holstein &amp; Gubrium, 2000</xref>). Language is the most important tool for human interplay. Through language, we express thoughts, feelings, and opinions; share experiences; tell who we are and what we want to be; and position ourselves in different social contexts (Atkinson; Holstein &amp; Gubrium; Riessman).</p>
<p>Aphasia is a common consequence of stroke, and it affects approximately one third of all stroke survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312450366">Engelter et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312450366">Kauhanen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732312450366">Naess, Hammersvik, &amp; Skeie, 2008</xref>). Stroke can result in various types of language disabilities. Any or all language modalities, including talking, reading, writing, calculating, and understanding oral or written language, can be affected in various combinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312450366">Hillis, 2007</xref>). The loss of language as a flexible tool to explore, discuss, and make sense of experiences is considered to affect all dimensions of quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312450366">Code, Hemsley, &amp; Herrmann, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732312450366">Moss, Parr, Byng, &amp; Petheram, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1049732312450366">Parr, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Aphasia following stroke is associated with major disruptions in everyday life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312450366">Bury, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312450366">Code &amp; Herrmann, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049732312450366">Natterlund, 2010</xref>). Persons with aphasia seem particularly vulnerable to psychosocial problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312450366">Code et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312450366">Hilari, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312450366">Hilari &amp; Byng, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312450366">Hilari et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1049732312450366">Parr, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1049732312450366">2007</xref>). Emotional and psychosocial factors have a marked impact on recovery, the response to rehabilitation, and psychosocial adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312450366">Brown, Worrall, Davidson, &amp; Howe, 2010</xref>; Code &amp; Herrmann; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312450366">Cruice, Worall, Hickson, &amp; Murison, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The telling and sharing of stories is seen as a primary tool for persons struggling to regain coherence and meaning in the chaos that often accompanies life-changing diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312450366">Bury, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312450366">Charon, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312450366">Frank, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312450366">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732312450366">Mattingly, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312450366">Frank (1995)</xref> identified three different types of illness narratives: restitution narratives, chaos narratives, and quest narratives. Restitution narratives are told when illness is seen as a temporary interruption to be overcome and get well again; chaos narratives describe suffering, uncertainty, and loss of control, and they lack coherence. Quest narratives occur when a person faces suffering and believes that there is something beneficial to be gained from illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312450366">Frank, 1995</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312450366">Frank (1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312450366">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312450366">2000</xref>) emphasized the importance of having people suffering from serious illness tell their stories and for health care providers to listen to them. For stroke survivors with normal communication and language skills, assistance with framing life stories and illness narratives has been found to be an important part of successful recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312450366">Becker, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312450366">Ch’Ng, French, &amp; Mclean, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312450366">Faircloth, Boylstein, Rittman, &amp; Gubrium, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312450366">Faircloth, Boylstein, Rittman, Young, &amp; Gubrium, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312450366">Kaufman, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>The interplay between the teller and the listener is essential to the construction of narratives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312450366">Frank, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312450366">2000</xref>). Aphasia disturbs both the natural dynamic interplay seen in storytelling and the common rules that govern these interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312450366">Kagan, 1998</xref>). It is unclear how persons with aphasia renegotiate and transform their experiences into stories and then move past the biographical disruptions caused by aphasia and stroke. Several authors have emphasized the importance of and challenges related to supporting the narrative processes of persons suffering from aphasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312450366">Hinckley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1049732312450366">Parr, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1049732312450366">Shadden, 2005</xref>). The stroke literature calls for clinical interventions that are accessible to this patient population and that focus on their psychosocial needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312450366">Hilari &amp; Byng, 2009</xref>; Hinckley; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312450366">Hjelmblink, Bernsten, Uvhagen, Kunkel, &amp; Holmström, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1049732312450366">Shadden &amp; Hagstrøm, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Aim</title>
<p>The aim of this article was to illuminate how an interactive process of coconstructing stories was established between a person with aphasia and a nurse within the context of a longitudinal psychosocial intervention during the first year after stroke. This case study was part of a larger study based on 25 cases of stroke in the first year after stroke. Seven of the participants had moderate to severe aphasia. The overall aim of the intervention was to support the psychosocial adjustment process in stroke patients, thereby promoting subjective psychosocial well-being.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1049732312450366">
<title>Description of the Intervention</title>
<p>The intervention was planned to consist of eight encounters, each lasting 1 to 2 hours, to be conducted during the first 6 to 12 months after a stroke. The intervention was organized as an individual, dialogue-based collaboration and problem-solving process between a stroke survivor and a specially trained nurse. The content of the program addressed four dimensions of psychosocial well-being—basic emotional state, meaningful activities, social relationships, and self-concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049732312450366">Næss, 2001</xref>)—all of which are threatened by stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312450366">Code, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312450366">Code et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312450366">Fure, Wyller, Engedal, &amp; Thommessen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1049732312450366">Parr, 2004</xref>). Worksheets addressing topics related to the aforementioned dimensions of psychosocial well-being and topics known (from the stroke literature) to be challenging were addressed in each encounter. The worksheets were adjusted linguistically for persons with aphasia. We also used principles from the Supported Conversation for Adults With Aphasia method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312450366">Kagan, 1998</xref>) to facilitate the conversations with the participants with language disability. We used an approach called guided self-determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1049732312450366">Zoffmann, 2004</xref>) to support the adjustment process. The theoretical and empirical foundations of the intervention are described in depth elsewhere (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732312450366">Kirkevold, Bronken, Martinsen, &amp; Kvigne, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The recovery process following a stroke has been referred to as a demanding journey in which the stroke survivor moves through different phases as various challenges unfold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312450366">Easton, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312450366">Kirkevold, 2002</xref>). We used a metaphor called the great trial of strength. It refers to a well-known and demanding 335-mile bicycle race in Norway (lasting 15 to 20 hours). Healthy and well-trained bicycle riders are followed by an escort car, which provides the support and equipment that the riders need. We assumed that a stroke survivor also needed an “escort car,” one addressing different needs as the survivor arose during the “journey of recovery” after stroke. Each encounter was conceptualized as a “pit stop” on this “race” toward recovery.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section4-1049732312450366">
<title>Design</title>
<p>This study constitutes a single-case design. A single case was chosen to exemplify and explore in depth how the process of coconstructing stories can be facilitated and developed within the context of the intervention described above. We chose this particular case because the person experienced different degrees of aphasia during the first year poststroke and was able to report the experiences relatively fluently after the intervention ended, providing us with rich data. Even if this participant was very young compared to the mean age of the stroke population, we regarded this case as representative of others because all the participants with aphasia in the larger study appreciated the assistance they received to coconstruct stories about themselves and their illness experiences. However, the participant in this case differed from the others in terms of gradually improving writing abilities and the creative use of the worksheets.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1049732312450366">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Data were obtained from multiple sources using various methods. We assumed that triangulation had a significant potential to expand the depth and breadth of the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312450366">Farmer, Robinson, Elliott, &amp; Eyles, 2006</xref>) given the limited ability of persons with aphasia to produce rich text. Triangulation is generally recommended to improve the trustworthiness of case studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1049732312450366">Patton, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1049732312450366">Stake, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1049732312450366">Yin, 2009</xref>). This article is informed by the data sources and methods, which are described below.</p>
<p>A total of 13 individual encounters between the participant with aphasia and the nurse were conducted during the first year following the stroke. We used participant observation to obtain an insider view of the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732312450366">Malterud, 2001</xref>). Notes were taken immediately following each encounter including context, place, time, content, use of communication resources and worksheets, comments, and reflections. Quotes from the notes are referred to as “log notes” in the findings section. In addition, we used 16 worksheets during the intervention. Demographic and medical data were gathered by members of the multidisciplinary team at the hospital and provided us with background information.</p>
<p>Three qualitative semistructured interviews were conducted with the participant at 2 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months after the intervention ended. These interviews were recorded on video to support the production of detailed interview text. The first interview focused on the experiences of participating in the intervention program and the impact of the program on various dimensions of quality of life (i.e., mood, relationships, activity, and self-esteem). Interviews 2 and 3 were follow-up interviews based on the same themes and relevant topics articulated in the previous interview(s).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1049732312450366">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The participants involved in the coconstruction of narratives in this case were a young woman with aphasia (given the pseudonym Maria) and a specially trained nurse (referred to as the nurse throughout the text). The nurse was the primary researcher and the first author of this article. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049732312450366">Figure 1</xref> gives a short presentation of the participants.</p>

<sec id="section7-1049732312450366">
<title>Context</title>
<p>Maria entered the intervention program 4 weeks after the onset of her stroke while she was still a patient in the hospital. The encounters took place in various locations based on where Maria was in her trajectory. Three encounters took place at the hospital, two took place in a rehabilitation unit, and eight occurred in her home. The first and the third follow-up interviews took place in her home, and the second occurred in a conference room at the hospital.</p>
<p>The partnership between Maria and the nurse was based on active participation in which the patient’s experiences and knowledge and the professional’s experiences and knowledge were considered to be of equal importance in the collaborative process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1049732312450366">Zoffmann, 2004</xref>). Both Maria and the nurse were active as both tellers and listeners, although the nurse, as the nonaphasic partner, had a special professional responsibility to facilitate the conversations and keep them going (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312450366">Kagan, 1998</xref>). Quotes from the interviews, the worksheets, and the log notes were translated from Norwegian to English. The quotes from Maria do not fully reflect the language disorder but were adjusted slightly to convey the meaning as clearly as possible.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1049732312450366">
<title>Ethical Considerations</title>
<p>Persons with aphasia are at risk of emotional harm, disempowerment, and lack of acknowledgment because of their communication disability. Thus, working with persons with aphasia requires careful ethical sensitivity in both clinical practice and research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732312450366">Lloyd, Gatherer, &amp; Kalsy, 2006</xref>; Morse; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1049732312450366">Sundin, Norberg, &amp; Jansson, 2001</xref>). In this case, Maria experienced sudden dramatic changes caused by a serious disease, stroke. The nurse met the participant during a critical phase of life, both in the hospital and at home. Maria gave the nurse access to personal and private observations and information. Ethical sensitivity was stressed during the entire process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732312450366">Morse, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1049732312450366">Weaver, Morse, &amp; Mitcham, 2008</xref>). Single-case studies are prone to threaten confidentiality and anonymity. Names and demographics have been changed, and Maria read and affirmed this presentation prior to publication. Considering the nurse’s powerful role in constructing the narrative of a person with aphasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732312450366">Murray, 2000</xref>), the asymmetry in their relationship with regard to role, position, knowledge, language, and health status was reflected on and respected. There was no conflict between the therapeutic goals and the research goals. Care and security had priority over research goals during the process.</p>
<p>Written informed consent was obtained using a language therapist at the hospital prior to initiation of the study. Oral and written information was communicated using adjusted language and illustrated communication resources. The consent to participate was repeated during the longitudinal intervention period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1049732312450366">Usher &amp; Arthur, 1998</xref>). A separate written informed consent was obtained before the in-depth interviews, which were recorded on video. The project was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics and the Norwegian Social Science Data Services.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1049732312450366">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Data were analyzed from a hermeneutic-phenomenological approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732312450366">Kvale &amp; Brinkmann, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1049732312450366">Ricoeur, 1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1049732312450366">1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1049732312450366">1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1049732312450366">1984</xref>). Linguistic data (text) were understood to encompass all expressions, including symbols, signs, words, images, pictograms, paintings, drawings, and illustrations. Mutual understanding relies on sharing a common sphere of meaning. The linguistic data expressed by Maria were affected by her limited vocabulary and changes in her syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic use of language, which in turn affected the entire text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312450366">Damico &amp; Simmons-Mackie, 2003</xref>). Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1049732312450366">Ricoeur (1978)</xref>, our ideas were supported by metaphorical thinking. According to him, the metaphorical process plays a semantic role and contributes value to the meaning of a text through its ability to “set before the eyes” a pictorial dimension of imagination and feelings, thereby enhancing the full cognitive intent. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1049732312450366">Ricoeur (1984)</xref>, narrative time is composed of two dimensions, the episodic and the configurational. The narratives are temporal and made up of events (episodes), and these events are rendered significant wholes by means of a plot (a configuration). By articulating relationships between events, people can give meaning to both past events and possible future events. Our understanding was developed through a continuous dialectic and a process of interpreting the whole from various parts that lasted throughout the entire analytical process.</p>
<p>The analytical process encompassed three main phases: naïve reading, structural analysis, and comprehensive understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732312450366">Lindseth &amp; Norberg, 2004</xref>). In the first phase, the entire text from each different data source was read to obtain an overall impression of the process of coconstructing stories. Reflections from these naïve readings resulted in the structural analyses, in which meaning units related to the process of storytelling were identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1049732312450366">Riessman, 2001</xref>). Accounts related to characteristics of the partnership, the content of the stories, how the stories were coconstructed (i.e., interactions, expressions, facilitation, use of communication recourses), roles in the interaction, the timeline, and contextual factors were sorted out and thematized. Each of the data sources was analyzed separately.</p>
<p>The qualitative interviews recorded on video were viewed and listened to and transcribed verbatim, and the transcripts were read several times to sustain the meaning of the text. Events that Maria emphasized as important in the follow-up interviews shed light above and beyond the data from the log notes and the worksheets. Data from one source were found to complement data from other sources. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1049732312450366">Figure 2</xref> gives an illustration from the structural analysis and shows the profile of Maria’s “journey of recovery” during the collaboration process. The profile is related to the great-trial-of-strength metaphor. An uphill direction indicates that Maria was experiencing difficult challenges and distress, whereas a downhill direction indicates that things were getting easier. The timeline shows how the encounters were allocated and when the interviews took place.</p>

<p>In the last phase, our understanding was deepened by reflections on our preliminary findings from the naïve reading and the structural analysis. The subthemes were reflected on in light of the aim of this article. A dialectical comparison of the events (references in the text) and interpretations of their meaning (sense) were viewed in the context of relevant narrative theory and abstracted into three main themes: the need to tell, opportunity to tell, and help telling.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>In the following text, we present excerpts from significant parts of the partnership formed between Maria and the nurse to coconstruct stories. These excerpts illuminate the process of how they interacted. To some extent, they are presented as a chronological succession of encounters to illustrate the evolution of the process over time.</p>
<sec id="section11-1049732312450366">
<title>Entering a Strange New World</title>
<p>The first encounter between Maria and the nurse took place at the hospital where Maria was still a patient. Maria’s speech-language therapist participated to support the communication between Maria and the nurse. After a mutual presentation, they explored how to best communicate with each other. Maria communicated with single words, such as “hm,” “yes,” “uff,” and “right,” and by nodding and using facial expressions. She had lost a range of words and struggled to understand both spoken and written language. She could neither read nor write but recognized a few written words. The nurse spoke slowly and clearly, highlighted keywords in the worksheets, pointed to visual illustrations, and was vigilant to Maria’s nonverbal signs. She sought to act in a way that made Maria feel seen, heard, and acknowledged as a competent adult person. Maria smiled and appeared interested in the intervention program.</p>
<p>The nurse invited Maria to tell her about what happened to her when she experienced the stroke. Maria tried to communicate what happened but struggled to find words. The nurse listened actively and tried to encourage her by asking questions, guessing, and helping her to find the words she was searching for. After a dialogue with questions, answers, guessing, interpretation, and validation, the nurse told Maria the story back the way that she had interpreted it and wrote it down in Maria’s worksheets (and in her own log notes). An excerpt is presented below:
<disp-quote>
<p>Maria was alone in her flat when she suddenly felt strange and was unable to move her body normally. When she finally managed to call the emergency number, she could not say who she was, where she lived or what had happened to her. When she arrived at the hospital, she could not understand what the “white people” were trying to tell her, nor could they understand what she said. Stroke was not on her mind at all. Maria used the words “strange” and “oh dear,” “uff” several times.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Maria concentrated hard to talk and understand and expressed tiredness after about half an hour. The two agreed to meet once before transition from the hospital to a rehabilitation unit.</p>
<p>The second encounter occurred 9 days later. The nurse initiated the conversation and used a worksheet that focused on Maria’s life before the onset of the stroke to better understand who Maria was and the life that the stroke had interrupted. The nurse encouraged Maria to tell her about herself, her family, her interests, her values, and her goals. She thought for a while and uttered, “Yeah . . . what shall I say . . . ?” It was very difficult for her to know what to talk about and how to express it. As a result, the nurse asked single questions such as, “Where do you live? What do you enjoy doing? What is most important to you now?” Maria sought to answer, but struggled immensely. For example, Maria was about to talk about her family but could not remember any names or places. The nurse encouraged Maria to refer to anything, that is, a direction, a letter, a sign, or something else. Maria wrote down the letter “S.” The nurse suggested many places beginning with “S,” all of which were wrong. Maria then corrected the health care worker by saying, “Not Norway, hm.” She looked around and grabbed a diary with a map. Finally, they ended in Sweden. By the use of a combination of talking, writing, and a toolbox with communication recourses, they both engaged in a dialectical process to determine significant fragments of Maria’s background.</p>
<p>The metaphor of the great trial of strength was introduced, and the nurse asked Maria to point out where in the landscape she imagined that she was. Maria thought for a while and answered, “Hm . . . difficult . . . do not know . . . never been sick before.” Her situation was “new” and “strange,” and she lacked experience and knowledge. Even if she referred to some frustrating events in which she was unable to talk or get others to understand, she was mainly in good spirits and looked forward to her stay in rehabilitation and to getting healthy. The nurse wrote the following in her log notes:
<disp-quote>
<p>Maria seemed optimistic and motivated. The atmosphere was relaxed, and I think we understood each other. Maria was smiling and seemed satisfied. I left the encounter with a good feeling. Her young age and the seriousness of her situation affect me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the first follow-up interview, Maria referred to this period of her trajectory in the following way: “In the beginning, I believed that my language would come back, and I could start working again after some weeks of training, even if the professionals told me that it would take time and that the outcomes were unpredictable.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1049732312450366">
<title>Behind the Smile, Thoughts and Feelings Pile Up</title>
<p>Maria and the nurse met twice during Maria’s rehabilitation stay, at 10 and 14 weeks poststroke (also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1049732312450366">Figure 2</xref>). For one of the worksheets, the topic was how the participant experienced being a stroke survivor, and the participant was offered the opportunity to tell her personal “illness story” (i.e., using a poem, song, picture, drawing, or thing), which is referred to as a fundamental need following a traumatic event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312450366">Frank, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312450366">1998</xref>). Maria had found a picture of a woman walking outdoors with her dog. The lady was surrounded by an invisible house. The heading of the picture was, “But, you look so healthy. . . .” The nurse explored the meaning of this picture with Maria and asked if she felt locked in, whether she felt that others did not understand her, and whether she felt lonely. She nodded and answered in the following way: “The last you said.” The nurse responded by saying, “Lonely?” Maria responded, “Yes. . . . Like in a bubble. . . . Alone.” She referred to an event in which another patient at the unit had asked her why she was a patient when she looked so normal. In despair and incapable of answering, she just smiled and left. Internally, she felt sad, desperate, and in great need of help. She commented, “If I . . . [she used body language to illustrate paralysis] others could see . . . at least.”</p>
<p>As loneliness, invisible symptoms, and lack of understanding are common challenges and experiences described in the stroke literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1049732312450366">Stone, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049732312450366">Nyström, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1049732312450366">Röding, Lindström, Malm, &amp; Ôhman, 2003</xref>), the nurse verbalized this to Maria as a means of offering emotional support, acknowledging her reactions as common and hopefully supporting her making her situation understandable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312450366">Antonovsky, 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312450366">1996</xref>). Maria got CDs with relaxing music, paper, pencil, crayons, and a booklet with advice for communication (for family and friends) from the toolbox. Maria appreciated help to deal with alternative ways of expressing other than spoken language. After this encounter, the nurse wrote the following in her log notes: “Maria is smiling but looks tired, and her eyes are sad and blank. I think she is very unhappy. Her suffering hurts. Smiling depression?”</p>
<p>Four weeks later (three and a half months after her stroke), Maria was resting in her bed when the nurse arrived. She had been through a very difficult period since they last met. To use the metaphor described above, the terrain was very rough (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1049732312450366">see Figure 2</xref>). The evolving consequences of her stroke and aphasia had become clearer to her, and the growing uncertainty she faced was overwhelming. She demonstrated with her body language how she was freezing and shaking by putting her own arms around her chest. The nurse picked up the story from the former encounter and asked Maria to tell her how she felt inside and what she was most concerned about. With tears in her eyes, she expressed exhaustion, anxiety, loss, grief, uncertainty about treatment, uncertainty about coming home, uncertainty about the outcomes of her illness and the duration of her language disability, and uncertainty about her work and her relationships. Fragmentarily, she expressed her incomprehensibility and loss in the following way: “Why now! . . . Do not understand . . . I have lost so much!” (Log notes).</p>
<p>The nurse listened actively, verbalized, mirrored her interpretations, and helped Maria find words in an effort to understand Maria’s situation and share in her story. A sense of coherence is considered essential to human coping, by experiencing life events as comprehensible, manageable, and meaningful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312450366">Antonovsky, 1987</xref>). The nurse sought to improve Maria’s understanding of the situation by sharing knowledge with her regarding the phases in the trajectory of poststroke survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312450366">Easton, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312450366">Kirkevold, 2002</xref>), common challenges, and the process of going through crisis and grief (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312450366">Code &amp; Herrmann, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Maria’s stories led to conversations about time, patience with regard to final outcomes, short-term goals, and attention to improvements as well as activities she felt positive about. Together, they sorted out what kind of support she needed at the present moment to be more confident and to be able to move on in her “race” toward recovery. They agreed to talk with the staff about Maria’s worries and to clarify plans concerning her discharge. Maria wanted the nurse to be an advocate on her behalf because of her problems with expressing her concerns. She was exhausted and afraid of forgetting what she wanted to ask for. This new insight into Maria’s situation, which was carefully puzzled together during the coconstruction of Maria’s story, affected decision making about which multidisciplinary services she should receive in the community after coming home. After the encounter, the nurse wrote in her log notes,
<disp-quote>
<p>Maria initiated the encounters at the rehabilitation unit by calling me. I interpreted the first call as a good sign of her improving language skills and self-determination. Looking back, I actually think that this was a desperate call, which I didn’t understand at that time: Maria was a patient at a specialized rehabilitation hospital. Several months later, she told me that she hadn’t been able to talk with the staff about her emotional and cognitive pondering. The staff was so too busy.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1049732312450366">
<title>Cannot Live Like This!</title>
<p>The nurse picked up threads from the former encounter and invited Maria to talk about her experiences of going home. Maria was happy about being home, but new challenges mounted. At the rehabilitation unit, she had envisioned receiving support from a multidisciplinary team. Where were they? When would they come? How could she get in contact with them as she struggled to make a call, read, and write? What did they expect her to do? How? It was very complicated for her to navigate the health care system and to gather needed information. Again, she was overwhelmed by anxiety, uncertainty, despair, and exhaustion. She needed help from someone who could act on her stories.</p>
<p>Gradually, as Maria’s language abilities improved, she started to write in the worksheets on her own prior to the encounters. She put a great deal of effort into composing the words and sentences, and expressed uncertainty concerning what she had written and whether it was comprehensible to the nurse. Some of the worksheets were outlined as unfinished sentences. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1049732312450366">Figure 3</xref> gives an example of a worksheet concerning mood that Maria wrote 5 months after her stroke.</p>

<p>Paying attention to Maria’s reflections on the worksheets by mirroring them (e.g., “Tell me what you’re dealing with that makes you sleepless?”) revealed new stories. For example, several times at night, she had to control whether she was able to move and talk, which in turn made her sleepless and engendered anxiety and exhaustion. This story reflected fear of a new stroke, which was then discussed. The nurse listened actively and engaged in Maria’s stories by questioning, interpreting, framing, and sharing relevant professional knowledge with her, such as how to enhance “general resistance resources” such as sleep, physical activity, social support, food, and pleasure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312450366">Antonovsky, 1996</xref>). The constructed stories were used to set new goals and engage her in problem solving.</p>
<p>The utterances in Maria’s worksheet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1049732312450366">Figure 3</xref>) reflected how she linked elements of the past, present, and future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1049732312450366">Ricoeur, 1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1049732312450366">1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1049732312450366">1984</xref>) and how she struggled to make sense of and handle her new life situation. At that moment, she felt lonely and uncertain and had many thoughts and feelings to handle, yet she continued to look to the future with dreams and a belief in obtaining a new life, and being able to enjoy it with friends, as she had done in the past. These thoughts and reflections kept her up at night. It is well known that the way a person comes to terms with loss and change influences the meaning given to an illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312450366">Kaufman, 1988</xref>, p. 218). Assistance to talk about thoughts, feelings, her condition, and her new everyday experiences was emphasized as the most important support offered during the intervention, as reflected in the first follow-up interview:
<disp-quote>
<p>The nurse helped me to give order to all the thoughts and feelings that were swirling around all the time, which I didn’t know where to put or what to do with. It helped me to find words and to put words to my thoughts and feelings.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Maria emphasized the importance of “not being left alone.” Her need to talk was illuminated in the following quote:
<disp-quote>
<p>In the beginning, I wanted to talk about the stroke all the time. With friends you have to give and take. With the nurse, I could just take and talk about myself all the time. It was very good for me to pay attention to other things than my body, like my thoughts and feelings, which were the most difficult for me, so you didn’t have to bear them inside.</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<sec id="section14-1049732312450366">
<title>The Broken Mirror</title>
<p>Maria presented herself as a social person who enjoyed being with friends and taking part in social activities. After the stroke, social activity was very demanding and exposed her to many situations in which her self-concept and identity were threatened. Several times she referred to a picture of a woman in front of a broken mirror, which is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1049732312450366">Figure 4</xref> above.</p>

<p>Maria was concerned about what others thought about her and was afraid of being regarded as simple and uninteresting: She expressed the negative feelings she had when she was at a loss for words, did not know what to say, was misunderstood, or fell off in conversations, as reflected in the follow-up interview: “Expressing myself like a child who is learning to talk when you are an adult is no pleasure. It does something to you!”</p>
<p>Her social role and self-image had changed. There was a mismatch between her desire and ability. Lack of energy, problems with understanding and talking, and intolerance for noise and sounds made it very difficult for her to keep up. Stories of daily events were “unpacked” and coconstructed by verbal exchanges, interpretation, questions, and validation. The nurse verbalized her interpretation of what she imagined was difficult in the situation back to Maria. She responded to and validated thoughts and feelings by using phrases such as “yeah exactly.” Social affirmation is normally an important part of self-construction, self-esteem, and identity development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312450366">Atkinson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312450366">Holstein &amp; Gubrium, 2000</xref>).</p>

<p>Maria and the nurse continued working systematically with the topics on the worksheets.

Maria’s retrospective assessment of the methodological approach of working to coconstruct stories was reflected in the follow-up interview:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think the “booklet” was very good. It was systematic at the same time as I could decide what I wanted to talk about. . . . I like to think and talk through pictures, but as I gradually started to write better, that was good too.

<title>It Is Getting Better and Better</title>
<p>Approximately 7 months after the stroke, Maria seemed to arrive at a turning point in her “journey.” Her language abilities improved a great deal. She wrote more on the worksheets, and her stories captured a wider variety of topics. She needed less help from the nurse to initiate, frame, and find words and to transform her experiences into stories. The content in her stories changed from “suffering” toward more “acting and coping” (i.e., they did not focus on what she was no longer able to do). They were about things she had done, how she had handled different situations and future plans, and daily challenges. She had initiated a visit to her colleagues at work, tidied up her storeroom, been to a public office by herself, walked in the park, and visited some of her friends. The nurse listened to the stories, cheered her progress, followed up on previous topics, and engaged in the conversation by sharing her views and relevant knowledge. In the last part of the partnership between Maria and the nurse, Maria set new goals and was about to return to work, initiate a close relationship, and redecorate a new house. She was prepared to end the partnership and “stand on her own feet,” as she said.</p>

<title>The Relationship</title>
<p>Maria regarded the linguistic facilitation during the collaboration process to be very important.

The following quote from the first follow-up interview reflects her assessment:
<disp-quote>
<p>There was no pressure or anything like that, it just helped me. I felt that I could decide nearly everything actually; at the same time, it helped me to talk, to get words for things, so that was very good. . . . Talking with a person outside of my friend and family network who had knowledge of the field was helpful. The nurse knew what problems occur with stroke and aphasia.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have illustrated how a person with aphasia and a nurse collaborated to coconstruct stories within the context of a complex clinical intervention aimed at promoting psychosocial well-being after stroke. The discussion is organized into the three main themes identified through our comprehensive analyses: the need to tell, opportunity to tell, and help telling.</p>
<sec id="section19-1049732312450366">
<title>The Need to Tell</title>
<p>Maria knew little about stroke and aphasia, and the sudden change in her identity from being a healthy person to being sick was incomprehensible to her. The disruption of her well-functioning life put her in a chaotic state, fraught with fear, uncertainty, grief, and loss, which she lacked the experience to handle. Her great need to talk and her inability to do so engendered in her a frightening loneliness, which she often referred to. She emphasized the importance of not being left alone with her thoughts and feelings. Sharing stories can function as a way of breaking through the wall of isolation and loneliness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312450366">Frank, 1998</xref>) and of regaining structure and order in the chaos that follows illness, change, and disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312450366">Bury, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312450366">Charon, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312450366">Frank, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312450366">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732312450366">Kleinman, 1988</xref>). Narratives are grounded in language and communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1049732312450366">Polkinghorne, 1988</xref>), which means that persons with language disability are robbed of a fundamental tool in their recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1049732312450366">Shadden &amp; Hagstrøm, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The ability to talk, read, and write is normally taken for granted. Language disability and cognitive processes are invisible and difficult to understand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1049732312450366">Stone, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1049732312450366">Röding et al., 2003</xref>), and the narratives of persons with aphasia stand at risk of being unvoiced, as illustrated in this case. In our study, the narrative needs of patients were focused on and cultivated using a longitudinal partnership. Maria’s social life suffered in several ways. The way she was able to present and position herself to others and her capacity to participate in social settings had changed. She often felt poorly understood and received strange feedback from her natural environment, which she found threatening to her self-esteem. Coconstructing stories about these experiences, receiving responses from the nurse, and discussing ways of preparing for and acting in challenging situations were described as beneficial in the follow-up interviews.</p>
<p>Stories are usually intentional and adjusted to different social settings with the purpose of presenting and positioning oneself in a certain way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312450366">Holstein &amp; Gubrium, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1049732312450366">Riessman, 2001</xref>). The partnership of storytelling was helpful to Maria both in terms of the process of reconstructing an altered self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312450366">Atkinson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312450366">Bruner, 1991</xref>) and as a means of receiving social affirmation, acknowledgment, and professional legitimation of her situation (Atkinson; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312450366">Bury, 1982</xref>; Holstein &amp; Gubrium). The interaction between the partners might serve as a beneficial compensation for Maria’s reduced ability to be socially active and for the altered responses she received from her natural environment. For persons with aphasia, storytelling is a great challenge to carry out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312450366">Hinckley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1049732312450366">Parr, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1049732312450366">Shadden &amp; Hagström, 2007</xref>), and they need facilitation and support. Our findings suggest that storytelling for this target group needs facilitation and support, and coconstructed stories might serve as an important resource for both coping and problem solving.</p>

<title>Opportunity to Tell</title>
<p>The process of coconstructing stories was implemented within the context of an intervention focusing on psychosocial issues. By virtue of giving specific attention to the psychosocial consequences of stroke and putting them on the agenda as common and “normal,” the nurse gained access to stories of a psychosocial nature that easily could have gone unvoiced. Persons with aphasia need time to communicate and must put a great deal of effort and concentration into understanding others and expressing themselves. It is often difficult for them to initiate a conversation and to know what to talk about and how to express it. In busy health care settings, conversations often take place during practical care. Maria was not able to talk and do things at the same time.</p>
<p>This intervention was based on dialogues, and all attention was paid to the communicative interaction. The opportunity to coconstruct stories was facilitated by environmental and structural factors. Organized time preserved for talking during the first year poststroke made it possible to coconstruct stories, maintain continuity, follow up, pay attention to changes, and connect the past, present, and future. The mutual, cumulative knowledge that the partners gained about one another and their personal ways of communicating engendered the storytelling. Planned and organized time preserved for talking about psychosocial issues longitudinally is necessary to meet the narrative needs of persons with aphasia.</p>

<title>The partnership of storytelling</title>
<p>Maria described the relationship as open and trusting and expressed a feeling of deciding nearly everything, including what to talk about. A therapeutic relationship and trust are important in any caring practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1049732312450366">Skirbekk, Middelthon, Hjortdahl, &amp; Finset, 2011</xref>) but crucial in interactions with persons with aphasia because of their reduced ability to express both needs and reservations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312450366">Kirsh &amp; Tate, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732312450366">Lloyd et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1049732312450366">Sundin &amp; Jansson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1049732312450366">Sundin, Jansson, &amp; Norberg, 2002</xref>). Maria was in a vulnerable situation, and there was asymmetry with regard to knowledge, position, and language ability in the partnership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732312450366">Murray, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The relationship between Maria and the nurse evolved as a cumulative process during the course of a longitudinal intervention lasting one year. The growing body of knowledge concerning Maria’s life and world exchanged during the interactions and gathered by writing down systematic and detailed information after every encounter increased the likelihood of reaching shared stories and mutual understanding. The quality of any relationship likely influences the stories that are told, and the outcome of the recovery process can be enhanced or hindered depending on this relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312450366">Frank, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312450366">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312450366">Hinckley, 2010</xref>). Storytelling is a relational activity that calls for someone to listen, respond, empathize, and act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312450366">Charon, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312450366">Frank, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1049732312450366">Riessman, 2001</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section23-1049732312450366">
<title>The role of the coconstructer in the partnership</title>
<p>Aphasia disturbs the natural dynamic interplay within an interaction. An active listening and interpreting role during the coconstruction of narratives was a key element in the process. To listen attentively and to be engaged during storytelling is acknowledged as an ethical responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312450366">Charon, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312450366">Frank, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732312450366">Kleinman, 1988</xref>). In Maria’s case, chaos narratives dominated 3 to 7 months after her stroke, as this was the most difficult phase in her trajectory. The listener had to provide active help and engagement by framing, interpreting, encouraging, asking, and using illustrated communication resources to reveal and construct the stories. In interacting with a person suffering from aphasia, one is not simply receiving the gift of a story by just listening. Active cocreation of stories also requires participation, support to express, facilitation, empathy, interpretation, and personal engagement.</p>
<p>A central principle in the Supported Conversation for Adults With Aphasia method is the responsibility of the nonaphasic conversation partner to keep the conversation going (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312450366">Kagan, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732312450366">Kagan et al., 2001</xref>). In the follow-up interviews, Maria said that throughout the partnership, she felt understood both in terms of her compromised language and with respect to her new situation. Knowledge from the field of stroke and aphasia helped the nurse to understand signs and expressions and to respond to them appropriately. Metaphorical thinking played an important role in the interpretative process of understanding syllables, single words, incomplete sentences, pictures, and gestures. The continuous process of validating the interpretations was an iterative part of the process of coconstructing narratives. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1049732312450366">Ricoeur (1978)</xref>, the dialectic between explanation and interpretation evident in questioning and answering can be an important part of promoting understanding.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-1049732312450366">
<title>Conversations, worksheets, and metaphors</title>
<p>The methodological approach of using a combination of conversations, worksheets, and metaphors revealed a range of stories. Maria regarded the worksheets as good tools for reflecting and consciousness raising. Topics in the worksheets were starting points for conversation. Written text, illustrations, pictograms, and opportunities to express herself in various ways were regarded as stimulating and helped her to focus on topics of concern to her. Gradually, as her language abilities improved, she also began writing down words and sentences, which in turn evolved into stories about events and experiences.</p>
<p>The great-trial-of-strength metaphor helped to reveal stories about experiences from a demanding and shifting “landscape” that was complete with ups and downs, challenges to overcome, the need for motivation and cheering, loneliness, hidden handicaps, and threats to identity, all of which easily could have been unvoiced and overlooked without the facilitation and resources provided to her. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049732312450366">Otto (2000)</xref> argued that metaphors can both enhance and transform the collective knowledge of a field, serving as a communication tool to express experiences and needs and communicate them in a way that is easy to understand, accept, and remember.</p>
<p>The focus of rehabilitation for persons with aphasia is often held on training language skills, which obviously is an important tool for storytelling, but storytelling reaches beyond language skills. The need for narrating about oneself, one’s history, and one’s experiences in everyday life and with illness experiences is a basic human need and a resource for recovery that is threatened for persons with aphasia. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312450366">Hjelmblink et al. (2007)</xref> also found that the aphasia diagnosis misled both the person with aphasia and the health care professionals to focus on only speech-language therapy. Our experiences imply that facilitation and support of storytelling should be targeted by nurses and other health care professions in rehabilitation programs to this group.</p>

<title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
<p>Active participant observation during the intervention provided us with rich information from an insider’s view of the partnership of storytelling, which improved our understanding of the process. Combining active participation and adequate observation and distance in a setting in which one is personally involved for a relatively long time is challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732312450366">Malterud, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1049732312450366">Patton, 2002</xref>). Information from three retrospective follow-up interviews with Maria (recorded on videotape) and her affirmation of the presentation in this article are seen to improve the trustworthiness of our findings (Malterud). The findings from the different data sources were complementary. The researchers’ preunderstanding of storytelling as an active component to improve adjustment and psychosocial well-being poststroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732312450366">Kirkevold et al., 2012</xref>) can be a strength in the sense of paying attention to this dimension of recovering, but also a risk for subjective selection of quotes (Malterud). To counteract the risks, we took part in a reflexive analytical process and questioned the text for competing interpretations.</p>
<p>Interviewing a person with aphasia threatens the gold standard of qualitative interviews, which includes the use of questions with an open ending to obtain spontaneous and rich interview text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732312450366">Kvale &amp; Brinkmann, 2009</xref>). When the interviews with Maria were performed, she talked quite fluently, even if her vocabulary was reduced and she struggled to express herself in the way she wanted to. The nurse and Maria were confident in their communication and had implicit and mutual knowledge about the collaboration process, which enhanced the interview process and follow-up questioning. Maria was much younger than the mean age of the stroke population. She had a college education and had interests in reading, writing, and drawing, which might have influenced her active engagement in the interactive process. The merits of our approach and the methodological facilitation of storytelling need more research on a larger scale.</p>
