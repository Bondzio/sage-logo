<p><italic>They call February the month of love, I call it the month of change …</italic></p>
<p>In February 2010, I was walking with Mathapelo along Swazi Street. It was around 7pm, a few hours after my aunt’s funeral. My friend was accompanying me to my house and the street was not busy that day. A guy came walking in the opposite direction. We paid no attention to him because we did not think of anything bad. In a blink of an eye he was right behind us with a gun. He said: ‘<italic>futsek nina siya le manje</italic>’ (‘We are going in that direction now’). Shaking and scared, we listened to him.</p>
<p>He led us to a field. The strange thing about him was that he knew the place so well that he told us exactly where to walk because that place has dangerous holes we could fall in. When we got to his place of horror he instructed us to lie on the ground face down, hands behind our backs. We did as we were told because we feared for our lives; he had a gun in his hand and was threatening to use it if we did not do as he said. He undressed us and said: ‘today <italic>ngizoni khipha ubutabane.</italic>’</p>
<p>I said a little prayer because I knew what was coming after. He then tied both our hands and feet. My friend kept on negotiating with him not to rape us and I was absentminded the whole time. It felt like my body was there but my mind was so far away. I just remember my friend saying, ‘please, if you rape us use a condom.’</p>
<p>He asked why I was wearing guys’ clothes. My tongue was tied, I couldn’t say anything, so I kept quiet. He covered our faces with our clothes, then he started raping my friend. When he was done he then untied my feet, spread my legs apart and forcefully penetrated me. I was crying and praying. When he was done he got dressed and said, ‘Am going now, I will tell you when you should go.’ Then he started walking, I could hear his movements as he was moving through the grass. From a distance he told us to get dressed and go. We tried to untie each other’s hands then got dressed. In the dark we managed to get out of those fields.</p>
<p>Then I told my friend that I was going straight to the police station. It was around 11pm. She said it was too risky but I told her that I did not care. We got to the police station; the police officers took us to a room.</p>
<p>We told them what happened and as we talking they stopped and asked me, ‘You were raped? How? That is impossible, you’re a guy!’ What they said hurt me even more. I then asked them how I could be male <italic>namabele</italic> (with breasts)!</p>
<p>If it was not for the girl I used to go to school with, those stupid people would have not taken my statement.</p>
<p>As they were taking our statements one of the officers said that it’s not the first time they heard of a rape case in that area. In my mind I thought: ‘Why, then, didn’t you go patrol the veld?’ We left the police station around 12 or 1am. I could not sleep that night as I could smell the guy on my body. In the morning, we went back to the police for the tests. They took them, gave us some pills, then told us to go, that they will call us.</p>
<p>Time went by and they never called until Kaya FM covered my story and demanded to know what happened. Police told them that the case was closed because the suspect was unknown. A year later, the case was reopened; they found the guy and arrested him. In court he was charged with 17 cases of rape. He got a life sentence for his crimes. I cannot say I was happy with that but it was better than nothing.</p>
<p>When I thought that the worst had past, hell broke loose. My life turned upside down. I was not treated well at home and I got very sick in December 2011 due to stress.</p>
<p>In January 2012, I was admitted to hospital – I was very sick and I thought I was dying. The doctors did a string of tests to figure out what was wrong with me. The tests came back and I was diagnosed as HIV-positive. On top of that I had a lung infection and PCP [a pneumonia very common among HIV patients]. At that point I could not breathe nor walk. I thought it was the end of me.</p>
<p>I stayed in hospital for two months, and when I was discharged my CD4 count [cell count that helps the body’s immunity] was single digit; no one thought I was going to make it. However, I started taking ARVs [anti-retrovirals] and I must say I am healthier than ever before; my CD4 count is over 300 and my viral load is low.</p>
<p>One thing I still need to overcome, though, is the fact that whenever I take my medication I am reminded of what that bastard did to me!</p>
<p>However, my inner self is strong; I am going beat this. HIV is not my life and I am not going to let it get to me.</p>
<p>I am not a victim but a victor …</p>

<p>Maybe love did live here once upon a time</p>
<p>When the sky was still blue and less invaded</p>
<p>When the grass was still green and natural</p>
<p>When the air still smelt fresh and less polluted</p>
<p>I long for something so real and non-judgmental</p>
<p>Give me something grounded, give me something rooted</p>
<p>Give me something real, give me something honest</p>
<p>Something so natural, give me something pure</p>
<p>Give me love my sweet, but give me truth</p>
<p>Give me something solid, give me unbreakable</p>
<p>Give me joy and excitement right through</p>
<p>Lay down with me and bless me with your love</p>
<p>Don’t corrupt my heart, but let it run free</p>
<p>Don’t judge me by my past. I’m doing right by you</p>
<p>Brush away the pain, sooth me with your touch</p>
<p>Maybe love still, just still leaves here just waiting for you</p>
<p>May my waiting be not in vain</p>
<p>Let my heart find you</p>
<p>Let your heat hear my heartbeat</p>
<p>Follow the sound of your heartbeat</p>
<p>I’m ready to give you a piece of me</p>
<p>A piece of me you shall have</p>
<p>Maybe love still lives here</p>

<p><italic>28 March 2009</italic></p>
<p>This was a very hopeful day for me. I remember waking up in the morning – it was Friday and I was in a weekend mood. This day was blazing hot and I just felt really good. I didn’t drag myself out of bed; I was so anxious to get to Leratong Hospital to see her. This was supposed to be the day I bore witness to change. On this day I didn’t cry at all; instead I had a smile on my face. For the first time in three months, I was <italic>hopeful</italic>. I remember as I was walking out the building, even the security guard said I looked happier than I had in a while. He asked if I had received good news from the hospital. I said, ‘nope’, but I was convinced that the medication given to her the night before had taken effect.</p>
<p>As I approached the hospital, my stomach was in knots suddenly. The taxi I was in hit somebody and we were delayed. We had to wait while the police took statements and attended to the people that were hurt. I could see the hospital on the horizon.</p>
<p>After a while I asked the policeman to go, as I was rushing to the hospital. I was imagining today she would realise I was there, she would not cry hysterically when I left but would tell me ‘I am getting better’ and we would be together again.</p>
<p>Finally the policeman said we could go. I got in another taxi and in five minutes I was there. As usual I was expecting the security guards to let me in. It had been the norm for me to be at the hospital by 7am daily but on this day I was there around 1pm; visiting hours were 2 to 3pm. I remember begging and pleading to go through.</p>
<p>This nasty feeling in my stomach grew stronger, by then I was cursing out of pure frustration and it didn’t help. Finally 2pm came and they opened the gates. I actually ran up to the ward. As I was coming in, I saw that she wasn’t there, someone else was occupying the bed I had left her in the previous evening. Her mother and little sister also walked in and I was the one trying to calm her mother down, telling her maybe the medication finally worked and she was no longer in the critical ward.</p>
<p>I remember the stares from the people in the ward, the nurse avoiding my eyes and I knew, but still, I fought the nasty feeling and chose HOPE. Someone finally came and invited us into a small office. Only her mother and sister could sit there and I stood by the door. I didn’t like her look at all as she fiddled with the file in her hand. She then started to take us on a long journey and I did not hear a word except for her mother’s sharp scream. I asked the nurse what time she had passed on. She said to me they pronounced her dead at 13:15 and I said to her, ‘Did it not dawn on you to call someone? I was waiting outside.’ When people die, all they want is a familiar face, a hand to hold on to until they go. All she could say was, ‘We knew you would be here at 2pm.’</p>
<p>She then led us to the room next door, she opened the door, and all I saw was her clean-shaven head, her face covered in a sheet to her forehead. I walked closer thinking, this is a mistake, a technical glitch, she will wake up and say, ‘April fool’s came early’. I pulled the sheet down, touched her face. It was cool, her facial expression was of a person who had been crying, her teeth clinched together as if she was still in pain. As I moved my hand up her cheek the last tear fell from her eye. I then confirmed that she really had been crying. I then started crying, realising the pain in her face as my face touched hers. I could no longer feel life like I used to, on her face. I remember walking away in a daze. I walked out of the hospital with so many questions in my head and no answers.</p>
<p>By the time I reached the taxi rank, her mother and sister were still hysterical. They got into a taxi to their home and I got into a taxi to Jo’burg. As the taxi pulled off, I cried so loud that people didn’t know what to do with me. I called my friend, told her, called my sister as well.</p>
<p>I don’t know how I got home, but when I did, I asked my cousin to please ensure my son did not come into my bedroom. I texted him from my bedroom to inform him of what had happened. I took all my clothes off, got two of her jackets from the wardrobe that smelled like her and covered myself in them and I was just so numb I was not sure if I should cry out loud or just keep quiet. Immediately I played ‘You and I’ by Michael Bublé on repeat, our song, over and over again. I must have dozed off because when I woke up my friends were there and I started crying again. I asked them to leave because they were taking me away from my dreams. In my dreams she was still there, smiling, laughing and dancing to India Arie. I could hear her in the lounge singing, ‘Having a private party, just me and my guitar.’ They left and I went back to the last three months with Penelope.</p>
<p><italic>21 December 2008</italic></p>
<p>She calls me from Cape Town, tells me she has decided to take the morning flight and will be with me in three hours’ time. I wake up and realise I’m unable to cook, as I am still hungover from my birthday celebration with friends from the previous evening. Around 12pm I get a call to come and get her downstairs. We spent the rest of the afternoon just talking. At around 8pm, we realised we were hungry, ordered a pizza and continued talking. Here was this lovely woman, hungry for life, had so much to give, she had plans for her brand and how she was going to be taking the South African fashion industry by storm. She carried the review of her brand Soul Chaeld in <italic>Drum</italic> magazine, as well as samples of what she had designed and made, with her. The following day we went out for breakfast. She was working the afternoon shift, 1pm to 5pm.</p>
<p>For the first, time while we were having breakfast, she was suddenly sick, didn’t even touch her food; she was so tired and drained. We immediately went back to the flat. She said, ‘I just want to rest and when I wake up, I know I will be fine.’ I asked if I could get her anything, she said, no, that this would go away. ‘I am eating healthy and I do Pilates.’ She called in sick; around 3pm she woke up and went home to rest some more. When I called her that evening she said she had beaten shingles and she was on her way to recovery. I remember that evening reading and getting as much information as I possibly could on HIV so I could be equipped.</p>
<p>On Christmas day, we went off to her family to have lunch there. I remember her singing and dancing, but by the end of the afternoon, it happened again. She was in pain. This time I suggested a doctor but she said no, she would be fine. We got home; she took a bath and slept. This went on for a couple of days, then she’d be good again. New Year’s Eve she spent sleeping, woke up at 12am to pray and went back to sleep.</p>
<p><italic>18 January 2009</italic></p>
<p>She calls me crying because her cough won’t go away. She says she has been up all night and in pain. I go to Kempton Park. When I get there, she can hardly stand.</p>
<p>She looked so weak. My well-groomed Penelope was not there. I assisted her to the bathtub, got her dressed.</p>
<p>She lived 2km away from Arwyp Clinic. Getting there took us forever, as it was hard for her to walk and we had to stop along the way. When we were close, I sat her down, ran to the clinic and requested a wheelchair and they obliged. I wheeled her there. She went through a series of tests. The nurses were trying to get blood from her, she was screaming from pain and the nurses were asking me what is wrong with her, how to make her comfortable. I told the head nurse she was HIV-positive. Immediately they called someone else who knew how to help. In my head I was trying to help make the situation a bit easier. Boy was she mad at me. She asked, who gave me permission to tell people about her status? Her doctor knew and why was I telling the nurse? I apologised because I knew she was talking from a place of pain. I asked her doctor how I was expected to take her home when she was in so much pain. He gave us some cough syrup and tablets. This was the longest night of my life, as she started throwing up, had diarrhea and so much pain.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I can hear her screaming,begging us not to leave and we left anyway</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Morning came. We get a call from the hospital to come in right away. When we get there she is admitted and some X-rays conducted on her. The results showed that she has tuberculosis (TB). Later on when she was settled they allowed me to go in. I had to wear gloves and a mask. She was drugged and was dosing in and out and when she opened her eyes I was there. One of the nurses called me to take sputum tests because I had been with her for weeks now while she was coughing. Luckily I was clear.</p>
<p>On her second day in hospital, she was back to her senses. We called her mother, and she said she was so happy I was there for her daughter in her time of need and convinced her to go to hospital.</p>
<p><italic>18 March 2009</italic></p>
<p>She had an appointment on 18 March at Hillbrow Clinic, where all TB patients go every morning to take pills before work. She did not like it. I said I would ensure that she takes her medication every day as required. This was the last day I saw Penelope alive, well, smiling and full of energy. When I think back she was irritated with me, because she said I mothered her and I was not her mother. This was because I begged and pleaded with her to take her pills even though they made her sick and she knew at home no one would tell her what to do.</p>
<p>On Saturday I called because I knew something was wrong. She didn’t want to speak to me. She told her sister to tell me I call too much and she needed to rest. Here I was trying to be there for the woman I love and yet she was pushing me away, I was becoming a nag. I left her alone even though it bugged me. I respected her wishes.</p>
<p>First thing in the morning, I was there, to ask the doctor all the questions I had read up on and what my nurse friends had told me. The doctor says they suspect meningitis and they would be doing a lumbar puncture to determine this. He also said she had hepatitis C.</p>
<p>All they could do was treat her liver with antibiotics and try to stabilise the virus so she could begin with ARV treatment. This process went on for the rest of the week and it seemed it was working.</p>
<p>The following week a celebrity friend and neighbour came to visit her. He told her to fight. He told her his CD4 count was at 6 and he survived when everyone had written him off. He gave me hope, because her CD4 count was sitting at 8, which was higher than his. So in my head she had a fighting chance. She was again very hopeful and started making plans about whom she would be dressing in the industry and how she would focus on getting her brand off the ground. It was a great day, because we sat and laughed, talked until we were kicked out. And so it went on – every morning her mother and I were there for all the appointments that she needed to be at. If we were not there, no one else would be, as they did not have enough staff.</p>
<p><italic>26 March 2009</italic></p>
<p>We get there; the lady in the bed next to her told us it had been a rough night. She had been crying, seeing snakes everywhere, calling my name, and for her mother and her sisters. She had lost so much weight in a week. I could actually carry her, thinking back to when we struggled to walk to the clinic because I couldn’t carry her; she had been heavy. Now I could just lift her up and place her in a wheelchair. At this stage, she was not even talking, couldn’t even sit up straight. Everyone at the ward we went to or at the clinic looked at her with so much pity. People said the hospital was cruel. I just kept on pushing her to every doctor we had to see that day; finally we went back to the ward, with the ARVs and instructions. I called the nurse, gave her the instructions. You could see she could not care less. I even asked if I could sleep over in the hallway that evening, just to ensure she took her pills at 8pm. They refused and said they would ensure it was done.</p>
<p>At 8pm that evening, I prayed to God that someone would give her the new pills; the pills that would give her life. I guess that never happened because she took a turn for the worse.</p>
<p>On Thursday, when we were about to leave, a lady asked if we could pray with Penelope. I had not seen her smile like that since she had been in hospital. Penelope said yes, we prayed and Penelope re-accepted Jesus in her life again. She confirmed that she was no longer sick and that she was healed. In my heart I knew because I had witnessed a moment like this when my grandmother passed on, that she was really saying she was letting go. But I wasn’t ready to let her go. She then said to me, don’t worry, this weekend I will be going home with you, I promise. Just before we left, she screamed for her sister, telling her not to go. She told her that she was seeing snakes when she closed her eyes. That night she did not want to be left alone. We left anyway, blowing kisses to her as they were chasing us out.</p>
<p>To this day, I can hear her screaming, begging us not to leave her and we left anyway, holding on to hope that she was finally going to be okay.</p>
<p><italic>30 March 2009</italic></p>
<p>My friend drives me to her house. I dropped off her clothes and the mother was so cold towards me. She told everybody I was the friend that was nursing Penelope when she was sick. She then told me the funeral would be on 4 April. I told her I would come on Thursday. When I arrived there, they were finalising the programme for her last service. On it was written ‘Her Nurse Sade Langa’. I was supposed to say a few words. I left in pain: I was not her nurse, I was more than that; I was there for her when she couldn’t eat. I was her lover, I loved her and yet her mother was denying me the right to mourn, to mourn my loss. Because I had lost a person I loved.</p>
<p><italic>4 April 2009</italic></p>
<p>On the day of the funeral, I was like any other person or friend who came to send his or her friend off. Even at the gravesite I went to see her coffin on the ground just like everyone else. It was as if no one wanted to know that this is the woman I loved. Something in me had gone, I was expected to be fine and just move on. We went back to her home. Her mother passed me on the street and said, ‘thanks for coming, my child’. She asked if I had eaten but was distracted by someone and left me there hanging. It was as if she never knew me. Like she had never come to her daughter’s place, found me there, slept in the other bedroom as I slept in the same bed as her daughter. It was as if Penelope was straight, she was not lesbian. At that moment, I realised I had nothing of hers, except for photographs and memories.</p>
<p>I sometimes imagine, if they had let me in, if the taxi didn’t get in an accident and I had witnessed her go, would I be okay? Would it have made me feel better? All I know is that nothing will ever erase the last three months with her from my head, the moments prior to this shared with her, the last moment I felt her cool cheek against mine.</p>
