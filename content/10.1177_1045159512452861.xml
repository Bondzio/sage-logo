<abstract>
<p>This literature review examines transitioning challenges faced by Chinese international students who pursue graduate degrees in the United States. Based on existing research on adulthood in U.S. and Chinese contexts and the features of Chinese graduate students, Chinese adults, and international students as learners in Western countries, the examination includes the adult learning environment in American graduate education, the demographic features of Chinese international students who pursue graduate degrees in the United States, and the challenges they are confronted with inside and outside the classroom. The emphasis is given to two types of transitions experienced by Chinese graduate students in the United States: learning to live into adulthood and learning to learn in an adult learning setting. Findings of this literature review shed light on understanding Chinese graduate students as a particular group of learners, provide practical suggestions for practitioners in the United States and other Western countries who teach or mentor Chinese graduate students, and inform future research on Chinese international students.</p>

<p>“Chinese graduate students in transitioning to adulthood revealed by the literature suggest the need to provide them with tools to explore their identities and make important life decisions.”</p>

</p>
<p>The higher education literature is increasingly concerned about how to better accommodate adult learners, who are becoming the “new majority in higher education” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1045159512452861">Jung &amp; Cervero, 2002</xref>, p. 306). The changing demographics of students continue to challenge educators to modify their teaching strategies and create a learning climate to benefit different groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1045159512452861">Halx, 2010</xref>). U.S.-contextual adult education literature on student population diversity usually gives emphasis to race, socioeconomic class, and gender differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1045159512452861">Alfred, 2001</xref>). The demographic features of international students receive less attention.</p>
<p>In recent decades, the growing number of international students to U.S. campuses further complicates the demographics of American higher education and challenges the assumptions of adult learners and approaches adopted by adult educators. For example, students from China constitute about 20% of the international students in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1045159512452861">Institution of International Education, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1045159512452861">Universities in the USA and Canada, 2010</xref>). A majority of Chinese international students pursue graduate degrees. In 2010, graduate schools had a 23% increase in admission offers to Chinese students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1045159512452861">Council of Graduate Schools, 2010</xref>). The tension between American style of teaching and Chinese learners has received increasing attention in recent years. While American educators are unfamiliar with Chinese learners, Chinese students also struggle with unfamiliar activities and cultures in American higher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1045159512452861">Harris, 2012</xref>). Studies on intercultural learning experiences of Chinese international students in Western cultures have intensively addressed the social distance between American and Chinese cultures of learning. Most of these studies looked at the influence of Confucius cultural heritage and the Collectivism social context that promote obedience and discourages creativity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1045159512452861">Holmes, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1045159512452861">Jin &amp; Cortazzi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1045159512452861">Nelson, Badger, &amp; Wu, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The discussion about Chinese international students’ cultural shock in the United States is an important means of understanding their academic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1045159512452861">Parris-Kidd &amp; Barnett, 2011</xref>). However, treating Chinese international students as a homogeneous group oversimplifies their nature as learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1045159512452861">Gu, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1045159512452861">Jones, 2005</xref>), providing limited information for teaching practices at different levels. The heavy reliance on cultural models made it easy to overlook other significant factors contributing to Chinese international students’ struggles and challenges when studying abroad, such as individual differences in managing challenges, students’ maturing process when studying abroad, motivation to learn, identity, and self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1045159512452861">Gu, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1045159512452861">Gu &amp; Schweisfurth, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1045159512452861">Murphy-Lejeune, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Therefore, a better understanding of Chinese international students requires alternative approaches to complement the cultural models and recognizes subgroup differences within Chinese international students. The purpose of this literature review is to expand the current understanding of Chinese international students pursuing graduate degrees in the United States beyond their cultural heritage. From an adult learning perspective, this article examines the adult learning environment in American graduate education, the demographic features of Chinese international students who pursue graduate degrees in the United States, and the challenges they are confronted with inside and outside the classroom. The findings of this literature review are intended to inform instructors, advisors, program planners, and student affairs practitioners who teach or mentor Chinese international students pursuing graduate degrees in the United States and other Western countries.</p>

<title>Strategy of the Literature Review</title>
<p>The review incorporated findings from research on adulthood in U.S. and Chinese contexts and the features of Chinese graduate students, Chinese adults, and international students as learners in Western countries. As the research on Chinese learners in U.S. context is scant, the review also included studies in other Western culture contexts, such as the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>
<p>Relevant materials for the review were gathered through database searches by using Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC), Academic OneFile, ProQuest, and China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database (CNKI). Articles chosen for review were subject to the following criteria:</p>
<list id="list1-1045159512452861" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The reviewed articles included those published in peer-reviewed journals, edited volumes, government official websites, dissertations, and theses. Although relying strictly on empirical studies would have been ideal, the limited empirical studies on Chinese graduate students studying abroad forced the reviewer to include earlier reviews, government reports, theses, and dissertations.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Materials used in the review included studies that identify their subjects as Chinese adult learners, Chinese graduate students, or international students.</p></list-item>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>In general, the research on Chinese graduate students’ studying abroad experiences in Western countries is at an early stage. Much of the research was descriptive, focusing on features of Chinese students rooted in Chinese culture and educational system. Most empirical studies were conducted in the U.K. and Australian contexts. Compared with recruitment strategies of international students, methods to improve these students’ learning experiences overseas have drawn less attention.</p>
<p>The literature points to several conclusions that could be informative for those who have Chinese graduate students in their classrooms or as their mentees, to better understand this particular group of learners. The review of the literature showed the challenges confronted by Chinese graduate students studying in the United States are at least twofold. Learning to live into adulthood and learning to learn in an adult learning setting are interwoven tasks. Beginning with an examination of the adult learning environment in the United States and characteristics of Chinese graduate students as adult or preadult learners, the following sections discuss the tension experienced by Chinese international students pursuing graduate degrees in the United States.</p>
<sec id="section3-1045159512452861">
<title>Assumptions of Adult Learners</title>
<p>Adult education, including graduate programs in the United States, has the tradition of attracting educators who consider the needs and characteristics of their students in course planning, delivery, and evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1045159512452861">Stark &amp; Lattuca, 1997</xref>). For a long time, andragogy, as conceptualized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1045159512452861">Knowles (1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1045159512452861">1984</xref>), has served as a guide to teach adults in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1045159512452861">Henschke, 2011</xref>). Andragogy, or “the art and science of helping adults learn” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1045159512452861">Knowles, 1980</xref>, p. 43), addresses the teaching approaches or the learning climate that help adults feel “respected, accepted, and supported” (p. 4). Compared with pedagogy, which means <italic>child-leading</italic> in Greek, andragogy, where “andra” means <italic>adult or man</italic>, recognizes the unique features of adult learners that set them apart from younger learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1045159512452861">Knowles, 1980</xref>). Andragogy continues to be important in understanding contemporary issues and serves as a foundation for practice and research in adult education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1045159512452861">Merriam, 2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1045159512452861">2001b</xref>).</p>
<p>The term <italic>adult learner</italic> usually refers to a learner who is considered an adult by society. As suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1045159512452861">Merriam and Caffarella (1999)</xref>, adult learners are people who learn in adulthood, including learners in formal settings like universities and colleges, in nonformal settings such as community-based learning programs, and in informal settings including home, workplace, and entertainment activities. However, adulthood does not have a universal meaning, the definition of which is embedded in social, historical, and cultural contexts.</p>
<p>Commonly used criteria in determining adulthood include age, marital status, financial independence, and adult roles in family and work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1045159512452861">C. Kasworm, 2003</xref>), but different sociocultural contexts attach importance to different criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1045159512452861">Rindfuss, 1991</xref>), and expect young people to enter adulthood and assume adult roles in different age and life periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1045159512452861">Schlegel &amp; Barry, 1991</xref>). Recent studies showed American young people no longer use marriage and parenthood as criteria for adulthood, but give more weight to being responsible for one’s self, being able to make independent decisions, and being financially independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1045159512452861">Arnett, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Adults</italic> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1045159512452861">Knowles’s (1968)</xref> work refer to those taking traditionally defined adult roles (e.g., family or work) and perceive themselves to be adults. An often used marker of adulthood in the higher education literature is 25 years of age or older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1045159512452861">C. Kasworm, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1045159512452861">Nelson et al., 2004</xref>). However, the time period between age 18 and 25 has long been controversial in the literature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1045159512452861">Levinson (1978)</xref> called this time period the early adult transition period, as young people during this age period usually take preliminary steps into the adult world and gradually leave the preadult world. More recently, this time period has been referred to as the emerging adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1045159512452861">Arnett, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1045159512452861">Nelson, 2003</xref>). Arnett argued that young Americans today experience lengthened higher education, prolonged job instability, and extended transition into adult roles like marriage and parenthood. Although young people in their late teen years and early 20s face much uncertainty and continue their exploration of various opportunities, they are divergent from adolescents because they have much more autonomy in making decisions and are freer from parental controls. When asked if they have reached adulthood, the majority of American young people during this time period showed uncertainty and gave ambiguous replies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1045159512452861">Arnett, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The definition of adulthood in the U.S. context emphasizes a person’s capacity to be self-sufficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1045159512452861">Arnett, 1998</xref>), so are the perceptions of adult learners. The assumptions of adult learners that envelop andragogy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1045159512452861">Knowles, 1980</xref>) are adults’ self-directedness in learning, more abundant life experiences than younger learners, readiness to learn, need for knowledge that is immediately useful, and internal motivation to learn. Despite many criticisms on Knowles’ andragogical approach for overlooking diverse features of different groups of learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1045159512452861">Pratt, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1045159512452861">Tisdell, 1998</xref>), andragogy and self-directed learning dominate the adult education literature in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1045159512452861">Merriam, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Today, more than 80% of the graduate students in American graduate schools are older than 25 years and are perceived as adult learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1045159512452861">Snyder &amp; Dillow, 2011</xref>). Although a small portion of undergraduate seekers in the United States also falls into this category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1045159512452861">Snyder &amp; Dillow, 2011</xref>), the adult learning literature distinguishes graduate adult learners from undergraduate adult learners (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1045159512452861">Kerns, 2006</xref>). Graduate adult learners are more likely to be familiar with the higher education environment, be focused on a professional field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1045159512452861">Kember, 2001</xref>), have professional experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1045159512452861">C. E. Kasworm &amp; Marienau, 1997</xref>), be in their midcareers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1045159512452861">Polson, 2003</xref>), and be facing considerable financial sacrifices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1045159512452861">Crothers, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Although graduate education literature continues to explore better ways of addressing the need and characteristics of graduate students, graduate programs in American universities largely promote learning environments and strategies that fit adult learners. The literature documents that graduate students in the U.S. context are encouraged and perceived to be self-directed, learn from each other more than from the faculty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1045159512452861">Anderson &amp; Swazey, 2002</xref>), be able to process the readings independently and think about their implications, and develop self-authorship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1045159512452861">Baxter Magolda, 1998</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1045159512452861">
<title>Challenges in the Transitioning to Adulthood</title>
<p>Compared with the understanding of adulthood in the United States, the definition of adulthood in Chinese culture gives more emphasis to criteria related to self-control and obligations to other people, giving less emphasis to individualistic transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1045159512452861">Arnett, 1998</xref>). Chinese young people tend to use the existence of adult responsibilities as the criteria of adulthood, such as marriage, parenthood, and the responsibility of caring for parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1045159512452861">Bian, Logan, &amp; Bian, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1045159512452861">Nelson et al., 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1045159512452861">Arnett (2005)</xref> pointed out the cultural split between urban and rural areas in China. Chinese young people in urban areas are more likely to experience emerging adulthood because they marry later, have more education, and have more occupational opportunities than young people in rural areas. However, such distinction hardly exists among Chinese international students. As Chinese universities are largely located in urban areas, those pursuing higher education, whether originally from rural or urban areas, usually spend most of their late teen years in urban areas and have similar life circumstances.</p>
<p>Chinese undergraduate students are predominately traditional students who enter college right after high school, during their late teen years or early 20s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1045159512452861">Cheung &amp; Kwok, 2001</xref>). Unlike in the United States, where adult learners constitute more than one third of the undergraduate population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1045159512452861">Snyder &amp; Dillow, 2011</xref>), Chinese working adults seldom consider returning to college to pursue an undergraduate degree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1045159512452861">Li, 2008</xref>). In addition, Chinese undergraduate students have little pressure to enter marriage. In fact, the Chinese tradition tells them to consider dating and marriage after graduation. There has been a long-standing prohibition on marriage by undergraduate students in China. College students who considered marriage were once required to withdraw from their universities. Not until 2005 was the rule against undergraduate marriage dropped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1045159512452861">Chinese Law Prof Blog, 2005</xref>). Therefore, Chinese undergraduate students are seldom adult learners not only because of their status of age and maturity but also due to the fact they normally do not undertake or feel ready to commit to the responsibilities of adults, including work, marriage, parenthood, and financial independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1045159512452861">C. Kasworm, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Chinese graduate students studying in the United States are under pressure to fulfill the obligations of adults and face several challenges entering adulthood: a lack of work experiences and career development opportunities, the difficulty to find the significant half, and to be physically and financially incapable of caring for parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1045159512452861">Xu, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1045159512452861">Yan &amp; Berliner, 2011</xref>). Many Chinese international students (or those from other countries) experience this challenging life transition when studying abroad and a longer period of transitioning into adulthood.</p>
<p>A large majority of Chinese graduate students have no or few years of work experience due to Chinese sociocultural traditions. Young people in China are expected to complete formal higher education early in their adulthood and start their career development before their 30s. Graduate school admissions and scholarship applications have age restrictions. Most Chinese graduate schools and the China Scholarship Council, which provides funding to outstanding self-financed students abroad, require applicants to be below 40 years old. The age restriction in job applications is even stricter. Most occupations in China including those in companies, government offices, and higher education usually require applicants to be below 35 years old or even younger. Older adults graduating from master or doctoral studies are at a disadvantage in the job market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1045159512452861">Webster, 2010</xref>). Although the increased public concern on age discrimination has forced the government, higher educational institutions, and employers to extend the age limit, changes are taking place very slowly. Chinese students who want to pursue graduate degrees are usually under pressure to complete the degree as early as possible. Therefore, most Chinese graduate students are in their 20s and early 30s, and have not left formal education most of their lives.</p>
<p>In addition, Chinese international students pursuing graduate degrees in the United States are confronted with a great deal of uncertainty about future employment. The immigration policy and recent economic slump caused difficulty for international students to find jobs in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1045159512452861">Xu, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1045159512452861">Yan &amp; Berliner, 2011</xref>). The perception of the job market back home in China is not positive either. The increase of homebred high degree holders and the unrealistic high expectations held by many returning students have gradually made returning students less favorable in the Chinese job market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1045159512452861">Xu, 2006</xref>). For Chinese students pursuing doctoral degrees in the United States, the long duration of most doctoral programs and the age restriction in the Chinese job market put them at another disadvantage. On average, doctoral students in China take 3.5 years to complete their degrees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1045159512452861">Research Team on Chinese Doctoral Graduates, 2010</xref>, in Chinese), but the average student takes more than 7 years to complete a PhD degree in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1045159512452861">de Valero, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Dating and marriage are also challenging life issues and immediate concerns for many Chinese graduate students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1045159512452861">Yan &amp; Berliner, 2011</xref>). Single men and women older than 30 years are sometimes called <italic>leftover women and men</italic> in China, meaning they probably have missed the chance to find their significant others. Chinese parents largely expect their children to get married before the age of 30. As a result, many Chinese graduate students experience anxiety and frustration in building and maintaining relationships. The anxiety and frustration are even greater for international Chinese graduate students due to the limited number of candidates around them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1045159512452861">Yan &amp; Berliner, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, the visa status and financial constraint prohibit Chinese graduate students from assuming the adult responsibility of caring for parents. The complex visa application procedure and high traveling expenses restrict Chinese international students from returning to China to visit their parents frequently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1045159512452861">Yan &amp; Berliner, 2011</xref>). Because of the high tuition and life expenses studying overseas, Chinese graduate students are usually financially incapable of assisting their parents.</p>
<p>Therefore, Chinese graduate students usually face the dilemma of transitioning to adulthood while studying in the United States. On one hand, a wide variety of restrictions and constrains prohibit them from fully entering adulthood and assuming adult responsibilities. To some extent, most graduate degree seekers in the United States are experiencing the exploration and instability of emerging adulthood like undergraduate seekers. These graduate students are exploring job opportunities, locations to settle down, and the significant half. They are also dealing with identity issues in the exploration process: What kind of work, location, and partner suits them best (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1045159512452861">Arnett, 2003</xref>)? On the other hand, unlike emerging adults who ponder adult obligations, but are not ready to make the commitment, most Chinese graduate students are under the pressure of social norms, expectations, and traditions to seek ways to fulfill these obligations. Under the constraints of time, age, and visa status, these graduate students usually do not have the luxury to try out many opportunities during their studies in the United States. Most of their life decisions have high opportunity costs. For instance, the choice to go back to China means giving up job opportunities in the United States, almost forever. Looking for a job in the United States means losing another year or two to compete in the Chinese job market before they reach the age restrictions required by employers. However, being away from family and friends and with a few or no peer American friends, most Chinese graduate students lack social effectiveness and struggle with these life circumstances by themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1045159512452861">Yan &amp; Berliner, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Challenges in Transitioning to American Classrooms</title>
<p>Much attention has been given to understanding the culture shock experienced by Chinese international students, yet less is known about their learning shock. Although cultural shock refers to a loss of familiar routines and references when one suddenly immerses in a new environment underprepared, learning shock refers to “experiences of acute frustration, confusion and anxiety experienced by some students, who find themselves exposed to unfamiliar learning and teaching methods, bombarded by unexpected and disorienting cues, and subjected to ambiguous and conflicting expectations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1045159512452861">Griffiths, Winstanley, &amp; Gabriel, 2005</xref>, p. 275).</p>
<p>Chinese education has long been speculated to be teacher centered, content based, and test driven (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1045159512452861">Wang &amp; Kreysa, 2006</xref>). Chinese adult learners are usually perceived to be passive, diligent, but lacking in creativity, and hold the tradition of rote learning that focuses on memorization and repetition of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1045159512452861">Wheeler, 2002</xref>). Many American instructors indicated frustration in reaching and engaging Chinese students in classrooms. Chinese graduate students seem inactive in classroom activities. The teaching strategies for facilitating learning activities that normally work well seem ineffective with Chinese students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1045159512452861">Chen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1045159512452861">Wan, 2001</xref>). Empirical studies on Chinese students’ learning experiences in the United States showed they are usually uncomfortable with classroom activities including participating in group discussions, asking questions in class, and critical argumentations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1045159512452861">Durkin, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The unfamiliarity of American ways of teaching and learning experienced by Chinese students is a type of learning shock that largely overlaps with the notion of culture shock and is the only type of learning shock widely discussed in the intercultural learning literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1045159512452861">Durkin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1045159512452861">Zhao &amp; Bourne, 2011</xref>) and the literature about the application of teaching concepts and strategies rooted in Western cultures to students in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1045159512452861">Rao, 2001</xref>). Some have suggested student-centered learning, which is usually also self-centered, featured by learning activities such as discussion, is not suitable for Chinese students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1045159512452861">Pennycook, 1994</xref>). Others indicated it just takes time for Chinese students to be used to these unfamiliar learning strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1045159512452861">Gu, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Getting familiar with a classroom activity is a learning process for international students, just like learning new subject matter. Chinese students experience difficulty in learning when the approaches are alien to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1045159512452861">Wong, 2004</xref>). For those who are not experienced in classroom activities, such as reflective activities, open-ended problem solving, and loosely structured discussion, they are novice learners who appear to be slow and passive. To switch from a novice to an expert learner in engaging in classroom activities, one needs factual knowledge about the activity to guide performance, learn the sequence of action to solve problems in the process, and develop their own understanding of the activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1045159512452861">Anderson, 1996</xref>). Several empirical studies on Chinese students learning in the U.K. context also revealed students tend to withdraw from participation when they do not see the long-term value of the activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1045159512452861">Durkin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1045159512452861">Zhao &amp; Bourne, 2011</xref>). As students’ participation in a foreign learning environment gets longer, they become more comfortable to engage in these activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1045159512452861">Gu, 2011</xref>). However, in graduate level classrooms, as most domestic students are familiar with the learning activities based on their prior educational experiences in undergraduate studies and educators respect students’ autonomy and self-sufficiency as adults, the level of detail used in guiding students is usually insufficient for international students who are novice learners.</p>
<p>Chinese graduate students may also be unfamiliar with the learning clues in the learning material and the content of lectures or discussions. As familiar learning contexts are lost when Chinese students study abroad, it requires more efforts and takes longer for international students to synthesize information and develop new knowledge schemes to solve cognitive conflicts than the majority students in the classroom. The language problem of Chinese international students only partly explains their difficulty in comprehending course instruction and classroom discussions. Learning is a process of constructing meaning and making sense of experiences. The amount of prior knowledge and the nature of it play a significant role in learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1045159512452861">Merriam &amp; Caffarella, 1999</xref>). However, the knowledge taught in American classrooms is usually embedded in a context more familiar to domestic students and is disconnected with international students’ previous experiences. The examples and clues given by instructors to help student understand the learning material may be confusing for international students. The confusion may be the use of an abbreviation or the unfamiliar context used in case studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1045159512452861">Zhao &amp; Bourne, 2011</xref>). As Chinese students usually have little work experience, they may be unfamiliar with the context of a professional field either.</p>
<p>A lack of understanding of cultural expectations can lead to one’s fear to behave in this culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1045159512452861">Parris-Kidd &amp; Barnett, 2011</xref>). Similarly, insufficient knowledge of a learning environment discourages a learner from participation. Learning in a foreign environment is multifold, including learning about the cultural taboos, social expectations, learning approaches, and the subject matter. What a domestic student is assumed to know as an adult learner may be alien to international students.</p>

<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>The internationalization of the curriculum is taking place more slowly than the internationalization of the campuses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1045159512452861">Kwok &amp; Arpan, 1994</xref>). Traditionally, international students are believed to be the ones who need change to cope with the host country. Practical strategies for international students to adapt themselves to an unfamiliar living and learning environment also abound. Recent investigations show that forcing Chinese international students to adopt the Western values and approaches is not an effective solution for them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1045159512452861">Zhou, Topping, &amp; Jindal-Snape, 2011</xref>). More scholars are calling for institutional transformation to better serve the needs of the growing diverse student population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1045159512452861">Garii, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1045159512452861">Marcy, 2004</xref>). Understanding the tension experienced by Chinese graduate students (and possibly by other international student groups) inside and outside the classroom can help educators to create a more supportive environment for students from different cultural backgrounds to capitalize on each other’s strengths. Therefore, some suggestions are proposed based on the findings from the literature.</p>
<p>A recommendation is proposed to program planners, mentors, and other professionals who intend to help international students’ personal development and their adaptation to the new environment. Support mechanisms can be built into the mentoring culture to encourage communications about current or potential life circumstances with which international students may be struggling. In addition to faculty–student mentoring, peer mentoring and role model programs can be employed to direct newcomers to more experienced international students from the same country, so they can share with each other their own experiences of overcoming particular challenges and address newcomers’ specific needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1045159512452861">Jacob &amp; Greggo, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1045159512452861">Rose, 2005</xref>). As full-time students, international graduate students may appear to be at an advantage in focusing on their studies and completing degrees on time. However, the challenges and uncertainty confronted by Chinese graduate students in transitioning to adulthood revealed by the literature suggest the need to provide them with tools to explore their identities and make important life decisions. The presence of these life issues may influence how they perceive the value of their studying abroad experiences and full engagement in learning. The fact that Chinese graduate students are under time and age constraints to complete their degrees may also influence how they approach learning. Too much stress can negatively influence their personal development and academic achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1045159512452861">Wan, Chapman, &amp; Biggs, 1992</xref>). Thus, a support system that allows these students to participate in mentoring and advising and explicitly address their concerns and struggles with more experienced individuals is beneficial to help international students through the difficult time away from home.</p>
<p>Pedagogical recommendations are proposed to instructors of graduate level courses who have Chinese international students in their classrooms or advisors who help students achieve academic success. Chinese graduate students share many similarities with most adult learners, including their motivation to learn job-related knowledge and skills and the pressure to take adult roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1045159512452861">Knowles, 1980</xref>). However, their lack of work experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1045159512452861">Xu, 2006</xref>) challenges the assumption that as adult learners, students at the graduate level may know what kind of knowledge is important and can be self-directed in learning. As most Chinese graduate students are still exploring their future opportunities, they may be unclear about their learning goals and thus may need more directions from instructors in building learning plans relevant to their career development at the beginning. The prospective learning shock that Chinese graduate students usually experience also suggests instructors need to provide more factual information, culturally sensitive learning clues, and more time and space for these students to become engaged in classroom activities. This reciprocal process will help instructors and Chinese graduate students to adapt to each other’s teaching and learning strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1045159512452861">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>). For instructors, taking into account the learning shocks that international students may experience in their classrooms and making adjustments accordingly will lead to more effective course planning and assessment. For Chinese students, these strategies can help them overcome the stress caused by the unfamiliar learning environment, especially during their early years in the program.</p>

<title>Implications for Future Research</title>
<p>This review offers a starting point for understanding the features of Chinese international students pursuing graduate degrees in the United States as a particular group of learners. Future studies on Chinese international students may take into account individual differences in addressing their learning experiences overseas. Chinese graduate students are divergent from undergraduate seekers. Chinese adult learners (or emerging adults) in the United States also face different life challenges as domestic students. Within the group of Chinese graduate students, individuals may give different emphasis to various life transitioning challenges and have different capabilities to make mature decisions. They may also vary in their awareness of the learning shock and ability to navigate the new environment. These individual differences need to be recognized and further explored.</p>
<p>In addition, the present review shows the potential stress that Chinese graduate students in the United States are likely to experience outside and inside the classroom. Emotion and feelings play a significant role in adult learning, influencing one’s self-concept and motivation to learn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1045159512452861">Dirkx, 2001</xref>). Students vary in terms of their learning motivations and the ability to handle stress. There is a need for more research of how specific groups of international students manage their challenges while studying abroad and how academic programs can support these student groups.</p>
