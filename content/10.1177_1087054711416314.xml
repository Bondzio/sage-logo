<p><bold>Objective:</bold> This study examines differences in reported levels of drug and alcohol use between college students with and without ADHD. <bold>Method:</bold> The Michigan Alcohol Screening Test (MAST) and several self-report and interview questions, developed by Barkley, were used to examine the drug and alcohol use of college students with and without ADHD. <bold>Results:</bold> Between-group differences were found on the MAST and in the endorsement of marijuana use. Subtype differences were also found on the MAST. Several factors, including medication treatment status, ethnicity, class standing, and gender were found to be differentially related to problematic drinking behaviors. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Difficulties in self-regulation may put college students with ADHD at a higher risk of problematic drinking and the subsequent risk for alcohol-use disorders than their peers. Possible explanations for results are discussed in terms of theory, prevention efforts, and future research.</p>

<p>Recent studies suggest that ADHD affects approximately 2% to 8% of the college student population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087054711416314">DuPaul, Weyandt, O’Dell, &amp; Varejao, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087054711416314">Weyandt &amp; DuPaul, 2006</xref>). When considering only students with documented ADHD, the number is much lower with less than 1% qualifying when both parent and self-reports are required for a diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087054711416314">DuPaul et al., 2009</xref>). Although 1% is a relatively small number, it nevertheless translates to roughly 150,000 college students in the United States dealing with daily difficulties related to ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087054711416314">National Center for Education Statistics, 2009</xref>). These students often struggle with making the transition to college due to loss of parental supervision and structure, too much freedom, and the distractions of campus life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087054711416314">Meaux, Green, &amp; Broussard, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>College students with ADHD are considered to be at a greater risk for academic and psychological difficulties than their peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1087054711416314">Weyandt &amp; DuPaul, 2009</xref>). College students with ADHD have been found to have more difficulty in selecting a major (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054711416314">DuPaul &amp; Weyandt, 2004</xref>), report more academic concerns/problems, have lower grade point averages (GPAs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054711416314">Blase et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087054711416314">Heiligenstein, Guenther, Levy, Savino, &amp; Fulwiler, 1999</xref>), and are more likely to be on academic probation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087054711416314">Heiligenstein et al., 1999</xref>). When examining other areas of life, college students with ADHD often report financial mismanagement, poor employment performance, and legal problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054711416314">DuPaul &amp; Weyandt, 2004</xref>). In terms of mental health, college students with ADHD report more depressive symptoms, social concerns, and emotional instability when compared with their peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054711416314">Blase et al., 2009</xref>). These combined difficulties may explain why fewer adolescents with ADHD attend college and why of those that do, fewer complete degree programs compared with college students without ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087054711416314">DuPaul et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The literature on adjustment and the adverse effects of ADHD on multiple areas of functioning provides a basis for hypothesizing that college students with ADHD will have higher rates of drug and alcohol abuse than their peers because they are trying to cope with their symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087054711416314">Rabiner, Anastopoulos, Costello, Hoyle, &amp; Swartzwelder, 2008</xref>). In fact, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054711416314">DuPaul and Weyandt (2004)</xref> found in their review of the literature, college students with ADHD report more drug and alcohol use and abuse than their peers. This conclusion was largely based on a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054711416314">Blase et al. (2009)</xref>, using a sample of 3,379 undergraduates who completed a web-based survey indicating their current symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity; ADHD medication use and diagnosis status; academic concerns; social concerns; emotional stability; level of depression; and drug use. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054711416314">Murphy, Barkley, and Bush (2002)</xref> also found that college students with ADHD are more likely to abuse alcohol and marijuana than their peers without ADHD. Longitudinal research has shown that children with ADHD exhibit a 3-year earlier and increased use of alcohol, tobacco, and other substances in adolescence when compared with peers without ADHD and have a 5 times higher risk of developing a substance use disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1087054711416314">Wilens, Biederman, Mick, Faraone, &amp; Spencer, 1997</xref>). Some research has raised concerns as to whether psychopharmacological treatment of ADHD may increase the risk of drug and alcohol abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087054711416314">Schubiner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087054711416314">Wilens, 2004</xref>) but, others have suggested it might be a protective factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087054711416314">Medscape, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the research linking ADHD and substance use in college students is not consistent. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087054711416314">Rabiner et al. (2008)</xref> found that students with past or current ADHD were not more likely than other college students to report consuming alcohol. These students were also found to report a similar maximum number of drinks during a 2-hr period and similar marijuana use. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1087054711416314">Upadhyaya et al. (2005)</xref> found that college students with ADHD had more past-year tobacco and marijuana use than their peers but not more alcohol and other drug use. It is possible that these disparate findings are due to the lack of confirmed ADHD diagnoses in the samples.</p>
<p>When compared with the non-college, adult population, the risks associated with alcohol use and abuse may be even more pronounced for college students with ADHD because alcohol and drug use is such a largely accepted part of college society. Recent research indicates that 90% of college students report regular consumption of alcohol, averaging two to four drinks per occasion a few times a week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087054711416314">McCabe, Boyd, Cranford, Morales, &amp; Slayden, 2006</xref>). Alcohol is the primary drug of choice among college students; however, more than half of all college students and young adults have tried an illicit drug at least once in their lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1087054711416314">Johnston, O’Malley, Bachman, &amp; Schulenberg, 2004</xref>). Drug and alcohol use in college is a concern because it may inhibit the successful transition through college and young adulthood, often with lasting consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087054711416314">Larimer, Kilmer, &amp; Lee, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087054711416314">Barkley, Murphy, O’Connell, Anderson, and Connor (2006)</xref> studied adults with ADHD of college age and beyond (mean age of 33 years) and found that when they did drink, their ability on a driving simulator task was more impaired than for adults without ADHD. This study is important in that it suggests that drinking in college can lead to an increased risk of impairment later in adulthood.</p>
<p>In summary, college students with ADHD are believed to have several areas of difficulty, one of which is drug and alcohol use and abuse. The current research in this area is sparse and conflicting, with some studies finding more drug and alcohol abuse in college students with ADHD than peers and others finding no difference between the two groups other than tobacco use. Medication treatment is believed to be a moderating factor; however, the research in this area is also conflicting. More research is needed to examine the use and abuse of drugs and alcohol in college students with ADHD.</p>
<p>The major limitation of previous research has been the use of only ADHD symptomatology, rather than ADHD diagnosis, as a requirement for ADHD group inclusion. The current study aims to overcome this limitation by using college students with a confirmed <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (4th ed., text revision; <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087054711416314">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>) diagnosis of ADHD. The design of the current study is descriptive, comparing college students with and without ADHD using the Michigan Alcohol Screening Test (MAST; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087054711416314">Selzer, 1971</xref>) and the Barkley Structured Interview for Adult ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054711416314">Barkley, 1998</xref>/<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054711416314">2006</xref>) to provide measures of drug and alcohol use.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 184 undergraduate students enrolled in a large Southeastern university. The participants were divided into two groups. The group with ADHD was comprised of 104 undergraduates who were diagnosed with ADHD at an on-campus clinic between the years 2006 and 2009. Individuals who had documented comorbid diagnoses were not included in the study; therefore, this group is believed to be comprised of college students with “pure” ADHD symptomatology. The group without ADHD comprised of 75 undergraduates enrolled in introductory-level communications classes at the same university. An additional 5 participants originally in the group without ADHD were removed due to a self-reported diagnosis of ADHD. Sample characteristics can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1087054711416314">Table 1</xref>. There were no differences between the groups with regard to age, ethnicity, or gender. There were more freshman and fewer seniors in the group with ADHD compared with the group without ADHD. The group with ADHD was further dichotomized by subtype. There were 44 (42.3%) students with ADHD, primarily inattentive subtype; 49 (47.1%) with ADHD, combined subtype; and 2 (1.9%) with ADHD, primarily hyperactive/impulsive subtype. Due to the small number of students diagnosed with the hyperactive/impulsive subtype, this group was not used in the subtype analyses.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>For the group with ADHD, archival data were used from clinic clients who had given consent for their evaluation data to be used for research purposes, undergone the clinic’s standard evaluation, and received a diagnosis of ADHD. All participants in the group with ADHD had completed the following self-rating forms, taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054711416314">Barkley and Murphy (1998)</xref>: Current Symptoms Scale–Self-Report Form, Childhood Symptoms Scale–Self-Report Form, Work Performance Rating Scale–Self-Report Form, Employment History form, Driving History Survey, and a Social History form. They also had other informants (parents, significant others, friends, etc.) rate their symptoms of ADHD by completing the following forms: the Current Symptoms Scale–Other Report Form, Childhood Symptoms Scale–Other Report Form, Driving History Survey, and the Work Performance Rating Scale–Other Report Form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054711416314">Barkley &amp; Murphy, 1998</xref>) and underwent a clinical interview (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054711416314">Barkley &amp; Murphy, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054711416314">2006</xref>). Additional information about learning and study strategies was gathered from the <italic>Learning and Study Strategies Inventory, 2nd Edition</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087054711416314">Weinstein &amp; Palmer, 2002</xref>), and select cognitive and achievement subtests from the <italic>Woodcock–Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities and Achievement–III</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087054711416314">Woodcock, McGrew, &amp; Mather, 2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1087054711416314">b</xref>) were administered to rule out the possibility of a learning disability. As part of the standard evaluation, each client was also asked to complete a MAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087054711416314">Selzer, 1971</xref>), which measures problematic drinking behavior.</p>
<p>Clients were diagnosed with ADHD if the following criteria were met (Murphy &amp; Gordon, 2006 as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054711416314">Barkley, 2006</xref>): (a) There was evidence that the student experienced ADHD symptoms in early childhood (ages 5-12; operationalized as endorsing at least six of nine symptoms of inattention or hyperactivity/impulsivity on the self and other report forms and in the clinical interview), (b) there was evidence that, no later than middle school, these ADHD symptoms led to substantial and chronic impairments across settings, (c) there was evidence that the student was currently experiencing ADHD symptoms (operationalized as endorsing at least six of nine symptoms of inattention or hyperactivity/impulsivity on the self and other report forms and in the clinical interview), (d) there was evidence that these ADHD symptoms were currently causing substantial and chronic impairments across settings, and (e) there were no explanations other than ADHD that better accounted for the student’s current symptoms.</p>
<p>For the present study, archival data from the Barkley Structured Interview for Adult ADHD, the MAST, and demographic information were used. In addition, the self-report measure of current symptoms of ADHD was used to examine the relationship between symptom severity and alcohol and drug use within the ADHD group.</p>
<p>The 75 college students without ADHD were recruited from introductory-level communications classes at the same university and received research credit for their participation. They completed an online survey comprised of the MAST and seven items from the Barkley Structured Interview for Adult ADHD indicating quantity of alcohol and other drug use, presence of drug or alcohol abuse problems, and history of treatment. They also provided information on their age, gender, and year in school. Five control group participants who reported a previous diagnosis of ADHD were excluded from analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1087054711416314">
<title>Instruments</title>
<p>The MAST, a 25-item self-report questionnaire, was used to evaluate drinking behavior. Its focus on drinking behavior and adverse consequences make it a widely used measure for examining significant problems associated with alcohol use in medical, legal, and interpersonal areas of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054711416314">Conley, 2001</xref>). Items are responded to with either a “yes” or “no” with some items reversed scored. Problematic endorsements are scored as a 1 and non-problematic endorsements are scored as a 0, for a possible Total Score of 25. A Total Score of 5 or more is considered to indicate problematic drinking behavior. Four additional scale scores can also be derived, including Help Seeking, which indicates long-standing drinking problems via prior treatment; Discord, which focuses on hostile behaviors while drinking; Alienation, which indicates inability to fulfill obligations due to long-standing misuse of alcohol; and Denial, which indicates denial of a drinking problem. Evidence of reliability and validity has been found in several studies, most of which include clinical populations. The MAST has evidence of good internal consistency (α = .86; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054711416314">Conley, 2001</xref>) and test–retest reliability (<italic>r</italic> = .95; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087054711416314">Teitelbaum &amp; Carey, 2000</xref>). It has also demonstrated high convergent validity with <italic>DSM-IV</italic> diagnostic criteria for alcohol use disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054711416314">Conley, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Items from the Barkley Structured Interview for Adult ADHD related to alcohol and drug use were also used. These items include dichotomously endorsed (yes or no) questions about current use of illicit drugs (such as marijuana, speed, heroin, lysergic acid diethylamide, and cocaine), drug abuse problems, and treatment history. The amount of alcohol typically consumed per week is also reported on a 5-point scale with 0 = <italic>not drinking</italic> and 5 = <italic>more than 10 drinks</italic>. The group with ADHD answered these items as part of a confidential, clinical interview, whereas the group without ADHD responded to the questions as part of an anonymous, online survey.</p>
<p>Symptom severity was measured using endorsements on the Current Symptom Checklist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054711416314">Barkley &amp; Murphy, 1998</xref>). This measure assesses symptoms of ADHD exhibited within the past 6 months and includes 18 items related to symptoms of ADHD based on the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> criteria. The items are rated on a 4-point scale as follows: 0 = <italic>never or rarely</italic>, 1 = <italic>sometimes</italic>, 2 = <italic>often</italic>, and 3 = <italic>very often</italic>. These endorsements were summed to provide a total severity score ranging from 0 to 54.</p>

<title>Between-Group Differences</title>
<p>To answer the first research question, “Do the self-report responses on the MAST regarding alcohol use differ between college students with and without ADHD?” an one-way ANOVA was performed using the five MAST scale scores as dependent variables. These include the MAST Total Score, as well as the four subscales, Help Seeking, Discord, Alienation, and Denial. As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1087054711416314">Table 2</xref>, compared with the group without ADHD, the group with ADHD had a significantly higher mean score on the Denial subscale of the MAST.

<p>To answer the second research question, “Are there differences between those with and without ADHD in the endorsement of individual items regarding drug and alcohol use?” <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1087054711416314">Table 3</xref> shows the rank order of endorsement of the items on the MAST for college students with and without ADHD. The pattern of responses is also shown for the two main subtypes of ADHD. The rank order of endorsement was very similar for the group with ADHD and those without ADHD, with trying to limit drinking, blacking out, not being normal, and interpersonal difficulties being heavily endorsed. When the group with ADHD was divided into subtypes, the overall pattern of responses differed when comparing the primarily inattentive and combined subtypes. The primarily inattentive subtype did not endorse trying to limit their drinking, which was the most highly endorsed item for the combined subtype group. However, the combined subtype endorsed being arrested for drunk driving, a problem that the primarily inattentive subtype did not endorse.</p>

<p>Chi-square analysis was used to compare the two groups’ responses to the individual MAST items. Significant differences were found for five items. Participants with ADHD responded “no” more frequently to the following items: “<italic>Can you stop drinking without a struggle after one or two drinks</italic>?” χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 174) = 9.421, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .002, and “<italic>Are you always able to stop drinking when you want to</italic>?” χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 174) = 17.018, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .000. Further analysis reveals that 40.4% of the college students with ADHD reported not being able to stop drinking without a struggle after a couple of drinks, whereas only 18.7% of college students without ADHD reported such difficulty. Furthermore, 40.4% of college students with ADHD reported being unable to stop drinking when wanting to, whereas only 12% of college students without ADHD endorsed this item.</p>
<p>Alternately, college students without ADHD responded “yes” more frequently to the following items: “<italic>Does your spouse (boyfriend/girlfriend) ever worry or complain about your drinking</italic>?” χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 174) = 5.803, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .016, “<italic>Has drinking ever caused problems between you and your spouse (boyfriend/girlfriend)</italic>?” χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 173) = 11.078, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and “<italic>Have you gotten into fights when drinking</italic>?” χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 174) = 4.293, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .038. Further analysis reveals that 16% of college students without ADHD reported that their significant other worries about their drinking, compared with only 5.1% of college students with ADHD. Furthermore, 36% of college students without ADHD reported that their drinking has caused problems with their significant other, compared with only 14.3% of those with ADHD reported such problems. Finally, 40% of college students without ADHD reported fighting while drinking, as compared with 25.3% of college students with ADHD.</p>
<p>Items regarding drug and alcohol use from the Barkley Structured Interview for Adult ADHD were also examined to answer the second research question. Items that required a “yes” or “no” response were analyzed using chi-square analyses; however, only a significant difference for marijuana use was found between the groups, χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 171) = 8.016, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .005. Of participants in the group with ADHD, 8.3% reported current marijuana use, whereas 24.0% of those in the group without ADHD reported current marijuana use. The item “How many drinks do you typically have a week?” was analyzed using a univariate test; however, no significant difference was found between the groups with and without ADHD. The mean number of drinks per week for both groups was in the 2 to 10 range.</p>

<title>Differences Within the ADHD Group</title>
<p>The third research question, “Do demographics, ADHD subtype, symptom severity, and stimulant medication treatment account for differences in alcohol and drug use within the group with ADHD?” was addressed with chi-square analyses. For ethnicity, the observed results were significantly different from what was expected on the questions “Do you feel you are a normal drinker?” χ<sup>2</sup>(2, <italic>N</italic> = 84) = 7.546, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .023; “Do your friends or relatives think you are a normal drinker?” χ<sup>2</sup> (2, <italic>N</italic> = 90) = 7.192, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .027; and “Have you ever woken up the morning after some drinking the night before and found that you could not remember a part of the evening before?” χ<sup>2</sup>(2, <italic>N</italic> = 90) = 10.582, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .005. Results showed that 81.8% of Hispanic participants and 61.4% of White participants reported being a normal drinker, whereas only 31.3% of African American participants endorsed this statement. When asked whether friends and relatives consider them a normal drinker, 85.7% of Hispanic participants and 58.3% of White participants answered “yes,” whereas only 37.5% of African American participants responded affirmatively. Finally, 56.7% of Whites reported experiencing a blackout after drinking, as opposed to only 35.7% of Hispanic participants and 12.5% of the African American participants.</p>
<p>For gender, the observed results were significantly different from what was expected on the questions “Do your friends or relatives think you are a normal drinker?” χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 99) = 4.082, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .043; “Have you ever attended a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)?” χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 99) = 6.011, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .014; and “Do you ever drink before noon?” χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 99) = 4.550, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .033. Specifically, 71% of female participants reported thinking they are a normal drinker, as opposed to 51% of the male participants. Furthermore, attending AA was endorsed by 11.8% of male participants, as compared with 0% of female participants. Finally, drinking before noon was reported by 17.6% of male participants but only 4.2% of female participants.</p>
<p>The observed results were significantly different from what was expected in regard to year in college on the following questions: “Have you ever gotten into fights when drinking?” χ<sup>2</sup>(3, <italic>N</italic> = 96) = 10.711, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .013, and “Have you ever been arrested for drunk driving?” χ<sup>2</sup>(3, <italic>N</italic> = 96) = 8.443, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .038. Sophomores and juniors reported the most fighting while drinking, 36.4% and 37.9%, respectively. Seniors endorsed the lowest amount (5.9%); however, freshmen also reported relatively low amounts (10.7%). A chronological relationship was found for participants’ report of being arrested for drunk driving. No participants with freshman or sophomore class standing reported being arrested for driving while intoxicated; however, 13.8% of participants with junior standing and 17.6% of seniors endorsed committing such an offense in the past.</p>
<p>Point-biserial correlations were used to determine whether ADHD symptom severity was correlated with endorsement of MAST items within the group with ADHD. The Current Symptoms Scale endorsements for the college students with ADHD were first summed to provide a Total Symptom score. No significant correlations were found between symptom severity and endorsement of MAST items.</p>
<p>An one-way ANOVA was used to determine whether differences within the group with ADHD in regard to MAST endorsement are accounted for by stimulant medication use. Of those with ADHD who provided information on current medication status, 36.4% reported being on stimulant medication. Three of the five subscales of the MAST did have significant differences: Total Score, Help Seeking, and Discord. Those taking medication for ADHD reported higher scores on these subscales, indicating more problematic drinking. As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1087054711416314">Table 4</xref>, compared with those in the group with ADHD not taking stimulant medication for ADHD, the group with ADHD taking stimulant medication had a significantly higher mean score on all three of these subscales. The other two subscales, Alienation and Denial did not differ significantly between the groups. Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> indicated effect sizes in the medium (−0.66) and large range (−1.07 and −1.08) for three of the subscales yielding significant differences between the medication treatment and nonmedication treatment groups.</p>

<p>Chi-square analyses were conducted at the item level to determine whether stimulant medication treatment accounts for differences within the group with ADHD in individual item endorsement. The observed results were significantly different from what was expected on the following questions: “Have you ever woken up the morning after some drinking the night before and found that you could not remember a part of the evening before?” χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 28) = 5.241, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .022; “Have you ever been in a hospital because of drinking?” χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 27) = 5.130, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .024, and “Have you ever lost friends or girlfriends/boyfriends because of drinking?” χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 28) = 4.547, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .033. Specifically, 78% of participants taking stimulant medication for ADHD reported blacking out, compared with only 32% of participants not taking stimulant medication. A total of 25% of participants taking stimulant medication reported being hospitalized due to drinking, whereas no one who reported not taking stimulants reported this. Furthermore, 22% of participants taking stimulant medication reported losing friends or romantic partners due to drinking; however, this statement was not endorsed by any of those not taking stimulant medication.</p>
<p>Following an anecdotal observation that students who endorsed being a “normal drinker” drank more than those who did not endorse “normal” drinking, a point-biserial correlation analysis was used to examine the relationship between “How many drinks do you typically have a week?” from the Barkley Structured Interview for Adult ADHD and a dichotomous item on the MAST, “Do you think you are a normal drinker?” Results indicated a significant negative relationship between these items (<italic>r</italic> = -.16, <italic>p</italic> = .04). As hypothesized, these results indicated that an endorsement of “normal drinking” was related to more drinking. Alternately, endorsing “not being a normal drinker” was related to less drinking.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study found several differences in drug and alcohol use between college students with and without ADHD as well as between ADHD subtypes. When comparing the frequency of MAST item endorsement between the participants with and without ADHD, the participants with ADHD were much more likely to report difficulty stopping drinking once starting. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054711416314">Barkley’s (2011)</xref> recent work on executive functioning included problems with self-restraint as one of five core deficits that characterize ADHD. This deficit encompasses the ability to inhibit actions and to consider the consequences of one’s actions. Our findings may indicate that college students with ADHD are more prone to binge drinking, a risky drinking style, which may help to explain previous research indicating that those with ADHD are at higher risk for substance abuse and dependence. When looking at other drugs, participants with ADHD indicated less marijuana use than their peers, although it is unclear if this result was influenced by differences in the assessment conditions. Because the participants with ADHD answered questions that might be used in their assessment report, they may have been less likely to give honest responses regarding illegal substances. Alternately, the non-ADHD participants’ responses were completely anonymous. Future research should address how assessment conditions impact the responses of students regarding their drug and alcohol use.</p>
<p>Significant differences in MAST item endorsement were also found between ADHD subtypes. The primarily inattentive subtype did not endorse trying to limit their drinking, which was the most highly endorsed item for the combined subtype group. However, the combined subtype endorsed being arrested for drunk driving, a problem that the primarily inattentive subtype did not endorse. These differences may be accounted for by differences in impulsivity, a symptom that differentiates the two subtypes. Impulsivity may affect one’s ability to limit their drinking and decision to drink and drive. Interestingly, the severity of symptoms of ADHD was not a predictor of endorsement of items related to problematic alcohol use.</p>
<p>In contrast to the results of the current study and others, some studies have found that stimulant medication treatment decreases the risk of drug and alcohol abuse, with those with unmedicated ADHD being twice as likely to develop drug and alcohol abuse than those who are medicated with stimulants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087054711416314">Schubiner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087054711416314">Wilens, 2004</xref>). The fact that more between-group differences in drug and alcohol use were not found in the current study may be due to the exclusion of participants with comorbid disorders, a factor that previous researchers have also considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087054711416314">Rabiner et al., 2008</xref>). Future research needs to take into account both comorbid diagnoses and the use of medication for the treatment of ADHD simultaneously.</p>
<p>Overall, the MAST results did not indicate severe drinking problems in either college students with ADHD or their peers. However, problematic behaviors were endorsed that could be the focus of prevention efforts. Specifically, high rates of endorsement were noted for difficulty controlling the amount of drinks consumed in an outing. High rates of endorsement were also found for blackouts. These endorsements suggest, in general, that college students may need help with learning to regulate their drinking so that they can avoid dangerous situations, including alcohol poisoning and blackouts. Given the fact that upperclassmen were found to endorse driving under the influences and lower classmen endorsed a lot of fighting, it appears that the negative consequences of drinking increase as students continue in college; therefore, early prevention efforts targeted at incoming freshmen would be best at reaching these students to lower their high-risk behaviors before negative lifelong consequences occur. Future research should also investigate drinking habits among racial/ethnic and gender groups. In the current study, White males with ADHD reported the most blackouts. This is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054711416314">O’Malley &amp; Johnston’s (2002)</xref> analysis of multiple data sources, indicating that White males engage in the heaviest drinking. Although the rate of occurrence was rare, it was also noted that male students with ADHD were more likely to endorse behaviors suggestive of severe alcohol abuse and dependence, such as drinking before noon and attending treatment such as AA.</p>
<p>Several of the questions on the MAST were not endorsed by any of the participants, indicating that the MAST may not be an appropriate measure for the college population. For example, the item “Have you ever been seen at a psychiatric or mental health clinic or gone to a doctor, social worker, or clergyman for help with an emotional problem in which drinking played a part?” was not endorsed by any of the participants. A total of 10 other items were rarely endorsed some of which included “Have you ever been in a hospital because of drinking?” “Have you ever had delirium tremens, severe shaking, heard voices, or seen things that weren’t there after heavy drinking?” and “Have you ever been told you have liver trouble or cirrhosis?” Given the large number of items with a low frequency of endorsement, the number of usable questions is significantly lessened, taking away from the sensitivity of the measure to detect differences between the groups. This is potentially a considerable problem given that the MAST is a brief, 25-item questionnaire. In support of this conclusion, other research has suggested that many of the MAST items assess the more advanced features of alcohol dependence, which is very uncommon among college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1087054711416314">Svanum &amp; McGrew, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the social acceptability of drinking in college might lead this population to misinterpret the individual items. For example, the MAST items sometimes place judgments on drinking behaviors such as “normal” that might cause the item to be interpreted differently from the author’s intention. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that higher levels of drinking were found to be significantly, inversely related to the endorsement of being a “normal drinker.” That is, participants thought themselves to be normal drinkers when they consumed as many as 10 drinks a week but oftentimes considered themselves not to be normal if they consumed 0 to 4 drinks per week! This finding in itself is important and has clear ramifications for how interviews or self-reports may need to be altered for a college student population.</p>
<p>There were several limitations in the current study. Significant group differences were found for year in college. Specifically, the group without ADHD had fewer freshman and more seniors than the group with ADHD. Overall, this is not expected to be a significant problem, as this study focused on undergraduate college students in general. We were not able to collect as much data on the participants as might have been desired, such as IQ estimate, GPA, or prior drinking history. The largest limitation of the current study is an environmental and procedural difference between groups. The group without ADHD responded to the questionnaire anonymously, whereas, the group with ADHD responded to the questionnaire under terms of confidentiality. Furthermore, the group with ADHD data was gathered in an evaluation setting to be generated into a report, which would determine academic accommodation eligibility. This setting creates a high-stakes situation for these participants and may have altered their responses. Overall, the current study is correlative in nature and only narrowly examines the complex issue of drug and alcohol use in college students with and without ADHD. The results should be considered tentative, and future research should examine this topic using more complex research designs and statistical tests. Finally, tobacco use was not evaluated in the current study and should be included in future research, as previous research has found a relationship between ADHD symptom severity and tobacco use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1087054711416314">Upadhyaya &amp; Carpenter, 2008</xref>).</p>
