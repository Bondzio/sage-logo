<p>In <italic>The Politics of Sleep</italic>, Simon Williams advances a provocative yet simplistic central argument: that “sleep is <italic>political through and through</italic>” (p. x). Of course, it might be prudent to ask if there is any sphere of life—or indeed, anything about sleep—that is <italic>not</italic> political, but this falls outside of Williams’ concern. Rather, he operates from the assumption that a politics of sleep might be considered a “strange, if not absurd” proposition, which is what then makes his main argument so significant.</p>
<p>Williams however is not just interested in making blanket statements and this is where his scholarship is at its most exceptional. Over five engaging chapters, Williams identifies a number of detailed ways sleep has been and is becoming politicized. For instance, he demonstrates how sleep is deeply implicated in the rise of a fast, 24/7 capitalist culture. Here, Williams rehearses a number of well-trodden observations about how the imperative to live faster has come at the expense of a more adverse sleep life, much to the lament of many social groups. But Williams astutely cautions against the popular idea that contemporary men and women are unequivocally more sleep-deprived than their predecessors since there is a lack of historical research that supports this analysis. Nevertheless, he argues persuasively that sleep has indeed become a more contested issue in recent times. For example, he observes how drowsiness has become more a matter of public concern, which places greater accountability on the individual to sleep responsibly—not too little, but also not too much. For Williams, this also extends to the issue of an active citizenry and to the embodied conditions of political and economic decision-making. Sleep, from this perspective, is important to regulate by way of formal and informal social policies because the prospect of a “well-slept” society is increasingly seen as a “public good.” One supposed benefit of sleeping well is that people become more productive in seemingly all sectors of life. Williams documents how this viewpoint has only more recently gained prominence. This is what explains, for instance, why attitudes towards workplace napping have turned more favorable and why the sleep lives of many professions like those in the aviation industry and government have attracted a greater amount of scrutiny.</p>
<p>However, Williams is keen throughout to note that the politics of sleep is not applied or constructed the same way for all groups and people. In fact as Williams notes, even though there are some “basic” human rights attached to our access to sleep, these rights are not always respected nor are they fully accorded to some sectors of the population, such as the homeless. Williams also notes how sleep deprivation has been used as an interrogation technique, which has recently been the subject of various legal challenges that argue the practice is actually a form of torture. These social divisions highlight how sleep is deeply implicated in the articulation and reproduction of various power relations.</p>
<p>Williams also considers what aspects of sleep resist being governed and disciplined, which presents a more dynamic view of how sleep relates to the upkeep of social order. Williams is especially interested here in the phenomenology of sleep, which reveals that sleep is at some level a radical withdrawal from the waking world and a partially involuntary affair. This is meant to demonstrate that sleep serves as a “limit” to some of the unfeasible demands of contemporary life and as an “excess” to an overly rational and intentional view of the social world.</p>
<p>Lastly, Williams turns his attention towards the bio-medicalization and pharmaceuticalization of sleep, which he deems to be a growing issue for concern. What is clear at the beginning of the twenty-first century is that sleep is increasingly being positioned in the framework of sleep-medicine. Williams offers a concise though still detailed history of this phenomenon. He also investigates what the future of sleep may look like, which many have suggested is the realization of a sleep-optional society. Williams links this possible future scenario to developments in military practice, but remains thoughtfully skeptical that sleep can ever be made wholly obsolete.</p>
<p>Those who are familiar with the nascent sociological study of sleep will know that Williams’ texts have been quite foundational to that area of study. Williams is mainly known for his ability to theorize sleep from a sociological perspective in novel and insightful ways and less known for his collection of new empirical sleep data. <italic>The Politics of Sleep</italic> does little to upset this depiction. However, this should not detract from what the work accomplishes, nor does it suggest that Williams’s scholarship is insufficiently grounded in empirical research originating from other sources. What Williams does here is make a persuasive case for how and why political analysis ought to consider the topic of sleep. For one thing, this is because sleep is a constitutive part of people’s lives that is mutually informed by the political context in which it is situated. But more than that, sleep is also a “prism” from which to analyze the “other fears, worries, frustrations and anxieties regarding contemporary life and living” that people have (p. xii). In arguing that there is a political dimension to sleep, Williams displays a penchant throughout for coining new terms, like the onset of a “sleep-positive” agenda which denotes how awareness of sleep is heightened by moves to “problematize” or “champion” its practice. But what perhaps is even more impressive about <italic>The Politics of Sleep</italic> is that Williams sets out in clear terms why social researchers belong in the broader public discussion surrounding sleep, instead of just sitting idly by. Displaying an interest towards sleep-related matters is yet another way that sociology can develop as a publicly-engaged discipline, since conducting sleep research is not a neutral but political act.</p>
