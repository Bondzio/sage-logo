<abstract>
<p>This study determined the effects of fiber length, the length uniformity index, micronaire (fineness), and strength of greige cotton lint on properties of nonwoven fabrics. Seven bales of pre-cleaned greige (<italic>non-bleached</italic>) cotton were procured from a US cotton producer and ginner. Each bale primarily had only one particular fiber quality parameter (e.g., length, length uniformity, micronaire, or strength) as a significant variable of interest, while other metrics remained subdued to the most practically possible extent. The fiber stock from each separate bale was processed into a lightly needlepunched substrate/fabric and then uniformly converted into a hydroentangled nonwoven fabric structure of the same nominal weight. All of the fibers and fabrics involved in the study were analyzed for their quality attributes. Although this study did not reveal any clear-cut, significant effects (obvious relations or correlations) of the fiber quality variables/metrics investigated, for the first time ever new information has been given that may be useful in the selection of optimally economical cotton for the production of cotton-based nonwoven fabrics for certain applications. At the minimum, this study has demonstrated that, unlike in traditional yarn-based textile processing, the <italic>greige</italic> cotton lint(s) <italic>of (typically) varied fiber metrics</italic> could be satisfactorily processed into viable nonwoven fabrics of acceptable physical and mechanical properties, as determined by standard test methods and procedures.</p>

<body>
<p>Today's complex textile markets require value-added, sustainable products that are environmentally and economically efficient to produce and use. New fabric production systems targeted for special markets and volumes need to be developed for achieving relatively greater ecological and economic benefits. The ongoing ‘<italic>green revolution</italic>’, in particular, has greatly impacted the nonwovens industry and the recent incorporation of cotton into nonwoven fabrics has attracted significant attention of the industry.</p>
<p>To increase value-added use of cotton in nonwoven products, the effects of fiber properties on the nonwoven processes and products have to be studied. Although a considerable volume of scientific literature exists on the effects of cotton fiber properties on the various processes and products involved in traditional textile manufacturing, including yarn spinning, weaving, knitting, dyeing, finishing, etc.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0040517512452949">1</xref></sup> there is no such literature or information available on the effects of cotton fiber metrics on nonwoven processes and products. Since greige/raw cotton typically sells at approximately half the price of the bleached cotton that presently is most often used in nonwovens, investigating the use of greige cotton in nonwovens, which potentially could make the cotton fiber more competitive with the manufactured fibers (which presently comprise ∼97% (by weight) of all the fibers used in nonwovens),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0040517512452949">2</xref></sup> has become an important aspect of the study. A few previous research studies conducted at the Southern Regional Research Center (SRRC) with a run-of-the-mill greige cotton had shown that greige cotton lint, when properly opened and cleaned, could be efficiently processed into hydroentangled nonwoven fabrics of acceptable attributes, such as tensile and tear strengths, dimensional stability, and absorbency, without scouring/bleaching.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0040517512452949">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0040517512452949">5</xref></sup> However, today, the existing nonwoven roll goods manufacturers do not have the required equipment to clean greige/raw cotton as supplied in a traditional bale. Obviously, a reliable supply of clean greige cotton to the nonwovens industry is crucial to the development of cotton-based nonwoven products.</p>
<p>In collaboration with a well-known US cotton producing/ginning company that commercially supplies standard bales of mechanically pre-cleaned cotton to textile and related industries,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0040517512452949">6</xref></sup> a cotton quality-based nonwovens process and product study has been conducted. Commercial-grade pilot plant machinery and mill-like procedures and operating conditions were used.</p>
<p>In this study seven bales of pre-cleaned greige (non-bleached) cotton of varying fiber quality parameters/variables of interest were procured to determine the effects of the fiber length, length uniformity index, micronaire, and strength on the nonwovens process and product performances, including the absorbency of the nonwoven materials produced. Each selected bale distinctly had only a particular fiber property or variable of interest (e.g., the fiber length (L), the length uniformity index (UI), the micronaire (mic), or the strength). All the fibers, their in-process materials/substrates, and the resulting hydroentangled nonwoven fabrics involved in the study were tested in-house by using the standard industrial protocols and testing procedures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0040517512452949">7</xref></sup> Characteristics of the cotton fibers used, the fiber processing details, the properties of the nonwoven fabrics produced, and conclusions for this study will be presented.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0040517512452949" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>From a national inventory of bales of American Upland cotton, seven bales of virgin raw cotton of desired variants were selected and purchased. The cotton quality of each bale was rechecked in-house, using the applicable Uster® High Volume Instrumentation (HVI) and Automated Fiber Information System (AFIS) of fiber quality measurements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0040517512452949">8</xref></sup> The cotton of each bale was mechanically cleaned, using no water, chemicals, or heat, via a proprietary technology developed at Wild Wood Gin, who commercially markets this so-called pre-cleaned cotton under the UltraClean® cotton brand.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0040517512452949">9</xref></sup> The pre-cleaned greige (non-bleached) cotton from each bale was re-baled into a standard 480-lb (net) bale. The quality parameters of the pre-cleaned (UltraClean®) cotton(s) were also measured, again using the applicable HVI or AFIS standard systems of fiber quality measurements, in order to realistically determine effects of the <italic>actual</italic> input-cotton materials. Fibers from each pre-cleaned bale were opened and separately conditioned and processed under similar processing conditions for conversion into hydroentangled nonwoven fabrics.</p>
<p>Fiber from each of the seven bales was processed through a conventional cotton preparatory line of equipment that comprised a hopper, a step cleaner, and a fine opener. The opened fiber was chute fed to a cotton card delivering a continuous web rather than a sliver. The carded web, 1 meter wide and ∼10 g/m<sup>2</sup> in density, continuously was conveyed to a crosslapper that lapped the carded web 20 times and conveyed the lapped material to a pre-needling machine to lightly needlepunch the fed material into a nominal 70 g/m<sup>2</sup> substrate/fabric. The substrate was rolled onto a cardboard tube for the downstream hydroentangling process, which involved a commercial-grade line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0040517512452949">10</xref></sup> at the SRRC. The main reason for producing lightly needlepunched substrates for hydroentanglement was two-fold: (1) to produce, with the available fiber processing equipment, a substrate as uniform and even as possible so that the final, hydroentangled fabric, as required, is also uniform and even (as determined by standard deviation (<italic>std. dev.</italic>)) in density and other properties; and (2) to study the effect of fiber properties on needlepunched nonwoven substrates. Accordingly, each substrate material was hydroentangled, using a low water pressure of 50 bars at the consolidating, pre-wetting jet head and a high water pressure of 125 bars at the two fabric-forming jet heads of the hydroentangling system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0040517512452949">11</xref></sup> The line production speed was 5 meters per minute. The hydroentangled fabric was dried using an inline gas-fired, hot-air dryer containing a rotating drum and subsequently wound onto a fabric roll for storage (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0040517512452949">Figure 1</xref>). As in the case of fiber testing, the fabrics produced from all the seven bales were also uniformly tested with American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and/or American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists (AATCC) standard test methods and procedures (viz., ASTM Test# D3776-87 for the measurement of mass per unit area of fabric, Test# D5729-97 for determining the thickness of a nonwoven material, Test# D5035-95 for determining the breaking force and elongation of textile fabrics, and AATCC Test Method 79-2005 for determining the absorbency of textiles) and conditions to determine their typical physical and mechanical properties, including the water drop absorbency, absorbency time, and capacity according to the standard test method (ASTM 1117, Section 5, Nonwovens Test Method).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0040517512452949">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0040517512452949">14</xref></sup> For this test method, a 76 mm-wide strip of fabric was cut to a length that weighed 5.0 ± 0.1 grams. The fabric strip was rolled on itself and placed in a cylindrical wire basket (made to the prescribed length, diameter, and weight specifications). The basket was dropped on its side into a room temperature water bath from a height of 25 mm. The time it took to completely submerge the basket in the bath was measured and reported as the absorbency (sink) time. After the absorbency time had been determined, the fabric sample was allowed to remain submerged for 10 seconds. The basket was removed by grasping the open end of the basket and holding it over the water reservoir for 10 seconds. The basket and sample were placed in a pre-weighed watch glass, the amount of water absorbed (grams) was measured, and the absorbency capacity calculated was reported as the number of grams of water absorbed per gram of the fabric. The AATCC Absorbency of Bleached Textiles method (drop test), AATCC-79-2005, used a fabric hoop to hold the sample and a burette to drop a single drop of water on the sample from a height of 1 cm. The time it took for the drop to be absorbed was measured.

<p>Finally, the various fiber and fabric test results were evaluated to determine any trends or relationships among the various fiber quality parameters and the fabric properties. The performances of the various processes involved in the investigations were also noted, but they are not elaborated upon at this time, except to mention that no significant difficulty was encountered during the fiber processing.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0040517512452949">Table 1</xref> shows the fiber properties of the various raw cotton bales. As can be seen, the various properties, although they seem to be in relatively narrow (typical/normal) ranges, are actually considered significant in the traditional textile yarn spinning and weaving processes, although the latter in no way are considered or used as a benchmark in this study. Because of the obvious inability of procuring cotton bales that only have one significant parameter (variable) of interest with all other fiber metrics almost constant, it was almost impossible to determine the exact effects of the various fiber parameters of interest without ignoring the obvious interactions among the other fiber properties that were interconnected, but not consistent, in every bale. At any rate, an attempt to investigate the effects of four major fiber metrics in a manner that is generally adopted and accepted in the traditional textile processing of woven fabrics has been made.

<p>To better understand and visualize the differences among the fiber properties of the seven bales of cotton listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0040517512452949">Table 2</xref>, the fiber properties for each bale were normalized to the maximum fiber property measured for all the bales. For example, Bale #2 has the longest fiber length at 3.02 cm and, thus, has a normalized value of unity, while Bales #5 and #6, which have the shortest fibers, have a normalized length value of 0.82 cm. The normalized fiber property values for each of the seven bales of cotton are visually illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0040517512452949">Figure 2</xref>.

<p>As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0040517512452949">Table 3</xref>, increasing the length of the fiber increased the strength of the needlepunched fabric; however, no significant effect of fiber length was observed in the hydroentangled fabrics. In fact, the strength value trend of hydroentangled fabrics (<italic>made from the respective two bales</italic>), when compared to that of the needlepunched fabrics (<italic>also made from the same two bales</italic>), somewhat reversed in favor of the shorter length fiber. Presently, a clear explanation for this rather unique trend is not possible, except to mention that the hydroentangled fabric strength essentially is achieved by the number of inter-fiber cohesions (interlacings) rendered by hydroentanglements of individual fibers, while the needlepunched fabric’s strength is most likely influenced by the fiber length, strength, and/or efficiency of the needlepunched process. One potential reason that varying the length of the fiber from 2.49 to 3.02 centimeters did not result in a significantly noticeable difference in the strength of the hydroentangled nonwoven fabric is that the variation in length, although representing the normal range of most virgin lint produced in US, was not significant enough for this type of (hydroentangled) fabric structure. Cotton gin motes and comber noils, which in a previous study were processed under comparable conditions and made into similar fabric structures, certainly had shown significantly less strength than the cotton lint nonwovens produced in this study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0040517512452949">15</xref></sup> The lengths of the cotton gin motes in that study were significantly shorter (∼50%) than the lint fibers used in this study. Thus, it is expected that a rather more significant variation in fiber length, that is, significantly shorter lint fibers, would likely lead to somewhat reduced fabric strengths. As mentioned previously, any direct comparisons of woven and nonwoven processes and products really are not relevant or benchmarked in this study. However, it may be noted that this relatively small difference in the fiber length parameter is considered quite significant in traditional textile processing. Generally, the fiber length is the most important fiber property in traditional textile processing and it is widely known that increasing the length of the fiber increases the strength of the yarn and its final woven fabric. In any case, it may be tentatively concluded in this study that, unlike the traditional yarns and fabrics, the fiber length within a rather typical ‘narrow range’ does not significantly influence the strength of hydroentangled nonwoven fabric in either ‘machine direction’ (MD) or the ‘cross-machine direction’ (CD). For a given fabric weight, a slightly shorter-fiber population of certain strength, in fact, may yield a relatively stronger fabric, presumably due to the greater number of fibers available for hydroentanglements.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0040517512452949"><title>Effect of fiber length uniformity index</title>
<p>The effects of fiber uniformity on the mechanical properties of the finished fabric were investigated in a similar manner to the fiber length above and the micronaire below. The uniformity of the cotton fiber varied from a low of 78.7% to a maximum of 81.4%. Although this difference seems to be slight, fiber uniformity differences of this magnitude generally result in significantly different strength values in traditional textile processing. The effects of the fiber length uniformity on the tensile strengths of needlepunched and hydroentangled fabrics are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0040517512452949">Table 4</xref>.

<p>Here in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0040517512452949">Table 4</xref>, the differences in MD and CD tensile properties of the fabrics are quite obvious, and significant. This, to a large extent, is a result of the underlying ‘crosslapping’ (<italic>evening out</italic>) of the material prior to the needlepunching process. The fiber orientation in the crosslapped batt largely determines the fabric strength in the MD and CD directions. However, it may be noticed that as the input material (batt) becomes more uniform, that is, with the input fiber of greater UI, the difference between the tensile strengths in the machine and cross directions become relatively lesser. Upon hydroentanglement, the effect of fiber uniformity on the measured tensile strengths of the fabrics is much less significant.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0040517512452949"><title>Effect of micronaire</title>
<p>In this study, the micronaire varied from a low of 3.60 to a high of 5.40, which is a significant difference of 43%. In traditional textile processing, a high micronaire value typically tends to yield a weaker fabric, because the high micronaire fibers are coarser and, thus, there are less fibers in a given yarn cross-section. Consequently, there are lower inter- and intra-fiber cohesive forces in a yarn structure made with coarser fibers. Three bales of cotton were selected based on variances in their micronaire values. For convenience, the HVI data for micronaire, length, length uniformity, and strength of the three bales are outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0040517512452949">Table 5</xref>.

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0040517512452949">Table 6</xref> shows that as the value of micronaire increases, both the tensile strengths in the machine and cross directions of needlepunched fabrics decrease. The fabrics made from a fiber micronaire value of 5.40 are 60% weaker in the cross direction and 35% weaker in the machine direction. Upon hydroentanglement, however, the differences in fabric strength are much less significant. The machine direction tensile strength remains nearly constant as the micronaire value is increased, while the cross-directional strength only decreases by about 15%. One possible reason for the observed differences in the effect of micronaire value on tensile strengths of needlepunched and hydroentangled fabrics is that the latter fabrics are more intensely entangled than their needlepunched counterparts. Although the weight of the needlepunched and hydroentangled fabrics is nearly the same at ∼70 g/m<sup>2</sup>, the needlepunched fabrics are 2.4 times thicker than fabrics that have been hydroentangled. Fabrics that are highly entangled appear to be less affected by variations in the value of micronaire. The difference in thicknesses of the fabrics (both needlepunched and hydroentangled) seems to be orderly, which makes sense, since the fiber thickness increases as the micronaire increases.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0040517512452949"><title>Effect of fiber strength</title>
<p>To study the effect of cotton fiber strength, three bales of cotton were examined with fiber strengths ranging from 26.0 to 32.6 g/tex. Variances in the other fiber properties, such as length, micronaire, and uniformity, were minimized to the greatest extent possible by selecting these three specific bales. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0040517512452949">Table 7</xref> illustrates the effect of fiber strength on the mechanical properties of the needlepunched and hydroentangled fabrics. Basically, the fiber strength follows the trends of the other fiber properties that have been examined above, that is, the fiber properties seem to matter somewhat in the needlepunched fabrics, but not so much in the hydroentangled fabrics. Overall, the variation in the fiber strength from 26.0 to 32.6 g/tex is a 20% difference.

<p>As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0040517512452949">Table 7</xref>, the mechanical strength of the needlepunched fabric increases with increasing fiber strength. However, this also indicates that increasing the individual fiber strength ultimately has little to no effect on the mechanical properties of the hydroentangled fabrics.</p>

<sec id="sec7-0040517512452949"><title>Interactive combination effects of fiber properties on fabric strength</title>
<p>The above analyses basically have focused on the individual effects of several fiber properties on the strength of nonwoven fabrics produced; however, it is very important to note that the interactive combination effects of, or among, the fiber’s multiple quality parameters could also influence the process and product performances of, in particular, the hydroentangled nonwovens. To elucidate the interactive effects of the fiber properties on the fabric strength, design of experiment techniques were used. Since the number of bales of cotton was limited, a modified fractional factorial design was used to examine the individual and interactive effects of strength, micronaire, and length. Analysis of the data shows that micronaire and length are the greatest individual contributors to variation in the tensile strengths of the materials, in both the machine and cross directions. In addition, it was observed that interactive effects of the fiber micronaire with length and the fiber length with strength contribute to variations in the fabric strength.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0040517512452949"><title>Effect of fiber properties on fabric absorbency characteristics</title>
<p>Raw (greige) cotton fiber on a plant, like many other botanical species, is naturally protected from any possible damaging conditions and/or predators. The cotton fiber, in particular, is protected with a thin coating or layer of natural hydrophobic waxes, without which the raw fiber could excessively swell and deteriorate from rain water and other ambient conditions. In the traditional wet processing of greige cotton textile materials, this waxy layer is chemically removed from the fibers by scouring the fiber, yarn, or fabric with sodium hydroxide, which ultimately yields an absorbent fabric for further uniform wet processing and dyeing. However, the caustic scouring process is time-consuming, costly, and somewhat environmentally sensitive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0040517512452949">16</xref></sup> Previous work revealed that the hydroentangling energy of the water used in fabric formation removed the greige cotton’s natural waxes and made the resulting fabric hydrophilic (<italic>i.e., absorbent without the chemical scouring process</italic>) – a significant milestone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0040517512452949">5</xref></sup> The amount of hydrophilicity attained depended on the hydraulic/mechanical energy used to form the fabric. In other words, greige cotton nonwoven fabrics of different absorbencies could be produced depending on the energy level used in making the fabric. Fabrics could be made very hydrophobic or very hydrophilic depending on the end-use application. In fact, if desired, a bi-layered cotton nonwoven fabric that is hydrophobic on one face and hydrophilic on the other face could be produced by needlepunching for certain specific end-use applications. Obviously, the amount of energy needed to make a greige cotton fabric of a certain level of absorbency most often depends on the ‘amount of waxes’ present on the greige fiber rather than on the fiber’s other classical properties as investigated in this study. Since the wax content of greige cotton can vary widely, depending on the seed variety, cultivar, region, weather, crop year, etc., and since the greige cottons used in this study likely came from different regions, it is unlikely that they all possessed constant wax content. Furthermore, neither the raw fibers nor the fabrics made thereof were measured for their wax content. Obviously, within the existing scope and scenario of this extensive study, where the precise and independent effects of the ‘interconnected’ fiber properties (quality) and, in particular, the cotton bales’ original wax content (which perhaps also varied from fiber to fiber) could not be properly determined and controlled, the authors admit that the reported fabric properties and, in particular, their absorbencies were solely based on the study data that, although they may not be totally coherent, yield some useful information that previously was not available.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0040517512452949">Table 8</xref> shows the absorbency characteristics of the various hydroentangled fabrics made uniformly with constant hydroentangling energy. The first sample in the table, SBIR 3-scoured &amp; bleached, represents a conventionally, fully scoured, and bleached fabric, which obviously is expected to have the maximum rate of absorbency based on the absorbency sink time. All other fabrics, viz., SBIR 1–SBIR 7, show their absorbency attributes in their hydroentangled form of fabric only, that is, without any chemical scouring and/or bleaching. Comparing the bleached SBIR 3 fabric sample with the non-scoured/bleached SBIR 3 fabric sample, the absorbency sink time is increased from 2.35 seconds to 28.75 seconds and the drop-test time from &lt;1.0 second to 4.6 seconds. This shows that some of the fiber’s original wax content still remained on the hydroentangled, non-bleached fabric sample. However, the sample’s absorbency capacity shows little change. In fact, the absorbency capacities of all the fabrics tested hardly vary (6.71 to 7.42 – almost insignificant, considering that the absorbency capacity may indeed be related to some extent to the fiber’s underlying properties, which, being out of the scope of this study, was not investigated towards any sustainable conclusion). The absorbency sink times and drop-test times, however, seem to follow the same trend on all fabric samples, that is, when the sink time increases, so does the drop-test time. The differences among the various samples’ absorbency sink times and drop-test times probably are related to the differing amounts of waxes still present on the fabric samples. In other words, the fabrics with the lowest sinking times probably contained the least amount of waxes on their respective virgin cotton fibers. Without precisely knowing the original fiber’s wax content and, perhaps more importantly, its wax types (molecular structure) and their adhesive nature, it is difficult to conclude that the hydroentanglement process will uniformly remove all the wax content from each fiber type, even though the energy supplied during hydroentangling remained constant.

<list-item><p>The nonwoven fabric absorbency capacity data do not seem to be related to the absorbency times (indirect determination of wax content).

As can be seen, the capacities are close but the sink times are not.

<sec id="sec10-0040517512452949" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Based on the investigations of four typical characteristics, viz., the fiber length, the length uniformity, the micronaire, and the tensile strength, of greige (raw) cotton lint taken from seven standard bales of pre-cleaned cotton and ignoring any ‘interconnections or interactions’ among the fiber properties studied and/or not studied, it appears that the fiber properties (their values within relatively normal ranges) of American Upland cottons do not appreciably affect either the nonwoven processes or the fabrics produced. Since the fiber properties studied are well known to be critical in traditional cotton textile processing and products (yarn spinning and woven fabrics), it may be concluded that the relatively low-quality and/or the so-called discounted cottons that generally are unsuitable for efficient use in traditional woven fabrics may be efficiently used in nonwoven fabrics for certain valuable end-use applications.</p>
