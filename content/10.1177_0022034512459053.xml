<abstract>
<p>Crosslinking is considered a possible approach to increasing the mechanical and structural stability and biodegradation resistance of the dentin collagen matrix. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanical and chemical variations and collagen degradation resistance associated with crosslinking of the dentin collagen matrix with UVA-activated riboflavin. Dentin collagen matrix specimens were treated with 0.1 and 1% riboflavin for 2 min and photo-activated with 7 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> UVA (368 nm) for 2 min. The structural change of the dentin collagen network with collagenase exposure was investigated by AFM and SEM at different time-points. The variations in surface/bulk mechanical properties and biodegradation resistance were characterized by nano-indentation, conventional mechanical testing, and hydroxyproline liberation at different time-points. Chemical changes associated with riboflavin/collagen-matrix interaction were analyzed by micro-Raman spectroscopy. UVA-activated riboflavin increased the mechanical properties, mechanical stability, and biodegradation resistance of the dentin collagen matrix. Higher collagen-network structural resistance against collagenolytic challenges was found with crosslinking. micro-Raman spectroscopy showed a strong dependency, in both intensity and wave-number, of certain Raman bands (1242-1667 cm<sup>-1</sup>) with crosslinking indicating the collagen/riboflavin interactions. UVA-activated riboflavin (1%) more efficiently crosslinked the dentin collagen matrix within a relatively clinically acceptable time-frame compared with 0.1% riboflavin.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Although there have been improvements in dentin adhesive systems, the degradation of the collagen matrix at the resin/dentin interface is still a matter of concern that adversely affects the longevity of the bonded interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034512459053">Breschi <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Crosslinking is considered a possible approach to the enhancement of mechanical and structural stability and collagen degradation resistance of the demineralized dentin matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034512459053">Bedran-Russo <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034512459053">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022034512459053">Xu and Wang, 2010</xref>). However, in addition to the biocompatibility and efficiency of dentin collagen crosslinking agents, clinical applicability should be considered in terms of the application/activation time-periods needed for the desired effect to be achieved.</p>
<p>Riboflavin is a free-radical-producing agent when photo-activated, with maximum absorption peaks at 270, 366, and 445 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034512459053">Kohlhaas <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034512459053">Spoerl <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Corneal crosslinking was recently introduced using UVA-activated riboflavin with significant improvement in biomechanical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022034512459053">Wollensak <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). Recently, riboflavin has been shown to increase bond strength, stabilize the adhesive interface, and inhibit dentin matrix-metalloproteinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034512459053">Cova <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Riboflavin could have potential in adhesive dentistry, owing to its biocompatibility, ease of application, and the ability to be photo-activated by the UVA-blue light spectral range. However, no previous studies have reported the mechanical and/or chemical interactions between UVA-activated riboflavin and the dentin collagen matrix. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the mechanical and chemical variations and collagen degradation resistance associated with crosslinking of the dentin collagen matrix with UVA-activated riboflavin. The null hypothesis was that crosslinking with UVA-activated riboflavin would not significantly affect the mechanical properties, mechanical stability, and hydroxyproline (HYP) liberation of/from the demineralized dentin matrix.</p>

<title>Materials &amp; Methods</title>
<p>Sound human molars were extracted, for orthodontic reasons, from 70 volunteers (age range, 21-35 yrs) who provided informed consent according to a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National University of Singapore. Teeth were stored in 0.5% chloramine-T solution for 2 wks, then in distilled water at 4°C until use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022034512459053">Yang <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>) and were used within 1 mo of extraction. Chemicals used in this study were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) unless otherwise stated.</p>
<sec id="section3-0022034512459053">
<title>Dentin Collagen Crosslinking</title>
<p>Occlusal enamel was removed perpendicular to the long axis of the teeth with a low-speed diamond saw (Buehler, Lake Bluff, IL, USA) under water-cooling until the dentin surfaces, 1 mm below the DEJ, were exposed. Dentin discs, 1 mm thick, were cut parallel to the exposed dentin surfaces. The discs were cut into 4 equal specimens, and each was attached to a disc-shaped metal support. Specimens were then sequentially wet-ground with 600- to 4,000-grit silicon-carbide papers (Carbimet; Buehler, Lake Bluff, IL, USA) and ultrasonicated for 15 min in de-ionized water.</p>
<p>We prepared riboflavin (RF) solutions (0.1 and 1%) by dissolving riboflavin-5-phosphate in distilled water. Solutions were kept in light-proof test tubes to avoid any light-activation of riboflavin before use. Specimens were etched for 15 sec with 37% phosphoric acid and thoroughly rinsed with distilled water for 5 min. The excess water was removed, and the dentin surface was left hydrated and treated with 10 µL riboflavin solution (0.1 or 1%) for 2 min. Riboflavin was applied in 1 application, left undisturbed for 2 min, gently air-dried for 5 sec, photo-activated with UVA (368 nm) at 7 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> for 2 min, and finally gently rinsed with distilled water. The UVA source used (BlueWave, Dymax, Torrington, CT, USA) was placed 10 mm from the dentin surface with a spot-size of 7 mm, such that the whole dentin specimen was fully irradiated with a single UVA irradiation spot. The control specimens were prepared as above but without riboflavin and/or photo-activation, and only distilled water was used.</p>

<title>AFM and SEM Imaging</title>
<p>The structural changes in the dentin collagen network with collagenase exposure were investigated by AFM and SEM at different time-points. We prepared the collagenase solution according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022034512459053">Zheng <italic>et al</italic>. (2010)</xref>, to detect real-time structural variations by AFM, by dissolving 100 mg of collagenase type-I (Clostridiopeptidase A from <italic>Clostridium histolyticum</italic>, 125 U/mg) in 6 mL of tricine buffer and 3 mL of distilled water. Specimens were imaged in liquid mode with AFM (Multimode/AFM, NanoScope IV, Bruker Instruments, Singapore) and a silicon-nitride probe (NP-S, Bruker) with a nominal tip radius of 10 nm, 18- to 24-KHz resonance frequency, and 0.06- to 0.12-N/m spring-constant. Tricine buffer was injected into the liquid cell for baseline imaging, followed by withdrawal of the buffer and injection of collagenase solution with continuous feeding for collagenase replenishment for real-time <italic>in situ</italic> imaging of each specimen at different time-points at a scan rate of 1 Hz. For SEM, specimens were prepared and viewed (XL30 FEG SEM, FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) before and after 24 hrs in collagenase.</p>

<sec id="section5-0022034512459053">
<title>Characterization of Surface-Mechanical Properties</title>
<p>Variations in surface nano-mechanical properties were tested (n = 6) at 0, 2, 4, and 8 hrs of exposure to collagenase, with a G200 Nanoindenter System (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Specimens were fixed to the metal supports and placed in collagenase in Petri dishes, with continuous feeding, until the desired time-point, such that the tested surfaces were facing upward. A pyramid-shaped Berkovich diamond-indenter with a tip radius of 40 nm was used at a constant strain-rate of 0.05/sec with a hold-time of 5 sec at a maximum indentation depth of 70 nm, which corresponded to a load-range of 400-500 µN. At each specific time-point, specimens were removed from collagenase, gently washed in tricine buffer, and tested in hydrated conditions in the buffer solution, for precise comparison of the readings with the baseline readings in the tricine buffer without exposure to collagenase. Up to 15 indentations were made in the intertubular dentin for each time-point, with lateral spacing not less than 400 nm for each specimen. Young’s modulus (<italic>E</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>) and hardness (H) were calculated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022034512459053">Ziskind <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section6-0022034512459053">
<title>Characterization of Bulk-Mechanical Properties</title>
<p>The variations in apparent elastic-modulus (<italic>E</italic><sub><italic>appr</italic></sub>) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) after 3 mos in distilled water and 24 hrs in collagenase (n = 17) at 37<sup>o</sup>C were tested and compared with the baseline measurements at 24 hrs in distilled water as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512459053">Bedran-Russo <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). Briefly, rectangular dentin beams of 0.5 x 1.7 x 6.5 mm (thickness x width x length) were cut and demineralized in 10% phosphoric acid for 5 hrs. Beams for UTS testing were additionally made in an hour-glass shape (0.5 x 0.5 ± 0.1 mm). Beams were suspended in the riboflavin solutions, for 2 min, and then each of the opposing sides of each beam was photo-activated separately, as previously described. Beams were fixed to a testing machine (5848 Microtester, Instron, Canton, MA, USA), and load was applied at 0.5 mm/min crosshead-speed to 3% maximum-strain (<italic>E</italic><sub><italic>appr</italic></sub>) or to failure (UTS).</p>

<sec id="section7-0022034512459053">
<title>Collagen Resistance to Degradation</title>
<p>The HYP content in the supernatant was measured at 12, 24, and 48 hrs in collagenase. An HYP assay kit (BioVision Inc., Exton, PA, USA) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Dentin slabs (n = 6) of 4.5 x 3.5 x 0.5 mm were prepared from the mid-coronal dentin and demineralized in 10% phosphoric acid for 5 hrs. Aliquots of the supernatants (100 µL) were collected and hydrolyzed in 12 N HCl at 120°C for 3 hrs. Then, 10-µL quantities of hydrolyzed aliquots were transferred to a 96-well plate and evaporated to dryness under vacuum. Chloramine-T buffer reagent (100 µL) was added and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Then, a 100-µL quantity of DMAB reagent was added and incubated for 90 min at 60°C. Absorbance was measured at 560 nm in a spectrophotometer (Infinite 200, Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland). Standard curves were generated, and HYP content was averaged from quadruplicate measurements.</p>

<title>Micro-Raman Analysis</title>
<p>Specimens (n = 5) were prepared as described in microscopic imaging and characterized by micro-Raman with a JY-LabRam HR-800 Raman spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon, Longjumeau, France). Specimens were analyzed before and after crosslinking with photo-activated riboflavin without exposure to collagenase, for characterization of the chemical variations associated with riboflavin crosslinking. Specimens were analyzed with the following micro-Raman parameters: 785-nm excitation wavelength and power &lt; 500 µW at a 100X objective.</p>

<sec id="section9-0022034512459053">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Data were expressed as means ± standard deviations and analyzed by two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test for repeated-measurement pair-wise comparison within the time-points and riboflavin concentrations. A <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

<p>SEM images showing the structure of the demineralized dentin collagen network before (<bold>A-C</bold>) and after 24 hrs in collagenase type-I (<bold>D-F</bold>). Before exposure to collagenase relatively, an intact open collagen network can be seen for the non-crosslinked (A) and riboflavin-crosslinked specimens (B, C). However, with riboflavin-crosslinking, a more regularly organized collagen network structure can be observed. After 24 hrs in collagenase, the non-crosslinked specimens showed complete removal of the demineralized collagen fibril network from the intertubular dentin and inside the dentinal tubules, exposing the underlying mineralized dentin surface (D). In addition, few collagen fibrils can be seen attached to the mineralized dentin surface, but no evidence of network structure can be observed. Dentin crosslinked with 0.1% (E) and 1% (F) riboflavin shows a partially preserved collagen fibril network structure at the intertubular dentin and dentinal tubules.

<p>Riboflavin crosslinking significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.001) HYP liberation compared with the non-crosslinked specimens at all time-points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512459053">Fig. 2G</xref>). No difference was found in HYP liberation between 0.1 and 1% riboflavin at 12 hrs. However, HYP liberation was significantly less (p &lt; 0.05) for 1% riboflavin at 24 and 48 hrs compared with 0.1% riboflavin. Generally, there was a significant increase in HYP liberation with increased exposure time to collagenase, except for 1% riboflavin between 12 and 24 hrs.</p>
<p>Raman spectroscopy showed the strong dependency, in intensity and wave-number, of certain Raman bands (1242-1667 cm<sup>-1</sup>) with crosslinking indicating the collagen-riboflavin interactions. Accentuation and a right-shift of amide-I and CH<sub>3</sub>/CH<sub>2</sub> deformation bands were found with crosslinking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512459053">Fig. 3A</xref>). The CN-stretch/NH-deformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512459053">Fig. 3B</xref>) were clearly featured with crosslinking with the left-shift. In addition, the ratio between CN-stretch/NH-deformations was reversed after crosslinking.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The null hypotheses were rejected, since UVA-activated riboflavin significantly increased mechanical properties and stability and decreased HYP liberation which could be attributed to collagen crosslinking.</p>
<p>This crosslinking could be explained such that, with UVA photo-activation, riboflavin was excited into its triplet state, generating singlet-oxygen-inducing chemical covalent bonds, bridging amine groups (N-H) of glycines of one chain with carbonyl groups (C=O) of hydroxyproline and proline in adjacent chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034512459053">Fraser <italic>et al</italic>., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512459053">McCall <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022034512459053">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Micro-Raman analysis revealed characteristic accentuation and shift in both amide-I and -III bands with crosslinking, which is consistent with previous reports of collagen type-I crosslinked with riboflavin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512459053">Jung <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>) or glutaraldehyde (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034512459053">Jastrzebska <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). In addition, the amide-I band was associated with the stretching-vibration of the peptide carbonyl groups, whereas the amide-III band resulted from the NH in-plane deformation coupled to CN-stretching. Accordingly, the micro-Raman findings could be attributed to the formation of peptide bonds between dentin and collagen when crosslinked with riboflavin. The stability of the sub-fibrillar triple-helical structure was achieved by the formation of peptide bonds between adjacent collagen chains. Furthermore, collagen type-I triple-helical domains have an amino acid sequence (primary structure) that, in addition to glycines, is rich in hydroxyproline and proline, which impart rigidity and stability to the collagen triple-helical domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022034512459053">Kadler, 1995</xref>). HYP liberation could result from collagenase-mediated collagen degradation, from other dentin enzymes such as cysteine and cathepsins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022034512459053">Nascimento <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>), and from other non-specific collagen-degradation pathways. Although the HYP assay is non-specific, it could indicate the tissue-collagen concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034512459053">Lamparter <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). Accordingly, the lower HYP liberation found with riboflavin crosslinking might indicate the higher collagen content and resistance of the demineralized dentin matrix to bacterial collagenase-mediated collagen degradation. Therefore, from the micro-Raman and HYP liberation results, the crosslinking effect of riboflavin on the dentin collagen matrix could be clarified.</p>
<p>Characterization of the structural and mechanical stability with challenges in collagenase or distilled water could be considered an indirect evaluation of the effect of riboflavin crosslinking on the resistance of the dentin matrix to enzymatic and/or hydrolytic degradations. The collagen-network structure was characterized with AFM at the same time-points to be correlated with nano-indentation results. AFM has an advantage, since it can probe structural variations in the dentin collagen network in the hydrated condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034512459053">Fawzy, 2010</xref>). However, after extensive surface destruction, due to collagenase effects, SEM could be considered a complementary imaging technique, or as an alternative to AFM.</p>
<p>The surface-mechanical properties were evaluated by nano-indentation testing, since it is more site-specific, and by analysis of the data obtained from the intertubular dentin. However, because of extensive surface destruction, nano-indentation could not be done after 8 hrs in collagenase, since this might affect the accuracy of the results, as indicated by the high standard deviations found. Although nano-indentation has high precision, the measurement is limited to only submicron surface depth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022034512459053">Ziskind <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). However, phosphoric acid demineralizes depths of a few micrometers, leaving behind demineralized collagen network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022034512459053">Nakabayashi and Pashley, 1998</xref>). Therefore, the characterization of bulk-mechanical properties might be more indicative of the penetrative effect of riboflavin crosslinking on the overall mechanical properties of the dentin matrix. Accordingly, both techniques are complementary. Previous studies used the 3-point bending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512459053">Bedran-Russo <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>) or nano-indentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034512459053">Bertassoni <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>) test to measure the elastic modulus of dentin.</p>
<p>The results of this study demonstrated the efficiency of two-minute application times for both riboflavin and UVA in crosslinking the dentin collagen matrix. Although a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034512459053">Cova <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>) showed the beneficial effect of 0.1% riboflavin application for 1 min on bonding to dentin, our pilot results supported the two-minute application time, although it is less clinically acceptable. Although other crosslinking agents, such as proanthocyanidins, improved the mechanical stability and collagen resistance to degradation and inhibited the activities of MMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034512459053">Bedran-Russo <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034512459053">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034512459053">La <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>), the time required to be effective might not be clinically applicable. In addition, crosslinking with glutaraldehyde (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022034512459053">Xu and Wang, 2010</xref>) is highly effective; however, cytotoxicity is a matter of concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034512459053">Huang <italic>et al</italic>., 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Higher riboflavin concentrations in the collagen matrix could lead to higher UVA absorption, generating more free-radicals and reactive oxygen species, mainly through the type-I pathway of photosensitized oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512459053">McCall <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022034512459053">Snibson, 2010</xref>). This could explain the lower HYP liberation and the higher mechanical properties, especially bulk properties, found with 1% riboflavin. With the increase in dentin thickness and UVA attenuation, a higher concentration of photo-initiator is desired for more efficient crosslinking. However, higher concentrations of riboflavin lead to more yellowish discoloration of dentin, which might adversely affect any subsequent esthetic restoration. In addition, one of the maximum absorption peaks of riboflavin is in the visible blue spectrum. Accordingly, the competition between riboflavin and the photo-activators/initiators of the dentin adhesive system that might affect the polymerization reaction of the resin monomers should be further investigated. The UVA/photo-activation was done at 7 mW/ for 2 min instead of the standard 3 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> used in corneal crosslinking, and adopted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034512459053">Cova <italic>et al</italic>. (2011)</xref>, since it was reported recently that efficient collagen crosslinking could be achieved within a shorter activation time by the use of a higher power/density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034512459053">Kanellopoulos, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, UVA-activated riboflavin (1%) was found to crosslink the dentin-collagen matrix more efficiently within a relatively clinically acceptable time-frame compared with 0.1% riboflavin. Accordingly, based on the results of the current study, UVA-activated riboflavin could have promising potential applications in adhesive dentistry as a dentin pre-treatment or as a modifier for etch-and-rinse and/or self-etch adhesives. However, riboflavin interaction with adhesive monomer polymerization and the potential of photo-activation/photo-polymerization in one-step adhesives, with dental blue-light as a more practical and safer alternative to UVA, are currently under investigation. In addition, optimization of the experimental parameters, including riboflavin concentrations and application times/technique, photo-activation times, and power/densities, should be further investigated to achieve the more efficient parameters effective within the most clinically applicable time-frame.</p>
