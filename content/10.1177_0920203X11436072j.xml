<p>This book takes issue with the current scholarship that underscores gender inequality in China’s open and reform period, and it argues that some Chinese women play a prominent role in China’s economic development. The author Minglu Chen has conducted interviews with female enterprise owners, wives of enterprise owners, and women managers in three different locales in China, and she concludes that despite some lingering gender inequality, these women make significant contributions to China’s economic transformation through their active involvement in business establishments and operations.</p>
<p>Chen divides the book into three parts according to different geographic locales. In each part of the book, Chen takes readers to three different regions – Jiaocheng in Shanxi Province, Qiongshan in Hainan Province, and Mianyang in Sichuan Province – and examines the role of women’s status at work and at home, and their relationships with local politics.</p>
<p>In the first part of the book, Chen underscores the close contact between Jiaocheng and the Party centre and the strict central control of the local economy. Manoeuvring in this local economy, women in her interviews managed to develop political capital through family ties and handle a significant amount of business activities, including purchasing, production, sales, personnel, finance, management, and operation. Meanwhile, domestic responsibilities remained a burden for these women.</p>
<p>In the second part of the book, Chen explicates the loose contact between Qiongshan and the Party centre and the massive domestic migration integral to the local economy. Deeming migration crucial to their lives, women in her interviews played a major role in the establishment, operation, and strategic planning of the business. Similar to the women in Jiaocheng, women in Qiongshan procured political liaisons through family ties and, at the same time, shouldered the responsibility of domestic work.</p>
<p>In the third part of the book, Chen delineates the industrial development of high-tech sectors in Mianyang as a ‘Science and Technology City’. Due to the demand for high-level education in this economic zone, women in her interviews shared a professional background. While they managed a considerable amount of business management, operation, and development, they differed from women from Jiaocheng and Qiongshan in that they had family or paid assistance with domestic work and they developed more political networks on their own.</p>
<p>In the last chapter, Chen explores areas for future studies and concludes that her findings are twofold. First, she contends that although gender inequality does exist in contemporary China, it has been overstated and dramatized by previous scholars. Second, she underscores the important connection between business development and local politics.</p>
<p>There is a schism between the two arguments of the book, begging for analysis of their interconnections. The first argument revolves around the issues of gender and gender inequality, whereas the second argument points to the crucial linkage between contemporary local business and local politics. Each of these two arguments stands on its own. Without harnessing the two arguments with an overarching theoretical thread, the book lacks a certain coherence in its argumentation. Nonetheless, this book should be of interest to scholars of China studies and women’s studies.</p>
