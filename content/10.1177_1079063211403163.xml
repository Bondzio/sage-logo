<abstract>
<p>This article examines the psychometric properties of an adaptation of Levenson’s Locus of Control (LoC) measure that is used by the English and Welsh Prison Service as part of the psychometric assessment battery for sexual offenders participating in the Sex Offender Treatment Programme (SOTP). Reliability and validity analyses were conducted on a sample of 2,497 sexual offenders who had completed SOTP. Internal consistency, convergent validity, and relationship to socially desirable responding were investigated. Construct validity was assessed via exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Test-retest reliability data were collected from an additional sample of 26 sexual offenders. The scale was found to have excellent internal consistency, good test-retest reliability, and weak to moderate convergent validity with measures of self-esteem, attachment styles, emotional loneliness, and social problem solving. There was a moderate correlation between the scale and socially desirable responding. EFA and CFA suggested that a four-factor solution provided an acceptable fit to the data, with the factors relating to constructs of chance, problem solving, powerful others, and internal control. The findings of the present study suggest that the adapted LoC Scale is a useful tool for assessing sexual offenders’ locus of control.</p>

<p>The term <italic>locus of control</italic> refers to the extent to which people feel they have control over their lives and how they attribute causes to events, which has been described as a general “expectancy” regarding the consequences of actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1079063211403163">Colman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1079063211403163">Levenson, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1079063211403163">Rotter, 1966</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1079063211403163">Rotter (1966)</xref> argued that individuals’ locus of control exists on a continuum from external to internal, with <italic>external locus of control</italic> referring to the tendency to attribute outcomes to external forces such as fate, chance, or other people. In contrast, <italic>internal locus of control</italic> refers to the belief that outcomes come about as a result of one’s own actions.</p>
<p>The most appropriate conceptualization of locus of control is heavily debated, with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1079063211403163">Rotter (1975)</xref> warning against confusion and misuse of the construct. Initially, the construct was described as unidimensional, with internal and external locus of control existing on opposite ends of a spectrum; that is, a person is seen as holding <italic>either</italic> internal or external beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1079063211403163">Luszczynska &amp; Schwarzer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1079063211403163">Rotter, 1966</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1079063211403163">1975</xref>). However, subsequent research, including factor analyses of the Internal-External Scale (I-E Scale), suggested that this conceptualization was too simple, leading to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1079063211403163">Levenson (1974</xref>) arguing for a three-factor model of locus of control comprising internality, chance, and powerful others. Thus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1079063211403163">Levenson (1974</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1079063211403163">1981)</xref> argued that the original definition of “external” may be too broad and proposed that individuals with an external locus of control may be made up of those who attribute external causes of events as unpredictable and a result of chance and those who attribute external causes of events to powerful others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1079063211403163">Kennedy, Lynch, &amp; Schwab, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1079063211403163">Levenson, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1079063211403163">Wilkinson, 2007</xref>). This distinction developed from the idea that “people who believe the world is unordered (chance) behave and think differently from people who believe the world is ordered but that powerful others are in control” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1079063211403163">Levenson, 1974</xref>, p. 354). It was also argued that locus of control beliefs are dynamic and can change under different conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1079063211403163">Levenson, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1079063211403163">Luszczynska &amp; Schwarzer, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1079063211403163">Rotter (1966)</xref> argued that an external locus of control may result in maladaptive behaviors because individuals with an external locus of control have difficulty understanding that their negative actions are linked to resulting consequences. In contrast, those with a more internal locus of control may engage in more adaptive behaviors because positive outcomes reinforce their beliefs that their actions are related to ensuing consequences, leading to the adaptive behavior being repeated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1079063211403163">Page &amp; Scalora, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1079063211403163">Reitzel &amp; Harju, 2000</xref>). Offending is one such behavior that has been linked to having an external locus of control, including sexual offending. It has been suggested that an external locus of control is a socioaffective deficit that may contribute to the commission of a sexual crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1079063211403163">Thornton, 2002</xref>). It is hypothesized that a sexual offender with a more external locus of control views emotions, thoughts, and events such as deviant sexual interests as inevitable, beyond his control, and unavoidable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1079063211403163">Thakker, Ward, &amp; Navathe, 2007</xref>). A review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1079063211403163">Thornton (2002)</xref> reported that an external locus of control, along with low self-esteem and emotional loneliness (a grouping referred to as <italic>inadequacy</italic>), is often identified as “offence precursor” and distinguishes sexual offenders from both nonoffending comparison groups and sexual offenders who offended less frequently. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1079063211403163">Fisher, Beech, and Browne (1998)</xref> found that men who had a more external locus of control had a higher risk of reconviction for a sexual offence and were more likely to have previous convictions for violent and nonviolent offences than those with a more internal locus of control.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1079063211403163">Marsa et al. (2004)</xref> also found that men who had committed sexual offences against children had a more external locus of control and higher levels of emotional loneliness than violent and nonviolent offenders. In their article, Marsa et al. argued that an external locus of control and emotional loneliness may result from insecure attachment styles. They go on to suggest that sexual offending may represent an attempt to satisfy emotional and social functioning deficits and reported that most of the sexual offenders in their sample endorsed a fearful attachment style and were less likely than all other groups to have a secure attachment style. A fearful attachment style is characterized by romantic relationship difficulties involving high personal anxiety. In contrast, a secure attachment style involves low interpersonal anxiety and avoidance which enables individuals to develop “stable” and unproblematic romantic relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1079063211403163">Marsa et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Locus of control has also been found to correlate with measures of social problem-solving ability and self-esteem, both in the wider personality literature and with offenders. It is proposed that these constructs “overlap” in how they influence how an individual relates to others and their social environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1079063211403163">D’Zurilla &amp; Nezu, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1079063211403163">Judge, Erez, Thoresen, &amp; Bono, 2002</xref>). Research suggests that individuals with low self-esteem and a more external locus of control have similarities, such as less effective problem solving and ability to resist the influence of others (e.g., peers), supporting the idea that the three constructs are interlinked cognitive constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1079063211403163">D’Zurilla &amp; Nezu, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1079063211403163">Judge et al., 2002</xref>). Examination of scores on a measure of social problem solving for a sample of sexual offenders found that social problem-solving ability was significantly correlated with self-esteem and locus of control, with an internal locus of control being associated with higher-self esteem and a more positive problem-solving orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1079063211403163">Wakeling, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>As a result of the research showing an association between locus of control and sexual offending, locus of control is one of the treatment targets in the SOTP run by the English and Welsh Prison Service. Therefore, locus of control is measured as part of the pre- and postprogram psychometric assessments to examine whether change has occurred. A modified version of the Levenson’s Locus of Control (LoC) Scale, made up of Internal, Powerful Others, and Chance subscales, is currently used in SOTP in the English and Welsh Prison Service as part of the assessment of treatment targets.</p>
<p>The first measure of locus of control (the I-E Scale) was devised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1079063211403163">Rotter (1966)</xref> and measured the extent to which individuals are more likely to endorse internal or external beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1079063211403163">Ashkanasy, 1985</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1079063211403163">Levenson (1974</xref>) modified Rotter’s I-E Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1079063211403163">1966</xref>) in line with her reconceptualization of locus of control, producing the Internal, Powerful Others, Chance Scale (IPC). The IPC consists of 24 items that assess the three factors of internal, powerful others, and chance. Each factor is made up of eight items, with individuals required to respond using a 7-point Likert-type scale. High scores on any of the Internal, Chance, or Powerful Others subscales suggested the individual expects control from that factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1079063211403163">Levenson, 1981</xref>). Early analyses suggested that the internal factor was independent from the chance and powerful others factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1079063211403163">Walkey, 1979</xref>). The IPC Scale has since been applied to a range of clinical samples, although validation of the scale has proven inconclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1079063211403163">Wilkinson, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the IPC Scale was examined during the 1990s as part of the development of a psychometric test battery for use in SOTP assessments, following which 18 items of the scale were retained (Wakeling, H. C., personal communication, January 9, 2009). To the authors’ knowledge, the adapted scale is currently only used in the English and Welsh Prison Service. However, although the scale is used nationally to assess treatment needs and treatment change in individuals who have completed SOTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1079063211403163">Interventions and Substance Misuse Group, 2007</xref>), there is little validation evidence with sexual offenders, with just one unpublished study that found the adapted IPC Scale had good internal consistency and test-retest reliability with sexual offenders (Rallings &amp; Webster, 2001, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1079063211403163">Wakeling, 2007</xref>). Therefore, the present study aims to fill this gap by examining the psychometric properties of the adapted version of Levenson’s IPC Scale used within the English and Welsh SOTP. This scale is referred to as the LoC Scale. Analyses were conducted to assess the measure’s internal consistency, test-retest reliability, construct validity, and its sensitivity to treatment change, and to examine its factor structure. The measure’s association with socially desirable responding was also examined.</p>
<p>The research hypotheses for construct validity analyses were as follows:</p>

<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: LoC and self-esteem: A more internal locus of control will be positively associated with higher self-esteem.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: LoC and attachment styles: A more internal locus of control will be negatively associated with high scores on fearful attachment style and positively associated with high scores on secure attachment style.</p></list-item>

<title>Reliability and validity analyses</title>
<p>The participants were 2,497 adult, male sexual offenders who had been convicted of a sexual offence or offence with a sexual nature and had completed an SOTP at one of 25 prison establishments across England and Wales. Male offenders who have been convicted of a sexual offence or offence with a sexual element are eligible to participate in SOTP if they are not in denial of the offence, above 18, and have enough time on their sentence to complete a program. The participants’ age ranged from 18 to 83 years, with a mean of 43.33 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 14.22). The sample was 91.1% White, 6.4% African or Caribbean, and 2.5% Other, which included multiple origins. The mean sentence length of participants serving determinate sentences was 5.71 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.50). In addition, 85 participants had received life sentences. Of the sample, 19% had committed sexual offences against adults, 78% had committed sexual offences against children, and 3% had committed offences against both adult and child victims. The majority (78.9%) had committed sexual offences against female victims.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1079063211403163">
<title>Test-retest</title>
<p>The participants for the test-retest analyses were 26 adult, male sexual offenders, all convicted of sexual offences or offences with a sexual nature. All were situated at one prison establishment. Offenders who had not completed any SOTP were identified from a central database. The participants’ age ranged from 26 to 74 years, with a mean of 47.81 (<italic>SD</italic> = 14.94). Less information regarding offences was available for these offenders as none had completed SOTPs. However, given that a requirement of the establishment is for men to complete SOTP and the sample were not participating in any program, it is likely that a number of participants were offenders in denial of their offences.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section6-1079063211403163">
<title>Locus of control</title>
<p>The adapted LoC Scale was used to assess locus of control. It is an 18-item, self-report questionnaire adapted by the Prison Service Interventions and Substance Misuse Group from a scale devised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1079063211403163">Levenson (1974</xref>). The scale assesses how much an individual believes events are caused by external factors (chance/fate or powerful others) or internal factors (i.e., their own behavior/actions). It is scored on a 5-point Likert-type scale, where respondents indicate the extent to which they agree or disagree with statements related to external or internal locus of control. High scores (40 and above) indicate a more internal locus of control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1079063211403163">Webster, Mann, Thornton, &amp; Wakeling, 2006</xref>). The adapted measure has been reported to have good test-retest reliability (Rallings &amp; Webster, 2001, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1079063211403163">Interventions and Substance Misuse Group, 2004</xref>). See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1079063211403163">appendix</xref> for the adapted scale.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1079063211403163">
<title>Self-esteem</title>
<p>The Short Self-Esteem Scale (SSES) was used to measure self-esteem. It was developed for use in HM Prison Service research and assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1079063211403163">Webster et al., 2006</xref>). The scale is an 8-item measure and respondents are required to give yes/no responses to questions relating to their self-esteem. Higher scores indicate greater self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1079063211403163">Interventions and Substance Misuse Group, 2007</xref>). The scale has been found to have “excellent” internal consistency and test-retest reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1079063211403163">Webster et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1079063211403163">
<title>Attachment styles</title>
<p>The Relationship Style Questionnaire (RSQ) was used to measure attachment styles. It was adapted from a scale developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1079063211403163">Dutton, Saunders, Starzomski, and Bartholomew (1994)</xref>. The RSQ is a 30-item scale made up of four subscales that measure four attachment patterns (Secure, Fearful, Pre-occupied, and Dismissing). Respondents are required to rate how much each item relates to their “style” in close relationships using a 5-point Likert-type scale. Item scores are summed to give a rating for each attachment style. The scale has been found to have convergent validity with interview ratings of the four styles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1079063211403163">Dutton et al., 1994</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1079063211403163">
<title>Emotional loneliness</title>
<p>The UCLA Emotional Loneliness Scale was used to measure emotional loneliness. It originates from a scale devised by Russell, Peplan, and Cutrona (1980, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1079063211403163">Interventions and Substance Misuse Group, 2007</xref>). It is made up of 19 items relating to how much respondents believe they have had meaningful relationships, have been lonely, or have had others close to them in 6 months prior to the testing date. Respondents answer using a 4-point Likert-type scale. High scores indicate a higher level of emotional loneliness and fewer close, meaningful relationships. The measure has been found to have strong test-retest reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1079063211403163">Interventions and Substance Misuse Group, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1079063211403163">
<title>Social problem solving</title>
<p>The Social Problem Solving Inventory–Revised (SPSI-R) was used to measure social problem solving. It is a 52-item scale made up of subscales measuring five aspects of problem solving conceptualized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1079063211403163">D’Zurilla, Nezu, and Maydeu-Olivares (2002)</xref>. It measures positive problem orientation, negative problem orientation, rational problem solving, impulsivity/carelessness style, and avoidance style. Respondents rate how well each statement relating to the five subscales fits them using a 5-point Likert-type scale. Higher scores suggest more effective problem solving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1079063211403163">Interventions and Substance Misuse Group, 2007</xref>). The measure has been validated with a large sample of U.K. sexual offenders. It was found to have good internal consistency and test-retest reliability and to have “reasonable” construct validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1079063211403163">Wakeling, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1079063211403163">
<title>Socially desirable responding</title>
<p>The Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding (BIDR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1079063211403163">Paulhus, 1984</xref>) was used to measure socially desirable responding. It is a 40-item measure containing two subscales scored on a 7-point Likert-type scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1079063211403163">Mills &amp; Kroner, 2006</xref>). The two subscales relate to self-deception and impression management. Subscale scores are summed to provide a total score, with high scores indicating more socially desirable responding. A validation study with offenders found the BIDR had utility in measuring socially desirable responding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1079063211403163">Kroner &amp; Weekes, 1996</xref>). Data from this measure were analyzed in the present study as previous research has suggested that the adapted LoC measure may be susceptible to socially desirable responding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1079063211403163">Mathie &amp; Wakeling, 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section12-1079063211403163">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Reliability and validity analyses were conducted on a large psychometric data set obtained from the HM Prison Service Interventions and Substance Misuse Group. In addition, a separate test-retest investigation was carried out at a Category C prison establishment that houses sexual offenders. A Category C establishment houses those prisoners not considered to pose a high risk of escape and who do not require maximum security.</p>
<sec id="section13-1079063211403163">
<title>Reliability/validity analysis</title>
<p>Data for the reliability and validity analyses were obtained from an anonymized national database held and maintained by the HM Prison Service Interventions and Substance Misuse Group. This database contained offenders’ pre-and posttreatment scores on various measures for all those offenders who completed a SOTP between 2003 and 2008. Only data from those offenders who consented prior to participating in SOTP to their scores being used for research purposes were included in the data set. The researcher was provided electronically with all total and raw scores for each measure included in the present study. Items that required reverse scoring were recoded. Demographic information on the participants was also provided.</p>

<title>Test-retest</title>
<p>A list of all offenders at a Category C prison establishment who had not completed SOTP was generated from the prison database. Offenders who had too short a time remaining at the establishment to complete two testing sessions were excluded, as were those who had a recorded IQ below 80 (an IQ of 80 is the cutoff for attending the Core and Rolling SOTP). This gave a potential participant pool of 44 offenders, who were invited to a recruitment meeting at which the study was described. Offenders were given recruitment information and had the opportunity to ask the researcher questions. Offenders who agreed to participate were given consent forms and confidentiality arrangements were explained. Offenders with literacy difficulties were identified and offered individual sessions.</p>
<p>Participants completed the adapted LoC measure at two time points. The majority completed the measure in a group setting, though for various reasons 4 participants completed the measure individually: 3 of these offenders missed their group appointments and 1 offender had additional literacy needs, and so the measure was administered verbally. The final sample comprised 26 offenders. The mean length of time between testing sessions was 35.01 days (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.27).</p>
<p>To ensure consistency, all participants completed the measure in the same conditions on both occasions (e.g., in a group or individually). Participants were given a standard set of instructions and supervised by the researcher and assistant. An observation sheet was completed for each testing session, where any difficulties or events that could have disrupted sessions were recorded. At the end of the second testing session, participants were debriefed and given the opportunity to ask any questions. Completed measures and scores were stored separately from consent forms in secure conditions.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient, and test-retest reliability was examined using a Pearson’s correlation. A series of Pearson’s correlations were used to examine the convergent validity of the adapted LoC Scale with self-esteem, attachment style, and social problem solving, and its association with socially desirable responding. Sensitivity to treatment changes was assessed using a paired samples <italic>t</italic> test. Finally, the construct validity was examined using EFA and CFA. SPSS was used to conduct all of the analyses, except the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), for which LISREL 8.80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1079063211403163">Jöreskog &amp; Sörbom, 2007</xref>) was used.</p>

<p>Convergent validity and the relationship of the adapted LoC Scale with socially desirable responding were examined. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1079063211403163">Table 1</xref> shows the correlations of the scale with each measure. One-tailed <italic>p</italic> values were used because directional hypotheses of the relationships between the adapted LoC and other scales were proposed. Results were in the expected directions, with a more internal locus of control (as measured by a higher score on the scale) being associated with higher self-esteem, secure attachment style, and overall effective problem-solving approach. A more internal locus of control was also positively associated with the rational and positive problem-orientation scales of the SPSI-R.</p>

<p>A more internal locus of control was negatively associated with fearful, preoccupied, and dismissing attachment styles, and higher levels of emotional loneliness. In addition, a more internal locus of control was negatively associated with the avoidance, impulsivity/carelessness, and negative problem-orientation scales of the SPSI-R. Examination of the relationship between the adapted LoC Scale and socially desirable responding showed that a more internal locus of control was positively associated with overall higher levels of socially desirable responding, self-deceptive enhancement, and impression management.</p>
<p>As multiple correlations were used in the reliability and validity analyses to assess convergent validity and relationship of the adapted LoC Scale to the other measures, a Bonferroni correction was applied to reduce the likelihood of a Type I error. To do this, the <italic>p</italic> value significant at .5 was divided by the number of correlations (<italic>n</italic> = 15). This gave a new <italic>p</italic> value of .003 for significance. All correlations were still significant, once this had been applied.</p>
<p>Analyses demonstrated a marked correlation between scores on the LoC Scale and measure of socially desirable responding (BIDR; <italic>r</italic> = .42, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, one-tailed). As a result, the convergent validity analyses were reexamined with BIDR scores partialled out. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1079063211403163">Table 2</xref> shows the correlations of the LoC with each measure when BIDR scores were partialled out.

<title>Sensitivity to Treatment Change</title>
<p>A paired samples <italic>t</italic> test was used to examine the adapted LoC Scale’s sensitivity to treatment change. The mean pretreatment LoC score was 48.66 (<italic>SD</italic> = 8.47), and mean posttreatment LoC score was 53.97 (<italic>SD</italic> = 8.34). A significant effect of treatment was found: <italic>t</italic>(2,322) = −35.52, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>r</italic> = .31). This suggested that participants’ locus of control scores, on average, became more internal following treatment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1079063211403163">
<title>Construct Validity</title>
<p>Construct validity was assessed using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and CFA. The data were split randomly using SPSS random sampling tools into two samples, with one used for the EFA (<italic>n</italic> = 1,133) and the other for CFA (<italic>n</italic> = 1,181). The discrepancy in number of participants for these two samples is due to missing cases being removed after the data had been split.</p>
<sec id="section21-1079063211403163">
<title>EFA</title>
<p>“Factorability” of the data was examined using Pearson’s <italic>r</italic>. A number of correlations in both data sets exceeded .30, indicating that the data were factorable. No correlations were above .8, suggesting multicollinearity was not a problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1079063211403163">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Initially, a principal components analysis (PCA) was carried out using varimax rotation. The PCA indicated four components with eigenvalues more than 1 that accounted for 48.2% of the variance. Examination of the Scree plot indicated that three components sat above the point at which the Scree plot “broke,” although a further component sat just above the plotted line, suggesting either a three- or four-component solution. Next, principal factor analysis (PFA) varimax rotation was conducted to examine a three- and four-factor solution as suggested by the PCA.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1079063211403163">
<title>Three-factor solution</title>
<p>The three-factor model accounted for 31.52% of the variance, and 13 of the 18 scale items loaded onto at least one of the factors using an item loading cutoff of 0.40. Items 1, 7, 8, 14, and 15 did not load onto any of the factors. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1079063211403163">Table 3</xref> shows the item loadings for each factor, communalities, percentage of variance and covariance, and squared multiple correlations (SMC) for the three-factor solution. The SMC provides an estimate of the solution’s internal consistency. A good solution should have SMCs between 0 and 1, with higher positive numbers (around .70) indicating more stable factors. Thus, all three factors appear to be stable.</p>

<p>Inspection of the factors in each solution suggested that the factors of chance and internal, originally proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1079063211403163">Levenson (1974</xref>), were relevant to retain as factor labels. In relation to the three-factor solution, five item loadings were the same as found in a CFA of Levenson’s original scale reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1079063211403163">Walkey (1979)</xref>. The six items loading onto Factor 1 related to beliefs about life events being caused by chance: this factor was therefore labeled <italic>Chance</italic>. Two out of five items loading onto Factor 2 related to beliefs that events were outside of an individual’s control and linked to powerful others (e.g., professionals). However, the other three items that loaded onto the factor did not appear relevant to powerful others, and were related to general beliefs about self-efficacy, leading to this factor being labeled <italic>Efficacy Beliefs</italic>. The three items that loaded onto Factor 3 were concerned with beliefs that an individual has control over events and confidence in solving problems: this factor was therefore labeled <italic>Internal</italic>.</p>
<p>In the four-factor solution, eight items relating to life events being outside of an individual’s control and/or linked to chance loaded onto Factor 1. Thus, Factor 1 was labeled <italic>External</italic>. Three items loaded onto the second factor and appeared specific to aspects of social problem solving, for example, anticipating difficulties and having confidence in solving problems. Thus, Factor 2 was labeled <italic>Problem Solving</italic>. Two items loaded onto Factor 3 and as with the three-factor solution related to the influence on life events of others. Factor 3 was therefore labeled <italic>Powerful Others</italic>. Finally, two items loaded onto the fourth factor relating to beliefs about internal control: the factor was therefore labeled <italic>Internal</italic>.</p>

However, this statistic is very sensitive to large sample sizes as used in the present study and can produce an inaccurate assessment of fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1079063211403163">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2007</xref>). Therefore, other indices were interpreted as they are considered to be more informative.</p>

<title>Root mean square residual (RMSR) and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA)</title>
<p>The RMSR is used to compare the fits of two (or more) models for the same data, and the closer the RMSR value is to zero, the better the fit of the model to the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1079063211403163">Bryant &amp; Yarnold, 1995</xref>). Low RMSEA values, close to 0.06, indicate a good fitting model and lower chance of Type II error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1079063211403163">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999</xref>). The RMSEA value for the four-factor model (0.07) was closer to 0.06 than the three-factor model (0.08), suggesting that the four-factor model was a “reasonable” fit and a better fit to the data than the three-factor model.</p>

<title>Fit indices (comparative fit [CFI], normed fit [NFI], nonnormed fit [NNFI], and goodness of fit [GFI])</title>
<p>Comparative fit statistics place the proposed models on a continuum from a model that is made up of unrelated variables and a model that is a perfect fit to the data. Higher values for the CFI, NFI, NNFI, and GFI indicate a better fit (e.g., &gt; 0.95). The indices for the four-factor model were slightly higher than for the three-factor model. The consistency in the CFI, NFI, NNFI, and GFI indices for the four-factor model also suggest that it provides a good fit to the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1079063211403163">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1079063211403163">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, examination of the items in the EFA and the goodness of fit statistics suggested that the four-factor model provided a better fit to the data than the three-factor model and was a “reasonable” fit. In addition, when the internal consistency of the scale was analyzed with the three items relating to problem solving removed, the Cronbach’s alpha remained at .81, suggesting that the removal of these items did not affect the reliability of the scale.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of the present study provide moderate support for the use of the adapted LoC Scale with sexual offenders. The results showed that the adapted LoC Scale has very good internal consistency and test-retest reliability. This is in line with the findings of an unpublished study by Rallings and Webster (2001, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1079063211403163">Wakeling, 2007</xref>). Indeed, the internal consistency and test-retest reliability for the adapted LoC Scale is higher than that reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1079063211403163">Levenson (1981)</xref> for the original IPC Scale.</p>
<p>The scale had weak to moderate convergent validity with measures of self-esteem, attachment styles, emotional loneliness, and social problem solving. The strongest associations were with the self-esteem and social problem-solving measures, which supports the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1079063211403163">Wakeling (2007)</xref> who found that the SSES (self-esteem) and SPSI-R (social problem solving) were significantly correlated with the adapted LoC Scale. In both the current and the Wakeling studies, a more internal locus of control was significantly associated with a more effective problem-solving approach and higher levels of self-esteem. These results provide support for the suggestion that there is “overlap” between cognitive constructs such as locus of control and self-esteem and that individuals’ locus of control orientation, level of self-esteem, and social problem-solving abilities are interlinked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1079063211403163">D’Zurilla &amp; Nezu, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1079063211403163">Judge et al., 2002</xref>). The correlations between locus of control, self-esteem, and emotional loneliness also provide some support for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1079063211403163">Thornton’s (2002)</xref> grouping of these three constructs into an “inadequacy” risk factor for sexual offending.</p>
<p>The association of the adapted LoC scores with socially desirable responding provides some support for the argument that self-report measures, particularly those related to social functioning, may be susceptible to socially desirable responding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1079063211403163">Mathie &amp; Wakeling, 2011</xref>). However, when socially desirable responding was controlled for, the associations between LoC scores and all measures remained significant, albeit of a weaker magnitude.</p>
<p>As all measures used in the present study were based on offenders’ self-report, their susceptibility to response bias should be borne in mind when interpreting the results. Independent observations or measures that are not susceptible to such measurement error would be beneficial when investigating such constructs and working clinically with offenders. However, traits such as locus of control are extremely difficult to objectively measure and this must be borne in mind with research of this kind.</p>
<p>Analysis showed that the LoC measure was sensitive to treatment change. These findings provide some support for the use of the measure in clinical work to assess the changes in locus of control orientation following intervention. The present results provide support for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1079063211403163">Webster et al. (2004)</xref> who found that offenders participating in SOTP showed a significant improvement in locus of control (also using the LoC measure). However, the present study did not use a control group of sexual offenders who did not complete SOTP, so it cannot be concluded that SOTP exerted the effect on LoC scores, and offenders’ locus of control may have changed independently rather than as a result of treatment. Further research would benefit from addressing this issue with the use of a matched comparison group. Moreover, prospective research is needed to examine the relationship between locus of control, and improvements in locus of control through treatment, and sexual recidivism.</p>
<p>The results of the factor analysis support <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1079063211403163">Levenson’s (1974)</xref> conceptualization of locus of control as multidimensional and made up of multiple factors. Both the EFA and CFA suggested that a four-factor model fitted the data best and explained an acceptable proportion of the variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1079063211403163">Henson &amp; Roberts, 2006</xref>). The EFA suggested that although 13 of the adapted LoC scale items could be meaningfully fit to the original three-factor model proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1079063211403163">Levenson (1974</xref>), 5 did not load on to any of the factors. This supports findings such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1079063211403163">Wilkinson’s (2007)</xref>, who found limited support for the three-factor model. Examination of the four-factor model suggested that 15 of the adapted LoC Scale items loaded on to at least one of the factors. Examination of the remaining three items that had weak loadings suggested that they were more relevant to a positive orientation toward problem solving, similar to the constructs of social problem-solving theory proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1079063211403163">D’Zurilla, Nezu, and Maydeu-Olivares (2004)</xref> rather than the locus of control construct. This finding suggests that these three items do not adequately tap into the locus of control construct, and so the measure might benefit from removal of these items.</p>
<p>Although the reliability and validity analyses benefited from a large sample, the test-retest sample was small (<italic>n</italic> = 26), and the average length of time between testing sessions was only 35 days. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1079063211403163">Kline (2000)</xref> argues that the period between testing sessions should be as long as possible and that test-retest investigations should have large samples (approximately <italic>n</italic> = 100) to minimize the impact of standard errors. Therefore, the present test-retest analyses may have limited validity as participants may have remembered previous answers to the scale items (although this may be more relevant to scales that require a right/wrong answer) or the results may be affected by large standard errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1079063211403163">Kline, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Both samples were mostly made up of sexual offenders from a White background, and participants in the main analyses had all completed a sexual offending behavior program. Therefore, it is not clear whether the findings can be generalized to those sexual offenders from other ethnic groups or those who do not complete SOTP, refuse or drop out of treatment. It is thought that offenders who refuse or do not complete treatment may differ significantly from those who participate in and complete treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1079063211403163">Mann &amp; Fernandez, 2006</xref>), and so their absence in this sample may have a biasing effect on results. In addition, results of the present study may not generalize to female sexual offenders or juvenile offenders.</p>
<p>It would be beneficial for further validation to be conducted with more diverse samples of sexual offenders, including those who refuse to participate in or do not complete SOTP. Future research would also benefit from examining whether further modifications of the LoC Scale, such as removing the items identified as more relevant to problem solving in the present study and adding new items relevant to locus of control, could improve the reliability and validity of the adapted scale.</p>
<p>The present study found that the measures of locus of control, self-esteem, and social problem solving were moderately associated with each other. However, it is not known <italic>why</italic> or <italic>how</italic> locus of control, self-esteem, and problem solving are linked or whether a “higher order” construct may influence the associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1079063211403163">Judge et al., 2002</xref>). Further research would benefit from conceptualizing and exploring the links between factors, such as locus of control, self-esteem, and social problem solving in sexual offender populations as a whole and within different types of sexual offender.</p>
<p>To conclude, the present study suggests that the adapted LoC Scale used within the English and Welsh Prison Service has good utility, and there is evidence to suggest that it is a reliable tool, with moderate convergent and construct validity. As noted, research to refine the measure further would be useful for maximizing its psychometric properties as well as further exploration of the relationship of locus of control with different types of sexual offending.</p>
