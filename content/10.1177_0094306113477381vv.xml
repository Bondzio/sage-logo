<p>Margot Weiss’ sociological approach to the formation of sexual desire is breathtakingly smart and powerful, and should be required reading for any serious scholar of sexuality henceforth. Linking political economy and structures of race, class, and gender to the very substance of what Bay Area BDSM (bondage, discipline, sadomasochism) practitioners eroticize, <italic>Techniques of Pleasure</italic> sociologizes desire and distills with brilliant acumen the sociopolitical contexts that underpin what I have elsewhere called an “erotic habitus.” On the other hand, Weiss spends much of her 231 pages of text devoted to the imposition of a Foucauldian/Rosian framework of neoliberal governmentality on the BDSM scene with a mind-numbing redundancy as if, in a kind of Butlerian performativity, the repetition itself will somehow make it real or meaningful. In this tedious, academic exercise, Weiss focuses on whether and how BDSM in the Bay Area can be construed to transgress norms and disturb social inequalities or alternatively, consolidate them and create new forms of structural disadvantage. Here, Weiss establishes herself as the interlocutor who exposes the false consciousness of her subjects, discerning for her scholarly audience “the Truth” of BDSM subjectivities and practices, and their unwitting collusion with neoliberal rationality and the structures of inequality in late capitalism.</p>
<p>Weiss set out for San Francisco to study the city’s BDSM community in 2000 as part of her dissertation research in anthropology. Over the following three years or so, she conducted sixty-one interviews with BDSM practitioners, and immersed herself in the scene.</p>
<p>The book is arranged in five chapters, the first which offers a sketch of the political, economic, and social history of San Francisco, including its reputation as an erotic oasis, the impact of deindustrialization on the social organization of the city, the rise of Silicon Valley (and its subsequent short-lived bust), and the mass gentrification of neighborhoods.</p>
<p>In Chapter Two, Weiss focuses on the political and economic formation of the new BDSM practitioner in the Bay Area. From her fieldwork, Weiss finds late-capitalist subjects who reflect the biopolitics of risk management through extensive concern over and formal management of the prospect of physical and psychological harm that may result from BDSM practice.</p>
<p>Weiss also analyzes the process by which one becomes a BDSM practitioner in the new scene. Whereas in the past one was mentored in a kind of personal apprenticeship, today’s practitioners attend classes and discussion groups, listen to lectures, read books on BDSM, and look to community experts to instruct them on the finer points of things like flogging, rope tying, breath play, electricity play, bondage, spanking and “aftercare.”</p>
<p>Weiss also notes the ways in which becoming a BDSM practitioner is a “deeply class-inflected” process as it rests on possessing the requisite leisure time, disposable income, and a disposition toward education and mastery. Thus it is the “professional-class” of the Bay Area that constitutes the ranks of BDSM practitioners.</p>
<p>In Chapter Three, Weiss broadens her analysis of neoliberal governmentality in her examination of BDSM toys. Here the reader learns that purchasing and using BDSM toys is a consumer practice that produces subjects who conform to the broader terrain of social, political and economic relations that characterize late-modern, “flexible” capitalism. These subjects are “deeply resonant with late-capitalist forms of biopower,” forging intimate bonds that depend upon (but are not wholly determined by) commodity exchange.</p>
<p>In Chapter Four, Weiss interviews three heterosexual dominant men in an explicit discussion around politics and the charged scenes of BDSM, including rape, slavery, capture and torture, incest play, holocaust play, and the like. Aware of the political implications of their own subject positions as heterosexual, dominant men, these men speak of ambivalences around their sexual desires that require a certain degree of self-work to neutralize. One of the major ways in which this neutralization is accomplished is through the notion of “consent” and through the articulation of a “play frame” that regards BDSM scenes as recreational. By this logic, women who consent to be dominated, and blacks (and others) who consent to be slaves, are thought to be making rational, autonomous decisions to partake in BDSM play. As Weiss concludes: “Here, the very rhetoric of choice not only displays privilege, it also allows people with privilege (of race, class or gender) to sidestep the fact that they are beneficiaries of that privilege, to position themselves as lone individuals, outside of the material relations of power that give form to both privilege and oppression, opportunity and constraint” (p. 173).</p>
<p>In the fifth and final chapter, Weiss rearticulates her central problematic concerning the question of subversion in BDSM, but this time through the contrasting lenses of radical feminism and queer theory. Whereas radical feminists reject a public/private divide, viewing sexuality as the primary sphere of women’s domination and BDSM as consolidating race and gender inequality, queer theorists laud BDSM for subverting heteronormativity and transcending “vanilla” sex. Weiss arrives at a “performative materialism” in which BDSM sexual practices are iterative fabrications of power relations that at the same time reflect, consolidate, and have the capacity to make conscious, material relations.</p>
<p>Of the more insightful moments in this work, Weiss’ analysis of the relationship of the body and sexual subjectivities to BDSM paraphernalia is outstanding. Here, Weiss shows how sexual pleasure and subjectivity are mediated through commodities, the latter which make possible certain kinds of intimate connections that at once draw upon but exceed a simple act of consumption. As well, Weiss offers gorgeous, lyrical analyses of the social constitution of sexual desires which, in another context, recall what Bourdieu referred to as the “somatization of social relations” or the inculcation of social structure at the level of the body. Weiss’ observations concerning the materiality of sexual desires and the ways in which the sexual imaginary maps on and off fields of power is extraordinary, dealing a near-fatal blow to traditional psychoanalytic readings which embed sexual ideation in an insulated model of family relations.</p>
<p>But rather than make the somatic uptake of the social order and its articulation in eroticism her central problematic, Weiss spends most of her time detailing the ways in which neoliberal governmentality is at the core of Bay Area BDSM culture, subjectivity and practice, along with the various ways in which BDSM is and is not subversive. Strangely, Weiss denies (or to use her language, “disavows”) that this is her focus, claiming instead to examine, “What political effects are produced in the complicated circuits between bodies, players, audiences, and readers created by SM?” (p. 229). But this distinction is a ruse, because in Weiss’ hands it reduces to the same question of the myriad ways in which the political effects of BDSM are or are not subversive to capitalism and social inequality.</p>
<p>In broad theoretical terms, while the realm of BDSM play and sexual fantasy more generally, are surely constituted as somatic objectifications of the larger world of power and politics—an insight of profound sociological value—these domains are at the same time irreducible to them as people fantasize sexual scenarios that both correlate with <italic>and</italic> sometimes invert structures of inequality. Importantly, the very possibility that one might fantasize about and eroticize a female dom or a male sub tells us something very important that is missed entirely by Weiss: there is a semblance of mental life and its associated articulation in cultural practice that is distinguished from the political economy and its logics in a manner, objectively and phenomenologically, that amounts to more than an artifact of a neoliberal separation of the public/private divide.</p>
<p>The fact that Weiss herself does not participate in BDSM, but sits on the sidelines, “playing around the edges,” adorned in one of her three pre-selected BDSM outfits, is also noteworthy. Here, Weiss sets herself up to speak to the subjectivities of BDSM practitioners while at the same time abstaining from the very practices that constitute those subjectivities. This is not to advance an orthodox methodological axiom that requires all ethnographers to “go native,” or one that strips them of the capacity for productive analysis in the absence of the authority of experience but, instead, to suggest that the particular questions at stake in <italic>this</italic> ethnography render abstinence from BDSM practice a rather glaring methodological deficit.</p>
