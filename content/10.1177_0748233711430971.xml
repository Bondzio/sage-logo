<p>Cadmium is a known industrial and environmental pollutant. It causes hepatotoxicity upon acute administration. Features of cadmium-induced acute hepatoxicity encompass necrosis, apoptosis, peliosis and inflammatory infiltration. Gadolinium chloride (GdCl<sub>3</sub>) may prevent cadmium-induced hepatotoxicity by suppressing Kupffer cells. The effect of GdCl<sub>3</sub> pretreatment on a model of acute cadmium-induced liver injury was investigated. Male Wistar rats 4–5 months old were injected intraperitoneally with normal saline followed by cadmium chloride (CdCl<sub>2</sub>; 6.5 mg/kg) or GdCl<sub>3</sub> (10 mg/kg) followed by CdCl<sub>2</sub> (6.5 mg/kg; groups I and II, respectively). Rats of both the groups were killed at 9, 12, 16, 24, 48 and 60 h after cadmium intoxication. Liver sections were analyzed for necrosis, apoptosis, peliosis and mitoses. Liver regeneration was also evaluated by tritiated thymidine incorporation into hepatic DNA. Serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were also determined. Hepatic necrosis, hepatocyte and nonparenchymal cell apoptosis and macroscopic and microscopic types of peliosis hepatis were minimized by gadolinium pretreatment. Serum levels of AST and ALT were also greatly diminished in rats of group II. Tritiated thymidine incorporation into hepatic DNA was increased in gadolinium pretreatment rats. Kupffer cell activation was minimal in both the groups of rats. Gadolinium pretreatment attenuates acute cadmium-induced liver injury in young Wistar rats, with mechanisms other than Kupffer cell elimination.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cadmium is one of the most abundant nonessential toxic elements due to its immense usage in various industrial applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0748233711430971">Page et al., 1986</xref>). In humans, the primary route of exposure is via contaminated drinking water, food supplies and tobacco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748233711430971">Goering et al., 1995</xref>). Acute cadmium intoxication in experimental animals results primarily in the accumulation of the metal in the liver causing acute hepatotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748233711430971">Dudley et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748233711430971">Kotsonis and Klaassen, 1977</xref>). Histopathological features of cadmium toxicity in the liver include zonal, focal and massive necrosis, fatty infiltration and hepatocyte swelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748233711430971">Dudley et al., 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748233711430971">1984</xref>). Apoptosis of parenchymal and nonparenchymal liver cells also constitutes a major mode of cell death in acute cadmium-induced hepatotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748233711430971">Tzirogiannis et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Peliosis hepatis is a vascular lesion characterized by the formation of blood-filled cavities with or without endothelial cell lining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748233711430971">Tzirogiannis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0748233711430971">Wold, 1981</xref>) and represents a distinct histological finding in cadmium acute hepatotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748233711430971">Tzirogiannis et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748233711430971">2006</xref>). Peliosis is further subdivided into microscopic and macroscopic types, and endothelial cell apoptosis seems to be the major mode of cell death implicated in the genesis of the lesion in the livers of cadmium intoxicated rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748233711430971">Tzirogiannis et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748233711430971">2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Cadmium is considered to act not only directly on hepatocytes and nonparenchymal liver cells causing toxicity but also indirectly through activation of Kupffer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748233711430971">Rikans and Yamano, 2000</xref>). Endothelial cells appear to be the most sensitive liver cell subpopulation to the toxic effects of the metal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0748233711430971">Liu et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748233711430971">McKim et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748233711430971">Nolan and Shaikh, 1986</xref>). In Wistar rats, liver injury caused by cadmium has been reported to be age dependent and rats less than 6 months old are resistant to the toxic effects of the metal through reduced activation of Kupffer cells and neutrophil infiltration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748233711430971">Tzirogiannis et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0748233711430971">Yamano et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0748233711430971">2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Cadmium acute hepatotoxicity has been the subject of numerous reports, and it has been proposed that it evolves as a biphasic process that encompasses two distinct pathways: one for initial injury mainly through direct toxic effects of the metal and/or ischemia due to endothelial cell injury and the other for delayed injury due to the triggering of the inflammatory cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748233711430971">Dong et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748233711430971">Kayama et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748233711430971">Rikans and Yamano, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748233711430971">Sauer et al., 1997</xref>). Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), mainly a product of Kupffer cells, has been considered a pivotal growth factor-mediating cadmium-induced liver injury, although TNF-α-null mice also develop severe liver trauma following cadmium intoxication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748233711430971">Harstad and Klaassen, 2002a</xref>).</p>
<p>Gadolinium is a pleiotropic lanthanide that specifically eliminates Kupffer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748233711430971">Sauer et al., 1997</xref>). Pretreatment with gadolinium chloride (GdCl<sub>3</sub>) prevents cadmium-induced hepatotoxicity, and this action seems to be independent of Kupffer cell elimination or induction of metallothionine (MT) since it is also present in MT null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748233711430971">Harstad and Klaassen, 2002b</xref>). Gadolinium protective action against cadmium is observed only on intact liver since the metal does not protect cultured hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0748233711430971">Badger et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Gadolinium has also been reported to protect against carbon tetrachloride-induced liver injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748233711430971">Edwards et al., 1993</xref>) and against ischemia–reperfusion injury by inhibiting apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748233711430971">Li et al., 2009</xref>). Gadolinium pretreatment also arrests the apoptosis of liver cells after radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748233711430971">Du et al., 2010</xref>). In the present study, we investigated the effect of GdCl<sub>3</sub> pretreatment on acute cadmium-induced hepatotoxicity.</p>

<title>Chemicals</title>
<p>Cadmium chloride (CdCl<sub>2</sub>) and GdCl<sub>3</sub> were supplied from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Company Inc (St. Louis, MO, USA). Diethyl ether for anesthesia was obtained from Codex, Carlo Erba (Milan, Italy) and [<sup>3</sup>H]-thymidine from Amersham Corp (Buckinghamshire, UK). TUNEL assay (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling) was purchased from YLEM (Roma, Italy) and APC Detection Kit from NeoMarkers (Freemont, CA, USA).</p>

<sec id="section4-0748233711430971">
<title>Animals and treatment</title>
<p>Male Wistar rats (Hellenic Pasteur Institute, Athens, Greece) 4–5 months old, weighing 160–180 g, were used in this study. The animals were fed with a commercial pelleted diet and tap water. They were allowed food and water ad libitum and maintained in identical housing units under controlled temperature (22 ± 1°C) and lighting cycle (8:00 a.m.–8:00 p.m. light and 8:00 p.m.–8:00 a.m. dark). Animals were handled with humane care in accordance with the European Union Directive and adapted in the relevant Greek Presidential decree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0748233711430971">Greek presidential decree No 160/1991, 1991</xref>). All experiments were conducted between 7.00 and 9.30 a.m., with the animals under light ether anesthesia.</p>
<p>Animals were randomly selected and assigned into two groups as follows:<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Group I rats: intraperitoneal injection of CdCl<sub>2</sub> at a dose of 6.5 mg/kg body weight and intraperitoneal injection of normal saline 24 h prior to cadmium intoxication.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Group II rats: intraperitoneal injection of CdCl<sub>2</sub> at a dose of 6.5 mg/kg body weight and intraperitoneal injection of GdCl<sub>3</sub> at the dose of 10 mg/kg body weight 24 h prior to cadmium intoxication.</p>
</list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Animals from all groups were killed under ether anesthesia via cardiac puncture at 9, 12, 16, 24, 48 and 60 h after cadmium intoxication. The control group consisted of a group of six animals killed at 0 h. One hour prior to killing, the animals of all groups were injected with [<sup>3</sup>H]-thymidine at a dose of 250 μCi/kg body weight intraperitoneally.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0748233711430971">
<title>Histopathology</title>
<p>Blocks of liver tissue were fixed in 4% buffered formalin for 24 h, paraffin-embedded, stained with hematoxylin–eosin (H&amp;E) and assessed for necrosis, apoptosis, peliosis, mitoses and inflammatory infiltration.</p>
<p>Necrosis was assessed semiquantitatively in a 5-degree severity scale (0–4): 0: <italic>no necrosis</italic>; 1: <italic>necrosis of 1%–5% of liver cells</italic>; 2: <italic>necrosis of 6%–25% of liver cells</italic>; 3: <italic>necrosis of 26%–50% of liver cells</italic> and 4: <italic>necrosis of &gt;50% of liver cells</italic>.</p>
<p>Microscopic and macroscopic types of peliosis hepatis were assessed separately by a semiquantitative method and expressed in a 4-degree severity scale (0–3): 0, <italic>no peliosis</italic>; 1, <italic>one zone of hepatic lobule (approximately 33%)</italic>; 2, <italic>two zones of hepatic lobule (approximately 67%)</italic> and 3, <italic>all the hepatic lobule (approximately 100%)</italic>.</p>
<p>Apoptosis was evaluated  (a) using H&amp;E stain for total apoptotic index and (b) in situ using the TUNEL assay for apoptotic index for hepatocytes and apoptotic index for nonparenchymal liver cells. Hepatic cell subpopulations were discriminated by their localization in the acini and by the immunochemical detection of vimentin. Apoptotic indices were expressed as the number of positive cells per 1000 cells.</p>
<p>Mitoses were counted in H&amp;E stained sections at 10 high-power field (HPF) and expressed per 1000 liver cells. Inflammatory infiltration was also expressed as the number of inflammatory cells per 1000 liver cells.</p>

<sec id="section6-0748233711430971">
<title>Immunohistochemistry for Kupffer cell detection</title>
<p>Immunochemistry was carried out using APC Detection Kit for nonparenchymal cells (vimentin 1:50 plus microwave; NeoMarkers) and for activated Kupffer cells CD68 (1:50 plus microwave; NeoMarkers). Positive cells were counted at 10 HPF and expressed per 1000 liver cells.</p>
<p>Kupffer cells were identified by the immunochemical detection of F4/80 macrophage surface antigen. Slides were incubated with proteinase K (20 μg/mL) for 15 min at room temperature for antigen retrieval. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by treatment of the slides with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min. The slides were treated for 30 min with 5% normal rabbit serum in phosphate buffer saline-blocked nonspecific binding. Kupffer cells were then detected with a primary antibody to the F4/80 macrophage surface antigen (MCAP497, Serotec Inc, Raleigh, NC, USA). A biotinylated anti-rat secondary antibody (BA-4001, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) specifically identified the primary antibody. The liver sections were then incubated with avidin and biotinylated horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and identified using the HRP substrate diaminobenzidine and counterstained with hematoxylin. Brown-staining cells with appropriate nuclear morphology and sinusoidal location were counted as Kupffer cells. Kupffer cells were quantified as the average number of F4/80-positive cells per field from at least 20 randomly selected fields per section.</p>

<p>Cadmium administration in group I rats caused evident liver necrosis which peaked at 12 and 48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748233711430971">Figure 1</xref>). Necrosis was zonal and located mainly at zone 2 in the hepatic acinus. The enzymatic activities of AST and ALT were elevated at 12 h and peaked at 48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748233711430971">Figure 2</xref>). GdCl<sub>3</sub> administration (group II) reversed cadmium-induced necrosis. For all time points examined, necrosis was reversed in group II rats with the exception of 48 h, where relatively low grades of the lesion were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748233711430971">Figure 1</xref>). Serum levels of AST and ALT were significantly decreased by GdCl<sub>3</sub> administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748233711430971">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Cadmium acute hepatotoxicity represents a field of intensive scientific research, but despite this fundamental aspect, it remains unveiled. Apoptosis represents an essential mechanism for the elimination of critically damaged cells in the livers of cadmium-intoxicated rats and it seems to be more profound in nonparenchymal liver cells. The time pattern of apoptotic cell death was distinct for hepatocytes and nonparenchymal liver cells with hepatocyte apoptosis to evolve in a biphasic pattern and nonparenchymal cell apoptosis, a monophasic pattern. Nonparenchymal cell apoptosis also seems to be the main mode of cell death implicated in the genesis of peliosis, and the above findings are in agreement with the previous findings of our team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748233711430971">Tzirogiannis et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Cadmium appears to be directly toxic to hepatocytes and especially liver endothelial cells, which are considered the most sensitive liver cell population to the toxic effects of the metal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748233711430971">Tzirogiannis et al., 2003</xref>). Indirect actions of the metal through activation of Kupffer cells have also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748233711430971">Rikans and Yamano, 2000</xref>). Since Kupffer cell activation has been minimal and close to control group for both groups of rats in our study, the observed hepatotoxic effect of the metal must be attributed to direct actions. Direct hepatotoxic effects of cadmium occur in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748233711430971">Dudley et al., 1984</xref>), and both endoplasmic reticulum stress and DNA damage are triggering the apoptotic cascade.</p>
<p>Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production has been proposed as the major mechanism for direct cadmium actions, and since cadmium is a redox-stable metal, free radical production must be mediated through indirect mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0748233711430971">Liu et al., 2008</xref>). The metal depletes glutathione and protein-bound sulfhydryl groups, which results in increased production of ROS such as superoxide, hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen peroxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0748233711430971">Liu et al., 2008</xref>). These ROS result in increased lipid peroxidation, enhanced excretion of urinary lipid metabolites, increased levels of oxidative stress and finally DNA and membrane damage that trigger apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0748233711430971">Liu et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Gadolinium pretreatment greatly attenuates all aspects of cadmium-induced acute hepatotoxicity, and this must be attributed to actions of gadolinium other than Kupffer cell elimination. Such an action has also been insinuated by the findings of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748233711430971">Harstad and Klaassen, 2002b</xref>).</p>
<p>Caspase 3, a member of the caspase family or proteins, is an early effector of apoptosis and its levels closely correlate with the degree of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748233711430971">Giammarioli et al., 2008</xref>). Gadolinium administration greatly reduces caspase 3 expression and this action has been attributed to Kupffer cell inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748233711430971">Li et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, gadolinium also seems to directly inhibit apoptosis through downregulating caspase 3 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0748233711430971">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In our study, gadolinium administration caused significant elevations in tritiated thymidine incorporation into hepatic DNA and in mitotic index values that persisted until 60 h after its administration. These results are in agreement with the findings of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748233711430971">Dudley et al., 1982</xref>) and cannot be attributed to liver regeneration since liver necrosis has been minimal in the gadolinium pretreated group of rats. Gadolinium has been reported to increase liver cell turnover in the intact liver and this effect is not observed in liver cell cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748233711430971">Dudley et al., 1982</xref>). This effect of gadolinium is thought to be mediated by TNF-α production from dying Kupffer cells, although production from other cell types such as cells of the biliary epithelium and portal vein cells could also participate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748233711430971">Dudley et al., 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, gadolinium administration greatly attenuates all aspects of acute cadmium-induced hepatotoxicity through direct actions of the metal. Further research is needed at this point in order to fully elucidate the molecular biology of this lanthanide.</p>
