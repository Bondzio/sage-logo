<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The concept of entrepreneurial orientation (EO) is widely considered to be a cornerstone of the literature on firm-level entrepreneurship. EO refers to a strategic organizational posture that captures the specific processes, practices and activities that enable firms to create value by engaging in entrepreneurial endeavors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0266242611418261">Lumpkin and Dess, 1996</xref>). It has emerged as a prominent theoretical construct in the organizational and management literature, attracting considerable attention in journals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266242611418261">Covin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0266242611418261">Messersmith and Wales, in press</xref>), textbooks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0266242611418261">Morris et al., 2010</xref>) and the popular press (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0266242611418261">Certo et al., 2009</xref>). The broad influence of EO also can be observed within neighboring scholarly areas: for example, entrepreneurial marketing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0266242611418261">Jones and Rowley, 2011</xref>). Prior research has linked EO to several variables in an effort to understand better its role in organizations. This article conducts a systematic review of the published literature in this area in order to shed new light on the EO concept by identifying common themes, notable biases and fruitful directions for further research.</p>
<p>Reviews can play an important part in the development of a research field by summarizing published work in a specific area and offering new ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0266242611418261">Bland et al., 1995</xref>). Previous attempts to appraise, summarize and communicate EO research has either narrowly focused on the strength of the EO–performance link (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0266242611418261">Rauch et al., 2009</xref>), with little consideration for other dependent variables and relationships, or examined entrepreneurial ‘activities … within a firm’s boundaries and [those that] transcend the firm’s boundaries’, with only minor consideration of EO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0266242611418261">Zahra et al., 1999</xref>). The prominence of EO as a core concept in the organizational literature suggests that the time is ripe to assess and reflect upon this growing body of research. Our intention is not to provide an exhaustive interpretation, but to identify the main research thrusts and directions of prior empirical research, using a rigorous and transparent methodology. We highlight theoretically grounded predictions, offer advice to practitioners and extend understanding of key EO questions to lend greater clarity and coherence to the literature.</p>
<p>We inspect a large sample of articles to obtain information about relationships that have been theorized and examined through empirical research using a robust, well-established procedure to shortlist relevant studies so that our work may be ‘replicated by others, create consensus among scholars and focus debate in a constructive fashion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0266242611418261">Cooper, 1998</xref>: xi). Our review affords a unique perspective from which to infer EO-related research implications and managerial issues. In addition, our study is not constrained by requirements for a minimum number of studies to compute effect size, as is the case with meta-analytic research. For example, Rauch et al. found that few moderators and mediators ‘have been used across a sufficient number of EO studies to facilitate a meta-analysis of contingency relationships’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0266242611418261">2009</xref>: 766). In contrast, our qualitative review allows us to identify and discuss a more comprehensive set of variables explored as antecedents, moderators and mediators.</p>
<p>The present research is motivated additionally by three factors. First, it provides insight into the prevalence and breadth of empirical research investigating the EO concept. We assess prevalence by exploring the number of publications over time. We assess breadth by segmenting prior research along several lines, including the aims and scope of the publishing journal and the focal country of the research.</p>
<p>Second, over the past three decades individual studies have investigated several antecedents and consequences of EO. Each study typically examines only a small subset of the antecedents and consequences. As Davies noted, empirical studies ‘are limited in the generalizability of the knowledge they produce about concepts, populations, settings and times’ and ‘frequently illuminate only one part of a larger explanatory puzzle’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0266242611418261">2000</xref>: 366). Taken together, these studies reveal many ‘pieces of the puzzle’, leaving researchers with ‘the big task and the big problem’ of making sense of disparate investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0266242611418261">Sarasvathy, 1999</xref>). Systematically reviewing these prior studies allows us to map relevant research and identify the most frequently examined antecedents and consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0266242611418261">Hammersley, 2001</xref>). Specifically, we map the variables explored in 158 empirical articles on EO research.</p>
<p>Third, the growing literature has provided different perspectives on the EO construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0266242611418261">Lumpkin and Dess, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0266242611418261">Miller, 1983</xref>). These distinct conceptualizations foster scholarly debate, but also produce fragmentation that can hinder scientific advancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0266242611418261">Basso et al., 2009</xref>). An examination and assessment of the extent to which these conceptualizations have been explored in the literature lends insight into common themes and notable biases. In so doing, we shed light on the popularity of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0266242611418261">Miller’s (1983)</xref> unidimensional conceptualization of EO, as well as the growing popularity of multidimensional explorations of the phenomenon.</p>
<p>In summary, the present study aims to provide an overview and map of the depth and breadth of empirical literature on the EO concept. It focuses specifically on the empirical literature, given that extant EO research has been primarily empirical in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0266242611418261">Rauch et al., 2009</xref>). These studies, pursuing statistical analyses of formal models, have helped evaluate and test meaningful theoretical tenets of EO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0266242611418261">Covin and Slevin, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0266242611418261">Lumpkin and Dess, 1996</xref>). Thus, by focusing on studies testing hypothesized relationships, we provide insights into theoretically important areas which have received empirical research attention in the literature.</p>
<p>The remainder of the article is structured as follows. In the next section, it provides a brief theoretical overview of the EO literature. Then, using an established protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0266242611418261">David and Han, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0266242611418261">Newbert, 2007</xref>), it assesses how EO has been empirically examined in the literature. Based on the findings, it discusses and highlights promising avenues of research. The article concludes with an acknowledgement of the limitations of this work and a discussion of its practical implications.</p>

<title>Theoretical background</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0266242611418261">Henry Mintzberg (1973)</xref> was one of the first scholars to recognize the utility of an entrepreneurial organizational strategy-making mode. However, it was not until the publication of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0266242611418261">Miller (1983)</xref> that the notion of entrepreneurial firms gained scholarly attention. In his seminal article, Danny Miller argued that ‘an entrepreneurial firm is one that engages in product–market innovation, undertakes somewhat risky ventures and is first to come up with “proactive” innovations, beating competitors to the punch’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0266242611418261">1983</xref>: 771). These three characteristics – innovation, proactiveness and risk-taking – were positioned by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0266242611418261">Miller (1983)</xref> as the heart of EO and are often combined to create a higher-order indicator of firm-level entrepreneurship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0266242611418261">Covin and Wales, forthcoming, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0266242611418261">Rauch et al., 2009</xref>). The significance of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0266242611418261">Miller’s (1983)</xref> contribution is evident in the more than 11 citations per annum that his article has averaged since publication, earning it the status of a ‘classic’ article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0266242611418261">Durden and Ellis, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite Miller’s theoretical contributions, it was not until the publication of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0266242611418261">Covin and Slevin (1989)</xref> that empirical research on firm-level entrepreneurship began in earnest. Covin and Slevin developed a nine-item self-response scale which has subsequently become popular in entrepreneurship research, with a large number of studies utilizing this instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0266242611418261">Rauch et al., 2009</xref>). Perhaps it is not surprising that the Covin and Slevin article also has attained ‘classic’ status, with an average of more than 15 citations per annum according to the SSCI Index.</p>
<p>Building upon prior research, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0266242611418261">Lumpkin and Dess (1996)</xref> suggested that EO can be conceived as a multidimensional phenomenon in which the dimensions represent independent predictors. By arguing that the various dimensions of EO need not co-vary for a firm to be considered entrepreneurial, Lumpkin and Dess made a ‘real break from the previous use and definition of the concept’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0266242611418261">Basso et al., 2009</xref>: 318). This ‘radical’ redefinition of EO marked the beginning of a significant theoretical division. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0266242611418261">Lumpkin and Dess (1996)</xref> also suggested two additional dimensions – competitive aggressiveness and autonomy – which go beyond the original three, and further describe the domain of EO. They defined competitive aggressiveness as an organization’s efforts to overcome its market adversaries by maintaining a confrontational posture, and autonomy as organizational members’ ability to independently pursue and champion promising entrepreneurial ideas and agendas. Measurement instruments for capturing competitive aggressiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0266242611418261">Lumpkin and Dess, 2001</xref>) and autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0266242611418261">Lumpkin et al., 2009</xref>) have been relatively recent additions to the EO literature. Notably, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0266242611418261">Lumpkin and Dess’s (1996)</xref> work is on track to achieve rare ‘super classic’ status in the entrepreneurship literature, with an average of more than 27 SSCI citations per annum since its publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0266242611418261">Durden and Ellis, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>EO can be compared to similar concepts within the entrepreneurship literature, such as corporate entrepreneurship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0266242611418261">Zahra et al., 1999</xref>) and small business orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0266242611418261">Runyan et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast with corporate entrepreneurship, which involves engaging in intrapreneurial activities such as corporate venturing and self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0266242611418261">Antoncic and Hisrich, 2001</xref>), and small business orientation, which ‘encompasses the emotional relationship or attachment of the owner to the business’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0266242611418261">Runyan et al., 2008</xref>), EO pertains to the strategic posture of the firm as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0266242611418261">Basso et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, EO allows for distancing the intentions and attitudes of key individuals within the firm from the firm’s overall proclivity towards entrepreneurship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0266242611418261">Lumpkin and Dess, 1996</xref>). By providing for a separate understanding of key entrepreneurial actors and how they influence behavioral proclivity of the entire firm (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0266242611418261">Sadler-Smith et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0266242611418261">Scott and Rosa, 1996</xref>), EO provides an important conceptual framework for exploring organizationally relevant phenomenon.</p>
<p>Having provided a brief overview of EO’s conceptual origins, we now turn to the empirical literature embedding EO within a complex and growing nomological network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0266242611418261">Cronbach and Meehl, 1955</xref>). In the next section, we describe our methodological approach to the collection and synthesis of relevant research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0266242611418261" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>A distinctive feature of systematic review is that it involves a specific and exhaustive ‘selection of studies for inclusion in the review, which can be contrasted with “haphazard study selection procedures” or even arbitrary study selection procedures’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0266242611418261">Hammersley, 2001</xref>: 544). In order to systematically review the empirical literature, we sampled articles that test EO hypotheses using an approach described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0266242611418261">Newbert (2007)</xref>. This multi-step approach is an extension of the procedure developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0266242611418261">David and Han (2004)</xref>, which has served as a robust and replicable literature review method in two important areas of enquiry: the resource-based view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0266242611418261">Newbert, 2007</xref>) and transaction-cost economics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0266242611418261">David and Han, 2004</xref>). Following Hammersley, who recommended ‘minimal reliance on judgment or discretion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0266242611418261">2001</xref>: 544) in selecting review articles, the present research employed the following criteria (according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0266242611418261">Newbert, 2007</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section4-0266242611418261">
<title>Research criteria and procedure</title>
<p>We restricted our search to ‘scholarly’ journal publications. Because articles in these publications undergo a rigorous peer review process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0266242611418261">Miller and Serzan, 1984</xref>), they are generally believed to be of a higher quality than non-journal articles such as book chapters or unpublished works, for example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0266242611418261">David and Han, 2004</xref>). We searched for articles in the ABI/Inform and EconLit databases, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0266242611418261">David and Han (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0266242611418261">Newbert (2007)</xref>. In addition, to be as comprehensive as possible, we also searched journals indexed in the EBSCO Business Source Complete database.</p>
<p>In order to ensure ‘substantive relevance’, we selected only articles that contained at least one of eight primary key phrases in the title or abstract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0266242611418261">Newbert, 2007</xref>: 125). The phrases were: ‘entrepreneurial orientation’, ‘entrepreneurial proclivity’, ‘entrepreneurial posture’, ‘entrepreneurial disposition’, ‘entrepreneurial intensity’, ‘firm-level entrepreneur*’, ‘intrapreneurship’ and ‘corporate entrepreneurship’. This list is based on the varied taxonomy associated with firm-level entrepreneurship in the literature (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0266242611418261">Zahra et al., 1999</xref> for a more complete review).</p>
<p>In order to eliminate ‘substantively irrelevant’ articles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0266242611418261">Newbert, 2007</xref>: 125), we used a second filter to sift through the remaining abstracts. We required that articles contain at least one of 11 additional keywords in the title or abstract: ‘orientation’, ‘posture’, ‘proclivity’, ‘disposition’, ‘firm-level’, ‘firm behavior’, ‘innovativeness’, ‘risk-taking’, ‘proactiveness’, ‘aggressiveness’ and ‘autonomy’. Many of these keywords were also used in the previous step. This allows articles containing these highly relevant keywords to pass through the secondary filter while more general, primary keywords such as ‘intrapreneurship’ or ‘corporate entrepreneurship’ must contain a secondary keyword to move to the next stage.</p>
<p>To ensure that the selected articles were empirical, we required the presence of one of seven methodological keywords (‘data’, ‘empirical’, ‘test*’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0266242611418261">2</xref></sup> ‘statistical’, ‘finding*’, ‘result*’ and ‘evidence’) in the title or abstract. We considered all of the various journal outlets in which scholarly peer-reviewed research has been reviewed. In other words, we did not eliminate ‘single article’ journals from our list (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0266242611418261">David and Han, 2004</xref>). This enhanced the comprehensiveness of our review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0266242611418261">Evans and Benefield, 2001</xref>). To capture the breadth of EO research, it would be useful to consider all the various journals that publish scholarly peer-reviewed research.</p>
<p>We read all remaining abstracts for substantive context (i.e. discussion of EO) and empirical content (i.e. mention of statistical analysis). Next, we read all of the remaining articles in their entirety to ensure theoretical and empirical relevance. Articles were retained only if hypotheses were tested using either regression or structural equation modeling. Studies were eliminated if they solely examined relationships using correlation analysis, cluster analysis or factor analysis. We rejected all articles in which EO was used simply as one of many variables upon which sampled firms were clustered, only the psychometric properties of the EO construct were investigated, or where measurement of EO was conceptually different from prior theorizing on the concept (as an individual difference variable, for example). For reasons of practicality and the theoretical tenability of the construct, we also rejected studies in which only one dimension of EO was examined. We believe that studies that examine a single EO dimension and label it an examination of the EO construct would be inappropriate for our review: as such, we included only studies in which two or more dimensions of EO were investigated. In short, we followed a seven-step procedure to identify relevant empirical EO articles published in scholarly journals. Taken together, these studies embed a set of well-developed variables with EO in a nomological net. Thus, we believe that our methodology is suitable for obtaining a comprehensive sample for an overview of the empirical EO literature.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0266242611418261">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>For each article in our database, we recorded all variables within hypothesized EO-linkages in a relational database. Study variables were coded, whenever possible, using limited-choice data capture techniques such as dropdown boxes and check boxes to minimize the opportunity for human error. Variable names were selected based upon the manner in which they were referred to within the methods, results or theory sections of each manuscript – with the methods section being given preference over labels offered in the results (i.e. regression tables), or theory sections which at times diverged from the label given to the specific measurement instrument employed and described in the measurement section. Effort was made to ensure that variable names were coded as specifically as possible. For example, if a study investigated firm growth or firm profitability, it was specifically coded as such. However, when a study simply mentioned a generalized firm performance variable or a mixture of various ‘indicators’ of firm performance, the variable was coded as ‘firm performance (mixed)’. Thus, in a limited number of instances variable names were intentionally coded more generally to facilitate parsimony, presentation and interpretability of proceeding analyses. For example, ‘number of board directors’ was coded ‘board size’ and ‘personal network contact frequency’ was coded as an article investigating ‘top manager personal networking’. We consulted the theory and methods sections of each manuscript to ensure variable label appropriateness. Article, variable and relationship counts were performed using structured language queries (SQL) on the relational database to aggregate and report study findings.</p>

<p>There is a notable increase in the number of EO articles published over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0266242611418261">Figure 1</xref>). The first article to explore the concept of EO empirically appeared in 1983. A three-year lull followed and then in 1986, a slow trickle of EO articles began to appear in journals. We observed a sharp increase in the number of EO articles beginning in 1999, which has rapidly accelerated over the last decade. There has been a particularly noticeable increase in EO research over the last six years, with the number of published studies jumping to an average of 18.1 studies from 2005 to 2010, compared to an average of 2.7 studies in preceding years.</p>
<p>This spike indicates two possible alternative scenarios. Business research is notorious for theoretical ‘fads and fashions’, where concepts and ideas are characterized by ‘short life cycles and rapid decline’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0266242611418261">Gibson et al., 2003</xref>: 12). Under this scenario, the current popularity of EO-related research may be short-lived, as present levels of research will be unsustainable. Perhaps the faster EO is investigated, the quicker intriguing research questions will be exhausted (i.e. contribute to bringing the fad to an end), and researchers eventually may turn their attention to other research topics within the domain of entrepreneurship. In contrast, contrary to the faddish nature of research in business studies where theories quickly ‘come and go’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0266242611418261">Gibson and Tesone, 2001</xref>), EO research has persisted for more than 30 years. It is possible that the philosophy and knowledge underlying EO may be relatively enduring and sustainable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0266242611418261">Abrahamson, 1996</xref>). If this is the case, future EO scholarship may surpass, or at least maintain, its current levels –indicating that EO provides a unique and useful tool for investigating a wide range of phenomenon of interest across an expanding set of contextual conditions. Moreover, the simplicity of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0266242611418261">Covin and Slevin (1989)</xref> instrument frequently used to capture EO may have enabled it to become a point of entry into entrepreneurship research for researchers from other disciplines. The elegance of EO may help to sustain its diffusion within an ever-expanding nomological network and thereby, secure its future prominence as an influential and highly researched phenomenon.</p>
<p>Additionally, and perhaps more significantly, in only four of the twenty-six years since its inception has more EO research been published within entrepreneurship-focused (specialty) journals than in other (general) scholarly outlets of business studies. As theoretical constructs are used in areas where they fulfill particular needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0266242611418261">Baskerville, 2003</xref>), the increase in articles empirically exploring EO in general business journals indicates broad acceptance and application within the scholarly community. To provide further insight, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0266242611418261">Table 1</xref> organizes empirical research on the EO construct according to the principal topic areas of journals that have previously published in this area. To classify the journal’s topic areas, the aims and scope of each publication were examined for keywords suggestive of a dominant area of specialty or focus.</p>

<title>National cultural contexts and entrepreneurial orientation</title>
<p>The increasing globalization of business and the growing popularity of entrepreneurship worldwide has motivated researchers to examine the applicability of models originally theorized in the USA within other national cultural contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0266242611418261">Lumpkin et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0266242611418261">Lumpkin and Dess (1996)</xref> emphasize the importance of external context in shaping the influence of EO, prompting examination of the concept in other countries. In order to organize the international variety in EO literature and isolate patterns in the relative frequency (or paucity) of research in various regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0266242611418261">Thomas et al., 1994</xref>), we adopted a segmentation approach that identifies a limited number of country clusters such that differences in culture, geo-demographic factors and history across clusters are substantially greater than variations between countries within the same cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0266242611418261">Hofstede et al., 2002</xref>). Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0266242611418261">Ronen and Shenkar’s (1985)</xref> grouping of countries based on work-related values is arguably the most well known, we chose to use the more contemporary GLOBE clustering scheme, as it is based on recently collected data and includes several countries not covered elsewhere. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0266242611418261">Table 2</xref> presents a list of societal contexts in which EO research has been conducted.</p>

<p>Tang et al. noted that ‘most studies have tested EO in the United States or other developed economies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0266242611418261">2008</xref>: 233). Our research largely supports their claim. We found that more than half of all EO studies have been conducted in countries in the Anglo, Nordic Europe and Latin Europe clusters. Unlike the broader strategy literature, where the majority of empirical research has been conducted in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0266242611418261">Hitt et al., 2004</xref>), our findings indicate that a substantial body of research has examined the applicability of EO outside the US context. Nevertheless, EO remains relatively unexamined in developing and emerging market contexts: one notable exception is EO research in China. We found that, consistent with the growing importance of China in global business and economics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0266242611418261">Peng et al., 2001</xref>), China has received the most attention in the EO literature after the USA.</p>
<p>We note several important omissions in international EO research. A particularly glaring finding is the lack of EO research in Brazil, India and Russia. Given that these three countries are considered to be among the world’s most rapidly emerging major economies, it is notable that research on EO is virtually non-existent. Nadkarni and Herrmann contend that more research is needed ‘in countries that are emerging as important global players and at the same time have sociocultural contexts very different from those of the US and other developed countries’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0266242611418261">2010</xref>: 1067). We also note that there is comparatively little understanding of EO in the Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe, Middle East and Southern Asia country clusters. This is consistent with the broader management literature, where few studies have been conducted in the context of countries in these clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0266242611418261">Leung et al., 2005</xref>). Prior research has emphasized that rate and influence of EO may vary in different external contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0266242611418261">Lumpkin and Dess, 1996</xref>). By understanding the nature and impact of EO in different countries, researchers can guide managers in structuring strategies and operations in ways that better suit local conditions and avoid potential adverse consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0266242611418261">Knight, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, our findings reveal that in terms of generalizing EO research internationally, prior research is mixed. On the positive side, EO research is not just limited to the USA, with many studies conducted in other Anglo (e.g. Australia and the UK), Nordic Europe (e.g. Sweden) and Confucian Asia (e.g. China) countries. On the negative side, EO remains virtually unexamined in several strategically important countries such as Brazil, India and Russia, as well as in clusters such as the Middle East, Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa. This indicates that despite a substantial expansion in EO’s geographic reach, many countries and areas have received only minimal attention. The lack of empirical EO research in these cultural clusters provides opportunity for further exploration into the applicability of, and ability to generalize, EO research internationally. For the future, EO research should be encouraged in locations previously overlooked. In order to discourage self-perpetuating cycles of parochialism, gatekeepers of the field – editors, editorial boards and reviewers – should encourage studies beyond presently popular countries (e.g. China, Sweden and the USA). Examining EO-related phenomena in a broader array of societies will advance EO’s geographic base.</p>
<p>We now turn to empirical literature on the two primary theoretical conceptualizations of the EO construct. We begin with an extensive examination of prior scholarly research on the concept of EO as a unified conceptual entity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0266242611418261">Miller, 1983</xref>), followed by a brief overview of multidimensional EO research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0266242611418261">Lumpkin and Dess, 1996</xref>).</p>

<p>Prior studies indicate that innovativeness, risk-taking and proactiveness exhibit moderate to high correlations with one another in practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266242611418261">Covin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0266242611418261">Rauch et al., 2009</xref>).

<title>Moderators and mediators</title>
<p>An important issue in entrepreneurship research concerns when and why EO matters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0266242611418261">Lumpkin and Dess, 1996</xref>). Moderator variables speak to the issue of when specific events occur, while mediating constructs address why particular events take place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0266242611418261">Baron and Kenny, 1986</xref>). Studying the role of moderators reveals the conditions under which EO is influential. According to James and Brett, ‘a variable z is a moderator if the relationship between two (or more) other variables, say x and y, is a function of the level of z’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0266242611418261">1984</xref>: 30). Statistically, there is no difference in analyzing the moderating effect of EO on another variable, or of the other variable on EO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0266242611418261">Baron and Kenny, 1986</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0266242611418261">Figure 2</xref> summarizes the moderating variables employed in prior research on EO as a unidimensional construct.</p>

</fig>
<p>We find that the role of moderators in influencing the relationship between EO and its various organizational outcomes has been the subject of extensive research. Two factors explain the considerable attention given to moderating variables. First, EO may be a necessary, but insufficient, condition for superior outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0266242611418261">Stam and Elfring, 2008</xref>). Second, in the absence of an appropriate context, EO may be an incredibly wasteful strategic posture as it requires a substantial investment of resources to develop and maintain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0266242611418261">Covin and Slevin, 1991</xref>). Although many studies demonstrate that EO is beneficial (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0266242611418261">Rauch et al., 2009</xref>), some find otherwise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0266242611418261">Matsuno et al., 2002</xref>). Arguments and empirical findings that EO is not universally applicable direct the research focus to contingent factors. Given the practical significance of understanding how to enhance EO’s performance potential, it is not surprising that researchers have adopted a contingency perspective to identify the conditions under which EO will be more useful.</p>
<p>In terms of categorizing moderator variables, we find that externally focused variables are commonly thought to affect EO’s influence. These include environmental variables (e.g. dynamism and hostility) as well as societal cultural variables (e.g. individualism and uncertainty avoidance). In addition, inter-firm networking variables that capture efforts to establish linkages with external actors have received considerable attention. As EO represents a strategic orientation, it is not surprising that other strategic variables (e.g. market orientation) have been examined as moderators. However, contrary to the attention given to external and strategic variables, few studies have examined the moderating role of factors that reside within the organization. We found that apart from a few organizational factors such as structural organicity, knowledge-based resources, managerial charisma and team cohesiveness, internal constructs facilitating or impeding the application of EO remain largely unexplored. Yet, it has been observed that for firms to benefit from EO, managers must properly manage entrepreneurial decisions and acts within their organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266242611418261">Covin et al., 2006</xref>). It would appear that researchers have only begun to scratch the surface regarding the understanding of interactive moderating effects in the EO literature, and most notably the role of internal factors. Additionally, important organizational characteristics such as firm age and size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0266242611418261">Hamilton, 2011</xref>) appear to have received little attention as moderating influences within prior EO research. Further, the literature has been agnostic towards the possible effects of differences in the manifestation of EO across firm levels, business units and over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0266242611418261">Wales et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast with moderator analysis, which speaks to the timing of a particular relationship’s statistical importance, mediation identifies why a specific relationship is possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0266242611418261">Baron and Kenny, 1986</xref>). Mediators help unravel the causal chain between two related variables. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0266242611418261">Figure 3</xref> summarizes variables that have been explored as possible mediating mechanisms through which EO is translated into outcomes. It is immediately obvious from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0266242611418261">Figure 3</xref> that mediating variables have received considerably less attention than moderator variables in the EO literature. This is despite the fact that entrepreneurship researchers, implicitly and explicitly, acknowledge the need to elucidate the causal process through which EO affects outcomes by decomposing the relationship into its constituent parts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0266242611418261">Li et al., 2009</xref>). In this vein, entrepreneurship research has advocated the usefulness of mediation tests in unearthing the mechanisms through which EO influences specific outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0266242611418261">Edelman et al., 2005</xref>). We found that in attempting to explain the causal path through which EO is actualized into outcomes, researchers usually turn to knowledge-based variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0266242611418261">Eisenhardt and Santos, 2002</xref>) such as organizational learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0266242611418261">Wang, 2008</xref>). We also found that support for tests of mediations varied from non-supported (for information acquisition) to very high (for organizational learning). As a whole, our analysis of mediators in the EO literature reveals little understanding of the causal mechanisms of how or why EO affects other variables in the nomological net.</p>

<p>The search for mediators is informed by classic models in which inputs lead to processes that in turn lead to outcomes (the input–processes–output or I–P–O model) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0266242611418261">Ilgen et al., 2005</xref>). These classical models are well known to organizational researchers and the tools to explore mediation relationships are readily available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0266242611418261">MacKinnon et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, mediation models have received considerably more attention in the broader strategic management discipline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0266242611418261">Hitt et al., 2004</xref>). Given the pivotal role of mediators in theoretically elaborating the effects of EO, it is somewhat surprising that few researchers have undertaken empirical tests to identify variables that intervene in EO–outcome relationships. As most research in entrepreneurship examines naturally occurring phenomena in non-experimental settings, mediation models are arguably the only way to establish causal relationships between EO and its outcomes, and thus deserving of a more central role in future research.</p>

<title>Antecedents and consequences</title>
<p>Over the past three decades, researchers have investigated several antecedents and consequences of EO in order to better understand its role in organizations. Examining antecedent variables illuminates the genesis of the construct. Put simply, entrepreneurship researchers are often interested in studying EO as a dependent variable so that they can clarify why certain companies are entrepreneurial and others are not. Our study reveals that substantial research has focused on aspects of the CEO and top management team, as well as the influence of various alternative strategic orientations, strategic processes and environmental considerations. In addition, leadership, governance, human resource management and organizational resources have received some – albeit limited – attention in the literature.</p>
<p>Just as it is necessary to examine ‘upstream’ variables that influence EO, it is important also to identify ‘downstream’ variables affected by EO. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0266242611418261">Figure 5</xref> presents a list of dependent variables used to study the EO phenomenon.</p>

</fig>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0266242611418261">Rauch et al. (2009)</xref>, we note that several studies examined performance measures as the dependent variable. Organizational researchers have argued for distinguishing between the effectiveness and efficiency measures of firm performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0266242611418261">Auh and Menguc, 2005</xref>). We found that both efficiency indicators (profitability and return on assets) and effectiveness indicators (firm growth and market share growth) have been frequently studied. However, the most popular dependent variable in past research combines elements of different performance indicators such as growth and profitability. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0266242611418261">Figure 5</xref> elucidates, other ‘downstream’ variables have been examined as well. Popular non-performance measures include marketing orientation, innovativeness, employee commitment, environmental uncertainty and various measures of organizational learning. Although firms are often compared in terms of performance, they typically have multiple goals and objectives, many of which are not reflected in bottom-line performance measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0266242611418261">March and Sutton, 1997</xref>). For example, recent case-based research suggests that EO may reduce tendencies toward inertia within family firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0266242611418261">Chirico and Nordqvist, 2010</xref>). Attention to non-performance measures in the EO literature reflects the idea that EO is not simply an instrumental variable related to superior performance; instead, EO may be associated with numerous and varied aspects of a firm’s functioning, opening the door for a wide variety of future research directions.</p>

<sec id="section12-0266242611418261">
<title>Multidimensional research on entrepreneurial orientation</title>
<p>We searched for studies examining EO characteristics: namely, autonomy, competitive aggressiveness, innovativeness, proactiveness and risk-taking, as separate behavioral dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0266242611418261">Lumpkin and Dess, 1996</xref>). This approach evaluates EO using a predetermined set of attributes or characteristics common to firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0266242611418261">Hughes and Morgan, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0266242611418261">Lumpkin and Dess (1996)</xref> argue that these five characteristics vary independently of each other because firms can be high on some dimensions and low on others. Since in the business literature these characteristics are often examined separately and without reference to EO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0266242611418261">Cahill, 1996</xref>), we focused on studies that involved more than one EO dimension and explored the dimensions separately. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0266242611418261">Table 4</xref> shows the number of articles exploring each dimension of EO in a multidimensional context.</p>

<p>Interestingly, innovativeness, risk-taking and proactiveness are still the predominant dimensions investigated. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0266242611418261">Figure 6</xref> shows the evolution in the number of studies per annum adopting a multidimensional view (relative to the more traditional unidimensional approach). Clearly, research adopting a multidimensional conceptualization of EO has been increasing in recent years, indicating greater acceptance of the notion that EO dimensions may manifest unique contributions to firm outcomes. Further, it is notable that at least six studies simultaneously have explored both unidimensional and multidimensional conceptualizations, indicating the potential for differing perspectives and underlying latent constructs to co-exist in practice, which perhaps may serve ultimately to strengthen the findings of future studies by providing deeper insight into the nature of observed relationships.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of the present research was to systematically conduct a qualitative review of the EO literature. We sought to document this substantial and growing literature stream and to provide a summary of prior research areas. Specifically, we examine how EO has been studied and elucidate specific foci of previous investigations into the phenomenon. We find that researchers often adopt a unidimensional view of EO, although use of the multidimensional perspective has increased in recent years. We found notable biases and inconsistencies among moderator, mediator, antecedent and dependent variable selection in the EO literature. In this section, we discuss the research implications and practical usefulness of the study findings.</p>
<sec id="section14-0266242611418261">
<title>Research implications and directions</title>
<p>Overall, our assessment of the extant EO literature indicates significant progress towards understanding the concept of EO and expanding knowledge of the nomological network in which the phenomenon is manifest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0266242611418261">Cronbach and Meehl, 1955</xref>). Clearly, EO research is being published in a wide variety of journal outlets, indicating an increasing interest in the concept among a wide group of researchers. Although the use of EO in articles published in entrepreneurship-focused journals has steadied over the last few years, the number of EO articles published in non-entrepreneurship journals has increased over the same time. Despite these developments, key knowledge gaps remain, suggesting pertinent avenues for future research.</p>
<sec id="section15-0266242611418261">
<title>Antecedents of EO</title>
<p>Our research suggests that although several variables have been examined as antecedents of EO, the origins of EO as an organizational phenomenon remain unclear: in other words, there is little understanding of the genesis of EO. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0266242611418261">Wiklund and Shepherd (2003)</xref> urged researchers to study EO as a dependent variable, in order to understand better its emergence and development. We found that their directive has been heeded, as our review revealed a great deal of investigation into the antecedents of EO, with organizational, environmental and top manager characteristics being the dominant areas of investigation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0266242611418261">Figure 4</xref>). Yet, entrepreneurship arises from social origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0266242611418261">Korsgaard, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0266242611418261">Thorton et al., 2011</xref>) and sociocultural antecedents remain underexplored. We encourage researchers to continue to advance theoretically grounded frameworks, particularly within relatively less explored areas such as leadership, networking and organizational learning, in order to link a small set of well-developed variables in explaining and predicting EO <italic>ex-ante</italic>.</p>
<p>Our literature review also revealed that despite having been examined in several countries, EO remains virtually unexamined in several strategically important countries such as Brazil, India and Russia, as well as in several other country clusters (e.g. Middle East, Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa). Both cultural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0266242611418261">Hofstede et al., 2002</xref>) and institutional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0266242611418261">Scott, 1995</xref>) theories emphasize the influence of unique country-specific factors in shaping organizations’ strategic posture and processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0266242611418261">Chiles et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, future researchers would do well not to only examine, but also compare, EO relationships within various countries previously overlooked in order to broaden the research agenda. For example, how do the regulatory, cognitive and normative components of the institutional environment within or across specific countries influence EO? Expanding the scope of EO research to specific national contexts is important as perceptions and applications of EO may vary by country, and different countries have varying interpretations of what it means to be entrepreneurial.</p>

<sec id="section16-0266242611418261">
<title>Contextualizing the influence of EO</title>
<p>The notion that the relationship between EO and performance is complex has led researchers to examine contingent relationships, exploring the impact of moderating variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0266242611418261">Rauch et al., 2009</xref>). Contingency approaches look more deeply into organizational phenomena to derive situational-specific theories and prescriptions for management research and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0266242611418261">Donaldson, 2001</xref>). Our review provides a comprehensive list of moderating factors examined in the EO literature, and notes a particularly limited amount of research into internal organizational moderators (although external and strategic variables have been investigated more deeply).</p>
<p>Although not directly captured in our analyses, we find one anecdotal observation worthy of discussion: as yet, research has not positioned contingency variables in terms of their comparative intervening effect on EO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266242611418261">Hambrick and Lei, 1985</xref>). In other words, researchers have not explicitly weighed internal, external and strategic contingency variables against each other to determine their relative influence on EO. Prioritizing contingency variables according to the strength of their impact on EO would help to determine their relative practical significance as influential variables. Such studies may highlight further where research priorities should lie and steer theoretical enquiry to the most potentially productive areas.</p>
<p>In addition, to speculate further, EO scholarship may benefit from distinguishing between three types of interaction between the predictor and contextual variables – enhancing relationships, antagonistic relationships and buffering relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0266242611418261">Frazier et al., 2004</xref>) – within future moderation research. Specifically, research on moderators that enhance the effect of EO (i.e. that influence outcomes in the same direction as the independent effect of EO) informs theories of organizational growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0266242611418261">Armstrong and Shimizu, 2007</xref>). Conversely, research on antagonistic and buffer moderators that weaken EO can contribute to theories of organizational decline. Such fine-grained research on interactive effects would help to identify EO’s boundary conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0266242611418261">Armstrong and Shimizu, 2007</xref>) and better inform managers about specific factors that have beneficial or adverse effects in particular situations.</p>
<p>We also encourage future EO scholars to pay greater attention to issues of practitioner relevance when examining contingency relationships. Our analyses suggest that many of the contextual factors investigated in the EO literature are not readily amenable to managerial influence. For example, managers of firms operating in the ‘wrong’ types of environments (such as benign industries), most likely will be unable to fundamentally alter their firms’ external contexts to create more productive EO–environmental alignments. Other contextual factors may be extremely time-consuming or difficult for managers to change. For example, managers who attempt to structure their firm more organically must contend with resistance based in organizational momentum. Taken together, our study suggests that EO researchers often investigate contextual factors that are of questionable or limited value to practitioners.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0266242611418261">
<title>Explicating EO’s causal mechanisms</title>
<p>Our study reveals that EO researchers have begun to heed the advice that advancing EO scholarship depends on elucidating the causal process through which EO is able to influence specific outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0266242611418261">Edelman et al., 2005</xref>). In this vein, researchers have argued that EO affects outcomes through organizational learning, knowledge-based resources and innovation. While these studies begin to address how or why EO contributes to particular outcomes, they do not go far enough in unearthing the underlying generative mechanisms. Notably, there has been little attention to the mediating role of various forms of new entry in the EO literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0266242611418261">Lumpkin and Dess, 1996</xref>). More broadly, although past EO research has investigated the mediating role of both internal processes (e.g. organizational learning) and emergent states (e.g. possession of knowledge based resources), isolating conceptually pure process or state variables will help us to understand better the transformation of EO into specific outcomes. To speculate, future research is likely to benefit from explicit consideration of the differences between processes and emergent states when empirically examining mediating relationships in the EO literature.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0266242611418261">
<title>Dimensionality of EO</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266242611418261">Covin et al. (2006)</xref> assert that one of the most important choices that EO researchers must make is that of EO dimensionality. Our review showed that most studies have conceptualized EO as a latent construct comprised of interrelated facets (unidimensionally), as opposed to an idiosyncratic configuration of multiple dimensions that describe the phenomenon (multidimensionally). Although we did not find evidence to support the claim that ‘studies have ignored an analysis of EO dimensions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0266242611418261">Hughes and Morgan, 2007</xref>: 652), we note that substantial opportunities exist for considerable advancement in understanding the individual influence of dimensions of EO. We suggest two avenues for future research in this regard. First, researchers could examine the relative impact and interactive influence to examine which dimensions benefit, suppress or have no effect on specific outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0266242611418261">Short et al., 2009</xref>). Second, researchers could examine the relationships between the EO dimensions to explore whether some dimensions influence others when investigating EO as a multidimensional phenomenon. Ultimately, we agree that the choice between unidimensional versus multidimensional conceptualizations should be driven by the research question being investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0266242611418261">Covin and Wales, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266242611418261">Covin et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In our overview of the EO literature, we answer the call for periodic enquiries into the status of ideas – as in the question of the state of EO research – to facilitate scientific progress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0266242611418261">Priem and Butler, 2001</xref>). Using a well-defined, multi-stage methodology, we analyzed prior empirical EO studies published in a broad set of journals. It is our hope that the review and synthesis of the EO literature reported in this study engenders something new by bringing together many independent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0266242611418261">Chow, 1987</xref>). The present research highlights numerous and varied fertile areas for further research. We do not expect our study to be considered as a final word on empirical EO research; rather, the present research seeks to highlight the cumulative achievements of the extant EO literature and to encourage future empirical studies in this area.</p>
<sec id="section20-0266242611418261">
<title>Limitations of the study</title>
<p>Notwithstanding the conceptual insights revealed, as with all systematic reviews, our findings must be interpreted in light of certain limitations. First, our review focused on studies using EO. Consequently, our research excluded other constructs that may be relevant to firm-level entrepreneurial activity such as corporate entrepreneurship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0266242611418261">Sadler-Smith et al., 2003</xref>) and small business orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0266242611418261">Runyan et al., 2008</xref>). Second, while we made every effort to be comprehensive in compiling the sample of EO articles for this study, we may have inadvertently overlooked relevant articles. This is especially possible when articles were not properly indexed or published in journals that do not participate in the databases we searched. Third, we limited the selection to peer-reviewed journal articles and thus may have introduced a degree of ‘publication bias’, given that the journals tend to receive and accept only articles reporting significant results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0266242611418261">Begg and Berlin, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>However, these limitations should not detract from our overarching conclusion that several knowledge gaps remain regarding the development and implementation of EO and its relationships with other variables, suggesting avenues for future research. Scholars are reminded that ‘the questions we ask often prevent us from asking other questions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0266242611418261">Sarasvathy, 1999</xref>: 707). We believe that cognizance of areas already investigated will help future EO studies formulate new questions that advance scholarly understanding of firm-level entrepreneurship. Moreover, for future EO research to continue to produce significant strides, researchers will need to grapple more deeply with questions of why, when and how EO is useful to the firm. Reformulating key questions and seeking answers requires meaningful interaction between theoretical refinement and future empirical examination. We hope that the research opportunities unearthed in the present study will stimulate further productive discussion on the EO concept.</p>
