<abstract>
<p>Despite most teenage smokers wanting to quit, their likelihood of success resembles that of flipping a coin. Evidence-based cessation programs, like the American Lung Association’s Not-On-Tobacco (N-O-T) program, are effective. Evaluation of program dissemination is critical. This study uses the RE-AIM framework to evaluate the N-O-T program in West Virginia from 2000 to 2005. RE-AIM components consisted of four measures. Regional dissemination was measured using comparative differences between Regional Educational Service Agency regions (RESAs). Significant associations were found between RESAs for numerous characteristics. Among the RE-AIM components, two measures of Implementation were significantly different between RESAs. Variability between RESAs provided valuable descriptive evidence of N-O-T program dissemination in West Virginia. Therefore, geographical tailoring grounded in community-based participatory research could increase the N-O-T program’s overall dissemination.</p>

<p>Despite 65% of daily teen smokers wanting to quit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524839910386183">Lamkin, Davis, &amp; Kamen, 1998</xref>), most are unable to quit on their own. A 4-year study found smokers between the ages of 12 and 19 years had a successful quit rate of 15.6%, or approximately 4% per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1524839910386183">Zhu, Sun, Billings, Choi, &amp; Malarcher, 1999</xref>). Comparatively, a current estimate of failed cessation rates among adolescent smokers is 43% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839910386183">CDC, 2006</xref>), with approximately 58% of adolescent smokers attempting at least one quit attempt in the previous year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839910386183">CDC, 2004</xref>). With 4,000 youths initiating cigarette smoking daily, it is critical to identify and disseminate evidence-based youth smoking cessation programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524839910386183">Horn et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Several reviews report that there is now sufficient evidence to recommend behaviorally-based programs for helping youths quit smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839910386183">Curry, Mermelstein, &amp; Sporer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839910386183">Grimshaw &amp; Stanton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524839910386183">Sussman &amp; Sun, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1524839910386183">Sussman, Sun, &amp; Dent, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1524839910386183">Sussman et al. (2006)</xref> found 48 experimental and quasi-experimental studies published between 1970 and 2003 for a meta-analysis. A 2.9% absolute advantage in quitting over control conditions was found, and an increased likelihood of quitting of 46%. Only two federally recognized, evidence-based behavioral programs—Project EX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524839910386183">Sussman, Dent, &amp; Lichtman, 2001</xref>) and the American Lung Association’s (ALA) Not-On-Tobacco (N-O-T) Program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839910386183">Dino, Horn, Goldcamp, Fernandes, et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839910386183">Horn, Dino, Kalsekar, &amp; Mody, 2005</xref>)—were reported. The Cochrane Collaboration’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839910386183">Grimshaw &amp; Stanton, 2006</xref>) meta-analysis included youth cessation intervention studies used worldwide. Stringent inclusion criteria resulted in 15 studies for review. The Cochrane meta-analysis reported that tobacco cessation treatment significantly increased the likelihood of cessation over control conditions. This review identified N-O-T as the only program of promise based on the number and outcome of evaluation studies.</p>
<p>The efficacy and effectiveness of a teen smoking cessation intervention are necessary but not sufficient conditions determining a program’s suitability for widespread dissemination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839910386183">Glasgow, Lichtenstein, &amp; Marcus, 2003</xref>). Other factors include feasibility, relevance, acceptability, adaptability, and economic cost. The RE-AIM framework (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839910386183">Glasgow et al., 2003</xref>) directs intervention development with a high degree of translatability, and evaluating effectiveness. RE-AIM includes: Intervention <italic>R</italic>each, <italic>E</italic>fficacy/Effectiveness, <italic>A</italic>doption, <italic>I</italic>mplementation, and <italic>M</italic>aintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839910386183">Glasgow, Vogt, &amp; Boles, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1524839910386183">RE-AIM, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The N-O-T program, an evidence-based, theory-driven teen smoking cessation program, was developed and evaluated consistent with the RE-AIM framework. ALA adopted N-O-T and facilitates national program training, marketing, dissemination, and implementation. A decade of research indicates N-O-T is cost-effective, adoptable, and suitable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839910386183">Dino, Horn, Abdulkadri, Kalsekar, &amp; Branstetter, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839910386183">Horn et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524839910386183">Joffe et al., 2009</xref>). N-O-T studies between 1998 and 2003 showed end-of-program intent-to-treat quit rates between 15% and 19% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839910386183">Horn et al., 2005</xref>), among the highest reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524839910386183">Sussman et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, N-O-T is the most widely disseminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839910386183">Curry, Sporer, Pugach, Campbell, &amp; Emery, 2007</xref>) teen smoking cessation program in the nation.</p>
<p>N-O-T has been evaluated consistent with RE-AIM. <italic>Reach</italic> was assessed by tracking recruitment strategy effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1524839910386183">Massey et al., 2003</xref>) and monitoring participant characteristics across sites and states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839910386183">Horn et al., 2005</xref>). This information informed national and local ALA training. <italic>Effectiveness</italic> evaluation included assessing multiple outcome measures (i.e. reduction of and/or quitting smoking, stage of change, and nicotine dependence) across states and sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839910386183">Dino, Kamal, Horn, Kalsekar, &amp; Fernandes, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839910386183">Horn et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524839910386183">Horn, Fernandes, Dino, Massey, &amp; Kalsekar, 2003</xref>). Results related to program effectiveness were used to inform a 2008 program revision and guide national research agendas. <italic>Adoption</italic> included assessment of facilitators and program adoption barriers. Findings were used in the national training and program revision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839910386183">Horn &amp; Dino, 2009</xref>). We assessed <italic>Implementation</italic> using cost-effectiveness data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839910386183">Dino et al., 2008</xref>) and an ongoing facilitator process evaluation. Finally, <italic>Maintenance</italic> was explored by monitoring program adoption over time by state and site and examination of the longer term (6 months or more) effects of N-O-T on smoking cessation and reduction outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839910386183">Dino, Horn, Goldcamp, Fernandes, et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839910386183">Horn &amp; Dino, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524839910386183">Horn, Dino, Kalsekar, &amp; Fernandes, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The current study uses the RE-AIM framework to evaluate N-O-T at the state level. First, we assessed the public health impact of N-O-T in West Virginia from 2000 to 2005. Second, we examined the impact of place by assessing the comparative public health impacts of N-O-T among Regional Educational Service Agency regions (RESAs), institutionalized service regions in West Virginia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1524839910386183">West Virginia Board of Education, 2010</xref>). These RESAs provided an understanding of the geographical contexts that effect the dissemination of the N-O-T program in West Virginia. The use of the RE-AIM framework provides a more comprehensive program assessment than the more common efficacy evaluation.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>This evaluation is a function of nonresearch, that is, real-world N-O-T effectiveness evaluation from 2000 to 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1524839910386183">T2R2, 2008</xref>). In West Virginia, from 2000 to 2005, approximately 1,500 middle school and high school students participated in N-O-T programs. Data were obtained from the American Lung Association of West Virginia (ALA-WV) as routinely collected from N-O-T facilitators using a standardized N-O-T evaluation protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1524839910386183">Prevention Research Center of West Virginia University, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Once entered into a database, participants were excluded if they (a) participated in N-O-T for educational rather than intervention purposes (e.g., health classes), (b) were nonsmokers, and/or (c) were smokeless tobacco users only. Participants were also excluded if they were missing county and school identifiers. These criteria resulted in a final sample of 959 participants. This study was approved as exempt by the Institutional Review Board at West Virginia University.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1524839910386183">
<title>Instruments</title>
<p>Data collection instruments were consistent with the three standard evaluation instruments found in the N-O-T curriculum. These included the Individual Information Form (e.g., demographic information), About Me 1Form (e.g., baseline information about smoking habits), and About Me 2 Form (e.g., follow-up information about smoking habits). Occasionally, schools using N-O-T make modifications to the tools to better meet their needs. To ensure consistency, we created a set of common variables for similar items, but modified some items, from these instruments for inclusion into the final database.

<p>The Reach component measures evaluating the N-O-T program across RESAs included total number of participants, percentage of first-time participants, percentage of female participants, and percentage of minority participants.</p>
<p>Assessment of Effectiveness was based on the participants’ smoking outcome, defined as favorable change or quit rate at the end of the program (3 months postbaseline). The first two Effectiveness measures, reduction rates and favorable change, were calculated for participants who did not quit. Favorable change measured the percentage of individuals who quit or reduced smoking any amount below the baseline rate of smoking. Reduction rates were calculated only among continuing smokers.</p>
<p>Quit rates were defined by two methods: compliant subsample (CSS) and intent-to-treat (ITT) methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839910386183">Dino, Horn, Goldcamp, Fernandes, et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839910386183">Dino, Horn, Goldcamp, Kemp-Rye, et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839910386183">Dino, Horn, Goldcamp, Maniar, et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1524839910386183">Sussman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524839910386183">Sussman et al., 2001</xref>).

In contrast, CSS analysis assumes that with appropriate attrition analysis, participants’ available postprogram data are representative of the total sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839910386183">Little, 1993</xref>). Both analyses have been used in past N-O-T research although with no systematic or consistent differences by age, gender, daily smoking, and other key variables between completers and noncompleters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839910386183">Dino, Horn, Goldcamp, Maniar, et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Participants were used as the unit of analysis in calculating quit rates for RESAs. Quit was defined by a self-reported <italic>no</italic> response to the question “Are you still smoking?” in the About Me 2 Form, which assumes at least 24-hr abstinence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839910386183">Horn &amp; Dino, 2009</xref>). Continuous days of abstinence were also reported. The CSS quit rate uses a population denominator composed from participants completing baseline (About Me 1 Form) and postprogram (About Me 2 Form) assessments, whereas the population denominator of ITT was constructed from the total number of participants at baseline.</p>
<p>Measures of Adoption address N-O-T program offerings and ALA-WV-trained N-O-T facilitators. Adoption measures included average number of N-O-T offerings annually; average number of participants per N-O-T program offering; average number of ALA-WV-trained N-O-T program facilitators annually; and percentage of female ALA-WV-trained N-O-T program facilitators. The N-O-T program Offering and Facilitator Registration Form databases provided these data.</p>
<p>Implementation included individual- and program-level measures. Annual retention rate (individual level) refers to the percentage of individual adherence to the program requirements (e.g., completion and follow-through of the program). Participant adherence was measured by participants’ completion of baseline (About Me 1 Form) and postprogram (About Me 2 Form) evaluations. The final individual-level measure was percentage of ALA-WV-trained N-O-T program facilitators who actually offered the program. There were two program-level measures: ratio of N-O-T program offerings per active ALA-WV-trained N-O-T program facilitators and the percentage of counties housing the N-O-T program.</p>
<p>We assessed Maintenance using four measurements derived from the difference between the last 2 years of the study period. The first measurement analyzed changes in the percentage of all participants who had never previously participated in the N-O-T program. The second measure analyzed changes in quit rates (ITT). The third measure examined changes in the number of N-O-T offerings. The final measure referred to changes in the number of ALA-WV-trained N-O-T program facilitators.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>This study used N-O-T program data collected from 2000 to 2005. Data were analyzed using SPSS, version 16. A random 40% error check was conducted to ensure data entry accuracy. Analytic techniques were used to account for missing data, and the study set entry criteria for participants with missing data. Some participant forms had missing or incomplete information, especially data related to grade; missing data is not uncommon with evaluation data collected under typical field conditions. Specifically, correlation analyses were used to investigate missing values for grade. Pearson’s correlation between age and grade was found to be .851 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). A strong correlation between these two variables supports the use of age to calculate missing grade and of grade to compute missing age.</p>
<p>Participant data were then assigned to one of eight RESAs based on county and school. We assessed regional performance by conducting descriptive analyses for demographics, smoking history, and psychosocial factors and by evaluating RE-AIM component measures across RESAs.</p>
<p>To examine variability in the regional RE-AIM measures, we calculated the average, lowest, and highest regional values for baseline characteristics and RE-AIM component measures. Pearson’s chi-square and analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were used to compare RESAs. We used Bonferroni correction to adjust for multiple comparisons.</p>
<p>Each RE-AIM composite score was constructed from four measures. As suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839910386183">Glasgow et al. (1999)</xref>, measures were converted to normalized <italic>z</italic> scores for easier comparison. Then, based on the <italic>z</italic> score for each measurement, the study obtained an average <italic>z</italic> score for each RE-AIM component. RESA performance was then assessed using a composite <italic>z</italic> score, constructed by summing across each region’s RE-AIM component <italic>z</italic> scores. The highest and lowest RESA composite <italic>z</italic> scores were then plotted for comparative analysis.</p>

<title>Baseline Characteristics</title>
<p>The average age across the RESAs was 15.8 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.4). Approximately 53% of the sample was female and more than 90% were white. Typically, participants smoked 14.4 (<italic>SD</italic> = 13.2) cigarettes per weekday and 20.3 (<italic>SD</italic> = 20.1) cigarettes per weekend day. The mean age participants first tried smoking was 10.7 (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.8), and approximately 79% of participants tried to quit. Participants observed smoking more often among friends (98.4%) than parents (78.5%) and siblings (60%). Participants’ intervention readiness measures of motivation to quit was 3.1 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.1), confidence to quit was 3.0 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.1), and stage of change was 2.7 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.3) across RESAs. There were significant differences (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) among RESAs including age, number of cigarettes smoked per weekday and weekend day, age first tried smoking, parents smoking, motivation to quit, and stage of change. Post hoc analysis of baseline characteristics after Bonferroni adjustment found significant difference(s) between pair(s) of RESAs for all variables except for number of cigarettes smoked per weekend day.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We applied the RE-AIM framework to a research-tested, nationally available teen smoking cessation program (N-O-T) as implemented across West Virginia between 2000 and 2005. RE-AIM is a valuable tool for guiding program evaluation and dissemination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839910386183">Glasgow et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524839910386183">Klesges, Estabrooks, Dzewaltowski, Bull, &amp; Glasgow, 2005</xref>). Each RE-AIM component illustrated unique characteristics for the various regions of West Virginia, each affecting program adoption and implementation. To our knowledge, this is the first published examination of RE-AIM in this context.</p>
<p>Reach findings revealed that N-O-T reached the intended audience of daily adolescent smokers within the 14- to 19-year age range across West Virginia. Important differences were found in teens’ social and familial contexts (i.e., parental smoking was found to be significantly different between RESAs).</p>
<p>Regional enrollments fluctuated over time yet statewide enrollment increased each year. Calculating absolute Reach as recommended by the RE-AIM reach calculator (total teen smokers enrolled per RESA/total possible teen smokers per RESA) is difficult because the total number of possible smokers per RESA is extremely limited (e.g., we can only estimate total possible teen smokers). Available youth smoking data for 2000, 2002, and 2005 reveal an average West Virginia youth smoking prevalence rate of 33.3% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1524839910386183">West Virginia Bureau of Public Health, 2007</xref>). Therefore, we estimate that N-O-T reaches &lt;1% of West Virginia’s teen smokers. This is clearly unacceptable program Reach. Identifying unique characteristics of N-O-T participants in each RESA may serve as a guide to future recruitment or program content adaptations.</p>
<p>Overall, about 20% of West Virginia N-O-T participants reported quitting smoking at 3 months postbaseline; this is consistent with national program effectiveness data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839910386183">Horn et al., 2005</xref>). Effectiveness data revealed variations in quit and reduction rates by year and region. Nonetheless, N-O-T quit rates showed a positive upward trend for five of eight regions. This finding supports future examination of regional factors that may influence program Effectiveness. Importantly, this finding begs the question “What conditions lead to higher program quit rates in West Virginia?” Identification of factors in regions with higher quit rates may guide program improvement across the state.</p>
<p>Adoption indicators support more N-O-T facilitator training and continued program use. From 2000 to 2005, a total of 664 N-O-T facilitators were trained in West Virginia, with an average of 14 facilitators trained annually per RESA. Future research is needed to determine the optimal number of new facilitators per year. The number of N-O-T offerings increased over the years, suggesting sustained interest in N-O-T. However, the Reach data strongly supports increased dissemination efforts statewide.</p>
<p>The RE-AIM assessment framework helps to identify areas in the state most needing improvement. Our data minimally informed Implementation issues, particularly related to facilitator adherence to the N-O-T curriculum. Of note, sometimes facilitators modified evaluation forms that constrained use of a common set of variables. Major discrepancies were found between the number of total trained facilitators and those actively offering the N-O-T program. Although 664 total facilitators were trained from 2000 to 2005, only 96 facilitators actively offered the N-O-T program during this period, with facilitator distribution across RESAs being variable. Nonetheless, inconsistencies between number of facilitators trained and numbers using the program, additional efforts are needed to increase facilitator Implementation. A significant difference was found in retention rates for only 1 of the 28 comparative pairs (e.g., lowest-value RESA vs. highest-value RESA). Therefore, regional implementation issues should be addressed in depth to more closely examine program fidelity across regions.</p>
<p>Finally, program Maintenance examined progress from 2004 thorough 2005. Selected measures represent how well each RESA region carried out the N-O-T program. Although more participants quit smoking, less youth smokers participated in the N-O-T program for the first time. In addition, RESAs trained more N-O-T facilitators but not all new facilitators offered N-O-T during the last 2 years of the study.</p>
<p>Plotting the lowest and highest RESA <italic>z</italic> score values for each component composite score can depict strengths and weaknesses of each region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839910386183">Farris, Will, Khavjou, &amp; Finkelstein, 2007</xref>). The highest RESA had higher composite scores for Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, and Implementation of N-O-T dissemination; however, Maintenance of the N-O-T program during the last 2 years of the study was higher in the lowest RESA.</p>
<p>A few limitations warrant discussion in this study. First, response bias is of concern. N-O-T participation is voluntary; therefore, the sample may reflect teen smokers who are moderately motivated to quit. Second, self-reported data may overestimate quit rates; however, previous studies have shown that self-report and biochemically valid quit rates are independently consistent, with 81% to 96% sensitivity and 77% to 95% specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524839910386183">Kentala, Utrainen, Pahkala, &amp; Mattila, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>To enhance data quality, N-O-T uses standardized evaluation procedures, trained facilitators. Furthermore, participant surveys are manually reviewed to eliminate errors, inaccuracies, and unreliable data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839910386183">Horn et al., 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In keeping with Glasgow et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1524839910386183">RE-AIM, 2010</xref>), the RE-AIM framework informed the “robustness, translatability, and public health impact” of the 2000-2005 West Virginia N-O-T program. N-O-T demonstrated respectable effectiveness and low to moderate levels of maintenance. Despite reaching the intended audience, the absolute reach was alarmingly low. This may be partially due to lack of Implementation among trained facilitators. Without increased program offerings, Reach is limited. Overall program dissemination was fruitful. However, limitations effecting regional dissemination were identified and examined providing information that would have been otherwise overlooked.</p>
