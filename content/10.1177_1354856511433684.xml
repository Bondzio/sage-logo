<abstract>
<p>This article aims to expand the critical frameworks by which online social networking can be contextualised and understood within the broader cultural practices of identity and selfhood. Utilising Judith Butler’s theories of performative identity, it is argued that the use of social networking sites are performative acts in and of themselves. Two facets of social networking are examined from theoretical and critical perspectives: (1) the use of social networking profiles (Info pages, taste selections, biographies) as a tool for performing, developing and stabilising identity as a narrative in line with cultural demands for coherence, intelligibility and recognition; (2) identity performances that occur through relationality among online friends through list maintenance and communication (wall posts, tagging, commentary), and how identity is reconfigured within a network morphology. Finally, the article aims to open discussion around the broad cultural practices and implications of online social networking by developing some theoretical approaches to understanding the incompatibilities between these two facets which compete and risk the ‘undoing’ of online identity coherence. Within the framework of the growing use of social networking sites as one area in which our selfhood and subjectivity are performed, this incompatibility and undoing has both risks and benefits for future the cultural production of identity.</p>

<p>Judith Butler’s theories of identity performativity have enormous capacity to further our understanding of how the multiple functions of social networking sites such as Facebook and MySpace are utilised in the construction and playing out of identity, subjectivity and selfhood in both online and offline contexts. Social networking sites have been investigated and discussed by researchers, journalists and public commentators. This includes seeing online social networking as a site for the sharing of personal experiences among friends, whether known or strangers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1354856511433684">Ellison et al., 2007</xref>: 1143); as a site for the articulation of one’s identity-based interests through the construction of taste statements which act as identifications with objects and with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1354856511433684">Liu, 2008</xref>: 253); as a site for relationship maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1354856511433684">Hoadley et al., 2010</xref>: 52) and connecting unfamiliar people with one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1354856511433684">Hoadley et al., 2010</xref>: 53); as a networked space for the expression or representation of pre-existing and salient aspects of users’ identities for others to view, interpret and engage with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354856511433684">boyd, 2008</xref>); as a space for youth to engage with other younger persons outside of the physical world’s constraints and parental surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354856511433684">boyd, 2008</xref>: 18); as a site for the expression and/or self-regulation of narcissistic personalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1354856511433684">Buffardi and Campbell, 2008</xref>); being friended and linking to friends whether close friends, acquaintances or strangers as ‘one of the (if not <italic>the</italic>) main activities of Facebook’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1354856511433684">Tong et al., 2008</xref>: 531). Such studies present a multi-disciplinary set of approaches to online identity and provide reasons for the <italic>use</italic> of online social networking – conscious, self-aware purposes articulated by different users in different combinations. However, an alternative approach to understanding social networking and identity is to take into account some of the ways in which social networking activities are performative acts of identity which constitute the user. That is, non-conscious, non-voluntarist uses of online social networking that retroactively <italic>produce the user</italic> with a particular selfhood, demographic of user, connections and identifications.</p>
<p>To draw together post-structuralist, anti-essentialist theories of subjectivity and identity with prior work on social networking is to do two things: (1) expand the critical frameworks by which online social networking can be contextualised within the broader cultural practices of identity and selfhood; (2) further destabilise the problematic dichotomy of a ‘real identity’ in an offline capacity and a ‘virtual identity’ represented in digital, networked communication. Additionally, by exploring social networking through Butler’s theories of performativity, it is possible to show that social networking activities and behaviours are both means by which identity can be performed and stabilised and, simultaneously, made more complex and conflicting. This comes from the fact that online social networking is not a singular activity but a set of interrelated – sometimes incompatible – <italic>inter</italic>activities which include identity performances through profile management, friending, becoming a fan (‘liking’ fan pages), tagging, being tagged, updating statuses, and having responses given by others to one’s own status updates. That is, an <italic>array</italic> of activities that require users to ‘work’ to perform a coherent, intelligible selfhood extending across all these online activities in addition to offline behaviours.</p>
<p>Working from a post-structuralist anti-foundationalist perspective that draws on Foucault, Lacan and Derrida, Butler’s theory of performativity is based on the idea that identity and subjectivity is an ongoing process of becoming, rather than an ontological state of being, whereby becoming is a sequence of acts, that retroactively constitute identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354856511433684">Butler, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354856511433684">Salih, 2002</xref>: 46). That is, identity formation occurs ‘in accord’ with culturally-given discourses, structures and practices which, once stabilised for the subject, comes to feel as common-sense, and by which any actions, performances or behaviours of the subject appear to be acts emanating from that identity rather than constituting it. The self or ‘I’ is made up of a matrix of pre-given identity categories, experiences and labels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354856511433684">Butler, 1990</xref>: 40) that, through repetition, lend the illusion of an inner identity core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354856511433684">Butler, 1993</xref>: 12). Where Butler’s theories provide an important perspective for the study of social networking and identity construction is in extending the very idea of performance from the bodily, the experiential, the affective into the field of online acts; in other words, online social networking behaviour is just as much a performance as any other ‘real life’ act, and just as equally constitutes a sense of self and identity; online behaviour should not be understood as an activity separate from those more ostensibly embodied performances of identity categories.</p>
<p>Working Butler’s theory of identity performativity alongside existing discussions of online social networking, I am arguing in this article that the online performance of subjectivity is articulated in at least two, sometimes competing ways: (1) modifying one’s own profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354856511433684">boyd, 2008</xref>: 122) which includes (a) developing the profile through choosing particular categories of common identity co-ordinates or demarcations as well as stating categories of taste, providing and deciding on particular information that in the act of deciding is a performance of identity: age, gender, relationship status, indicators of sexual orientation/identity, and making biographical statements; (b) ongoing activities such as status updates, uploading and captioning photos, sending messages, rewriting biographical statements and other forms of updating, refining and manipulating one’s profile; (2) identifying in a relational sense with various friends and networks through adding and accepting adds – and, of course, updating, changing making new additions or deletions to the friends list. Both of these are performances of self-identity which, in Butler’s formulation of subjectivity, retroactively constitute identity, just as offline performances of selfhood do likewise. Separately, these two social networking activities are acts of identity performance; however, the extent to which these two areas of social networking operate <italic>together</italic> towards a coherent, unified self needs to be explored. Lewis and West have indicated that while social networking sites require ‘both the presentation of self and a process of “friending” … there is a degree of incompatibility between these imperatives’ (2009: 1224). Since identifications are, as Butler has noted, ‘multiple and contestatory’ (1993: 99), and the subject is produced at the ‘cost of its own complexity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1354856511433684">Hall, 2004</xref>: 127), a stronger understanding of the use of online social networking in the construction of intelligible and coherent identities can be explored by thinking through the ways in which the complexity and multiplicity of social networking friendship activities, comments, discussions, tagging and so on, work both to build and undo narratives of selfhood. Concentrating on Facebook and MySpace as the two most common and popular examples in anglophone use that seek to ‘balance’ profile management with friendship connections, I will begin by giving a theoretical account as to how Butler’s performativity can best be utilised to understand the contemporary cultural role of social networking in relation to how identities are constituted, played out, transformed and stabilised online. The first section will argue that profile management can be understood as an act of identity performance; the second will explore some initial approaches to understanding how the relationality of friendship lists provides a somewhat <italic>different</italic> framework for the performance of identity. In the final section, I will analyse some of the ways in which these two areas of identity performativity – profiles and friending – produce gaps and rifts in the coherence of an identity narrative, creating ‘extra work’ for identity self-management. Ultimately, this article intends to provide a few directions for continued theorisation and analysis of identity and subjectivity in an online context, and ways for approaching in greater complexity the relationship between Web 2.0 interactive environments and contemporary shifts in how selfhood and identity are constructed and played out.</p>
<sec id="section1-1354856511433684">
<title>Profiles and performativity</title>
<p>Post-structuralist and feminist theory since the 1990 s has contributed to a broader understanding of subjectivity as contingent, multiple and fluid operating variously through historical, cultural and narrativised structures and frameworks. This is a shift from the more traditional, Enlightenment perception of identity as emanating from an inner essence and represented through behaviour and communication. Butler’s work on performativity has been particularly important in expanding the ways in which such behaviour, communication, articulation and activity can be understood as constituting – rather than merely representing – identity and selfhood. Although Butler’s work is complex and wide-ranging, there are four nodes of her theories of performative identity that are significant in the study of online, interactive behaviours and experiences. These are best summarised as follows: (a) extending the work of both Nietzsche and Foucault, there is no core, essential self from which behaviours and actions – both offline and online – emerge, only a set of performances that retroactively produce an illusion of an inner identity core: the actor behind the acts is an <italic>effect</italic> of those performances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354856511433684">Butler, 1993</xref>: 12); (b) the self is performed by the citation and repetition of discursively given norms, categories, stereotypes, labels and expressions stabilising over time: in the context of online social networking, that discourse includes available lists of profile categories ranging from user gender and relationship status to choices around favourite films and other taste categories as well as other articulations, posts, interpretations, searches and what appear ostensibly as choices; (c) selves are constituted in discourse but can be reconstituted or reconfigured differently in the encounter with different, new, imaginative discursive arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354856511433684">Butler, 1991</xref>: 18): these include new categories or alternative names and norms of identity encountered online – for example, the decision to add or ‘like’ a fan page on, say, animal rights which might reconstitute a co-ordinate of that user’s identity as vegetarian; and (d) while never complete or without flaw, the process of performing identity occurs within a narrative of coherence <italic>over time</italic>, motivated by a cultural demand or imperative that we are coherent, intelligible and recognisable to others in order to allow social participation and belonging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1354856511433684">Butler, 1997</xref>: 27). In other words, a sense of self is forged across an array of identity categories or ‘co-ordinates’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1354856511433684">Cover, 2004</xref>) – which include common axes of discrimination such as gender, ethnicity, ability and age but might also comprise spurious experiences that are less easily categorisable and less well demarcated in an identity–difference dichotomy – and that these are articulated through an ongoing process of ‘shoring up’ or ‘answering’ any anomalies between those co-ordinates to present a coherent, recognisable and intelligible self.</p>
<p>Performativity, then, is identity produced through the citation of culturally given identity categories or norms in a reiterative process, and occurs across both offline and online actions – in this theoretical framework it would be a mistake to think of social networking behaviour, for example, as being only a representation or biographical statement or set of conscious and voluntary choices made by individuals or in accord with particular backgrounds or demographics. Such performance which, in the context of online social networking, might be ‘liking’ a fan page, adding a friend or choosing a gender category are not merely voluntary, self-conscious decisions but acts which at a deeper level of analysis can be seen to construct the identity or self perceived to be making those decisions. Contemporary western culture <italic>compels </italic>such acts of identity in the demand that one articulate oneself as a rational, reasonable, coherence and recognisable self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1354856511433684">Woodward, 2002</xref>: 89), despite post-structuralist theory ‘showing up’ the impossibility of a genuinely coherent, intelligible and unified self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1354856511433684">Butler, 1997</xref>: 99; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1354856511433684">Jameson, 1985</xref>). Social networking sites, and particularly their profile management function, can thus be understood as one tool or mechanism for attempting to be effective in articulating a coherent and recognisable self, much as diaries, journals, conversations or other communicated ‘justifications’ have been. As the <italic>work</italic> of self-coherence becomes ever more difficult, the time spent in profile maintenance, which may be as complex as profile revision or as simple as making a status update and adding an image caption, pays off as the (never quite) coherent and intelligible profile remains over time.</p>
<p>Aspects of social networking sites such as Facebook and MySpace can thus be said to be the tools <italic>par excellence</italic> by which to perform as a coherent subject in a process over time. As Helen Kennedy has pointed out about webpages generally, they are a media form which is never entirely finished, just as identity composition is a continuous process – both are constantly ‘under construction’ (2006: 869). A user exploiting Facebook or MySpace for performing identity in a never-ending process towards coherence and intelligibility is, effectively, doing what we do when we have a conversation, perhaps in a café, with a friend and speak of ourselves, desires, experiences, recent actions, tastes. Within a disciplinary society of surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1354856511433684">Foucault, 1977a</xref>), we police each other’s subjecthood for coherence, often in line with stereotypes and easily-recognisable ‘norms’ and narratives: one subject’s taste for classical music but punk outfits demands an explanation for consistency, intelligibility and uniformity in order to belong and maintain participation in the social. Within cultural frameworks that posit the stereotype that gay men are particular about interior décor (an old but persistent stereotype), one’s queer identity but household messiness is seen as non-complementary or outside the restrictive norm or stereotype and demands explanation. Two conflicting political views must be smoothed over: ‘But you said earlier …’ demanding the <italic>work</italic> of bringing the performance, articulations, expressions back into coherence and stabilising once again the project of identity.</p>
<p>On social networking sites such as Facebook, the tools for performative coherence are supplied in the profile management interface – although one does not necessarily need to utilise them all – and these provide a discursive structure or framework that can be utilised to give performative acts of identity consistency and coherence. The profile basics: gender, birth date, gender of sexual/romantic interest, relationship status (and who), a biographical statement, political views, religious views, a short written biography, a profile photograph or image, a favourite quotation, education and work, likes and interests. For Sonia Livingstone, such choices are an act of biographisation of the self, in which users ‘select a more or less complex representation of themselves’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1354856511433684">2008</xref>: 403). To view this in a framework of performativity, the establishment and maintenance of a profile is not a representation or biography but performative acts, which constitute the self and stabilise it over time as the effect of those choices. Written, selected and revised, this is a performance that requires carefully chosen responses that present an intelligible self with integrity, unification and recognisable coherence. An inconsistency (say, conservative political views that rub awkwardly against the act of ‘liking’ an anti-war fan page) can be explained out, made intelligible, cohering together through perhaps a lengthy biographical entry on the Facebook Info page. A straight man’s status of relationship with another man can be indicated or recognised as an act of irony, leaving the identity of heterosexuality intact (depending on the reader’s digital-cultural literacy or knowledge of the person). The important element here in understanding online social networking as a site for an intelligible identity performance is that different users will exploit these tools in different ways and to varying degrees, and that at no stage is this necessarily a conscious, voluntary moment of identity construction but just as reiterative, hidden and disavowed as a masculine way of walking performs, stabilises and is consistent with a male identity, or choices around household furnishing performs and coheres with, say, a middle-class income bracket, affiliation or identification. These are never complete, but always and forever a process – persistent maintenance of the self and constant maintenance of the profile.</p>
<p>Subjectivity as an effect within an interactive digital environment occurs not through an external act of ‘naming’ but in ‘taking’ the name or category or label <italic>as if</italic> one were interpellated by it, simultaneously <italic>as if </italic>it were simply a choice for a convenient representation. None of these forms of performativity online operate as free-floating decisions but, in line with a theory of performativity, are constituted by the available, provided categorisations in line with available discourses of selfhood. An obvious but significant example: gender configurations in contemporary society are expected to conform to available cultural categories (masculine/feminine and various emerging, sometimes controversial alternatives), but in performing these online through an enunciative act on a social networking profile, is required to declare an even more limited choice from a drop-down menu: male or female only (and once set cannot be changed). This forecloses on the broad range of alternative possibilities from intersexed identities, various transgender identities and those of fluidity and non-western androgynies which cannot be expressed through either a dichotomy or even a one-word concept label. As Ian Buchanan put it in discussing the cultural, linguistic and discursive options available to us around gender identity, ‘you can choose to be man, woman, or transgendered, but you cannot choose to be nongendered’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354856511433684">2007</xref>). The categories available in making profile choices in social networking sites provide, indeed, the same limitations – if not stricter ones – as the discourses available to us. In Butler’s terms, like discourse, these are ‘constitutive categories that seek to keep gender in its place by posturing as the foundational illusions of identity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354856511433684">Butler, 1990</xref>: 33–34).</p>
<p>Although not wholly constrictive given the range of counter-options for performing otherwise (for example, the biography text-box or ongoing status updates), the provided categories on social networking sites offer a notion of freedom to ‘choose’ that is endemic to neo-liberalist thinking and digital technology’s either/or framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354856511433684">Lazzarato, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1354856511433684">2009</xref>). Yet they risk for some users the violence of a normative truth-regime that excludes alternative, postmodern, post-structuralist ways of reconfiguring identity, self-complexity or doing subjectivity <italic>otherwise</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354856511433684">Butler, 1993</xref>: 53). In other words, while culture might demand identity coherence in accord with a culturally recognised discourse, the social networking tools of subject performance provide limited scope for playing out an identity in accord with anything but the most simplistic and simplified discourses articulating only the most limited normative choices – at least around gender, age and relationship status as three areas of demarcated and heavily politicised identity co-ordinates. What is important about the profile pages of Facebook and MySpace is that the information, often provided as an initiation into social networking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354856511433684">boyd, 2008</xref>: 128) and subsequently updated as the ‘narrative’ of our performed identities might change, shift or stabilise over time, responds to the cultural demand for coherence and provides the tools for smoothing over the inconsistencies into an intelligible, recognisable presentation of selfhood. This is not the site of the chat-room experimentation of Turkle’s pre-Web 2.0 understanding of internet identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1354856511433684">Turkle, 1995</xref>), but is coterminous with an offline sense of self, masquerading as biography and representation but just as constitutive of self-identities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1354856511433684">
<title>Identity, friendship and the network</title>
<p>Although not wholly disconnected from profile management, the act of friending and relating to others through social networking on Facebook and MySpace is a separate set of performances of identity expression. This second ‘field’ of online performance focuses on the social or relational, producing conformity through interactive identification with others: friends, acquaintances, strangers, persons known only online, co-workers, employees, students and teachers, parents and family – all typically presented under the problematically simple label of ‘friends’. Online relationality is developed through (1) the creation and maintenance of friends lists through reciprocal adding and accepting of friends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1354856511433684">Lewis and West, 2009</xref>: 1210) and (2) engaging with those friends to varying degrees through interactive communication such as updating, commenting, responding and tagging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1354856511433684">Green, 2008</xref>: 7). Both are performative acts of identification articulated through frameworks of relationality and belonging; specific activities which produce, constitute and stabilise the self. Friendship, kinship and other relationships are significant elements in the performance of identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1354856511433684">Lewis and West, 2009</xref>: 1210) and within this theoretical approach it can be argued that the act of coherent and intelligible identity performances are not only to maintain norms for social participation but are done in the context of those in our circle of friends who – often unwittingly but within disciplinary society – surveil. Those who will engage with the narrative of my performance, those who will look for coherence and those who will recognise my self as a subject do so on behalf of power formations of normalisation. This is something that occurs within a construction not just of identity norms, categories and names as given discursively, but within a matrix of <italic>identification</italic> and <italic>belonging</italic>. In some recent work on how users present themselves through social networking on LiveJournal, Hodkinson points out that friending is about an individualised set of choices as to how one interacts and customises the self within shifting personal priorities rather than fixed and ongoing group structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354856511433684">2007</xref>: 646). Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354856511433684">Donath and boyd (2004</xref>), Liu points out that a user’s friends’ connections are an expression of identity and ‘the public display of friend connections constitutes a social milieu that contextualizes one’s identity’. They are, for Liu, ‘willful acts of context creation’ (2008: 254) that aim to produce group identifications through solidarity between a user’s tastes and a social group’s taste norm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1354856511433684">Liu, 2008</xref>: 261–262). This perspective, drawing to some extent on the performance work of Erving <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1354856511433684">Goffman (1971</xref>), is notable for the way in which it places identity within the context of surveillance through spectatorship and interaction with others within a social network. Liu sees this as a self-conscious act by which performers are reflectively aware of the impressions fostered within the network of friends. However, the relationality of online social networking can be understood as a non-ostensible activity taken up unwittingly by users as part of the ‘biographical “narratives” that will explain themselves to themselves, and hence sustain a coherent and consistent identity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354856511433684">Buckingham, 2008</xref>: 9).</p>
<p>In line with Butler’s more nuanced approach to performativity, we can thus argue that the performances of identity which may appear to be wilful and reflexive are acts which constitute the narrative of selfhood, retroactively establishing the subject who speaks – or in this case, speaks the self through status updates and interactions with friends; speaks the self through the performative acts of friending. For David Buckingham, the idea that choices are wilful, conscious and pragmatic is coterminous with modern neo-liberal consumerism in which participants are offered ‘multiple possibilities to construct and fashion their own identities … in increasingly creative and diverse ways’ (2008: 9). Drawing on Foucault, he points out that this problematically excludes the fact that such choices and the framework in which choosing ‘what to be’ is made are usually just effects of disciplinary power rather than self-conscious empowerment. Furthermore, such approaches tend to restore not only the idea of identity as the product of conscious action, but a notion of an ‘inner’ and ‘outer’ subjecthood – a private self and a public self. This is distinct from a Butler-Foucauldian understanding of subjecthood: not only are notions of inner/outer and public/private problematised, but any ‘outer’ performance of the self such as relationality and sociality in online and offline settings are not representations emerging from a rational self but, rather, are constitutive of the necessary fiction of a stable inner self. The performative interaction and relationality with others online comes in the two forms of (1) ‘friending’ and friend list maintenance and (2) synchronous and asynchronous communication between those ‘friends’, both of which I will outline next.</p>
<sec id="section3-1354856511433684">
<title>Friending</title>
<p>To understand the identity implications of the act of friending we need to explore the way in which the performance of subjecthood operates in the context of online social networks: that is, by asking what this ‘friendship’ might actually come to be. There is some emerging work around the ways in which friends are categorised variously by the user via new mechanisms that allow certain information to remain private from certain groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354856511433684">Diaz, 2008</xref>); others have explored some of the ways in which friendship online is understood as a weak form of relationality with others as opposed to social contact in a fully embodied, offline sense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354856511433684">Baym et al., 2007</xref>: 737; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1354856511433684">Ellison et al., 2007</xref>: 1146; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1354856511433684">Tong et al., 2008</xref>: 537); and still others have suggested that social networking sites’ singular conceptual category of friend (regardless of various privacy distinctions on Facebook, or the ‘top friends’ list produced on MySpace) is a flattening out of the complex relationships and multiple categories of friendship and acquaintanceship experienced in offline spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1354856511433684">Lewis and West, 2009</xref>: 1211). We can advance these important points by noting that the act of friending – of adding a friend, whether that be an acquaintance, a stranger, an old friend or some other category of relationship is an act of identity performance in and of itself. But that act is channelled through a concept of <italic>identification</italic> – of acknowledging and thereby producing and stabilising some relationship and some sense of like (whether that be liking in the sense of fondness or being akin to an other, noting that Facebook frequently uses the signifier <italic>like</italic> as a means of response to friends’ comments and the terminology for joining a group fan page). Choosing to add a friend may well be a voluntary act of seeking information or gaining access to another’s profile; in Butler’s performativity framework it is what that act ‘says’ about a user that retrospectively makes it a factor of identity performance.</p>
<p>In the case of Facebook and MySpace, one thus forms an identification with an other through the performative act of adding a friend or liking a group, and this responds to the very grey set of distinctions between identifying with an other in relation; possessing an other as a friend on a list, and possessing a particular ‘friend count’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1354856511433684">Tong et al., 2008</xref>: 545). Given that friending an other on both Facebook and MySpace is also an action which allows access to one’s profile of ‘managed’ self-information, prior postings, photographs and other artefacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1354856511433684">Tufekci, 2008</xref>: 23), the act is a sort of double-performative – it is an identification that is simultaneously an articulation of the history of identifications given through that profile, a simultaneous act of relationality and of speaking the self. None of this is to suggest that there is some flattening out of all persons on a friendship list, as if a group has come together through sameness. Rather, identifications can be constituted in difference and distinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1354856511433684">Butler, 1995</xref>: 441). For a singular user, what can occur is a set of identifications that are marked by varying gradations and fragmentations of identification, of sameness and difference, of closeness and distance, and of other categorisations which may not be stated obviously through Facebook and MySpace friends lists. The act of adding – and, by corollary, the decision <italic>not to add</italic> – friends is thus an act of performance that constitutes the self through a complex array of <italic>claims</italic> to relationality and sociality.</p>

<sec id="section4-1354856511433684">
<title>Networked communication</title>
<p>As for the second form of performativity through friendship and relationality, identifications are <italic>stabilised</italic> through commentary, updates, discussions communication and interactivity. The performativity of relationships and belonging in online social networking is, in other words, not limited to (a) owning a list of friends and/or (b) being on another’s list of friends, but on maintaining flows of communication through the multifarious vectors of friendship and relationality on social networking sites – noting that by no means are these necessarily the <italic>only</italic> ways in which relational communication flows, for we know social networkers today will utilise a multiplicity of communication platforms both offline and online, through synchronous and asynchronous means, and across more than one social networking site. In their research on the ways in which commentary and language occurs among friends and family on MySpace, Kathleen Walker et al. have delineated six major forms or themes of comments: ‘(1) friendly greetings or inquiries, (2) expressions of affection and encouragement, (3) suggestion and confirmation of plans, (4) personal asides and inside jokes, (5) exchanges of information and news, and (6) entertainment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1354856511433684">Walker et al., 2009</xref>: 684). Comments are thus not always, necessarily simply updates on one’s actual status, thoughts and feelings, responses to others’ comments and so forth, that can be read by or are intended for a general public, regardless of the level of privacy settings. Rather, they can work within various sets of connotations and significations that may be understood by the friends of the user, or some of the friends of the users, perhaps just one or two friends of the user: common experiences, shared amusements, in-jokes among a close inner circle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1354856511433684">Lewis and West, 2009</xref>: 1222) or ‘seemingly random statements that only their recipients could truly appreciate’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1354856511433684">Walker et al., 2009</xref>: 686) are among the codes of speech of insider remarks and asides that formulate and perform certain types of belonging in the space of the social networking site.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best way of understanding the interface between belonging and identification through social networking sites is in line with Manuel Castells’ network morphology that characterises contemporary sociality across political, economic, labour and technological environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1354856511433684">Castells, 2000 [1996]</xref>). It is no surprise that the relationality of online social networking fits with Castell’s description of the network (despite predating the uptake of Facebook and MySpace), given social networking sites are, of course, the culmination of its logic. As far as the logic that directs social networking sites goes, relationality occurs along lines of an increasing complexity of interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1354856511433684">Castells, 2000 [1996]</xref>: 70–71), which is witnessed in the multiplicity of communicatory engagements across a social networking site from the perspective of a single user (and, indeed, also in offline situations). For example, a user makes a status update that is able to be seen by all or some on a friends list who have access to that profile’s wall. One friend can begin a commentary that surreptitiously questions how that update fits within the user’s recognisable identity: ‘But you said last week that you preferred …’ demanding an explanation. The complexity occurs not because the borders of a community are being policed through surveillance and the imperative to confess for normalisation, coherence and recognition, but because the original status update is open to a multiplicity of ‘activated meanings’ within a complex set of discursive reading formations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1354856511433684">Bennett, 1983</xref>: 218). For different friends, this will depend not on <italic>where</italic> they are located within a network morphology, but on <italic>how </italic>they are located. Neither are friends lists a flattened group of individuals but identify with the user variously, through multiple typologies: family/friend/acquaintance, extent of experience with the user, shared identity experiences, production and maintenance of online and offline knowledge. Of course, each user’s typology of friends and how they operate on the network of relationality will differ (perhaps rapidly) over time, and will include how other meanings and identifications are produced in other ways across the network – such as how that user commented on a photograph on the friend’s sister’s partner’s site. In other words, complexity is found in the variances in knowledge around a user and the considerable variety of networkers, but is <italic>managed</italic> through the technological paradigm of a social networking site. Simultaneous complex and easy, belonging becomes not a thing but a momentary intersection between different dimensions of identification managed but always persistently in flux. Online relationality, identification, mutuality and performance, then are constituted by a structural logic of ‘nodes and hubs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1354856511433684">Castells, 2000 [1996]</xref>: 443). Within Facebook, MySpace and other social networking sites, friends become placed in a framework of amorphous nodes, hubs and points, allowing us to see a re-levelling of relationalities such that from the perspective of all users there are multiple networks formations at play.</p>
<p>Relationality may thus depend on a number of social factors, but how it is expressed online conforms to this newer logic of the network that shifts from one formation to another depending on different contexts, times of day, topic of conversation, issues arising, and so on. This allows us to shift beyond the many arguments as to who <italic>should</italic> be an online friend, whether one should add work colleagues or an employer or manager to the list of friends, etiquette around different friendships, whether or not parents and older relatives (or younger relatives) should have access. These can all constitute different nodes and hubs – again, always shifting. Thus the framework of identifications that occur across the network in its very instability, amorphousness and flux are multiple, and this aligns with Butler’s point that identifications are always multiple and occurring all the time, therefore never driven by a singular identification or rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354856511433684">Butler, 1990</xref>: 67). The degree to which online social networking friendship constitutes one’s subjectivity is, of course, variable and must never be considered out of the context of the full, complex array of relationships, spaces, places and experiences occurring across everyday life – that is, not just the Web 2.0 world of online communication and interactivity. What online social networking has enabled, however, is a shift in the logic of identification and belonging from spatial, kinship and community patterns into an ever-increasing cycle of complexity in which belonging continues to be the primary aim of performing identities towards intelligibility and coherence but whereby the notion of belonging is defined differently now through the network of flows. Ultimately, this makes subjectivity more complex: the logic of social networking postmodernises subjecthood in a way different from the late capitalist postmodernisation of identity through consumption. While some might bemoan the simpler, more stable frameworks that belong to Enlightenment demands for coherence, this somewhat rival logic opens up new possibilities for, at the very least, alternative ways of being a subject.</p>

<title>Multiplicities and undoing</title>
<p>While profile maintenance and online friendship/relationality are both sets of performative acts which in Butler’s framework of performativity constitute narratives of selfhood, in evaluating their effectiveness as tools for the coherent and intelligible performance of identity, there emerges a critical argument that these two facets of online social networking compete with each other and risk the undoing of identity narratives and coherence. That is, while they both provide useful and effective means by which to articulate self-identity in ways that aim to fulfil the cultural demand for intelligible selfhood, viewed together they open either the possibility of revealing the basic incoherence and multiplicity of identity or adding to the task of ‘identity work’. I would like to end this article by analysing some of the ways in which the use of Facebook and/or MySpace generates inconsistency in the performance of a coherent identity. This incompatibility of the two activities might best be figured as one of the gaps in citation, reiteration and repetition of which Butler has demonstrated ‘shows up’ the persistent instability of coherent identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354856511433684">Butler, 1990</xref>: 145). In fact, it may only be by taking the risk of showing identity’s incoherence that identification with others – the networking with, for and by friends in their various formations – can occur. The profile, as I have been arguing, is the site of a reiterative performance or practice of identity that, carefully constructed, works as part of an overall narrative and a strategy towards the coherent performance of a unified identity/subjectivity, answering the Enlightenment imperatives for intelligibility and recognition in order to participate socially and achieve belonging within a disciplinary society of norms. While sites such as Facebook, MySpace, LiveJournal and other social networking formations provide a convenient tool for the construction and clarification of selfhood online (and one that is capable of being utilised as an archive for offline performances for others and the self), they also present the greatest risk to narrative coherence through the specifically <italic>digital</italic> and asynchronous forms of friending and friendship communication and interactivity. This occurs in three identifiable ways: (a) Through the capacity of social networking sites’ walls and commentary spaces by which a friend is invited to surveil, identify and point to a breach in identity coherence most easily; (b) through the possibility of disruption by being able to point to the specific moments in the record of identity narrative represented by wall-posts and status updates and in contrast with other parts of the social networking site such as photographs; (c) by the fact that the narrative of the self is not entirely ‘managed’ by the user (in the way, perhaps a diary maintained over time has been), meaning his or her performance of coherent selfhood is persistently countered by the comments <italic>about</italic> that person and – particularly – the possibly unwanted tagging of that user in photographs that may be unwanted, not in his or her possession and not in his or her control (except to keep tabs on this regularly and remove tags where possible).</p>
<sec id="section6-1354856511433684">
<title>Commentaries</title>
<p>The fact that participants in the online social networking nodes and hubs of relationality are in a position to surveil each profile creates the possibility for the undoing of identity coherence, noting the point that this is not necessarily a negative thing, but something which creates difficulties in fulfilling the continuing Enlightenment imperative of intelligible, reasonable and recognisable subjectivity. This is akin to the ‘café conversation’ mentioned earlier. In the act of conversing about oneself, one may be called upon by a friend to clarify any perceived incoherence in identity, frequently seen as a lack of ‘integrity’: ‘But yesterday, you said that you were <italic>a</italic> vegetarian …’ or ‘but I had no idea you’d slept with women, so are you bisexual or what …?’ and so on. The call from the friend to clarify in terms of a known, recognisable and perhaps normalised narrative is undertaken on behalf of contemporary culture’s imperative for coherence. And that might easily be resolved: an explanation that re-weaves the life story, the narrative of identity. The response restores one to recognisability, even though it may be a re-cognition or re-thinking of the self: ‘yes, I am vegetarian, I had a moment of weakness’ or ‘sometimes I do eat fish’; ‘I’ve always found both genders attractive’ or ‘it was something I was doing in college – everybody was.’ But once this ‘conversation’ and the demand for confession, clarity and coherence shifts to the Facebook wall we have a markedly different scenario which more effectively undoes identity coherence and selfhood than a fleeting verbal remark: a textual comment, a request written on the wall is no longer simply a spoken demand for a recognisable identity narrative but is on the one hand a call that is made in a semi-public environment and on the other a call that persists over time.</p>
<p>The fact that the conversational policing of identity occurs through wall and photo/video commentary responses provides what might otherwise have been a spoken request, the cultural perception of authority that comes with written/produced text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354856511433684">Biriotti and Miller, 1993</xref>: 2–6, 12; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354856511433684">Foucault, 1977b</xref>: 128). At the same time, however, it should be remember that this is not a one-sided form of conversing whereby an author-user is interrogated by a reader-feedback-friend. Rather, this goes both ways, for the request for a clarification, a comment, a caption and so on made by a friend is also his or her act of subject performance, an articulation constitutive of the self within the nodes-and-hubs arrangement of the network morphology of online identification. The multiple directions of the flow of such performative commentary and conversation is an interactivity which, for Mark Andrejevic, has an element of the confessional culture that stems from a contemporary desire for subjection to ‘a discursive regime of self-disclosure’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354856511433684">2002</xref>: 234). For some time now, media scholars have noted the ways in which confession of the self has been remade as entertainment, across television shows such as <italic>Sex and the City</italic> to reality television to the talkback show epitomised by <italic>Oprah</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354856511433684">Attwood, 2006</xref>: 84). However, the Facebook Wall can be characterised as confession of the self remade as friendship and relationality, indeed there have been suggestions that earlier homepages and other interactive sites of biography are the culmination of confessional society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354856511433684">Kennedy, 2006</xref>: 870).</p>
<p>Where disciplinary surveillance itself shifts into a network morphology, its efficacy is no longer in the <italic>possibility</italic> of being watched, as Foucault puts it using the metaphor of the prison’s panopticon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1354856511433684">Foucault, 1977a</xref>), but in the <italic>certainty</italic> of that surveillance operating within the network flows of relationality. Friends are no longer thus those who <italic>might</italic> surveil and normalise; rather, their relative placement as nodes and hubs in an interactive flow of question-and-answer constitutes their performativity as Facebook friends within a framework of multiplicities of regularisation and normalisation. In that sense, Facebook friendship is the disciplinary regime of confession <italic>par excellence</italic>. But because of the multiplicity of flows that contrasts with the centralisation of the panopticon metaphor, we see not its effect as normalisation, but multiple attempts to normalise from multiple angles that can come with the diverse ‘conversations’ from different friends, about different updates, across different formulations of private and public speech and alongside different activations of meaning – the user and his or her narrative of recognisable identity risk being forcibly fragmented or, at the very least, require even greater ‘identity work’ to perform, retain and stabilise coherence and intelligibility.</p>

<title>Disrupting the past – the archive</title>
<p>Confession in the face of the other is, as Sally Munt has pointed out, a technique of the self which renders the subject ‘visible and plausible to itself, and to others’ through a reiteration which gains the force of a plot and involves a persistent and retrospective reordering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1354856511433684">Munt, 2002</xref>: 19). But what happens to that retrospective remembering and reconfiguring when the momentary articulations of an identity performance and the many conversations and regimentary instances of surveillance-and-confession are laid out across a social networking wall as a written history? What St Louis, following Stuart Hall, has referred to as narratives which account ‘for peoples’ arrival at the present through a past that is imaginatively reconstructed and dramatized’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1354856511433684">St Louis, 2009</xref>: 565), and what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354856511433684">Buckingham (2008</xref>) points to as part of the ‘project of selfhood’ in which biographical narratives are articulated over time, are both useful in pointing to the ways in which the narrative of performative selfhood that is developed by the user through profile management is put asunder by the friendship wall discussions, additions, commentary and tagging that act as an <italic>archive</italic>. That is, the memorialisation of the past is not as easily refigured, reordered and reremembered when an order, a history and a set of collective memories are laid out as an archive. An autobiography or a reflective construction of a user’s online profile involves a memorialisation of a past which never existed but which retrospectively narrates and justifies the <italic>current</italic> moment of identity coherence in order to lend the illusion of an ongoing fixity of selfhood across time. But an archive of the past is precisely that which opens up the possibility of incoherence by having documented the past identity configurations at various moments.</p>
<p>For Castells, the network captures within its domain ‘most cultural expressions, in all their diversity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1354856511433684">Castells, 2000 [1996]</xref>: 403), and it is in the powerful tools of a Web 2.0 digital environment that data and articulations from different points in subjective time are brought together. This, again, will be in the form of status updates, commentaries, feedback, conversations, images and videos, which flow across the network but are gathered together on a single page as a documentation of every shift in identity. I can look at my friend’s wall and read a biography that is presented in reverse order, hitting the ‘older posts’ button to take me further and further back. While my friend’s <italic>profile</italic> presents a coherent and constructed narrative, a biography and set of educational and employment posts, a list of various tastes and – combined with my knowledge of his or her other activities and experiences – there is a clear and discernible narrative available to me. This profile may have been rewritten a dozen times, but when read as a profile there is no necessary reason to tease out its constructedness. But reading the <italic>wall posts</italic>, commentary, friends’ views along with the updates on when friends were added and so on, I can see a documentary record of momentary fragments of a fragmentary self that has not been shaped into performance masquerading as a representation of intelligible selfhood. My friend’s recognition as a subject is at risk. What is important to note, however, is that online commentary can be, to use Vikki Bell’s phrase ‘the constitutive moments and modes of identity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1354856511433684">Bell, 1999</xref>: 7), but that for performativity to ‘work’, those constitutive moments must be smoothed over, disavowed, forgotten or re-memorialised into something else, something otherwise. And it is precisely this that the documentary record of these moments does not allow, instead making visible the fact that any subject may have had a multitude of those moments and the corresponding shifts in identityhood.</p>

<sec id="section8-1354856511433684">
<title>Tagging</title>
<p>Tagging of images and other artefacts has been a somewhat controversial element of Facebook and MySpace, given that it allows a user to link the name of another user to a photograph of which the tagged person may not have seen, been aware of, or authorised. Tagging is very much the epitome of an interactive, participatory Web 2.0 culture of communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1354856511433684">Munster, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1354856511433684">Walther et al., 2008</xref>: 30). Tags create identificatory links, giving an association or a connection between a user and a set of behaviours that may be discerned in a photograph – which is not to deny the multiplicity of meanings that can be interpreted, read or activated by viewers of that image. To tag a photograph on Facebook, a user uploads it to an album, selects the tagging tool, selects a face or other body part (or anything else really) in the image and either chooses a person’s name from one’s list of network contacts (friends) or types any other name or tag. Now, there is nothing particularly new about being able to make this kind of association in an online capacity. One could establish a website and caption or otherwise tag people’s names to images which, again, they may not have seen or authorised for distribution. What is significantly different in the case of Facebook is that once tagged, an alert will appear on a user’s wall, fed to the news-feed seen by all other people in that person’s network. This, of course, is part of the increasing capacity of digital environments to organise data and online artefacts in ways that are more easily accessible through classifying, filtering and tagging, even though it replicates older conceptual issues around the relationship between image and word (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1354856511433684">Prada, 2009</xref>). An image of a user may be captioned, but for anyone searching for those images (who may be the subject of the image her/himself) without digital tagging they would be no more easily found than those with a handwritten caption in an analogue, physical album in Grandmother’s attic. This element of rationality has, of course, raised a number of concerns and panics around privacy and control of information over the past couple of years in the popular press. There have been concerns about the ways in which tagged non-textual items become increasingly searchable online (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354856511433684">Hearn, 2010</xref>) which, given how different in tone and context an image or video can be from text, may have an impact not just on how one is represented but on how one perceives oneself – particularly if that tagged image or video comes back as a surprise. According to recent reports, several European countries’ regulators, including those in Switzerland and Germany, are currently investigating whether the practice of posting photos, videos and other information about people on sites such as Facebook and tagging them without their consent is a breach of privacy laws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1354856511433684">
<italic>The Age</italic>, 2010</xref>). It might be argued that privacy concerns are not only about control of ostensible information but about the management identity performance, and to prevent the presentation of the self from spiralling out uncontrollably across the networking and over time.</p>
<p>An example of the ways in which tagging acts to disrupt or undo the coherent narrative of an identity performance is as follows: a recent news report has addressed issues of jealousy that might occur when one’s current partner is tagged in photographs by – and with – an ex-partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1354856511433684">
<italic>Sydney Morning Herald</italic>, 2009</xref>), clearly addressing the distinction between an older model of analogue photographs and the social practices around the removal or hiding of photographs that present past relationships. Where acts of coupledom are central to identity practices in contemporary culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354856511433684">Cover, 2010</xref>), an unwanted, unintended re-emergence of that relationship is of course going to create, preserve and archive additional layers of relational identifications for that user, and an incompatibility with the invited profile statement naming the current partner. This might, of course, be further complexified should the gender of the past partner be different from the current one, opening fragmentations perhaps for some networked friends in the sexual orientation of the profiled user. From the perspective of the user who has utilised Facebook’s profile function and wall in the construction of a performance of coherent identity, which has, by necessity, involved disavowing past experiences, the undoing of identity is opened by an encounter with the past. Not a memorialised past – rewritten in one’s memory or narrative through the framework of an identity <italic>present</italic>, but an archaeological artefact that might grate against the currency of one’s identity performance, both online and off. In other words, tagging not only takes identityhood out of the myth that it is represented, articulated, commanded and controlled by the subject through profiles and performances, but acts as a reminder that the network framework <italic>commandeers</italic> and potentially thwarts the performativity of an intelligible selfhood.</p>

<sec id="section9-1354856511433684">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Given that users are beginning to recognise the problem of the multiplicity of the networked audience in terms of who is accessing information, how it is being utilised, the extent to which one might be required to explain oneself to different friends and different groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1354856511433684">Lewis and West, 2009</xref>: 1222–1223) it may well be the case that the great ‘identity project’ of online social networking faces an uncertain future. Certainly, some of the recent questions and public debates over privacy and digital surveillance, control of one’s Facebook information (including deleted artefacts), and the utilisation of social networking accounts by third parties who construct marketing profiles based on portions of information and usage have both generated and revealed a number anxieties around online social networking as a tool for identity performativity. Will users tire of the additional ‘identity work’ caused by the potential incompatibilities between the friendship network and the constructed profile? Or is this the beginning of a new discursive framework in which a culture begins to embrace the complexity and incoherence of identity, leading to the fruition of postmodern and post-structuralist thinking of the self? The answers to this of course are not easily predicted and may well be distinct and different for different users and their networks of friends.</p>
<p>In advancing our understanding of the relationship between social networking (and other online activities) and the performance of identity within contemporary cultural norms, structures and frameworks, it is important to bear in mind that social networking uses, activities, changes, updates and account management are not only conscious representations and choices made for access, but simultaneously activities or performances which construct identity and selfhood. Significant here is that rather than thinking of social networking as singular activities, the ways in which sites such as MySpace and Facebook have developed through the growth of applications, user-uptake and favoured user activities has provided us with a multiplicity of activities and communicative forms which, as I have been arguing in relation to (a) profiles and (b) friendship networking, are not always mutually compatible with the project of subject performance. This theoretical account is one among several ways in which we can approach social networking and identity; additional empirical work will reveal other understandings of this significant tool of everyday identity.</p>
