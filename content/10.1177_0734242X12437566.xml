<abstract>
<p>Green public procurement has been criticized for its excessive reliance on detailed technology specifications, which can distort incentives in the short term and discourage innovation in the longer term. Economists therefore tend to prefer technology-neutral procurement, which rewards outcomes rather than technologies. However, technology-neutral procurement can also be problematic in practice. The present study investigated green public procurement of waste management, a rapidly growing field. In one of the most sophisticated models for technology-neutral procurement applied in Sweden in recent years, different environmental impacts were assigned weights, but no weight was given to the particular technology employed. Even here, however, potential inefficiencies were found where the scoring rule could have led to arbitrary, and presumably unwanted, outcomes. Explicitly assigning monetary surcharges to desirable and undesirable environmental effects may be a better way to reach environmental targets.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the present study, tenders in green public procurement of the management of biological waste products were evaluated. A recent example of a scoring rule developed and used in a Swedish municipality was examined and a sensitivity analysis was conducted in order to assess how robust the rule was to small changes in the competing bids.</p>
<p>Green public procurements, where environmental criteria are included, are increasingly common and are seen as an important instrument for achieving sustainable development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X12437566">Erdmenger, 2003</xref>). The EU has indicated that green public procurement is vital for achieving both sustainable development and a sustainable economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X12437566">COM, 2008</xref>). Public entities in the EU can set their own criteria in green procurements, as long as a clear rule is announced for scoring the environmental criteria used (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X12437566">Che (1993)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X12437566">Dini et al. (2006)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X12437566">Bergman and Lundberg (2011)</xref>, for discussions of scoring rules in procurements).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X12437566">Bergman and Lundberg (2011)</xref>, in an overview of Swedish public procurement, identify four broad classes of scoring rules. The most common approach, which was found in almost half of the procurements that they studied, was ‘price to quality’ scoring rules in which different criteria (including price and, potentially, environmental criteria) were used to generate the score. Pure monetary procurements, in which only price is considered and no quality criteria are included apart from those mandated by law, also remain common. Less frequent is the ‘quality to price’ scoring rule in which different criteria, potentially including environmental ones, are assigned explicit monetary weights and where these are then used, together with the price, to generate a monetary score. Pure quality procurements, in which the price is set in advance but different bidders can offer different levels of quality, are even rarer.</p>
<p>Green public procurement can be achieved in several ways. The most common approach is through technical standards, mandating the use of a specific green technology rather than those used most commonly in the field (e.g. biogas treatment rather than incineration for organic waste; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X12437566">COM (2005)</xref> for a discussion of technology mandates versus the technology neutrality option discussed below). There are, however, drawbacks with this approach. In the short run, it can lead to excessive costs in cases where slightly dirtier technologies can achieve almost the same environmental gains as the mandated technology but at substantially lower cost. In the longer run, once the providers of the good or service in question have achieved the mandated standard, there is no incentive to develop even greener technologies. Thus, innovation may cease once the specified technology has been implemented. For these reasons, economists frequently advocate technology-neutral green procurement, where environmental benefits are still given weight, but without specifying the technology to be used (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X12437566">Breyer (1982)</xref> or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X12437566">Besanko (1987)</xref>, for seminal contributions; see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X12437566">Brännlund et al. (2009)</xref>, for recent discussion of these issues).</p>
<p>An important benefit of technology-neutral public procurement is that it is open to any kind of technological solution, creating incentives for new providers to compete if their tenders offer a better total value than that offered by other bidders. This encourages innovation, as new technologies can quickly be established on the market as long as their price and environmental benefit make the total value of their tenders comparable with that of competing technologies. It also encourages existing companies to find ways to lower their prices and environmental impacts in order to become more competitive in future public procurements.</p>
<p>Although attractive in theory, one risk with technology-neutral procurement is that different effects may be weighted according to different criteria in such a way that the overall outcome becomes inefficient. If the weighting criteria are poorly considered, the reduction of environmental impacts may be achieved at an unnecessarily high cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X12437566">Brännlund et al., 2009</xref>). As public entities are free to set their own criteria, as long as they comply with EU regulations, there is also a risk that comparable environmental impacts will be given different weights in different procurements. It is important, therefore, to evaluate how technology-neutral procurements function in practice.</p>
<p>In the present study, an example of green public procurement of waste management services – a relatively new field – was investigated. Since waste management has traditionally played an important role in EU environmental policy (the various policies and regulations regarding recycling are obvious examples), it is interesting to study how green procurement works in practice in the waste management sector.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0734242X12437566">
<title>The procurement</title>
<p>The studied municipality produces some 400 tons of biological waste and 1800 tons of combustible waste annually. Its procurement of waste management services for 2009–2014 was the first technology-neutral green public procurement of waste management in Sweden where different environmental impacts were weighted against each other; other than this, however, the scoring rule was similar to those used in many other procurements. Thus, the results from this procurement are of potential interest for other municipalities seeking to encourage environmentally friendly waste management processes.</p>
<p>Collecting and treating waste is a municipal responsibility in Sweden, but individual municipalities can pay other agents to do the work for them. The procurement studied here involved collection and treatment of biological household waste. The choices were between burning the waste for energy and transforming it into biogas. Apart from the environmental point system studied below, there were mandatory criteria that all bidders had to meet, including constraints on traffic noise from vehicles, a ban on treating the biological waste together with chemical wastes, and other constraints linked to local regulations and to Swedish legislation. The requirement that all of the bids comply with all Swedish and municipal regulations effectively imposed some fairly restrictive technology standards, and could explain the low number of bids. The small overall size of the procurement also, effectively, limited the range of bidders to those with existing installations.</p>
<p>Two firms submitted tenders: one submitted a tender for incineration into energy, and another submitted a tender for anaerobic digestion into biogas. The waste-to-energy tender won the 5-year contract, which commenced in September 2009 and may be extended until 2016 by mutual agreement before a renewed procurement will be carried out.</p>
<p>The specifications for the procurement, including a proposed scoring rule for desirable environmental criteria, were drawn up by the municipality’s environmental office, based on the municipality’s environmental guidelines, and were then formally determined by the municipal council. The contract would be given to the firm with the lowest tender score <italic>S</italic>; this score was determined as follows (where <italic>P</italic><sub>b</sub> is the market price of the bid, measured in Swedish Kronor, SEK, per ton of waste):</p>

<p>The weights were defined as set out in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X12437566">Table 1</xref>. It was assumed that, in most cases, the waste management would lead to a net CO<sub>2</sub> reduction because the waste would displace the use of fossil fuels, either in heat generation or as transport fuel. The 65% threshold value for nutrient return was based on an assessment by the municipality’s environmental office of the current state of the biogas sector; biogas technologies can have a nutrient return of more than 65%, although not all do, whereas all incineration technologies currently available have returns close to zero and thus face a weight of 1.</p>

<p>Thus, a bid with large environmental impacts and, hence, full weights for all categories would have been valued at the full price stated. However, greener bids could receive smaller or zero weights for their environmental impacts. An incineration tender with a sufficiently large net CO<sub>2</sub> reduction would implicitly be valued at 80% of its market price, whereas a biogas tender with a large net CO<sub>2</sub> reduction <italic>and</italic> a high nutrient return would be valued at 50% of its market price. In this fashion, the municipality attempted to give priority to biogas over incineration, while ensuring that the price differential would not become unreasonably large. Notably, however, the scoring rule targeted the environmental impact <italic>per se</italic> rather than the technology. [It should be noted that the weights were not completely technology-neutral, despite the stated intent; for near-zero changes in net emissions, different weights applied to the two technologies. This did not matter in practice, as both submitted bids led to sufficiently large net reductions to get the zero score; in principle, however, this could have affected the outcome.] Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X12437566">Bergman and Lundberg (2011)</xref>, this was classified as a ‘price to quality’ scoring rule where the monetary cost was merged with two different environmental criteria into a final score, but where no explicit monetary weights were assigned to the respective environmental criteria.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>The tender score for the incineration bid was 702, while that for the biogas bid was 1238. The incineration bid therefore won the contract.</p>
<p>This procurement was unusual in the sense that it was technology-neutral, focusing only on environmental outcomes rather than on the technologies used, and in the sense that several different environmental impacts (both CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and nutrient recovery) could affect the outcome. It was also unusual in that a great deal of thought had been given to how the environmental impacts <italic>per se</italic> – rather than the technologies involved – would be incorporated. Despite this unusually high level of sophistication, however, the rule could have led to drastic and presumably unintended consequences if the values in the bids had been slightly different.</p>
<p>Let us first consider the implicit values attached to the nutrient recovery. Both bids were below the 65% recovery threshold necessary to achieve a lower score: the incineration bid had 0% nutrient recovery and received a score of 263 SEK, whereas the biogas bid had 60% nutrient recovery and received a score of 464 SEK. This means that, for the incineration bid, each percentage point of nutrient recovery below the threshold was valued at approximately 4 SEK ton<sup>−1</sup>, on average, while for the biogas bid, each percentage point below the threshold added approximately 93 SEK per ton, on average. If one looks only at the marginal effect of not achieving the threshold recovery value, the effect is to increase the imputed cost for the incineration bid by 263 SEK and the imputed cost for the biogas bid by 464 SEK. There is no obvious reason why either the average or the marginal value for the two bids, for the same environmental effect, should differ this much. The municipality clearly saw biogas as the preferred option; however, the rule used meant that, since the biogas option was more expensive to begin with, all the scores (for a given level of environmental impact) automatically became larger for that bid as well.</p>
<sec id="section4-0734242X12437566">
<title>Sensitivity analysis</title>
<p>The waste-to-energy plant used in this bid is one of the best in Sweden when it comes to environmental quality. A recent study of Danish waste management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X12437566">Chapman et al., 2009</xref>) provides data that lets us compare the nearby Danish waste-to-energy alternatives with their counterparts in Sweden. If the technology from the dirtiest Danish plants studied in that paper had been used for the incineration alternative, but with the same bidding price as in reality, the incineration option would still have been chosen (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X12437566">Table 3</xref>). However, had the nutrient return in the biogas option been slightly higher (65% rather than 60%), the biogas option would have won. Thus, a difference of a few percentage points in nutrient recovery could have determined the outcome.</p>

<p>Note: Scores for net CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and for nutrient return are determined using the scoring rule discussed in the text. Prices and values that have been changed for this specific scenario are given in bold underlined, while changes resulting from these changes are given in bold and italics; changes compared to the actual procurement are that the incineration option is assumed to be similar to some of the worst other incineration options in terms of environmental impacts, and that the biogas option in the hypothetical scenario is assumed to have a slightly higher nutrient recovery than in the actual bid.</p>

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>Even if the biogas option had won in this scenario, it would have meant that the implicit values attached to the lower CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and better nutrient return would have been quite high. Both environmental impacts are valued in other markets, and the prices in those markets indicate the values attached to these impacts elsewhere. In practice, biogas producers and other processors give away nutrient-rich sewage material to local farmers for free, because the high transportation costs mean that potential customers are very few. Thus, the market value of this sewage material is, effectively, nil. CO<sub>2</sub> reductions are valued in the EU’s emissions trading system for emission permits: the market value at the time of the procurement was some 20 Euros per ton, corresponding at the time to approximately 200 SEK per ton. Scientific estimates of the marginal damage of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions vary widely, see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X12437566">Tol (2011)</xref> for a recent overview, but are generally of the same order of magnitude. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X12437566">Table 3</xref>, the implicit valuation of CO<sub>2</sub> reductions (the difference in price, divided by the difference in net emissions) is 656 SEK per ton if the sewage material is valued at its 0 market price. Thus, it would have been substantially cheaper for the municipality to reduce overall CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by simply buying emission reductions in the ETS market.</p>

A ‘price to quality’ scoring rule was used, a common approach in public procurement; if anything, the scoring rule used was more sophisticated than the average, in that several different environmental criteria were indicated and in that there was a deliberate effort to make the procurement technology-neutral. Nonetheless, it was found that the rule could have forced the municipality to choose bids with only slightly better environmental characteristics but substantially higher cost. It was also found that the implicit monetary values attached to the environmental impacts vary widely between the bids, despite the intended neutrality, and that they did so in a way which contradicted the municipality’s stated preferences.</p>
<p>Environmentally sound waste management is an important part of environmental policy, and green procurement of waste management services can contribute to this. However, a system in which different bids get different scores attached to the same environmental improvement is clearly not desirable. It is preferable to use the same surcharge in monetary terms for a specific environmental improvement (what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X12437566">Bergman and Lundberg (2011)</xref> call ‘quality to price’ scoring), regardless of the bid’s other aspects. When the environmental targets (CO<sub>2</sub> reductions and improved nutrient recovery in the present case) are priced elsewhere in the economy, those prices can be used as an indication of the surcharges to be used; however, the surcharges may still need to be adjusted if local conditions are sufficiently different so that the environmental impacts differ (the authors are grateful to the two anonymous reviewers for pointing out this qualification). When no such monetary indicators are available, policymakers will need to decide on scores through other means. Nonetheless, applying the same score for a specific improvement to all bids, regardless of those bids’ other characteristics, is likely to be necessary for ensuring that the procurement process is truly neutral.</p>
