<p>Each book review for this special bicentennial issue of <italic>Theology Today</italic> has a connection to Princeton Theological Seminary in that the author of the book under review, the reviewer, or the topic of the book has historical or current association with the seminary.</p>
<p><italic>With Piety and Learning: The History of Practical Theology at Princeton Theological Seminary</italic> (International Practical Theology Series, in cooperation with the International Academy of Practical Theology)</p>

<p>This is one book I wish I had read forty years ago at roughly the time I began doctoral work in personality and theology and pastoral theology with Seward Hiltner and Jim Lapsley at Princeton Theological Seminary in 1965. In those days I was aware that what Hiltner, and a young religious education instructor named Jim Loder, represented at Princeton was a liberal broadening of the curriculum of the seminary from its earlier eras. But I had little idea what a long, conflicted, and creative history lay behind their appointments, or how that history and its continuing curricular and theological legacy would implicitly define my own later intellectual agenda as a pastoral theologian. But anyone with a serious interest in practical theology would find <italic>With Piety and Learning</italic> a thoroughly fascinating and informative read, not only for what it reveals about the Princeton tradition, but for its wider relevance to the attempts being made today to advance practical theology as a major theological and pedagogical enterprise.</p>
<p>These issues, and this history, Mikoski and Osmer lay out clearly and in fascinating detail in this timely volume for the seminary’s centennial celebration, which I am pleased to say was written by a couple of my own former doctoral students at Emory. The authors argue that Princeton developed a distinctive tradition of practical theology whose signature feature was a strong core commitment to the discipline’s theological identity and method combined with an emphasis, drawn from evangelical and liberal traditions, on religious experience, secular disciplines, and what we would today call the method of reflective practice. More specifically, their thesis is that Princeton sought to define the field as a third methodological path between the narrow Reformed orthodoxy of Princeton’s earlier history and the “professional model” advanced in liberal circles by the early religious education movement and seminaries like the University of Chicago Divinity School and Union Theological Seminary in New York.</p>
<p>Princeton’s nineteenth-century faculty members were experienced pastors, often with prominent denominational profiles, and it was not uncommon for them to teach both “classical” and “practical” courses with a heavy weight placed on preaching (a curricular emphasis that remains strong today). The book traces the long effort that Princeton faculty have made since its earliest days to hold together the life of the mind and a commitment to moral and spiritual practice in ordained ministry. Mikoski, who wrote the nineteenth-century chapters, notes, however, that the one glaring exception in that century was the horrendous problem of slavery. It is indeed painful today to read that Alexander, Miller, and Hodge all likely owned slaves at some point in their lives, and that, while Princeton’s antebellum faculty were kindly disposed toward African Americans in attitude and action, and “were not supporters of slavery,” they “could not bring themselves to oppose it publically and aggressively” (27).</p>
<p>Osmer, who wrote the twentieth-century chapters, describes the notorious theological struggles that raged between progressive, reforming forces at Princeton (advocated, significantly, by the practical faculty) and conservative traditionalists, and nicely summarizes the familiar history of the modernist–fundamentalist fight of the 1920s that swirled around New Testament professor J. Gresham Machen. Especially critical for practical theology in this period was the creative and courageous leadership of Professor of Practical Theology, Charles Erdman and, a bit later, the broad, progressive, ecumenical leadership of President John A. Mackay, who essentially rebuilt the seminary faculty in the 1930s and laid the foundations for the later achievements of Hiltner, Loder, and other practical theologians. In particular, Mackay’s controversial appointment of Elmer G. Homrighausen in religious education in 1938 had far-reaching consequences for the field. When I was at Princeton, I knew “Homie” as a warm, lovable man who was then dean and Erdman Professor of Pastoral Theology, a title I took to be more or less traditional for faculty with broad theological interests and not an indication of a commitment to pastoral or practical theology as an academic discipline. Wrong! I had no idea how profoundly important Homrighausen had been for the later era of practical theologians at Princeton. Schooled in part in the University of Chicago’s liberal tradition, Homrighausen remained deeply committed throughout his career to apologetics, the inclusion of data from experience, experimental methods in theological education, and the importance of nontheological disciplines for theology (if “christened”), even after he made his momentous and influential turn toward Barth and neo-orthodoxy. Homrighausen, it seems, was really the first Princeton theologian to try to hold these diverse traditions together, even if, as Osmer argues, he failed to work out a detailed methodology.</p>
<p>Mikoski and Osmer focus on key figures, principally Hiltner, Loder, and homiletician Charles Bartow, to represent the recent era because of their highly creative, foundational work as practical theologians. Osmer provides excellent, extensive accounts of how these three each understood practical theology (drawing on some of my own work on Hiltner), with appropriate critiques of each (especially by Craig Dykstra). I was particularly struck—and informed—by the creative theological work of Charles Bartow in his later years, whom I had known only as a young speech instructor in the 1960s. Osmer also provides colorful commentary of a personal sort on the complexities of Seward Hiltner’s character and style of relating, all of which conform to my own recollections, though he fails to note Seward’s genuine warmth and extraordinary sense of humor—and he underplays the tension that pervaded his relationship with Jim Loder. Nor does he note the feminist critique of Seward’s heavy-handed male chauvinism. But clearly the practical theologies of Hiltner, Loder, and Bartow were highly creative in the modern Princeton tradition, and still carry enormous potential importance for practical theology.</p>
<p>The one major omission in this otherwise excellent book is its lack of attention to Princeton’s Doctor of Ministry program, which I understand was largely Hiltner’s creation, but in any case had to have been one of the seminary’s most important, faculty-wide attempts to take theological education in a practical theological direction, and actually to “do” practical theology. I do not know why the program was discontinued, or what that decision may say about the current state of practical theology at Princeton. But I fear that the field may still be struggling to gain acceptance as a theological discipline there, an impression that was reinforced for me by one of the book’s later chapters that records a conversation about the state of practical theology at the seminary as viewed by four current faculty members in practical disciplines. What it means to combine learning with vital practical piety in theology and theological education at Princeton apparently remains an unsettled, challenging, and immensely important question.</p>
