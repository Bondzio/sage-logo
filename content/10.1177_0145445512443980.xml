<abstract>
<p>Although children with social phobia (SP) and selective mutism (SM) present similarly in a clinical setting, it remains unclear whether children with SM are unable to speak due to overwhelming anxiety, or whether withholding speech functions as an avoidance mechanism. A total of 35 children (ages 5-12 years) with either SM (<italic>n</italic> = 10), SP (<italic>n</italic> = 11), or no diagnosis (<italic>n</italic> = 14) participated in the current study. Measurements included clinician, child, and parent ratings as well as behavioral observations and psychophysiological measures. Independent evaluators and clinicians rated children with SM as more severely impaired, more anxious, and less socially effective, but the groups did not differ in self- or parent-reported anxiety. Psychophysiological measures indicated that children in the SM group experienced less arousal than other children during social interaction tasks. The authors postulate that lack of speech may serve as an avoidance mechanism and thus account for this lack of arousal.</p>

<body>
<p>Selective mutism (SM) is characterized by persistent withholding of speech, or a failure to speak in particular social situations in which speaking is expected (e.g., school, among peers), despite speaking in other situations (e.g., in the home). SM is diagnosed when the refusal/failure to speak interferes with achievement (e.g., educational, occupational) or appropriate social communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145445512443980">American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>SM is an uncommon disorder with general population prevalence below 1% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145445512443980">APA, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145445512443980">Bergman, Piacentini, &amp; McCracken, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145445512443980">Chavira, Stein, Bailey, &amp; Stein, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145445512443980">Elizur &amp; Perednik, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0145445512443980">Steinhausen &amp; Juzi, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0145445512443980">Viana, Beidel, &amp; Rabian, 2009</xref>), with the age of onset ranging between 2.7 and 4.1 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145445512443980">APA, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145445512443980">Cunningham, McHolm, Boyle, &amp; Patel, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145445512443980">Garcia, Freeman, Francis, Miller, &amp; Leonard, 2004</xref>). This age range is derived with some ambiguity though, as there is often a lag (approximately 14.1 months) between symptom onset and diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0145445512443980">Kristensen, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Of similar uncertainty is the etiology of SM. Although described in the literature for more than a century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0145445512443980">Wright, Holmes, Cuccaro, &amp; Leonhardt, 1994</xref>), few consistent data support any one etiological theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0145445512443980">Scott &amp; Beidel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0145445512443980">Stone, Kratochwill, Sladezcek, &amp; Serlin, 2002</xref>). The most frequent explanation is that children with SM are socially anxious and thus do not speak in social settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145445512443980">Black &amp; Uhde, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145445512443980">Dummit et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0145445512443980">Sharp, Sherman, &amp; Gross, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0145445512443980">Vecchio &amp; Kearney, 2005</xref>). Several common clinical features of social phobia (SP) and SM support the conceptualization that the two disorders are related, or even the same diagnostically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145445512443980">Anstendig, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145445512443980">Black &amp; Uhde, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0145445512443980">Silveira, Jainer, England, &amp; Bates, 2004</xref>), with SM conceptualized as a developmental variant of SP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145445512443980">Bergman et al., 2002</xref>). For example, children with SM have elevated scores on self-report measures of social anxiety and shyness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145445512443980">Carbone et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145445512443980">Cunningham, et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145445512443980">Dummit et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0145445512443980">Steinhausen &amp; Juzi, 1996</xref>). Moreover, they often meet criteria for SP or the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (3rd ed., rev.; <italic>DSM-III-R</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145445512443980">APA, 1987</xref>) diagnosis of avoidant disorder, with some comorbidity estimates as high as 97% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145445512443980">Black &amp; Uhde, 1995</xref>). Second, family history studies show a high incidence of anxiety disorders, and SP in particular, among relatives of children with SM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145445512443980">Black &amp; Uhde, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145445512443980">Chavira, Shipon-Blum, &amp; Stein, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145445512443980">Kolvin &amp; Fundudis, 1981</xref>). Furthermore, psychopharmacological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145445512443980">Black &amp; Uhde, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0145445512443980">Lafferty, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0145445512443980">Lehman, 2002</xref>) and cognitive behavioral treatments (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0145445512443980">Viana et al., 2009</xref>, for review) that reduce social anxiety are also effective in treating SM.</p>
<p>Although clinicians, and thus the parents who inform those clinicians, tend to rate children with SM as having severe symptoms of social anxiety, it remains unclear whether these children actually experience more intense symptoms when compared with other children with SP who do speak. Based on self-report data, children with SM do not report more symptoms of social anxiety, more severe social anxiety, more fear of negative evaluation, or more frequent comorbid generalized anxiety disorder than children with SP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0145445512443980">Manassis et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0145445512443980">Yeganeh, Beidel, &amp; Turner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0145445512443980">Yeganeh, Beidel, Turner, Pina, &amp; Silverman, 2003</xref>). Moreover, no differences in self-reported anxiety were found between children with SM and children with SP during a peer-interaction task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0145445512443980">Yeganeh et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Although there seems to be little doubt that SP and SM are related in terms of clinical presentation, their exact relationship remains unclear. Specifically, it remains to be determined whether children with SM are so overwhelmed by anxiety that speech would be impossible or whether withholding speech functions as an avoidance mechanism. The inference that silence is a product of heightened anxiety has so far been based on the subjective assessments made by clinicians and parents, but these measures may not accurately reflect the experience of the children themselves. Thus, objective measures of anxiety, such as those provided by psychophysiological assessment, represent one avenue by which to address this question empirically.</p>
<p>Early research examining the psychophysiology of behaviorally inhibited children showed heightened levels of arousal in response to fear-relevant stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0145445512443980">Kagan, Reznick, Clarke, Snidman, &amp; Garcia-Coll, 1984</xref>) as well as novel information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145445512443980">Garcia-Coll, Kagan, &amp; Reznick, 1984</xref>). Although the extant literature on psychophysiological assessment in anxious children is quite small, patterns of autonomic arousal, particularly of the sympathetic nervous system appear to differentiate anxious from nonanxious children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145445512443980">Beidel, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145445512443980">McNeil, Ries, &amp; Turk, 1995</xref>). For example, children diagnosed with an anxiety disorder exhibited significantly more skin conductance fluctuations than children without an anxiety disorder when confronted with a potentially fear-producing stimulus (e.g., a picture of a snake; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0145445512443980">Turner, Beidel, &amp; Epstein, 1991</xref>). In a replication study examining offspring of parents with anxiety disorders who did not have an anxiety disorder, these âat riskâ children displayed significantly more electrodermal activity during resting baseline and during stimulus intertrial intervals when compared with children of parents with no psychiatric diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0145445512443980">Turner, Beidel, &amp; Roberson-Nay, 2005</xref>). Moreover, at risk children were less likely to habituate to fear-relevant auditory or visual stimuli, a pattern most commonly found among individuals with an anxiety disorder. These findings illustrate the utility of psychophysiological measurement for the assessment of anxiety in children.</p>
<p>With respect to assessment of physiology among children with social fears, test-anxious children had larger heart rate increases than normal control children when taking a test or reading aloud before an audience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145445512443980">Beidel, 1988</xref>). Furthermore, the test-anxious children maintained elevated heart rates throughout each task, whereas children without a disorder returned to baseline after an initial increase. In a subsequent investigation, children diagnosed with a <italic>DSM-III-R</italic> diagnosis of overanxious disorder had higher <italic>resting</italic> heart rates than children with SP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145445512443980">Beidel, 1991</xref>). Children with SP exhibited increased <italic>reactivity</italic> during the vocabulary and read-aloud tasks, as measured by changes in heart rate, but children with overanxious disorder did not. Based on all these investigations, it appears that psychophysiological assessment can detect heightened physiological arousal in anxious children.</p>
<p>Therefore, assessing psychophysiological reactivity may be useful in examining whether children with SM experience more severe social distress, while engaging in social interactions than children with SP who are not selectively mute. The current study compared the psychophysiological responses (i.e., heart rate, blood pressure, and electrodermal activity) of children with SM to children with SP alone, and children with no psychiatric diagnosis during two social tasks. It is expected that children with SM and SP will demonstrate higher levels of autonomic and self-reported anxious arousal during the tasks when compared with normal controls, and that children with SM will demonstrate heightened levels of arousal above and beyond that of the children with SP.</p>

<title>Participants and Procedure</title>
<p>A total of 35 children participated in the current study. Ten children with SM were recruited from flyers sent to schools and public libraries describing SM, offering a free psychological assessment and possible participation in an ongoing treatment study for SP. Eleven children with SP and 14 children with no disorder (NC) were recruited as part of a larger investigation of a behavioral treatment for child SP. The parents of children in the SP group were recruited via media advertisements for free treatment of shy children, or were referred by medical or mental health professionals. The NC children were recruited as âfriendly peersâ to assist in the behavioral treatment study. All children received financial remuneration as compensation for participation in the psychophysiological assessment.</p>
<p>Children ranged in age from 5 to 12 years. Participant demographic information may be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0145445512443980">Table 1</xref>. All children were required to have at least a first grade reading level, which was assessed via the childâs acknowledgment of having read the assent form for the study. After receiving a verbal explanation of the study rationale and procedures, children were left with their parents to discuss any questions or concerns about participation and to complete an assent form. The assent form asked each child to read a series of statements describing the study and to place a checkmark next to each statement, indicating that they understood and were willing to participate. All parents completed a separate consent form.</p>

Clinicians who administered the ADIS-C/P also completed the Kiddie-Global Assessment Scale (K-GAS) a modified version of the GAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145445512443980">Endicott, Spitzer, Fleiss, &amp; Cohen, 1976</xref>) and the Childrenâs GAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0145445512443980">Shaffer, Gould, &amp; Brasic, 1983</xref>). The K-GAS is a 9-point scale of overall functioning with ratings ranging from 1 (<italic>persistent danger of severely hurting self or others</italic>) to 9 (<italic>good functioning</italic>). In most cases, the clinician interviewed each child and parent separately; however, only parent interviews were possible in the case of children in the SM group.

<p>One parent of each child completed the Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory for Children-Parent Version (SPAIC-PV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145445512443980">Beidel, Turner, &amp; Morris, 2004</xref>), a 26-item assessment of childrenâs social anxiety, and the 118-item Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145445512443980">Achenbach, 1991</xref>). The internalizing broadband scale was used in this investigation.</p>

<title>Behavioral assessment</title>
<p>After completing the diagnostic interview, the children participated in two social interaction tasks during which electrodermal activity, blood pressure, and heart rate were assessed. The children were seated throughout the assessment. Prior to beginning the tasks, the experimenter attached the blood pressure cuff and electrodes (see psychophysiological measures below), and recorded a 10-min resting baseline. The recording equipment was located in an adjacent room, but the experimenter maintained visual and verbal contact with the children via television monitor and intercom.</p>
<p>The first task consisted of a series of five short role-plays where the children responded naturally to statements or questions posed by a same-aged peer. The content of the interactions included starting a conversation with an unfamiliar peer, offering to help another peer, giving and receiving a compliment, and responding assertively to the inappropriate behavior of a peer. During the second task, children were asked to read a childrenâs story (âJack and the Beanstalkâ or âLassieâ) for 10 min in front of a small audience that included an adult and a same-aged peer. To minimize movement induced by page turning that could interfere with the psychophysiological recording, the children read the story from a laptop computer screen, displayed in Times New Roman 36-point font. This enabled the children to scroll down the page using only small finger movements. The order of the tasks was established randomly by tossing a coin. All children were told they could end the task at any time, and children in the SM group were given a card with the word STOP to communicate their desire to end any task.</p>
<p>Tasks were videotaped and rated by an independent observer blinded to the participantsâ diagnostic status using a 4-point Likert-type scale for anxiety (1 = <italic>not at all anxious</italic> to 4 = <italic>extremely anxious</italic>) and effectiveness (1 = <italic>not at all effective</italic> to 4 = <italic>very effective</italic>). Of course, blinding was only partially effective inasmuch as the lack of verbal expression by children with SM may have indicated their status to the observers. However, observers were blinded to the studyâs hypotheses to allow, insofar as possible, unbiased observations. Interrater reliability was calculated as part of the larger treatment study, and 25% of videos were rated for interrater reliability. Intraclass correlation coefficients for anxiety during the role-play and the read-aloud tasks were .86 and <italic>r =</italic> .78, respectively. Likewise, social effectiveness ratings during the role-play and the read-aloud tasks were .98 and .96, respectively. Children also rated their anxiety during each task using a pictorial Likert-type scale (Self Assessment Manikin [SAM]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145445512443980">Bradley &amp; Lang, 1994</xref>) ranging from 1 (<italic>not at all anxious</italic>) to 5 (<italic>extremely anxious</italic>). Finally, the childrenâs latency to respond (in seconds) to the confederate during the role-play task was timed and averaged across scenes for each group.</p>

<title>Psychophysiological measures</title>
<p>Electrodermal activity was measured using a Coulbourn Instruments S71-23 isolated skin conductance module, by means of a constant voltage circuit, and Windaq Pro Version 2.63 software (DATAQ Instruments, Akron, Ohio). Before attaching the electrodes, the childâs fingers were cleansed using isopropyl-rubbing alcohol (70% by volume) and a small amount of highly conductive electrolyte gel (Parker Laboratories, Inc.) was applied onto the electrode sites. Two Ag-AgCl electrodes measuring 4 mm in diameter (Docsx Biomedical Products, Ukiah, California) were attached to the palmar surface of the middle phalanx on the childâs first and second digit, using half-inch strips of hypoallergenic surgical tape (3M, Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA). Due to the configuration of the laptop computer used for the read-aloud task, the electrodes were placed on the fingers of each childâs left hand, allowing the child to use his or her right hand to scroll the computer cursor.</p>
<p>A child-sized blood pressure cuff (100 mm; Industrial and Biomedical Sensors Corporation, Waltham, Massachusetts) was fitted around the childâs upper right arm, over the top of the childâs shirtsleeve. The cuff was secured around the childâs right arm to avoid interference with the skin conductance recordings. Systolic and diastolic readings were made every 2 min with an inflation pressure of 120 mmHg (IBS Corporation, Waltham, Massachusetts). Heart rate (in beats per minute) was measured concurrently using the same machine.</p>

<p>Means and standard deviations for clinician-, parent-, and child-report measures are depicted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0145445512443980">Table 2</xref>. Multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVA) followed by univariate analyses of variance (ANOVA) were used to assess for differences among groups. Fisherâs Least Significant Difference (LSD) test was used for all post hoc analyses. Despite the lower mean age for children in the SM group, preliminary analyses suggested that results were not significantly different when age was included as a covariate. Thus, to enhance power in the design, and based on the recommendations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0145445512443980">Miller and Chapman (2001)</xref>, age was not used as a covariate.</p>

The frequency of these responses were averaged across the groups (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0145445512443980">Table 3</xref>) and across standardized time periods (minutes 3-8 of the baseline, minutes 1-3 of the read-aloud task, and the 10-min role-play task) to calculate an average frequency/rate per minute, which was used for all analyses.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Current conceptualizations of SM propose that children with this disorder are unable to speak due to elevated levels of social anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145445512443980">Black &amp; Uhde, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145445512443980">Dummit et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0145445512443980">Sharp et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0145445512443980">Vecchio &amp; Kearney, 2005</xref>), although to date this rationale has relied primarily on subjective measures of anxiety (i.e., self-, parent, and clinician report). To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine psychophysiological variables (i.e., heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and electrodermal activity) among groups of children with SM, SP, and no diagnosis when they are engaged in social interactions. These variables were examined in conjunction with clinician, child, and parent reports of emotional functioning to further elucidate the relationship between these two disorders.</p>
<p>Childrenâs ratings of their own social distress, or parentâs ratings of their child, did not reveal between-group differences for the SM and SP groups. Consistent with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0145445512443980">Yeganeh et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0145445512443980">Yeganeh et al., 2006</xref>), children with SM and children with SP reported elevated levels of distress compared with those in the NC group, although there were no significant differences between the two anxious groups. The first explanation is that this lack of a significant difference was the result of a low sample size (e.g., reduced power) as children in this sample with SM had scores that were 8 points higher on the SPAI-C. A post hoc power analysis revealed acceptable power (Î² = .86) for this analysis. It is also possible that the lack of differences for the two groups with social anxiety resulted from the challenges of obtaining self-report data from children of such a young age (e.g., difficulty in successfully quantifying oneâs emotions). However, exploratory analyses excluding children below the age of 8 still did not reveal significant differences in self-reported anxiety during the tasks. The current study replicates previous findings in which observers (e.g., clinicians and independent evaluators) rate children with SM as suffering from more intensive social distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145445512443980">Bergman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0145445512443980">Yeganeh et al., 2003</xref>), although children with SM and SP were perceived to have equivalent levels of functional impairment. Consistent with the clinicianâs report, trained blinded observers rated children with SM as significantly more anxious and less socially effective compared with children in the SP and NC groups. The lack of significant differences between the latter two groups may have been a function of this contrast effect. Specifically, when compared with children who did not respond, the limited skill of children with SP may have been more difficult to discern.</p>
<p>Overall, these findings suggest that children with SM are viewed as more socially anxious, more distressed, and less behaviorally skilled compared with children with SP across a variety of measures. One caveat, however, is that children with SM did not speak during the behavioral tasks. Thus, blinded observer ratings were not actually blinded in the case of SM, and these data cannot address the confound that failure to speak may be subjectively interpreted as indicative of extreme distress. Silence may reflect a broad range of emotions (e.g., anger, depression, oppositionality), and it would be incorrect to immediately interpret lack of speech as indicative of overwhelming anxiety. Corroborative evidence is needed; otherwise, clinicians may misinterpret silence.</p>
<p>In this investigation, psychophysiological measures represent the most objective measures of anxiety. No significant differences in physiological response were found among the three groups using indices of heart rate and systolic blood pressure. This finding was interesting and unexpected given that children with SP tend to demonstrate heightened levels of physiological reactivity during tasks requiring them to interact socially with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145445512443980">Beidel, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0145445512443980">Turner et al., 2005</xref>). One reason for the disparate findings is that the sample size in this study was smaller than in the previous investigations. Therefore, the lack of a significant difference across groups may be reflective of the limited statistical power in each of these analyses (Î² = .20 to .44 for all analyses). Another consideration is that in this investigation, heart rate was assessed using a blood pressure/pulse rate monitor, which assessed these variables at discrete intervals but may be less sensitive than continuous recording. In an ongoing investigation in our clinic, we are replicating and extending the current investigation, using more advanced cardiac monitoring equipment that will assess cardiac reactivity continuously and will provide for a more complete picture of cardiovascular response.</p>
<p>With respect to electrodermal activity, there were group differences but not in the direction expected by the studyâs hypothesis. First and foremost, it is important to note that the observed power for analyses of SCR and SCL ranged from .13 to .15, and thus might explain a lack of significant findings throughout such analyses. Children with SM did not demonstrate heightened levels of arousal during the tasks when compared with children in the other two groups. More specifically, children with SM exhibited the lowest average number of SCRs during the read-aloud task, and exhibited levels similar to those in the NC group during the role-play task. Children in the SP group exhibited the largest average number of SCRs during both tasks. Moreover, children with SM exhibited negligible increases in SCL during the behavioral tasks in comparison to the SP and NC groups. These results suggest that children with SM did not experience heightened anxiety during the tasks relative to children in the SP group, directly contradicting the conceptualization of overwhelming anxiety in these situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145445512443980">Black &amp; Uhde, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145445512443980">Dummit et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0145445512443980">Sharp et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0145445512443980">Vecchio &amp; Kearney, 2005</xref>). However, prior to drawing firm conclusions, several caveats are presented and discussed below.</p>
<p>First, perhaps the decreased arousal displayed by these children represents successful avoidance of a distressful situation. In much the same manner that an individual with fears of heights minimizes their distress by avoiding high places, it may be that children with SM have learned a successful method of avoidance (i.e., not speaking), which then results in a decrease in anxious distress, as described by the two-factor theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0145445512443980">Mowrer, 1947</xref>). Second, the behavioral tasks used in this investigation (role-play interactions and reading aloud) were fairly simple, with few physical demands other than to sit in a chair and speak. The ability to quickly end the task through simple speech refusal may also have facilitated the use of this avoidant strategy and minimized physiological arousal. In ongoing investigations at our clinic, we are using different tasks which require nonverbal as well as verbal social engagement. These different task demands, with the inability to escape the nonverbal demands for social engagement, may indeed reveal different behavioral and physiological responses. Thus, further investigations are required for a full functional behavioral analysis of SM. One alternative currently under discussion is that SM be subsumed under the diagnostic category of SP, at least as a specifier as proposed by <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (5th ed.; <italic>DSM-5</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145445512443980">BÃ¶gels et al. 2010</xref>). Another alternative is to consider SM to be similar to the current conceptualization of school phobia (i.e., a behavior for which there may be different etiological causes).</p>
<p>There are several limitations to the current study. First, the small sample size limits raise concerns as to whether there is adequate power for all measures to detect significant differences among groups. Second, the psychophysiological measurement strategy used in this investigation only measured cardiovascular reactivity at certain intervals, not on a continuous basis. Thus, second by second, patterns of reactivity may have been obscured by assessments limited to 2-min intervals. A third limitation to the current study is the generalizability of the role-play task to everyday social interactions, which are believed to be most feared by the children in the SP and SM groups. Although they are a well-validated measure of behavioral interaction, role-play tasks may be less socially valid for preadolescent children. Thus, in the future, it will be important to provide participants with behavioral tasks that more closely mirror those found in their day-to-day activities.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, this study contributes to the current literature examining the differential symptomology between SP and SM. Specifically, this study provides the strongest data to date (i.e., psychophysiological assessment) demonstrating the lack of distinction between these two diagnostic groups and questioning the role of withholding speech in social encounters. Rather than being overwhelmed by anxious distress and therefore being unable to produce words, SM may be an effective avoidance strategy by which to decrease emotional and physiological distress. Studies underway at our clinic, along with other centers, will further elucidate the clinical presentation of these two conditions.</p>
