<abstract>
<p>Drawing upon research on federalism, localism, and professional autonomy, this article explores how educational stakeholders used social media to discuss and organize against the implementation of Differentiated Accountability in a large Florida school district. The results showed that the stakeholders used social media to engage in sense making and organizing against district policy changes. The authors also find that opposition stemmed from a sense among the commenters that aspects of the policy violated broadly accepted norms of professional autonomy. Strain across the groups ultimately detracted from the fundamental objective of raising student achievement.</p>

<p>The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), designed to provide equity in educational opportunity for low-income children, began as a funding program aiming at ameliorating the effects of poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0895904812466171">Borman, Stringfield, &amp; Slavin, 2001</xref>). As part of the War on Poverty program suite, ESEA was enacted to overcome a lack of political will and economic capacity in states, particularly Southern states, to create integrated equal education systems for all students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0895904812466171">Jennings, 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0895904812466171">Kantor &amp; Lowe, 1995</xref>). Considering that school segregation had been ruled unconstitutional in <italic>Brown v Board of Education</italic> ruling and that states and districts had continually failed to respond to the court order, ESEA was in part “a carrot” to coerce districts to comply with the Supreme Court ruling and subsequent lower-court orders to desegregate the public schools. States and districts were offered money to aid in the education of poor children so they could serve children who did not come to school with the supports of nonpoor children, and hopefully, as then-President Johnson desired, end poverty in a generation.</p>
<p>For almost 50 years, ESEA has evolved. Beginning as a program focused on providing support to states and districts for impoverished students, it is now the primary vehicle for a broader federal education policy agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0895904812466171">Cross, 2004</xref>). Not only its major piece of funding, Title I, remains focused on high-poverty students and schools, the act is also now driving state and district policy. ESEA’s recent iteration, the No Child Left Behind Act of 2002 (NCLB), cemented a new era of accountability in schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0895904812466171">McDonnell, 2005</xref>). NCLB was designed to hold schools, districts, and states accountable for the learning of each student by disaggregating data by ethnic group, economic disadvantage, language, and disability status and requiring progress for all subgroups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0895904812466171">Berry &amp; Herrington, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0895904812466171">McDonnell, 2005</xref>). Schools are judged by a dichotomous measure that determines whether the school is passing or failing based on the achievement levels of the aforementioned subgroups. NCLB has been criticized for a one-size-fits-all approach to accountability, and for its effects, namely, the sanctioning of schools that are in need of improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0895904812466171">Mintrop &amp; Sunderman, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Under the Obama administration, the U.S. Department of Education (USDE) has removed the politically charged title, “No Child Left Behind,” from USDE’s website and publication materials. The test-based accountability focus, however, has not gone away. The use of additional assessments and the development of longitudinal data systems have greatly increased the reach of current accountability policies to evaluate teachers and project student growth. Researchers have studied how various stakeholders have responded to test-based accountability documenting how principals are changing the way they staff schools, teachers are changing the way they teach students, and districts are changing the way they pay teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0895904812466171">Cohen-Vogel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0895904812466171">Figlio &amp; Kenny, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0895904812466171">Figlio &amp; Lucas, 2004</xref>; Goldhaber &amp; Figlio, 2007; Rouse et al., 2004). Some research has emerged over the past decade studying how the current accountability policy is changing the dynamics of the classroom. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0895904812466171">Spillane (2004)</xref> has done extensive research on how various stakeholders make sense of policy and interpret meanings behind the policy at various levels. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0895904812466171">Coburn (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0895904812466171">2005</xref>) has extended this line of inquiry by studying how environmental pressures in the institutional environment and nonsystem actors such as professional developers, reform organizations, and publishers influence classroom practices surrounding reading instruction. Her research also examines how districts implement evidence-based district reform and the implications for the classroom (Coburn &amp; Talbert, 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0895904812466171">Honig &amp; Coburn, 2008</xref>). Our article further extends these lines of inquiry, examining not only how school-level actors respond and navigate the tensions of accountability policy but also how they organize to ensure that their voices are heard, and in some instances, fight back against policy makers who, they feel, fail to incorporate teacher voices into the policy-making process.</p>
<p>This article continues our work on the latter years of NCLB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0895904812466171">Berry &amp; Herrington, 2011</xref>). Our perspective draws from recent literature on the challenges of intergovernmental relations in education, professional autonomy, and sense making. We utilize methods that incorporate computer-mediated discourse analysis to unpack educational policy implementation. The purpose of this article is to extend our understanding of the evolving educational reform movement by analyzing how local stakeholders respond to the implementation of accountability policy at the district and school level. This research informs the knowledge base on the latter years of NCLB and adds to the research on how current accountability practices create new political tensions as policy implementation becomes more focused on the classroom level.</p>

<title>What Is Differentiated Accountability?</title>
<p>In 2008, in response to state demands for a more nuanced approach to accountability under NCLB, the USDE initiated pilot programs that waived some of the more punitive consequences of NCLB and offered a differentiated approach to measuring outcomes and assisting schools in need of improvement (SINIs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0895904812466171">Berry &amp; Herrington, 2011</xref>). The two main policy vehicles offered to states were the Growth Model Pilot Project and the Differentiated Accountability (DA) pilot program. This analysis focuses on the latter.</p>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0895904812466171">USDE (2008)</xref> adopted a Differentiated Accountability pilot program in an attempt to ensure that states could target accountability to the specific needs of their state. The program allowed the merging of the federal accountability system with accountability systems of the respective states. This merger of systems not only helped some states identify the schools that were in varying degrees of need but also to differentiate interventions according to depth of the need. The pilot program began with six states, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, and expanded to 17 states by the summer of 2010. While the policy responses to DA initiated differed across the states, one of the strongest responses was in the state of Florida. In 2009, Florida extended provisions in the pilot program to <italic>all</italic> public schools in the state. The extension established an integrated statewide system for school improvement and accountability aligned with the federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act (§1008.33(7), F.S.). But by including non–Title I schools, more schools—many of which had not been subject to interventions under the original NCLB provisions—found themselves facing possible state and district intervention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0895904812466171">
<title>Florida’s Approach to Differentiated Accountability</title>
<p>Although the previous accountability program in Florida, Assistance Plus, included some of the elements of the DA plan, the DA plan represented a new, more hands-on role for the state in the lowest-performing schools. SINIs were split into five categories: Prevent I, Prevent II, Correct I, Correct II, and Intervene. Prevent I and Prevent II schools were schools that did not meet AYP for 2 to 4 consecutive years. Correct I and Correct II schools were schools that did not meet AYP for more than 4 years. The differentiation between schools that were Prevent or Correct I versus Prevent or Correct II was that schools that were graded as a “D” were placed in the II category. All schools graded as “F” were placed in the Correct II category, regardless of AYP status. Schools placed in the Intervene category were schools that had consistently received school grades of F (4 in the past 6 years), Correct II-D schools that had more than 65% of the students not proficient in reading or math, and Correct II-D schools that have increases in nonproficiency in reading and math based on the scores 5 years prior to that year. Strategies for schools that fell into the Correct and Intervene levels of the matrix included, but were not limited to, the regular review and replacement of teachers and administrators, full staffing by the first day of school, district-provided instructional coaches who kept mandated daily logs of activities, differentiated and performance pay, summer professional development, instructional pacing guides, extension of the learning day, and regular reporting to the district and state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0895904812466171">Florida Department of Education [FLDoE], 2009c</xref>).</p>
<p>The primary state strategy for assisting districts under the new plan was the use of regional teams that consisted of content area instructional specialists led by a regional director (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0895904812466171">FLDoE, 2009a</xref>). These regional teams were responsible for supporting and assisting teachers and school administrators in the Correct II and Intervene schools as well as Correct I schools in the lowest 5% of performance in the state. The DA regional teams not only served as support for the district and schools targeted as in need of improvement but also served as accountability compliance officers that were to impose corrective action if schools were not complying with the strategies and support offered by the state. At the local level, several districts focused on school improvement efforts to increase student achievement and avoid the state scrutiny that occurs once a school enters graduated levels of categories within the Differentiated Accountability matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0895904812466171">FLDoE, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Schools in Prevent I and Correct I were required to use Florida’s Continuous Improvement Model (FCIM) with their subgroups not meeting AYP. Prevent II, Correct II, and Intervene schools were required to use FCIM school wide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0895904812466171">FLDoE, 2009c</xref>). FCIM involved using data-driven policies and programs to drive instruction and to increase achievement, particularly among the lowest-performing students and subgroups. The intent of the model was to guide teachers to use data to individualize instruction in areas where students needed additional support. FCIM employed a procedure for instruction that combined effective schools literature with the aspects of “total quality management,” a management approach widely applied in the business world. Part of this process requires the use of assessments, which provide data, to drive the instructional process. Key to this philosophy of education is the “no excuses” approach that asserts that every child can learn no matter his or her life circumstances and that those circumstances should not be used as rationale for low achievement. The FCIM cycle of “Plan-Do-Check-Act” was to be used by districts and schools to ensure that students are receiving the education they need. The district had to monitor the implementation of FCIM and prescribe interim (baseline, mid-year, and mini) assessments for students scoring Levels 1 to 3 in reading, writing, mathematics, and science in those schools that fall into the more intensive levels of the accountability matrix. Also, schools that fall into Correct II or Intervene status must participate in the Florida Assessments for Instruction in Reading (FAIR) state tests.</p>

<title>Intergovernmental Tension in Policy Implementation</title>
<p>Federalist tension has always existed in education policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0895904812466171">Jennings, 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0895904812466171">McDonnell, 2005</xref>). As education is primarily a responsibility of states, and states up until the mid-20th century delegated most of this responsibility to local districts, the intervention of the federal government in education policy has been seen by some as an intrusion and an overstepping of the bounds of the federal government. Initially, ESEA provided additional funds to school districts with the goal of equalizing the quality of education across students from families of all income levels. Accountability to the federal government by states was limited to assuring that the funds had been expended properly. However, after the release of <italic>A Nation at Risk</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0895904812466171">National Commission on Excellence in Education [NCEE], 1983</xref>), the focus shifted from one of equity to a focus on excellence. Claims by the NCEE that students in the United States were falling behind students of other first-world countries shifted the focus from fiscal compliance to educational effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0895904812466171">Borman, Stringfield, &amp; Slavin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0895904812466171">Cross, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0895904812466171">McDonnell, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Whereas this shift continued to develop over the 80s and 90s, the enactment of NCLB in 2002 marked a significant milestone. Federal requirements for the development of state tests and proficiency standards led to a new era of accountability where states were to comply with mandates from the federal government while working toward the common goal of excellence in student achievement.</p>
<p>This shift, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0895904812466171">Lee (2010)</xref>, began an era of states subverting stronger accountability policy by masking performance. Lee argued that under NCLB states work with the federal government to achieve the common goal of raising student achievement for all students. However, because the federal government holds the funds for improvement and threatens to issues sanctions to states for a lack of performance, states are also under pressure to mask low performance. This theme of cooperative and competitive (or coercive) federalism is found more frequently in policy and public administration literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0895904812466171">May &amp; Burby, 1996</xref>) but has application in education policy. Because these two types of federalism are functioning at the same time, this creates, in Lee’s words, a system of “bipolar federalism” where states cooperate with the federal policy, yet subvert it at the same time. Although Lee situates his analysis at the federal-state relationship, we extend his arguments to the state/local level.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0895904812466171">
<title>Tensions at the Local Level</title>
<p>States and districts are called upon to work together to increase student achievement and to respect each other’s level of control, legal autonomy, and authority. This creates a series of tensions for players at the local level as they try to negotiate with the state in its twin roles of providing assistance and enforcing compliance. The state offers help to local districts that are, for all practical purposes, forced to receive that help.</p>
<p>This tension erupts at the local level because localities are often responsible for the implementation of reform but are not the primary players in formulating the policies. This creates a peculiar situation for district leaders who become the face of accountability implementation and may become the target of local public ire as they attempt to carry out reforms developed (and sometimes mandated) by the federal and state governments.</p>
<p>This tension plays out for teachers in the classrooms as well. Over the past 30 years, the standards movement has limited teachers’ influence over content, and the accountability movement of the past 10 years has altered how teachers deliver the content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0895904812466171">Day, 2002</xref>). A number of scholars have tried to unpack, both theoretically and empirically, how this comes to pass. Day theorizes that the meaning of the work of a professional educator has been redefined by accountability policies that fostered the development of two types of teachers. One has a professional identity that includes responsibility for the whole child and the other one is whose professionalism is focused on the technical and instrumental skills needed to help the student master content measured by standardized assessments. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0895904812466171">Wills and Sandholtz (2009)</xref>, however, argue that teacher professionalism is not absent in an era of test-based accountability but is being redefined as a sort of “constrained professionalism.” When strategies for instructional and curricular improvement are centralized at higher levels of government, the classroom teacher’s zone of discretion regarding instructional strategies narrows. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0895904812466171">Au (2011)</xref> argues that the adoption by districts or schools of highly specific curricula specifically designed to support the reliance on testing further reduces teachers’ discretion.</p>
<p>In previous years, teachers have been characterized as street-level bureaucrats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0895904812466171">Lipsky, 1980</xref>) who enjoy a goodly amount of discretion in deciding when and how and even whether to implement reform strategies. In one often repeated formulation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0895904812466171">Tyack and Cuban (1995)</xref> argue that “reform often stopped at the classroom door.” However, under the new accountability pressures, teachers can no longer “simply ‘shut the door’ and teach ‘what’ or ‘how’ they will” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0895904812466171">Cohen-Vogel &amp; Rutledge, 2009</xref>, p. 106). In their analysis of how school leaders respond to the challenges of state and federal mandates, Cohen-Vogel and Rutledge find that instructional arrangements such as teacher staffing, curriculum, and instructional time are altered at the school level based on accountability policy. Reform is not limited to the periphery but penetrates core technology of schooling: classroom instruction.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0895904812466171">Fitzgerald (2008)</xref> argued that this erosion of autonomy has developed in many nations due to a policy narrative that identifies teachers and schools as a problem in need of an audit-like intervention by the state. A “politics of mistrust,” as Fitzgerald terms it, drawing from the concept of street-level bureaucrats, has served to further alter the professional nature of teachers’ work.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0895904812466171">
<title>Sense Making in Local Implementation</title>
<p>Research on cognition shows that there is a sense-making process that occurs during implementation of new reforms at the local level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0895904812466171">Spillane, Reiser, &amp; Reimer, 2002</xref>). A teacher’s previous knowledge, or “the way it used to be,” does not disappear when teachers confront a new policy. Teachers engage in a cognitive battle of sense making and attempt to merge the new way of work with their previous ideas. Spillane et al. also substantiate a strong bias toward prior beliefs. People resist change even when presented with new information, further increasing tensions.</p>
<p>This sense-making process is not limited to teachers; it also occurs with parents. Refrains of “this isn’t the way I was taught” or “I wish they could just teach math the way I learned it” are common with parents. This suggests a sense-making process occurs with parents who fail to understand or appreciate policy changes in the classroom. Students are placed in a precarious position of having to manage the sense-making processes of their parents and its impact on the relationship between the teachers and the school.</p>

<title>Social Media as a Sharing Mechanism</title>
<p>Social media has created an electronic discourse that, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0895904812466171">Davis and Brewer (1997)</xref>, “has the immediacy characteristic of speech and the permanence characteristic of writing” (back cover). According to Dennen and Pashnyak, online interactions have become “fairly common with individuals looking for advice, social support, or to connect with those who share common interests or hobbies” (p. 274). Although blog postings are important, the authors write that “comments provide more data than links; they are evidence not only that someone is aware of another blog, but of an individual’s thoughts about a blog or blog post” (p. 274). People tend to use blogs for a variety of reasons. Research consistently finds that blogs are used to share information, explore identity, and develop relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0895904812466171">Dennen &amp; Pashnyak, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0895904812466171">Hersberger, Murray, &amp; Rioux, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0895904812466171">Schmidt, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>As the world has seen regimes overthrown in the past 2 years that were advanced by, in part, social media, it is evident that social media can be used as powerful tool to share ideas in the public sphere. This article explores how social media may strengthen and amplify the voices of supporters and opponents of education policy. They provide a platform to share ideas and thoughts more broadly. Discussions that might in the past have been limited to faculty lounges may extend more easily across the district, across the states, and with the world at large. Likewise, power imbalances that might prove difficult to challenge in the “real” world may be breached in new and novel ways in an online environment.</p>
<p>With the advent of education blogs, newspaper websites, and social media venues, such as Facebook and Twitter, teachers have shared their thoughts on education policies that have direct effects on the classroom. Researchers can examine these new forms of media to get a more detailed picture of how policies are perceived.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0895904812466171">1</xref></sup></p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Computer-mediated discourse analysis (CMDA) is a formal tool developed to help analyze the content and features of social media communications. CMDA helps illuminate the discourses in a community that might feel distanced from the more direct arenas where policies are formed and discussed (Dennen, Myers, &amp; Suggs, 2010). We used computer-mediated discourse analysis to examine communications across a district in Florida charged with implementing elements of the new Differentiated Accountability system. The district serves approximately 180,000 students, with approximately 10% English Language Learners, and 15%students with disabilities. Minority enrollment is slightly above 60% (FLDoE, 2010), and about half of the students are free or reduced lunch eligible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0895904812466171">FLDoE, 2009b</xref>). For our analysis, we drew data from the website of the major newspaper whose market included the district. Other information was found, as appropriate, in state statutes and rules and policy guidance documents describing the state policies and state-sanctioned practices.</p>
<p>The focus of our data collection was article postings from the newspaper from September to November 2009, as the Differentiated Accountability system was first introduced in the district and then scaled back, as a response in large part to objections raised by educators and other actors. The policy did not go away; however, the district removed the classroom intervention pieces from all the schools in the district and instead focused on using the classroom interventions in the low-performing schools. Much of this played out in the traditional and social media. The online version of the newspaper provided relatively thorough coverage of the curricular and assessment changes underway. We limited our analysis to the 542 “comments” that were posted during that time period. We used pattern coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0895904812466171">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>) to derive major themes characterizing how the commenters responded to the policies set forth by the state.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>We were particularly struck by the clear efforts by teachers, parents, students, and community members to try and make sense of the reforms the district was proposing. Some commenters tried to situate the policy into their prior knowledge of NCLB. Commenters and district administrators often expressed support for the same goal: ensuring that students receive a high-quality education and increasing student achievement. Disagreements were over the means to achieve them.</p>
<p>Many stakeholders at the local level pushed back on DA objecting to what they were experiencing: an onslaught of testing with too little time for instruction to help the students master the material.</p>
<p>Teachers and students used the comments to discuss how new policies encroach on teaching and learning. Teachers, parents, and students failed to see how the district and school administrators were assisting in raising student achievement. They questioned a top-down approach by the administration, which they considered arbitrary. The administration seemed to require processes that prevented teachers and parents applying their judgment and experience to determine what was best for their students and children.</p>

<title>Frustration Over Perceived Lack of Trust and Lack of Respect</title>
<p>Teacher and parent commenters objected to state-sanctioned practices they deemed overly specific in regards to instruction at the classroom level. Four practices, in particular, were mentioned repeatedly as intrusive and a barrier to teachers ability to tailor their practice to what they perceived as the needs of their students: Common board configurations that mandate the instructional content teachers should display on their classroom black or white boards, district-mandated lesson plans, the use of instructional pacing guides and focus calendars that tell teachers which benchmarks and standards they should be teaching daily, and administrative walkthroughs that ensured compliance with the policy.</p>
<p>The issue of trust—or lack of trust—was raised. This view is evident in one bloggers remarks:
<disp-quote>
<p>Low trust is an unseen cost in life and business because it creates hidden agendas and guarded communication, thereby slowing decision-making. The lack of trust teachers, administrators, and parents have in [the Superintendent] and this plan has significantly impacted our entire education system. Our children are paying the price! A lack of trust stymies innovation and productivity. Our teachers would be the first to tell you the “Continuous Improvement Model” has stolen their innovation, productivity, and effectiveness in the classroom. Trust, on the other hand, produces speed because it feeds collaboration, loyalty and ultimately, results. Good leaders know that if their followers don’t trust them, they’ll stop following them.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This commenter mentioned the values of innovation, productivity, and effectiveness in the classroom and discussed how children are suffering because of the lack of those values in the classroom. The commenter blames the superintendent and FCIM for the lack of trust and missing elements in the classroom. A number of commenters who identified themselves as teachers stated that their ability to be effective required that they be allowed to use their own expertise to tailor their practice to their diagnoses of student needs. A commenter states:
<disp-quote>
<p>I have spent well over five years putting a thoughtful, meaningful mathematics curriculum together that addresses my students’ needs, expectations, challenges and curiosities and love for learning. Oh yes, it automatically addresses the benchmarks. That is a considerable amount of time bringing in research-based strategies proven to work in the classroom. Oh yes, and FCAT scores are high as a result. But they are high in my classroom because I know from my years of experience what works and what does not. My master’s degree in mathematics and my National Board certification certainly only enhance my ability to bring my students to new heights in the learning and true understanding of the mathematics I present. . . . my carefully laid out curriculum has been instantly ditched for a NEW curriculum put together over this summer that relies on testing, testing, testing of RANDOM benchmarks that do not follow the lessons being taught. Today I am told to teach geometry but the problem of the day (embedded assessment) focuses on probability. Does that make sense to anyone? Tomorrow when I teach geometry again, the embedded assessment question deals with algebra . . . and so on and so on.</p>
<p>Today I received another seven pages of continued, “how to set up my classroom,” to conform to the master plan. Thank you to those who walked through my classroom for a total of ten minutes not understanding the math that had gone on for the entire six weeks.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This commenter seems to be upset by the new policy’s lack of the acknowledgment of his or her professional judgment. She lays out her level of experience (5 years), her education level (masters), and her credentials (National Board Certification). She discusses her lesson plans and their alignment with the standards, and her students’ high student test scores, which she believes are a result of her efforts. The commenter expresses frustration that the new policy developed over one summer has replaced her professional expertise, offended by the new curriculum not sequenced in a way that makes sense, and is angered by how in a short amount of time the policy replaced her years of education, experience, and credentialing.</p>

<title>Uncertainty of the Role of the District in Guiding Classroom Practice</title>
<p>Other commenters were pulled in both directions, supporting the district administration’s intentions, if not practice, and sharing parents’ frustration with a strong presence of administrators in classroom practice.</p>
<p>This post from a self-identified science coach exhibits this tension.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>As a science coach I am biased about this program. I realize it was very challenging and understand the frustrations of everyone, but there has to be some form of accountability and if that resides with principles [sic], I am sorry, we are back to square one. Or, if we base educational reform on how the students react at home then we will be going backwards. The District needs to get involved. Also, I feel as though there were more rumors and misinformation about the program fueling the fire of the [District Official] “witch-hunt.” I saw some amazing positive changes taking place throughout my school and within classroom instruction in just a couple weeks. . . . It was like someone hit a switch and teachers went scrambling to find their hands-on manipulatives that have been sitting in their closets collecting dust for years. . . . At the heart of this program was sound philosophy and educational research based accountability. All of the other details could have been adjusted to be more practical and in the end we all would have won. Instead, we just extinguished our best chance at improving public education in [District].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is important to note that this comment comes from a science coach, who may have a hybrid role as a teacher and an administrator. Although the coach sympathizes with teacher frustration, he or she recognizes the need for a change to increase accountability for teachers reluctant to change. The coach also makes note that the reforms were based in sound philosophy and research and that protest against the reforms actually harm the student.</p>
<p>Another user’s remarks expressed this seemingly contradictory view:
<disp-quote>
<p>To everyone else so quick to comment . . . know that the teachers are doing their best to adhere to Florida’s Continuous Improvement Model and still make a difference in the kids’ lives. The new lesson plans, etc. are helping both newer teachers and those that lack the creativity to create their own lessons and are used to just assigning book pages. That being said, [Superintendent] has not had a strong teacher following for YEARS. It is my belief that he hired [Chief Academic Officer] to be his scapegoat. Upon meeting [CAO] and expressing many concerns, I no longer see him as the problem. Many of these changes were put in place by the state last year, and are just coming to [District] now. So parents, keep supporting the teachers, and together, we can get [the Superintendent] to realize that he does not have teacher &amp; student interests at heart.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>On one hand, the commenter states that teachers are trying to attend to FCIM, which he or she believes is helping new teachers and teachers who “assign book pages.” This commenter also makes the point that these reforms are out of the district’s control. On the other hand, the teacher shares that he or she is still trying to make a difference, implying that the superintendent does not support teacher and student interests.</p>

<title>Mobilization Against Reform</title>
<p>Commenters who identified as teachers worked together with parents and students to respond to district reforms. Commenters referred blog readers to Facebook, Twitter, blogs, and other websites and encouraged them to write editorial letters and organize rallies against the district. In the comments section of the newspaper’s article posts, formal and grassroots advocacy groups, interest groups, and others often posted their real names and contact information to encourage readers to compel district administrators to collaborate with teachers and parents. Other parents provided links to online polls and encouraged them to register their opposition to the new reforms by taking the poll. Other commenters informed readers of all the outlets (e.g., television channels, internet, and websites) where the school district meetings would be shown. There are also posts from students who encourage parents and teachers to take action, as evident by one user’s post:
<disp-quote>
<p>We need everyone’s support! Tomorrow . . . between 4:00 pm and 8:00 pm please show up at the school board whether you are a tax payer, parent, principal, student, etc. and show your support. The [School Board Office] is located [Street Directions]. If you have it, please wear Orange. If you can afford it, please bring a Pumpkin with a Sad Face to leave behind as a memory. We plan on showing them this is not just a few wacked out parents. . . . Staff—Don’t be afraid. Nobody will be fired that shows up as you will have thousands of witnesses. It’s time for the intimidation to stop. It’s time for the fear to stop. For the first time in history this problem is going to [be] resolved. Our Future Depends on it. There has never been a more important time for your voice to be heard. Our children are our future. We want nothing but the best. Our teachers work night and day teaching our kids and we need to support their efforts.</p>

<title>Discussion and Implications</title>
<p>By examining how local stakeholders used social media to share information about the impacts of Florida’s Differentiated Accountability policy on classroom instruction, this study adds to the literature on the challenges of federalism in accountability policy and institutional challenges of localism in education policy. Furthermore, it also opens a new area of research on the use of virtual spaces to construct meaning around educational policy in a politically charged environment.</p>
<p>As pressure of the NCLB accountability timeframe intensifies, DA from the federal government allowed states to resolve an increasing point of tension—alignment of state accountability policies with the federal NCLB policies. By choosing to extend Florida’s NCLB accountability framework to all schools including non–Title I schools, the state achieved improved consistency and coherence for its statewide accountability system, but it also increased tensions at the local level. The state’s insistence on a set of prescriptions for persistently low-performing schools generated resistance by local educators to their sense of autonomy and ability to use their detailed knowledge of their students to tailor their own interventions. Frustration may be easier to express on the local level as the proximity of the actors from one another decreases, and blame can be more focused. This creates a challenging environment for local administrators. Those who are charged with implementing the policy, district and school employees may experience additional tension among themselves, which may in turn impact policy implementation. Parental dissatisfaction with what they may see as classroom intrusion only adds to the tension and unrest. Furthermore, by including schools that were not Title I schools and thus not accustomed to outside scrutiny and even less to externally imposed prescriptions for improving instruction, the new DA policy increased the percentage of educators who might join a nascent move to collective opposition. Finally, the new DA policy heightened the actual and the perceived sense of the encroachment of accountability-driven prescriptions into the classroom.</p>
<p>District-level response to stakeholder resistance to the reforms varied from damage control to intense conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0895904812466171">Wirt &amp; Kirst, 2005</xref>). The variation resulted from an attempt to navigate pressures from the state that are in conflict with pressures from local parents and teachers. The superintendent attempted to stay “on message” and defend the decisions of the district and the state to focus on the use of data and common configurations and lesson plans for classroom practice. Although some superintendents in other districts not included in this analysis attempted to massage the frustrations of the teachers and parents, the superintendent in this district assertively defended the interventions as necessary in raising student achievement. The district administration stood in firm opposition to the pressure that the parents put on the district. The superintendent and his main academic staff reached out to local media to further defend their stance on the policy changes and stood strong in their opposition to concessions that parents and teachers desired. In turn, the rhetoric became more heated.</p>
<p>Our findings are consistent with previous research that identifies major fault lines between how states interpret their role and obligations in enforcing state and federal accountability policies and how many educators see the policies of NCLB as counterproductive to school improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0895904812466171">Hacsi, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0895904812466171">Mintrop &amp; Sunderman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0895904812466171">Popham, 2005</xref>). In an attempt to reduce the likelihood of students receiving poor instruction, policy makers have attempted to standardize elements of instruction and to structure teaching in a way that focuses on maximizing student achievement. Classroom practice is now the focus of intervention. The adoption of common board configurations, lesson plans, and instructional calendars with school, district, and state administrative walkthroughs has been successful in challenging the status quo and in creating a sense of urgency among teachers that practice must change, but this success has come with a cost. In response to DA waivers that allow states to tailor their policies and programs to their own diagnoses, the state and the local districts have adopted even more standardized policies and programs to implement the federal program.</p>
<p>Although our findings suggests that the goal of increased student achievement is commonly shared among parents, teachers, administrators, and policy makers, having a common goal was not sufficient to overcome strong resistance to state and district interventions, especially as they encroach on classroom practice. If this tension is to be overcome, accountability policy will have to incorporate a better balance between higher-level intervention and professional knowledge and be implemented in a manner that does not insult professional educators and parents or be viewed as shortchanging students. Interventions that polarize various actors run the risk of creating further upheaval and turmoil in schools between district and school-level personnel and between parents and educators. That is to say, we fear that in the name of improved student achievement on one hand and respect for the professional knowledge and teacher autonomy on the other, students may end up even further victimized, victims of the tensions in a system in protracted upheaval.</p>

<p>The use of online spaces is a new area of discovery that is ripe for research. At this point, we are not very sure how online discourse is affecting the dissemination of knowledge or the spread of activism, and we are not quite certain how drastically the study of virtual spaces differs with that of physical spaces. However, we do know that people are connecting virtually to share information and that interest groups, advocacy organizations, and individuals are intentionally crafting their social media presence in a way to influence the policy discussion. We as researchers should not take this for granted but ensure that we are examining the discussion that is occurring in these spaces. This article attempts to do that by exploring how people use newer, technological forms of communication to construct meaning about accountability policy, communicate among themselves and to the public about how the policy impacts classroom life, and navigate issues and concerns with the implementation of accountability policy within the walls of the classroom.</p>
