<abstract>
<p>The lighting industry relies on colour-rendering index (CRI) and correlated colour temperature (CCT) to communicate the colour properties of light sources. While advances have been made in recent years to develop new metrics for colour rendering, not much attention has been given to the validity or utility of CCT for communicating the appearance of illumination. Recently, it was shown that a wide range of chromaticities can appear ‘white’ or with minimal perceived ‘tint’. Importantly, these chromaticities do not follow the line of blackbody radiation, the reference for CCT. The present study builds on this previous research to determine whether ‘white’ illumination is preferred in simulated residential applications. Results presented here support the hypothesis that people prefer ‘white’ or minimally ‘tinted’ sources of illumination.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1477153512442936"><title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>With regard to the intersection of colour perception and illumination, there are two metrics on which the lighting industry relies, colour-rendering index (CRI) and correlated colour temperature (CCT).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1477153512442936">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1477153512442936">2</xref></sup> The industry relies on the former as a measure of how well the colour of objects will be revealed under the illumination, while it relies on the latter as a measure of the appearance of the illumination itself.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1477153512442936">2</xref></sup> There has been renewed interest in examining the validity and utility of CRI as a measure of the colour-rendering properties of a light source used for illumination. Briefly, several colour-rendering metrics are now being discussed either as a replacement for CRI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1477153512442936">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1477153512442936"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1477153512442936"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1477153512442936"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1477153512442936"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1477153512442936"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1477153512442936"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477153512442936"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1477153512442936">11</xref></sup> or as an adjunct to CRI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1477153512442936">12</xref></sup> Little attention has been given, however, to the validity and utility of CCT as a measure of the colour appearance of the illumination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1477153512442936">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1477153512442936">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1477153512442936">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recently, Rea and Freyssinier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1477153512442936">15</xref></sup> showed that, in the illuminant viewing mode,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1477153512442936">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1477153512442936">17</xref></sup> a wide range of chromaticities would appear ‘white’ or at least have minimum perceived ‘tint’. These empirical findings are at odds with perceptions of ‘white’ or minimum ‘tint’ when assessing luminous targets in the aperture mode. For a small disk in an otherwise dark field, as would be true for signal lights, the perception of ‘white’ is associated with a small area in chromaticity space.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1477153512442936">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1477153512442936"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1477153512442936">20</xref></sup> When viewing the interior of an illuminated box, however, the perception of ‘white’ traces a line in chromaticity space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1477153512442936">Figure 1</xref>). Although the chromaticities along this ‘white’ line are not metamers, they are all perceived as having minimal ‘tint’ for a given CCT. Importantly, the ‘white’ illumination line of chromaticities is not the same as the line of chromaticities for blackbody radiation. Thus, in the illuminant viewing mode as would exist for architectural lighting applications, a point of minimal ‘tint’ can be found for <italic>any</italic> CCT between 6500 K and 2700 K, and these ‘white’ points often look more similar to one another than each does to illumination of the same CCT. Interestingly, since the current standards for sources of white illumination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1477153512442936">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1477153512442936">22</xref></sup> are closely tied to the line for blackbody radiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1477153512442936">Figure 1</xref>), the vernacular of describing fabricated light sources as providing ‘warm’ and ‘cool’ illumination are, in part, artifacts of selecting the blackbody line as a reference for standardization.

<p>Subjects in the Rea and Freyssinier study evaluated the colour of illumination provided to the inside of an empty, hollow cube.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1477153512442936">15</xref></sup> In the present experiment, scale models of residential spaces were used to determine whether the estimates of ‘white’ illumination from Rea and Freyssinier might have more direct applicability to lighting practice.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1477153512442936"><title>2.1. Overview</title>
<p>Two experiments were conducted, both using two scale models of a residential living room. One scale model employed a ‘warm’ décor dominated by brown colours while the other employed a ‘cool’ décor dominated by blue colours. The primary goal of the first experiment was to compare subjective assessments of the two residential décors when each was illuminated by an incandescent (halogen) lamp, a light source commonly used in residential applications, or by a ‘white’ source with good colour-rendering properties and of the same CCT (2700 K). Two different illuminance levels, representing a wide range for residential applications (28 lx and 306 lx), were used so that, as a secondary goal, a ‘typical’ illuminance level could be selected for the second experiment. The primary goal of the second experiment was to compare subjective preferences of sources of illumination of different CCT at an illuminance level ‘typical’ of residences in North America (75 lx). Two sources, one 2700 K and one 3500 K, had chromaticities on or near the blackbody line and two sources, also 2700 K and 3500 K, had chromaticities on the ‘white’ line derived from the previous study by Rea and Freyssinier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1477153512442936">Figure 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1477153512442936">15</xref></sup> All sources had high CRI values.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1477153512442936"><title>2.2. Observers</title>
<p>Representing both genders and a wide range of ages, ten males and six females volunteered as subjects in the two studies with a mean age of 43.4 years (SD = 13.7 years) and a median age of 43.5 years (range = 23–63 years). All had colour normal vision as determined by the Ishihara pseudo-isochromatic plates screening test.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1477153512442936">23</xref></sup> The experimental procedure was approved by Rensselaer’s Institute Review Board.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1477153512442936"><title>2.3. Apparatus</title>
<p>Two self-contained (12:1) scale models of a residential living room were used in the study. Both models, 0.38 m by 0.38 m by 0.27 m, had the same layout and type of dollhouse furniture; however, their colour schemes differed. One room had brown upholstery and carpet while the other had blue furnishings. The scale models had a 0.20 m by 0.10 m window on the front wall so that the interiors could be viewed by subjects at what would be a normal viewing height if they were about to enter the living room (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1477153512442936">Figure 2</xref>). The walls and the floors of both models were painted matte white with ceiling paint. There were no ceilings on the models so that controlled illumination could be provided to their interiors.

The room lights were on for the purpose of the photograph only</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1477153512442936-fig2.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The models were designed to slide into a tabletop viewing box previously described by Rea and Freyssinier.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1477153512442936">15</xref></sup> Briefly, the viewing box was a hollow cube, 0.56 m on a side, with a ceiling compartment containing a variety of computer-controlled (12-bit resolution) light sources (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1477153512442936">Table 1</xref>) that could provide diffuse illumination to the floor of the hollow cube. The viewing box was calibrated for the present experiment to provide 306 lx ± 6 lx at the center of the miniature table from four selected combinations of sources (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1477153512442936">Table 2</xref>). Spatially, the illuminance distribution across the viewing boxes was very uniform. For a given source and viewing box, the standard deviation of illuminance in the plane of the miniature table (nine measurements) was 8%. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1477153512442936">Figure 1</xref>, two sources had a CCT of 2700 K and two had a CCT of 3500 K, while two sources had chromaticities on or near the blackbody line and two had chromaticities on the ‘white’ line derived from Rea and Freyssinier (noted by the letters B and W in the tables).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1477153512442936">15</xref></sup> Screens made of a fine, achromatic wire mesh were cut to the size of the model ceilings to provide, as necessary, 28 lx ± 0.5 lx and 75 lx ± 1 lx on the scale model tables without measurably changing the spatial distribution and, presumably, the spectral irradiance distributions. It should be noted that the spectral irradiance distributions were different for the two scale models due to the internal reflections from the coloured furniture (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1477153512442936">Table 3</xref>). During operation of the experiment, an illuminance meter and a tristimulus sensor (HCT-99; Gigahertz-Optik, Newburyport, MA) inside the hollow cube (not inside the scale models) provided active feedback to maintain the illuminance within ± 1 lx and the chromaticities within a 0.6 step MacAdam ellipse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1477153512442936">24</xref></sup> for a given experimental condition. It is worth emphasizing that since it is possible to create light sources with the same chromaticity but very different colour rendering properties, it was necessary to create sources for this experiment with similar colour rendering properties as well as identical chromaticities. After earlier recommendations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1477153512442936">12</xref></sup> regarding CRI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1477153512442936">25</xref></sup> and gamut area index (GAI),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1477153512442936">26</xref></sup> both 3500 K sources and the 2700 K ‘white’ source were created so that their CRI and GAI values were both high. The spectral irradiance distribution of the 2700 K incandescent source, having a high CRI value (98) and a low GAI value (51), was not modified because this is a source commonly used in residential applications.

<p>Subjects participated in two experiments. In the first one, the two 2700 K sources each provided illuminance levels of 28 lx ± 0.5 lx and 306 lx ± 6 lx in the scale model rooms with the brown and the blue décors. These average levels cover the range recommended by the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America for activities from circulation, relaxation, and conversation to casual reading and ordinary visual tasks in residential applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1477153512442936">1</xref></sup> Both illuminance levels were seen by subjects for a given room décor before presentation of the two illuminance levels in the second room décor. Illuminance level presentation order was counterbalanced within subjects; room décors were counterbalanced across subjects. In the second experiment, all four sources provided 75 lx ± 1 lx in the two rooms. This average level was selected to represent a ‘typical’ value for residential applications that could be achieved with wire-mesh mechanical dimming of the scale model rooms. All four sources were seen by subjects for one room décor before presenting the four sources with the second room décor. Room décor presentation order was counterbalanced across subjects; sources were counterbalanced within and across subjects. Subjects completed each experiment in less than one hour but, depending upon the subject, the two room décors were seen in one or two sessions. All sessions were conducted between 9:00 am and 12:00 (noon). In both experiments, each combination of light source, illuminance level, and room décors was evaluated once.</p>
<p>Prior to each trial, the experimenter-selected experimental condition (room décor, light source, and illuminance level) was automatically stabilized by the computer. Stabilization took less than 10 seconds during which time the subjects were instructed to close or cover their eyes. Once the experimenter saw that the light output was stable, subjects were instructed to view the selected condition for several seconds prior to making their evaluation. Rea and Freyssinier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1477153512442936">15</xref></sup> showed that, in the illuminant mode, light appearing slightly ‘tinted’ immediately upon viewing appeared less ‘tinted’ after 45 seconds viewing, while ‘untinted’ light always appeared ‘white’ independent of viewing time. Thus, for this study, it was expected that light from ‘tinted’ sources would appear less so after several seconds of viewing.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1477153512442936">Figure 3</xref> shows the questions asked of each subject for each experimental condition in both experiments. Subjects were first asked to rate the lighting in each room using a 10-interval rating scale with end-point designations of ‘strongly dislike it’ and ‘strongly like it.’ A similar scale with end-point designations of ‘much brighter’ and ‘much dimmer’ was used to rate the apparent brightness of the scale model room as compared to a ‘typical’ living room in the experience of each observer. Subjects were requested to state the integer values on both scales that best represented their answers to those questions. The subjects were also asked to rank order (1 being most important to 4 being least important) the four salient features of the room (wood elements, walls, fabric, and carpet) as to how much each influenced their evaluation. Finally, three financial questions were posed to the subjects to assess the value they placed on each lighting condition.

<p>The ‘like-dislike’ ratings were submitted to a 2 (chromaticity, on or near the blackbody line or on the ‘white’ line) by 2 (illuminance level, 28 lx or 306 lx) by 2 (room décor, blue or brown) repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA).

</fig></p>
<p>The ‘brighter-dimmer’ ratings were also submitted to a 2 by 2 by 2 repeated measures ANOVA. As with the ‘like-dislike’ ratings, there were significant main effects of chromaticity (F<sub>1,15</sub> = 9.70; <italic>p</italic> = 0.007) and of illuminance level (F<sub>1,15</sub> = 67.57; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and no other terms reached statistical significance. One-sample <italic>t</italic>-tests were used to compare the assessments for the two illuminance levels to a zero value, corresponding to what would be judged as ‘typical’ of a residential application. These showed that 306 lx was judged as significantly higher (<italic>t</italic><sub>63</sub> = 8.60; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) than a typical residence and 28 lx was judged significantly lower (<italic>t</italic><sub>63</sub> =−4.05; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) than the zero value, suggesting that an illuminance level between these two would be ‘typical.’ Based upon these findings, 75 lx was chosen as the representative typical illuminance level for residences in the second experiment because, as noted above, this was a practical level of illuminance that could be delivered to the two scale models.</p>
<p>Responses to the question ‘What part of the room was most influential?’ were weighted inversely proportional to their rankings; the value of 4 was assigned to their first choice through 1 to their last choice. Based upon these weighted scores, subjects primarily relied on the fabric to make their judgments. The walls were the second most important part of the room. The carpet and the wood were both relatively unimportant for their judgments.</p>
<p>Chi-square statistics were applied to the responses to the question ‘Would you purchase this light source?’ because of the binary (‘yes’ vs. ‘no’) answers provided by subjects. The ‘yes’ response to the 2700 K ‘white’ source (2700 W) was statistically different than chance (χ<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> = 4, <italic>p</italic> = 0.046; 40 ‘yes’ vs. 24 ‘no’), but not to the 2700 K source near the line of blackbody radiation (2700 B: χ<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> = 0.0625, <italic>p</italic> = 0.803; 31 ‘yes’ vs. 33 ‘no’).</p>

<p>For the question related to the relative cost of the light source being viewed if it had 10 times longer life and 4 times higher efficacy than an incandescent lamp (at $0.60) and using the 2 by 2 by 2 repeated measures ANOVA, there was a statistically significant main effect of chromaticity (F<sub>1,15</sub> = 5.90; <italic>p</italic> = 0.028). Subjects were willing to pay, averaging across décor and light level, $2.54 for the sources near the line of blackbody radiation (2700 B) and $4.28 for the ‘white’ light source (2700 W; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1477153512442936">Table 4</xref>). These amounts were both statistically greater than the $0.60 price of an incandescent lamp using one-sample <italic>t</italic>-tests (<italic>t</italic><sub>63</sub> = 4.03 and <italic>t</italic><sub>63</sub> = 5.15, respectively; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 for both <italic>t</italic>-tests). There was also a statistically significant main effect of light level (F<sub>1,15</sub> = 5.41; <italic>p</italic> = 0.035). Together, these results suggest that people would be willing to pay more for light sources of longer life and greater efficacy if they also provide illumination that is whiter and brighter.</p>

<sec id="sec9-1477153512442936"><title>3.2. Experiment 2: 2700 K or 3500 K on or near the blackbody line or ‘white’</title>
<p>As in the first experiment, the ‘like-dislike’ ratings were submitted to a 2 by 2 by 2 repeated measures ANOVA where CCT (2700 K or 3500 K), chromaticity (on or near the blackbody line or on the ‘white’ line), and room décor (blue or brown) were the independent variables. There was a significant main effect of chromaticity (F<sub>1,15</sub> = 9.62; <italic>p</italic> = 0.007) showing that the ‘white’ sources (2700 W and 3500 W) were liked statistically more by subjects than those with chromaticities on or near the line of blackbody radiation (2700 B and 3500 B). There was also a significant interaction between chromaticity and CCT (F<sub>1,15</sub> = 5.79; <italic>p</italic> = 0.029); no other term in the ANOVA was statistically significant. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1477153512442936">Figure 5</xref> illustrates the statistically significant interaction between CCT and chromaticity. As can be seen from this figure, the two sources on the ‘white’ line (2700 W and 3500 W) were liked equally well by subjects, whereas the 2700 K source near the blackbody line (i.e., the incandescent source, 2700 B) was liked least. It is also important to note that the 3500 K source on the blackbody line (3500 B) was liked nearly as much as the two sources on the ‘white’ line, suggesting that the 3500 K source on the blackbody line (3500 B) was not tinted as much as the incandescent (2700 B) source.

<p>Responses to the question ‘What part of the room was most influential?’ were treated as they were in Experiment 1. Consistent with the results of Experiment 1, subjects primarily relied on the fabric to make their judgments, and the carpet and the wood objects were relatively unimportant for their judgments.</p>
<p>For the question ‘Would you purchase this light source?’, more subjects replied ‘no’ than ‘yes’ for the 2700 B source near the blackbody line (i.e., the incandescent lamp), but the chi-square test indicated that this difference was not statistically different than chance (χ<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> = 2, <italic>p</italic> = 0.157; 12 ‘yes’ vs. 20 ‘no’). In contrast, more subjects replied ‘yes’ than ‘no’ for the other three sources and these differences were significantly different than chance (2700 W: χ<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> = 6.125, <italic>p</italic> = 0.013, 23 ‘yes’ vs. 9 no’; 3500 B: χ<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> = 6.125, <italic>p</italic> = 0.013, 23 ‘yes’ vs. 9 ‘no’; and 3500 W: χ<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> = 8, <italic>p</italic> = 0.005, 24 ‘yes’ vs. 8 ‘no’). The two ‘white’ light sources (2700 W and 3500 W) were more likely to be purchased than the incandescent source (2700 B), but in addition, the 3500 K source on the blackbody line (3500 B) was also likely to be purchased.</p>
<p>For the question related to the cost of the light source if it had the same lifetime and efficacy as an incandescent lamp, the ANOVA revealed that people were willing to pay significantly more to illuminate the blue décor than the brown décor (F<sub>1,15</sub> = 4.67; <italic>p</italic> = 0.047). Although this result is not specifically related to the light source itself, the finding indirectly suggests that subjects were differentially attentive to the sources of illumination for the two décors whereby they were more sensitive to illumination of the blue décor than to illumination of the brown décor. There was also a significant interaction between room décor and CCT (F<sub>1,15</sub> = 6.43; <italic>p</italic> = 0.023). Subjects were less likely to pay more for the 2700 K sources than for the 3500 K sources to illuminate both the brown and blue décors, but they were willing to pay slightly more for the 3500 K sources to illuminate the blue décor. This significant interaction suggests that subjects saw more value in matching the ‘whiter’ light source to the blue décor than to the brown décor. Average pricing information is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1477153512442936">Table 4</xref>. It is interesting to note that the people would pay only $0.22 for the 2700 K lamp near the blackbody line, which is <italic>significantly less</italic> (<italic>t</italic><sub>31</sub> = −6.85; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) than the $0.60 price for the incandescent lamp, recognizing, of course, that this is in fact the same lamp type.</p>
<p>For the question related to the cost of the light source if the features included 10 times longer life and 4 times higher efficacy and using the 2 by 2 by 2 repeated measures ANOVA, only the main effect of CCT was statistically significant (F<sub>1,15</sub> = 5.21; <italic>p</italic> = 0.037), with the 3500 K sources being seen to have more value than the 2700 K sources. This result suggests, consistent with the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1477153512442936">Figures 4(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1477153512442936">5</xref>, that people would be willing to pay more for light sources of longer life and greater efficacy if it was not the incandescent source (2700 B; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1477153512442936">Table 4</xref>). To determine whether the value of longer life and higher efficacy was significantly higher than the $0.60 cost of an incandescent lamp, four one-sample <italic>t</italic>-tests were performed. Subjects were willing to spend, averaging across décor, $1.90 for the 2700 K lamp on the line of blackbody radiation (i.e., the same incandescent source, 2700 B) if it had 10 times longer life and 4 times higher efficacy, but this was not statistically greater than $0.60 (<italic>t</italic><sub>31</sub> = 1.90; <italic>p</italic> = 0.067). For the three sources ‘whiter’ than the incandescent (2700 B) source with the longer life and higher efficacy, subjects were willing to spend, averaging across décor, $3.65 for the ‘white’ 2700 K, $4.61 for the ‘white’ 3500 K, and $4.25 for the 3500 K on the line of blackbody radiation; these three values were statistically different than $0.60 (<italic>t</italic><sub>31</sub> = 3.71, <italic>t</italic><sub>31</sub> = 3.72, and <italic>t</italic><sub>31</sub> = 3.64, respectively; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 in all tests).</p>

The results of the present study suggest the same effect is true for interior spaces; namely, people prefer ‘whiter’ light sources for illuminating residential applications over ‘yellower’ common incandescent sources.</p>
<p>This conclusion is at sharp odds with current industry strategies for developing compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) and light-emitting diode (LED) light sources for illuminating residential applications. Most manufacturers are trying to emulate the ‘warm’ colour appearance of incandescent light sources.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1477153512442936">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1477153512442936">41</xref></sup> The data from the present study suggest, however, that given a visual choice, people would prefer ‘whiter’ light sources than the illumination provided by incandescent (2700 B) light sources. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1477153512442936">Figure 6</xref> shows the relative differences for the ‘like-dislike’ ratings as a function of distance in the 1976 CIE u’v’ colour space<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1477153512442936">21</xref></sup> for different combinations of the four sources used in the second experiment. The 1976 chromaticity space was used here because equal distances in this diagram are presumed to be of equal ‘psychological’ distance. The largest difference is associated with the two 2700 K light sources; this difference was highly significant (<italic>t</italic><sub>15</sub> =−3.24, <italic>p</italic> = 0.005), meaning that subjects consistently liked the common incandescent source less than the ‘white’ light source of the same CCT.

Although the ‘white’ 3500 K source was liked better than the 3500 K source on the line of blackbody radiation, the difference was not significantly greater than zero (<italic>t</italic><sub>15</sub> = −0.92, ns), suggesting that the 3500 K source on the line of blackbody radiation is not as tinted as the incandescent source. What is most important to note from this figure is that there is no statistical difference (<italic>t</italic><sub>15</sub> =−0.95, ns) in the ‘like-dislike’ scale for the two chromaticities of different CCT that were seen as ‘white’ in the study by Rea and Freyssinier,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1477153512442936">15</xref></sup> supporting their conclusions that these two sources produce illuminations that have very similar ‘white’ appearance, even though they have very different chromaticities.

<p>It is interesting to note in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1477153512442936">Figure 6</xref> that there is no relationship with distances in the u’v’ colour space to the ‘like-dislike’ differences derived from the present study. Assuming that small differences in the ‘like-dislike’ scale are associated with small differences in the amount of perceived ‘tint’ in the illumination, just-noticeable-differences in the u’v’ colour space are not predictive of perceived differences in the hue (or absence of hue) in the illumination. Importantly, the illuminant mode viewing conditions in the present experiments are different than the aperture mode viewing conditions used to derive the u’v’ colour space. As briefly noted earlier, and more fully by Rea and Freyssinier,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1477153512442936">15</xref></sup> perceptions of ‘white’ are very different for these two viewing modes; in the aperture mode, ‘white’ is associated with a small area in chromaticity space<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1477153512442936">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1477153512442936"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1477153512442936">20</xref></sup> whereas ‘white’ in the illuminant mode is associated with a line in chromaticity space.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1477153512442936">15</xref></sup> A direct test of hue discrimination in the illuminant viewing mode versus in the aperture viewing mode should be conducted with the expectation that the two different viewing modes will lead to very different patterns of results.</p>
<p>Differences in the colour-rendering properties of the different light sources may be another, separate reason for the poor correlation between distances in the u’v’ space and the similarities in the perceived ‘tints’ in the illumination. In other words, ratings on the ‘like-dislike’ scale may have been influenced not simply by the perceived ‘whiteness’ of the illuminant, but by the colour-rendering properties of the light source as well. Although CRI was high for all four sources, GAI was low for the 2700 K source near the line of blackbody radiation (i.e., 2700 B; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1477153512442936">Table 1</xref>). As shown previously by the authors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1477153512442936">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1477153512442936">26</xref></sup> and others,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1477153512442936">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1477153512442936">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1477153512442936">42</xref></sup> the colour-rendering properties of a light source cannot be predicted from CRI alone. So even though all four sources had high CRI values, they were not necessarily equal in terms of the way they rendered colours in the two scale models. A systematic investigation of the interaction between the apparent ‘tint’ of illumination and the colour-rendering properties of that illumination needs to be undertaken. It is hypothesized that good colour rendering properties (both CRI and GAI) together with the perceived ‘whiteness’ in the illumination will be important for architectural applications like the one studied here.</p>
<p>It must also be noted that the preferences for ‘white’ light sources may be related to the relative brightness of the scale models when illuminated by the different sources. In outdoor applications, illumination from metal halide sources consistently looks brighter than that from high pressure sodium sources at the same photopic illuminance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1477153512442936">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1477153512442936">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1477153512442936">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1477153512442936"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1477153512442936"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1477153512442936">38</xref></sup> This same effect may be true here as well, but cannot be unambiguously ascertained from the results of the present study. The 2700 K and the 3500 K sources on the ‘white’ line from Rea and Freyssinier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1477153512442936">15</xref></sup> used in this study were probably seen as brighter as well as ‘whiter’ at the same level of illuminance as the sources of the same CCT with chromaticities on or near the line of blackbody radiation. The apparent brightness of the scale model interiors was not examined directly in the present study, but, at the same illuminance level, subjects in the present experiment usually rated the ‘whiter’ source as brighter than a typical residence more times than they did for the incandescent source (2700 K) near the line of blackbody radiation. Future studies, reminiscent of those conducted for outdoor applications,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1477153512442936">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1477153512442936">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1477153512442936">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1477153512442936">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1477153512442936">38</xref></sup> need to systematically separate these two potential reasons for the preferences seen here. It is hypothesized that, like the results of many outdoor lighting studies, ‘whiter’ illumination will be seen as brighter illumination at the same photopic level.</p>
<p>The monetary values placed on the different light sources are interesting. People do not see a monetary premium for the ‘whiter’ light sources if they have the same life and efficacy as an incandescent source. Thus, the mental calculus appears to be similar to choices among flavors of ice cream. There may be a general preference for one flavor over another (people like vanilla twice as much as chocolate and eight times as much as strawberry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1477153512442936">43</xref></sup>), but people would not be inclined to pay more for their preferred ice cream flavor if the servings were the same size. Similarly, from the data gathered here, people would not pay more for their preferred colour of illumination if life and efficacy were the same.</p>
<p>People do see a monetary value for longer lamp life and greater lamp efficacy and are willing to pay more for these features. For this particular study, subjects were willing to pay, on average, a premium of $1.30 over the cost of an incandescent source priced at $0.60 if the same lamp (2700 B) lasted 10 times longer and was 4 times more efficacious. Interestingly, the premiums for longer life and higher efficacy were significantly greater for the ‘white’ light sources; on average, the premium for the three ‘whiter’ light sources was $3.57 over the $0.60 price of an incandescent lamp in the second experiment. Thus, a preference for ‘white’ illumination interacts with and cannot be easily de-coupled from other features of the light source. (It must be noted, however, that subjects in the present experiment seriously underestimated the value of longer life and higher efficacy. A lamp that had 4 times the efficacy of an incandescent lamp and lasted 10 times longer realistically would have a 15-year break-even, initial cost of $39.00, assuming the cost of energy was $0.10/kWh and the lamp was operated 4 hours/day.)</p>
<p>The present study extends the findings from Rea and Freyssinier,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1477153512442936">15</xref></sup> showing that people prefer minimally tinted or ‘white’ illumination for residences, much as they prefer metal halide over high pressure sodium sources for nighttime outdoor lighting applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1477153512442936">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1477153512442936">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1477153512442936">37</xref></sup> Apparently, however, people are unwilling to pay more for ‘whiter’ light than the incandescent (2700 B) source in residential applications unless that feature is bundled with longer life and higher efficacy. Following the ice cream analogy, people would not pay more for their preferred ‘flavor’ of illumination unless it also came from a larger scoop. Consistent with the marketing literature associated with energy-efficient replacements for the incandescent lamp, the first cost of a light source is extremely important,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1477153512442936">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1477153512442936"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1477153512442936">46</xref></sup> but the likelihood of changing to more energy-efficient light sources is lessened unless those financial benefits are bundled with better colour properties as well. Certainly the technology is available to deliver longer life, higher efficacy, and better colour characteristics.</p>
