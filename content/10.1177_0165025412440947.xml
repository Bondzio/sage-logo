<abstract>
<p>I-states-as-objects-analysis (ISOA) is a person-oriented methodology for studying short-term developmental stability and change in patterns of variable values. ISOA is based on longitudinal data with the same set of variables measured at all measurement occasions. A key concept is the <italic>i-state</italic>, defined as a person’s pattern of variable values at a specific time point. All i-states are first subjected to a classification analysis that results in a time-invariant classification characterized by a number of <italic>typical i-states</italic>. Each person is then characterized at each time point by the typical i-state he/she belongs to. Then the person’s sequences of typical i-states are analyzed with regard to structural and individual stability and change. Extensions of ISOA are presented where: (1) some methods for checking the assumption of a time-invariant classification are indicated; (2) information about the degree of dissimilarity between typical i-states is used as an aid in interpreting the findings; and (3) attention is given to <italic>closed paths</italic>—that is, typical i-state sequences that do not occur at all. To demonstrate the methods, an empirical example is given that concerns the development of children’s achievement-intelligence patterns between ages 10 and 13. </p>

<p>We are concerned here with developmental processes studied by analyzing longitudinal data for a sample of individuals that have been repeatedly measured in the same variables. This type of study is often carried out using variable-oriented methods such as, for instance, structural equation modeling and repeated measurements analysis of variance (ANOVA). When applying standard variable-oriented methods, the variable is regarded as a key conceptual and analytical unit and it is assumed that the relevant information about development is captured by a model for data treatment that summarizes and restricts this information in various ways. For instance, pair-wise relations are computed between the variables and used as input data for structural equation modeling. Whether this is an adequate simplification depends on the specific problem under study, the data, and the assumptions of the process that follow from the researcher’s theoretical framework. Broadly speaking, if a modern developmental science theoretical framework is considered relevant, its tenets will in many cases be at odds with the assumptions made when applying standard variable-oriented methods in a developmental context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0165025412440947">Cairns, Elder, &amp; Costello, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0165025412440947">Magnusson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0165025412440947">Magnusson &amp; Törestad, 1993</xref>). </p>
<p>A person-oriented approach has emerged from a developmental science theoretical framework. This approach is very briefly characterized by a theoretical perspective that: (1) emphasizes the process of individual development in context; and (2) emphasizes the holistic aspect of individual development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0165025412440947">Bergman &amp; Magnusson, 1997</xref>). A crucial aspect of the person-oriented approach is that individual <italic>patterns</italic> of information are of key interest and that these patterns should normally not be broken up because they cannot be assumed to be represented by, for instance, a data summary based on pairwise relations between the variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0165025412440947">Bergman &amp; Andersson, 2010</xref>). From this standpoint, a good problem–method match usually demands the use of statistical tools that enable the study of patterns of information treated as indivisible wholes. This can be done in different ways, with one major class of methods being a classificatory approach. Each person in the studied sample is assigned to one subgroup so that all persons in the same subgroup have a similar pattern of information (called a typical pattern; usually synonymous to a pattern of values of certain variables that is approximately shared by the members in a subgroup). </p>
<p>The distinction between variable-oriented and person-oriented is not always clear cut and it can refer to either the theoretical framework or to the type of methodology used. We are concerned here with the latter aspect and then, in some cases, it can be almost a matter of taste whether a certain method is labeled variable-oriented or person-oriented. For instance, in loglinear analysis a higher-order contingency table is studied and each individual is characterized by its combination of values in the categorical variables, a pattern, but in the analyses the patterns are explained by a summary in the form of a set of linear and interactive “effects.” It should be pointed out that the variable-oriented and person-oriented approaches have also complementary strengths, as outlined in a special issue of the Merrill-Palmer Quarterly on this topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0165025412440947">Laursen &amp; Hoff, 2006</xref>). </p>
<p>Assuming longitudinal data with the same set of variables measured at all time points, the classification could be of the individuals’ complete longitudinal patterns (i.e., with k time points and the same v variables at each time point, the number of variables in the analyzed patterns would be k × v). However, in practice this approach often does not work well since the complexity of the patterns analyzed usually results in classes that are heterogeneous and difficult to interpret (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0165025412440947">Bergman, 1998</xref>). An often more viable alternative is that the classification is carried out separately at each time point, based on the variables from that time point, and then class membership at time 1 is related to class membership at time 2, class membership at time 2 is related to class membership at time 3, and so on. A standard procedure is then the LICUR (LInking of ClUsters after removal of a Residue) approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0165025412440947">Bergman, Magnusson, &amp; El-Khouri, 2003</xref>). In LICUR a cluster analytic procedure is usually used at each time point separately and the cluster solutions at the different time points are compared to evaluate structural stability and change. Then between each adjacent pair of time points, cluster membership is cross-tabulated to give information about cluster membership combinations that occur more often than expected by chance (so-called developmental types) and to look for individual stability (belongs to similar clusters at both time points) and individual change. </p>
<p>However, when short-term development is examined, it can often be assumed that the same typical patterns emerge at all time points, although perhaps with different frequencies and with some of the persons changing the typical pattern they belong to. This assumption can be used to improve the power of the classification analysis and to make the findings more clear and interpretable. This is the basic idea of I-States-as-Objects-Analysis (ISOA) that will be the focus of the present article. It is the aim of the paper to first present the ISOA approach, both theoretically and methodologically, and then introduce three extensions of it: (1) some methods for checking the assumption of a time-invariant classification; (2) the use of information about the degree of dissimilarity between typical i-states as an aid in interpreting the findings; and (3) the study of <italic>closed paths</italic>—that is, developmental paths that do not occur at all. </p>

<title>Short overview of ISOA</title>
<p>The starting point for ISOA is a situation in which short-term individual development is studied and a person-oriented theoretical framework is considered relevant. By “short-term development” we mean a study in a developmental area that has its start and endpoint within what is judged to be the same stage or phase in development (e.g., the study of school adjustment between ages 8 and 10). It is assumed that data are available for a sample of persons studied repeatedly in the same set of variables. The study of typical individual patterns of variable values, and how they evolve, is then a natural analytic approach. The basic idea of ISOA was indicated earlier and, for the moment, we are concerned with the assumption in ISOA of a time-invariant classification system (the same set of typical patterns describes the data at all time points). This assumption was suggested by a consideration of some similarities of the person-oriented approach to the study of dynamic systems where system state development is modeled (for an overview see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0165025412440947">Devaney, 1989</xref>; for examples of dynamic modeling within the behavioral sciences, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0165025412440947">Boker, 2002</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0165025412440947">Granic &amp; Hollenstein, 2006</xref>). By applying a dynamic systems approach, a small number of emerging attractor states are often found, characterized by, for instance, stable states or periodic states in the value patterns of the variables describing the system under study. ISOA also concerns system state development (≈ pattern development) and its set of time-invariant typical patterns resembles to a certain degree the attractor structure in a model of a dynamic system. Admittedly this analogy is not perfect, but it suffices to suggest the ISOA approach with its key assumption that approximately the same typical patterns occur at all time points, although the proportion of the sample that belongs to each typical pattern may vary across time, and individuals may change the typical pattern they belong to.</p>
<p>However, the analogy with a dynamic system breaks down when long-term development is studied, since during such a period it can be expected that the developmental system may reorganize and it cannot be assumed that the same model structure is applicable at all ages. Such reorganization is less likely when short-term development is studied during a period with no major transitions. Hence the ISOA approach is applicable mainly for studying short-term development, but the tenability of the assumption of age-invariance of the classification structure should be checked anyway (see the section about this topic).</p>
<p>The first step in ISOA analysis concerns finding the time-invariant set of typical patterns. It could be derived from theory but, most commonly, it is derived from empirical data. For this purpose the <italic>i-state </italic>is defined as a person’s pattern of variable values at a specific time point. Hence if there are k time points, each person is characterized by k i-states. All i-states are then subjected to a classification analysis (i.e., <italic>N</italic> × k objects are analyzed, <italic>N</italic> being the total sample size). This results in that each i-state will belong to one of the classes in this classification, such a class being called a <italic>typical i-state</italic>. Consequently each individual will be characterized at each time point by the typical i-state he or she belongs to according to the time-invariant classification system. </p>
<p>The first step of ISOA is illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0165025412440947">Table 1</xref>. Of course, the fictional data matrix presented in the example is unrealistic (only four individuals and two variables), but it suffices to illustrate the principle. It is seen that in the first step of the ISOA analysis 12 objects (i-states) are analyzed; or, more specifically, three i-states for each of the four individuals together form the sample in this analysis with the value patterns in the two variables being (15, 17), (18, 17), . . . (17, 17). These 12 value patterns are classified so that i-states with similar value patterns form a class (= a typical i-state). In this case, two classes are a natural solution and they are denoted with C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>. Then it is noted for each individual which typical i-state he/she belongs to at the three time points. For instance, individual 2 belongs to C<sub>1</sub> at times 1 and 2 and to C<sub>2</sub> at time 3 and his time-ordered sequence of typical i-state membership is C<sub>1</sub> C<sub>1</sub> C<sub>2</sub>. The data matrix of the four individuals’ time ordered sequence of typical i-state membership is input data in further ISOA analyses, and these procedures are described later.</p>

<p>The classification analysis in ISOA can be carried out in different ways but, so far, mostly a cluster analysis-based procedure has been used. It is briefly described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0165025412440947">Bergman and Nurmi (2010</xref>) and, in more detail, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0165025412440947">Bergman (2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Before the classification analysis is carried out, a residue analysis should in most cases be undertaken by which a residue set (≈ a set of multivariate outliers, usually defined as objects that are dissimilar to all other objects as measured by the averaged squared Euclidian distance) is identified and removed from the data set. This can be important for theoretical reasons because the researcher’s theoretical framework might lead to the expectation that an appropriate classification of the data should not encompass all studied subjects; there will be some subjects with unique profiles that do not fit into the classification system. The detection and removal of outliers can also be important from a practical viewpoint because it has been shown that just a few multivariate outliers can distort the results of a classification analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0165025412440947">Bergman, 1988</xref>). The relative size of the residue set is also one indication of the “classificability” of the data set.</p>
<p>Although the nature of this time-invariant classification can be an important empirical finding in itself, this first step of ISOA is not at focus in the present article. The focus is instead on the second step, namely the analysis of pattern development based on information about class membership in the time-invariant classification system. Traditionally, two types of analyses are made: (1) <italic>frequency stability/change</italic> is studied by comparing the proportion of the sample that belongs to the different typical i-states across time points; and (2) <italic>individual stability/change</italic> in belonging to different typical i-states is studied either by examining developmental patterns of class membership (typical i-state memberships) across all k time points or, more commonly, by studying cross-tabulations of typical i-state membership between all pairs of adjacent time points (i.e., k-1 cross-tabulations u × u where u is the number of typical i-states). </p>
<p>As an illustration, consider again the example presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0165025412440947">Table 1</xref> where two classes (typical i-states) were found (C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>). Hence at each time point an individual belongs to either C<sub>1</sub> or C<sub>2</sub>; there is one binary categorical variable for each of the three time points. A cross-tabulation is formed between the time 1 categorical variable and the time 2 categorical variable (i.e., a 2 × 2 table, <italic>n</italic> = 4) and a cross-tabulation is formed between the time 2 categorical variable and the time 3 categorical variable (i.e., a 2 × 2 table, <italic>n</italic> = 4). The resulting cross-tabulations are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0165025412440947">Table 1</xref>. For instance, it is seen in the time 1 × time 2 cross-tabulation that there is perfect individual stability between these two time points (if you start in C<sub>1</sub> you end in C<sub>1</sub>, and if you start in C<sub>2</sub> you end in C<sub>2</sub>).</p>
<p>Exact significance tests are performed for each cell in a cross-tabulation of the above type to find typical developmental paths of typical i-state membership (i.e., typical i-state combinations across time that occur more often than expected by chance). Of course, for the example data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0165025412440947">Table 1</xref>, tests are meaningless because the sample size is too small. The null hypothesis in these cases is most often an independence model where, for each time-ordered pair of categories, it is assumed that membership to one of them is independent of membership to the other one. The computation of the expected number of cases characterized by a certain time-ordered pair of categories (pair of typical i-states) can be computed in the same way as when computing an expected frequency in a chi-square analysis of a cross-tabulation. These results are often summarized and graphically illustrated by a <italic>stream chart</italic>. A stream chart is a figure in which each typical i-state is verbally described in the left column for time s and in the right column for time s + 1. Significant stabilities or changes are depicted by drawing arrows (paths) from each typical i-state at time s to each typical i-state at time s + 1 for which the observed cell frequency is significantly greater than the expected one. Such a stream chart is presented in an empirical example presented in a later section. Examples of research in which stream charts have been used are given by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0165025412440947">Laursen, Furman, and Mooney (2006</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0165025412440947">Nurmi and Aunola (2005</xref>). </p>
<p>The ISOA procedures described in this section are illustrated in an empirical example given in a later section, where findings are presented resulting from applying an ISOA analysis of a longitudinal sample. Below, three extensions of ISOA are presented.</p>

Therefore ISOA is mainly applicable for studying short-term development where this assumption is more likely to hold. This assumption of approximate invariance should always be checked and we will discuss some methods for this purpose. We will then assume a standard ISOA analytical framework, but most of the concepts and methods we present can be generalized/reformulated to suit other analytical frameworks. </p>
<p>“Invariance” can be of different kinds and we will mainly focus on <italic>structural invariance</italic>; that is, the degree to which the typical i-states that emerged in the first step of a standard ISOA analysis are similar to the clusters that emerged in the age-specific cluster analyses. With “similar” it is meant here that the <italic>centroid</italic> (mean vector for a class) is similar for a typical ISOA i-state and a cluster in the age-specific cluster solution. For each ISOA typical i-state, the distance of its centroid to the centroid of the closest cluster in the corresponding age-specific cluster analysis is computed by the averaged squared Euclidian distance between the two centroids (ASEDC). If all ASEDCs are small, each ISOA typical i-state is mirrored by a cluster in the age-specific cluster solution, indicating structural invariance. What constitutes “small” is to a certain extent subjective, but the size of the ASEDCs can be compared to the average squared distances between all subjects in the total sample, which is 2 for <italic>z</italic>-standardized data. If structural invariance holds, then all ASEDCs should be much smaller than 2. In our experience, for <italic>z</italic>-standardized data an ASEDC below 0.25 indicates an acceptable degree of similarity. The structural invariance of the typical i-states should be studied at each time point separately, beginning by observing the median ASEDC and its range. Then for each typical i-state the degree to which it is mirrored by an age-specific cluster should be studied (i.e., has a small ASEDC to a cluster in the studied age-specific classification). For instance, it is possible that some, but not all, typical i-states are similar to clusters in the age-specific classification analyses. </p>
<p>
<italic>Class membership invariance</italic> between the ISOA cluster solution and an age-specific cluster solution is another aspect of invariance. There are a number of different coefficients available for measuring the similarity between class memberships with regard to two different cluster solutions. One type uses pairs of objects as the basic unit of analysis, for instance the Rand coefficient and the point-biseral correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0165025412440947">Rand, 1971</xref>). There are also coefficients based on a cross-tabulation of the two solutions with the subject as the unit of analysis and one such coefficient was used in our empirical example presented in a later section (Cramér’s V; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0165025412440947">Cramér, 1999</xref>). </p>
<p>A third aspect of invariance is <italic>comparative class homogeneity</italic>: the extent to which the typical i-states that emerged from the ISOA analysis provide at a specific time point as “good” a classification as the relevant age-specific clusters in the sense of creating equally homogeneous groups. This can be studied by comparing the explained error sum of squares of the ISOA clusters at time i with that of the time-specific cluster solution at time i. </p>
<p>These methods for studying invariance were applied in the empirical example presented in a later section. It should be pointed out that, in case the invariance assumption is untenable, an alternative approach is the LICUR method that was described earlier.</p>

<title>The degree of dissimilarity between typical i-states as an aid in interpreting findings from an ISOA analysis</title>
<p>In most cases the first step of an ISOA analysis is based on all individuals’ observed pattern of variable values at each time point. This information is used to construct the time-invariant classification system with its classes (typical i-states) and to evaluate the quality of it. For example, the degree of (dis)similarity between the i-states that belong to a typical i-state is usually studied often by computing their distance to the centroid. Because the purpose of a classification analysis is usually to find a number of groups where the individuals within a group are similar but the different groups are distinct (e.g., have different centroids), we can expect all typical i-states to be dissimilar. However, their <italic>degree</italic> of dissimilarity usually varies strongly. Dissimilarities can be measured in different ways, and we will here use a standard measure, namely averaged squared Euclidian distance, defining the dissimilarity D<sub>ij</sub> between two typical i-states i and j as<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-0165025412440947">

<p>where M<sub>ri</sub> is the mean in variable r for class i and the summation is made over the v variables in the profile. D<sub>ij</sub> takes into account both level and form differences between the centroids of the two typical i-states. Note that, for the Euclidean distance to be meaningful, scales must be commensurate (often accomplished by standardizing the variables to have the same mean and standard deviation).</p>
<p>It is possible to increase the information value of finding significant individual changes (i.e., movements from one typical i-state to another) between two time points. This can be accomplished by adding information about the dissimilarities between the typical i-states. These dissimilarities can often be reasonably well summarized by a two-dimensional map in which each typical i-state is a point and the dissimilarity between two typical i-states is represented by the distance between them. Such a map can be derived from multidimensional scaling (MDS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0165025412440947">Kruskal, 1964</xref>). Then arrows are drawn between typical i-states for which a significant individual change has occurred. The tail of the arrow is at the time s typical i-state and the point of the arrow is at the time s + 1 typical i-state. In this way one can examine the degree of dissimilarity between each pair of typical i-states for which a significant individual change has been observed. For example, an interesting case would be unexpectedly frequent movements from one typical i-state to another quite dissimilar one, perhaps suggesting a transformation process. Based on the map, we can also study the extent to which two typical i-states are <italic>connecting vessels</italic> in the sense that there is significant movement across time both from one such state to the other and from the other to the first one. This kind of figure we call a <italic>typical i-state change map, </italic>and it is illustrated in the empirical example given in a later section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0165025412440947">Figure 2</xref>). </p>

<title>The study of closed paths</title>
<p>An interesting case when studying the development of individuals’ typical i-state membership is where a certain sequence occurs <italic>less</italic> often than expected by chance. To our knowledge, this aspect of studying individual development was first introduced by Gustav Lienert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0165025412440947">Krauth &amp; Lienert, 1973</xref>) within the framework of configural frequency analysis, and he coined the concept <italic>antitype</italic>. Further work in the area has been carried out by von Eye (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0165025412440947">von Eye, Mair, &amp; Mun, 2010</xref>). Within a person-oriented framework the concept has been elaborated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0165025412440947">Bergman and Magnusson (1997</xref>), who used the term “white spots” for roughly the same phenomenon, but who, in addition, stressed the importance of developmental paths that not only occur less often than expected by chance, but do not occur at all or occur very rarely. The authors argued that, in many developmental studies, it can be important to complement the ordinary study of what (often) occurs in development with a study of what (almost) does not occur. What does not happen fences what happens and it can also be subjected to hypothesis testing. This can lead to additional predictions, sharpening the power to reject a false theory.</p>
<p>This line of inquiry could be based on the detection of developmental antitypes as indicated earlier. However, here we are concerned with finding <italic>closed paths</italic>: paths that no one follows. This corresponds in ISOA to a sequence of typical i-states shown by no one. (In some situations a closed path could be defined as a “rare path,” although what should be regarded as “rare” can be a difficult decision.) Of special interest are <italic>reciprocally closed paths</italic>; that is, pairs of typical i-state membership between two time points that are characterized by closed paths, regardless of which in the pair is the start typical i-state. In the empirical example, an analysis of closed paths is presented.</p>
<p>It is difficult to construct a really informative significance test of a closed path. For instance, the ordinary significance test of a developmental antitype only tests whether the observed frequency is significantly lower than expected under some null hypothesis (usually one of independence between the variables in the pattern). One possibility to test for a closed path is to formulate the null hypothesis of the expected frequency as some fraction (fr) of the expected frequency under a model of complete independence (exp), and then test if the zero frequency that was obtained is significantly lower, using the binomial distribution with<italic> p</italic> = fr × exp / <italic>N</italic>. A significant result would then support that the path is at least less common than a rather rare path. An alternative approach is to obtain the expected frequencies from a relevant specification of a log linear model, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0165025412440947">von Eye et al. (2010</xref>). In the empirical example given in a later section we chose the former alternative and defined the null hypothesis of a fairly rare path by setting fr = 0.5.</p>

<title>Empirical example of an ISOA analysis: Developmental patterns of achievement and intelligence</title>
<sec id="section6-0165025412440947">
<title>Background</title>
<p>It is well-known that intelligence and school achievement are stable phenomena and their growth and relations have been much studied during the last 100 years within the variable-oriented tradition, sometimes considering the verbal and nonverbal domains separately. This study has included an interest in relative achievement—that is, achievement in relation to intelligence (for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0165025412440947">Ashbury, 1974</xref>). However, over- or underachievement seem to be less stable characteristics. Broadly speaking, the same problem area will now be addressed from a person-oriented perspective using the ISOA approach. Then questions such as the following arise: Are there a limited number of typical patterns of achievement and intelligence that can well describe the individual patterns? If so, what is the degree of structural frequency stability and change, and the degree of individual stability and change? Do the results imply typical verbal and nonverbal patterns? Do we find typical patterns of over- or underachievement, and if such patterns are found, do individuals tend to stably belong to them? </p>
<p>If we assume an approximately time-invariant classification structure, ISOA can be applied in the situation just described. In the empirical example, this was done on longitudinal data taken from ages 10 and 13 from the longitudinal research program Individual Development and Adaptation (IDA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0165025412440947">Magnusson, 1988</xref>). At each age, four variables formed the value pattern or profile: achievement in a standardized test of Swedish (Swed), achievement in a standardized test of mathematics (Math), verbal ability (IQv), and nonverbal ability (IQnv). The variables and the sample are described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0165025412440947">Bergman (1973</xref>). All variables were z + 5 standardized at each age separately. The sample comprised 773 children with complete data from both ages. We first present the basic findings from a standard ISOA analysis. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0165025412440947">
<title>Standard ISOA analysis</title>
<p>In the first step of the ISOA analysis, a data set was constructed with 2 × 773 = 1,546 value profiles; that is, each child contributed with one value profile in Swed, Math, IQv, and IQnv from age 10 and one value profile in the same variables from age 13. Performing a residue analysis according to standard options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0165025412440947">Bergman et al., 2003</xref>), no residue subjects (≈ multivariate outliers) were found. Then cluster analysis was applied on this data set using Ward’s method and LICUR criteria for choosing the number of clusters. For this purpose, the Sleipner statistical package for person-oriented analysis was used (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0165025412440947">Bergman et al., 2003</xref> for details of the LICUR procedure). A nine-clusters solution was chosen with an explained error sum of squares of 75.6%, indicating fairly high cluster homogeneity (as much as three-quarters of the variation in data is explained by the solution which usually is considered quite satisfactory; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0165025412440947">Bergman et al., 2003</xref>). For further analyses of the time-invariant classification we also used the statistical package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0165025412440947">ROPstat (2011</xref>). The cluster centroids are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0165025412440947">Table 2</xref> together with short labels describing the clusters.

<p>For instance, it is seen from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0165025412440947">Table 2</xref> that there is one large cluster (cluster 1, “Above average,” 19.1% of all 1,546 i-states) with members that are above average in all four variables. There is one cluster indicating underachievement in mathematics (cluster 3, 9.6% of all i-states) and one cluster indicating overachievement in mathematics (cluster 6, 9.4% of all i-states). No cluster emerged that indicated pronounced under- or overachievement in the verbal domain.</p>
<p>In the second step, first frequency stability and change were studied by comparing for each typical i-state the relative frequencies of the sample of all individuals (<italic>N</italic> = 773) that were characterized by this typical i-state at the two ages. Then individual stability and change were studied by examining individuals’ patterns of typical i-state membership across age. The basic information used for the interpretation of the findings is given by a cross-tabulation between the typical i-states at age 10 and the typical i-states at age 13 (<italic>N</italic> = 773; see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0165025412440947">Appendix 1</xref>). This information is elaborated and summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0165025412440947">Figure 1</xref> in the form of a stream chart.</p>

</fig>
<p>Examining <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0165025412440947">Figure 1,</xref> we first pay attention to the information related to frequency stability and change; that is, the percentages of all individuals belonging to the different typical i-states at the two ages. They indicate a high degree of frequency stability for almost all typical i-states, with only small age differences in the proportion of the sample that belongs to them. Cluster 7 (“verbal below average”) is the only exception, and for this cluster the proportion in the sample had significantly decreased, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 using a two-tailed test of correlated proportions, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0165025412440947">Fleiss (1981</xref>, p. 113). To interpret this frequency change, findings from subsequent ISOA analyses are helpful and we will come back to it later. </p>
<p>We see in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0165025412440947">Figure 1</xref> that the individual stabilities are also quite high in that there is a strong tendency for individuals who start at age 10 in a certain typical i-state to remain in the same typical i-state at age 13. For all typical i-states this tendency is significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and to be stable is 3.4 to 8.4 times more likely than expected under an independence model (explained in the section where ISOA is described). The stability is highest for cluster 9, “much above average,” suggesting that generalized high achievement and intelligence at an early school age very much increased the chances that a child, 3 years later, would again show the same favorable pattern (8.4 times more likely than expected by chance). Notably, the typical i-state closest to the “much above average” group, namely cluster 1 “above average,” does not show the same degree of stability (3.2 times more likely than expected by chance to remain in this typical i-state). </p>

<sec id="section8-0165025412440947">
<title>The typical i-state change map analysis</title>
<p>It was previously described how one could use the information about the dissimilarities between the typical i-states to enhance the information value when studying significant individual change. The results of such an analysis are conveniently presented in a typical i-state change map, and this analysis was applied to the present data. First we carried out multidimensional scaling of the dissimilarities between the typical i-states (nonmetric ALSCAL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0165025412440947">Kruskal, 1964</xref>) and extracted a two-dimensional solution with good fit (Young’s S-stress = 0.021; S-stress is the square root of the ratio of averaged squared error of fit to total sum of squares. An often-applied rule of thumb is that an S-stress value below 0.20 indicates sufficient fit). Then, in the picture representing the distances between the typical i-states, the significant individual changes were indicated by arrows. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0165025412440947">Figure 2</xref>. </p>
<p>For instance, it is seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0165025412440947">Figure 2</xref> that it was a significant change to have started at age 10 in the typical i-state cluster 7 (“verbal below average”) and, at age 13, having moved to cluster 2 (“average, nonverbal highest”; <italic>p</italic> = .01, 1.7 times more frequent than expected by chance). Coming back to the structural change previously noted for cluster 7, namely that the proportion belonging to “verbal below average” had significantly decreased between age 10 and age 13, we find that they tended to move to cluster 2. This change is not large since the distance map suggests that these two typical i-states are rather close to each other. It is further seen that all significant changes are between fairly similar typical i-states, and the only strongly significant change is the stream from cluster 4 (“much below average”) to cluster 5 (“below average, nonverbal lowest”; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). This finding indicates that it is, to a moderate degree, a typical change for children characterized by a very unpromising achievement-intelligence profile to show a moderate general improvement. Examining the cluster centroids presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0165025412440947">Table 2</xref> shows that this improvement was most pronounced in the verbal domain. No connecting vessels were found where significant individual changes occurred both from and to the members of any pair of typical i-states.</p>
<p>Although the dimensions produced by the multidimensional scaling are often not easy to interpret, in this case the configuration of the typical i-states in the two-dimensional picture suggests that dimension 1 is mainly discriminating general profile level and dimension 2 is mainly discriminating nonverbal strength—verbal strength. We see that most of the significant changes are in dimension 1, indicating a moderate change in the general level, and only one change is clearly taking place in dimension 2, indicating a decrease in the verbal domain and an increase in the nonverbal domain (from cluster 5 to cluster 3).</p>

<title>The analysis of closed paths</title>
<p>Closed paths were defined as paths that no one followed (i.e., time 1 typical i-state membership × time 2 typical i-state membership cells that had zero frequency). From <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0165025412440947">Table 3</xref> it is seen that all closed paths except one were reciprocally closed paths and that 3 years later no one in cluster 9 (“much above average”; <italic>N</italic> = 57) had moved to any of the three typical i-states characterized by being below average, and no one in any of these three groups (<italic>N</italic> = 278) had moved to “much above average” 3 years later. However, only three closed paths were significant when a stringent significance test (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) was performed using the earlier described test based on the binomial distribution with fr = 0.5 × exp. Cluster 1 (“above average”) and cluster 5 (“below average”) were then significant reciprocally closed paths.</p>

<title>The study of invariance of classifications across age</title>
<p>Using the earlier described methods, different aspects of the invariance of the time-invariant classification system were studied and the findings are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0165025412440947">Table 4</xref>. First, it can be seen that no ASEDC is large and that most are quite small. Hence at each time point each ISOA cluster is at least reasonably well mirrored by a cluster in the age-specific cluster analysis. With regard to class membership invariance, the relations between the ISOA solution and the age-specific solutions were high but not very high. It is also seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0165025412440947">Table 4</xref> that at each specific age the ISOA classification does almost as good a job as the age-specific classification in explaining the variance in the data. Taken together, this information suggests that the invariance assumption made in ISOA is tenable.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A distinction should be made between, on one hand, the theoretical idea, paradigm, and basic concepts of ISOA, and on the other hand, the methodological realization of ISOA in the form of the type of data analyzed and the statistical method that is used. With regard to theory, as previously presented, the core idea of ISOA is a view on short-term development, assuming that all individuals can be regarded as instances of a “meta process” that, at each point in time, is characterized by one of a limited number of typical configurations of the characteristics of this system. Belongingness to any of these typical configurations can vary between individuals and between time points, but the set of typical configurations is regarded as invariant. Within this framework we have presented a number of concepts: structural and individual stability and change, structural invariance, class membership invariance, comparative class homogeneity, as well as closed paths. These concepts were operationalized in terms of standard ISOA methodology, but they can be generalized. </p>
<p>With regard to method, it should be emphasized that the methodology presented here is only one way of translating the ISOA rationale into statistical analyses. We expect in future developments that other methodological approaches will be increasingly applied. For instance, model-based methods (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0165025412440947">Raftery &amp; Dean, 2006</xref>) hold the promise of providing a more elegant summary of the key features of the data and also of model testing (especially valuable if contrasting models can be tested against each other). This is possible by implementation and extensions of advanced standard statistical methodology that already exist. If the variables are categorical, a suitable specification of latent transition analysis can be used (LTA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0165025412440947">Collins &amp; Wugalter, 1992</xref>). LTA expands the latent Markov model to complex latent variables and the use of multiple indicators and, for instance, the transition probability matrix for the latent statuses then informs about development. Examples of two approaches for modeling developmental trajectories are general growth mixture modeling (GGMM), that handles both a categorical and continuous latent variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0165025412440947">Muthén, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0165025412440947">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2000</xref>), and group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM), which has been extended to the simultaneous modeling of trajectories in two variables, dual trajectory modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0165025412440947">Nagin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0165025412440947">Nagin &amp; Odgers, 2010</xref>). As we understand it, GBTM can in many cases be a useful method for analyzing individual pattern development and finding different developmental groups in cases where the value pattern for the dependent variable consists of not more than two variables. However, GBTM is not suitable in the (standard) ISOA situation where the value pattern of interest consists of more than two variables. Extensions of latent curve models to modeling multivariate change are discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0165025412440947">MacCallum, Kim, Malarkey, and Kiecolt-Glaser (1997</xref>). However, in many such extensions it should be recognized that, although in similarity to ISOA multivariate trajectories are studied, the variable pattern is not kept as an undivided whole in the analyses. A helpful discussion of this and some other aspects in applying a person-oriented approach is given by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0165025412440947">Sterba and Bauer (2010</xref>). Different model-based approaches are possible, depending on the specific scientific problem and the data available, for instance, in the case of continuous dependent variables, longitudinal extensions of latent profile analysis.</p>
<p>A model-based approach might be the researcher’s first choice, if its assumptions are met. A suitable approach of this type also models (benign) errors of measurement, which is not the case in the clustering method previously discussed. However, the issue of the tenability of the assumptions and the complexity of multivariate models of pattern development can present obstacles to the interpretation of the findings. A comparative strength of the standard ISOA approach is that the researcher stays closer to the data and can more easily judge the degree to which they conform to the findings produced by the analyses. In quite a few cases it is probably helpful to carry out both a model-based ISOA analysis and a more exploratory one based on the procedures suggested here or on procedures within the configural frequency analysis paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0165025412440947">von Eye &amp; Niedermeier, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0165025412440947">von Eye &amp; Pena, 2004</xref>). </p>
<p>We again emphasize that the theoretical rationale of ISOA can be methodologically realized in different ways. If the standard ISOA methodology is used, the basic classification into typical i-states is achieved using cluster analysis. In this type of analysis, usually the dissimilarity matrix is analyzed; that is, the matrix of value profile dissimilarities for all pairs of objects. The variables in the profile can be at different scale levels and it is important that a dissimilarity measure is used that corresponds to the scale level (i.e. for approximately interval scaled variables the averaged squared Euclidean distance is often used; for nominal scaled variables the matching coefficient is often used). However, the basic classification of typical i-states can also be derived from theory or from the data using a model-based approach, as indicated earlier. </p>
<p>ISOA is a methodology for studying short-term developmental stability and change in the pattern of variable values. In contrast to other classification-based methods with this purpose, ISOA builds on a classification structure that is time-invariant. This makes it considerably simpler to make comparisons across age and interpret developmental trends because exactly the same typical i-states appear at all ages. Another strength of the ISOA methodology is that, in the first step where the time-invariant classification structure is derived, the number of objects that are analyzed equals the number of time points multiplied by the number of subjects. This means that, even for a fairly small sample, the number of analyzed objects will be fairly large if there are many measurement points. This is a useful property because, if a random sample from a population is assumed, a fairly large sample size is usually needed to make inferences about the classification structure at the population level. </p>
<p>However, in ISOA it must be assumed that the classification structure is essentially the same at all time points. Of course the proportions of the sample that belong to the different typical i-states can vary and individuals may change the typical i-state they belong to—but the typical i-states are assumed to be the same at all time points. The assumption of an invariant classification system can normally only be expected to hold when short-term pattern development is studied. It should always be checked and some methods for doing this were indicated. </p>
<p>Overviewing the empirical findings, a picture of high stability of the intelligence-achievement patterns emerges. All typical i-states are about equally common at both ages and individuals strongly tend to belong to the same typical pattern at both ages. Even the only strongly significant individual change is less pronounced than the weakest individual stability. Thus the often reported high stability of intelligence-achievement <italic>variables</italic> also seems to hold for <italic>patterns</italic>, including some indicating under- or overachievement.</p>
<p>We believe the analysis of closed paths reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0165025412440947">Table 3</xref> produced interesting findings. For instance, barriers (reciprocally closed paths) were found for the movement between, on the one hand, the typical i-state characterized as “much above average” and, on the other hand, those characterized as being “below average”. These barriers to developmental pattern change were not only strong, which was to be expected, but they were impermeable. This “deterministic” picture was not revealed when we studied correlations between the variables, examined regression residuals, etcetera (these findings were not reported in the tables). In an analysis of IDA data, looking at the school grades in Swedish and mathematics separately, it was found that, out of 179 children who at age 10 had a grade in Swedish below average, only two children at age 13 had a grade above average, and out of 169 who at age 10 had a grade in mathematics below average, only two children at age 13 had a grade above average (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0165025412440947">Bergman, 1978</xref>). This simple analysis of two different achievement variables to those used in the empirical example (grades instead of standardized achievement as measured by tests) gives some support to the notion of an extremely strong developmental barrier between high and low achievement. This is a potentially worrisome finding for educators and it deserves to be confirmed or refuted on samples from a different time and location.</p>
<p> To keep the empirical example short and simple, a case with only two time points was presented. The normal situation where ISOA is applied is when many time points are used that are fairly close together (for an example, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0165025412440947">Nurmi &amp; Aunola, 2005</xref>). In the case of many time points, the standard way to proceed is that, after the sequences of all subjects’ typical i-state membership have been derived, they are cross-tabulated between each adjoining pair of time points, and results are presented in summary form as the one given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0165025412440947">Figure 1</xref>, with a new column added for each time point after the first two. The typical i-state change map is possible, but more cumbersome to adjust to the case of many time points, and the simplest solution is to present one map for each pair of adjacent time points. To study the full sequences of class membership without in any way breaking them up is possible and can be theoretically attractive, but in practice it is difficult because a very large sample size is needed, and findings tend to be complex. </p>
<p>By taking undivided patterns of information into account, the complexity of the analyses increases and this can make it hard to meet stringent statistical demands on power and proper significance testing. With regard to ISOA, the fact that only nominal information is used in the significance tests, combined with cell-wise testing, can lead to a multiple significance testing problem and to low power, if the sample is not large. This problem is present also in the empirical example presented here in spite of the fact that the sample was fairly large (<italic>N</italic> = 773). However, the problem can be reduced if a limited number of theoretically derived hypotheses is first tested (e.g., hypotheses about individual stability), and then the remaining paths are explored using corrections for multiple significance testing.</p>
<p> The most important criterion for judging the usefulness of a methodological approach should be the problem-method match. The ISOA methodology is rooted in the person-oriented research paradigm, which implies that it should be regarded as appropriate if ISOA is to be considered. The acceptance or rejection of this framework obviously depends on the scientific question asked and the researcher’s guiding theory. We claim that a person-oriented theoretical framework, with its focus on individual development and with individuals regarded as “functioning wholes,” is useful in a number of areas. This is increasingly recognized, perhaps because most modern developmental theories have many properties that fit the person-oriented research paradigm. If this framework is accepted, application of standard variable-oriented methods can be problematic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0165025412440947">Carlson, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0165025412440947">Molenaar, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0165025412440947">von Eye &amp; Bergman, 2003</xref>), and a better problem-method match is often obtained by applying a person-oriented methodological approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0165025412440947">Bergman &amp; Trost, 2006</xref>) or an individual-specific approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0165025412440947">Nesselroade &amp; Ram, 2004</xref>).</p>
