<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This is one of the largest series reporting outcomes for outpatient thyroid surgery. Since these surgeries appear to be shifting to an outpatient setting, this report reflects the experience with the majority of endocrine surgeries from the UHC database being performed presently. These results are derived from teaching hospitals and their affiliates and may not reflect the entirety of thyroid surgery in the United States.</p>

<body>
<p>Thyroid surgery in the United States is widely performed for both benign and malignant disease. The safety and effectiveness of this surgery continue to improve with smaller incisions, better hemostasis, better anesthesia, and postoperative rapid assay parathyroid hormone levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813477823">1</xref></sup> It has been shown that thyroid surgery can be done safely on an outpatient basis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813477823">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813477823"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813477823"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813477823"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599813477823"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813477823"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813477823"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599813477823">9</xref></sup> One prospective study comparing inpatient vs outpatient thyroidectomy reported average costs of $2875 and $1991, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599813477823">10</xref></sup> Larger multi-institutional studies of cost studies of outpatient thyroid surgery would help define cost savings compared with inpatient surgery.</p>
<p>The University Health System Consortium (UHC), Oak Brook, Illinois, was formed in 1984 and consists of 112 academic medical centers and more than 250 of their affiliated hospitals. This represents 90% of the nonprofit academic medical centers in the United States (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uhc.edu">www.uhc.edu</ext-link>). Data are compiled from discharge summaries into a secure, interactive, web-based database referred to as the Clinical Database/Resource Manager (CDB/RM). The CDB/RM provides an expanded set of comparative demographic, cost, and procedural data as well as analytic tools to support the clinical operations of member institutions. Participating hospitals can benchmark openly with other hospitals by accessing this transparent, web-enabled database.</p>
<p>The UHC data set has potential advantages over the better known Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, which reports on a limited population (26% of the total US population) from selected areas of the United States, is restricted to Medicare recipients (mostly senior citizens), and focuses exclusively on cancer patients (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://seer.cancer.gov">http://seer.cancer.gov</ext-link>). The UHC collects from a broader population (4 million discharges in 2009) than the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Database (NSQIP). The NSQIP had 336,190 cases submitted from 237 sites in 2009 and collects outcomes data for 30 days following discharge (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.acsnisqip.org">www.acsnisqip.org</ext-link>).</p>
<p>There are several changes occurring in head and neck endocrine surgery. This surgery seems to be shifting from the inpatient to outpatient setting. Moreover, there are well-known, yet relatively infrequent, complications from thyroid surgery. Reduction of these complications seems to be inversely related to a surgeon’s operative volume.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813477823">3</xref></sup> Ability to anticipate complications as they occur or prevent them from occurring has enabled this transition to outpatient surgery for thyroidectomy.</p>
<p>Examination of a large database will allow generation of data regarding the recent past history of thyroid surgery and will provide a context for future changes in charges and complications. This information will also be useful for patients, providers, and policy makers in making decisions regarding use of the health care system for surgical treatment of thyroid disease.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>This study was reviewed by the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences institutional review board and determined to be exempt. The UHC database data are compiled from discharge summaries into a secure, interactive, web-based database. We had access to the entirety of the database behind the web portal by special arrangement and collaboration. Each discharge is considered a discrete event in the database, and patients are not followed longitudinally following discharge by design. The outpatient data collection set has been a recent addition to the originally established UHC inpatient discharge database. Outpatient data are not complete from all UHC institutions and have been phased in over recent years. Outpatient costs are not yet available, so charges are reported as a proxy for cost. Consequently, we took a subset of the UHC data with institutions completely reporting inpatient and outpatient data over the study period. Since encounters are treated as discrete events, patient unique identifiers were used to link encounters of possible significance over 30 days following the outpatient surgery encounter to search for possible complications.</p>
<p>Data were accessed in 2011 and reflected quarterly data collected from 2005 to 2010 (24 quarters). Searching strategy was based on diagnoses of thyroid disease (benign and malignant) and patients undergoing thyroidectomy and neck dissection across all UHC member facilities that contribute data to the outpatient surgical repository. Demographic information was collected for each encounter. Complications evaluated in this analysis included hypocalcemia, vocal cord paralysis, aspiration pneumonia (as a possible proxy for vocal fold paralysis), hematoma, wound infection, stroke, myocardial infarction, deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, and death. Charges from thyroid surgery were collected from a subset of hospitals that reported both outpatient and inpatient data for just the year 2010 due to lack of charge data collection among some hospitals in previous years and to remove reporting bias.</p>
<p>Descriptive statistics are reported; specifically, means and medians were used to summarize continuous data, whereas categorical information was summarized using counts and percentages. Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used to compare inpatient and outpatient charges. Outpatient and inpatient trends, demographics, and proportion of sample done as outpatient between study start (2005) and study end (2010) were subjected to Pearson correlation and χ<sup>2</sup> analyses. Comparisons between outpatients and inpatients used a 2-sample <italic>t</italic> test to analyze age, whereas a Pearson χ<sup>2</sup> test was used for sex and race. The analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, North Carolina) and R version 2.9.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).</p>
<p>Additional analysis was done to address possible bias of data by comparing morbidity of patients undergoing outpatient and inpatient thyroid surgery. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) chronic and comorbid conditions were used to analyze a cohort of our sample for which these data were available from the first quarter of 2009 until the end of 2010 (8 quarters).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599813477823">11</xref></sup>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A 175-hospital subset that had complete outpatient and inpatient data collection over the study period was analyzed. There were 38,362 patients who had outpatient thyroid surgery. In total, 26,079 (68%) patients had thyroid surgery for benign disease, and 12,283 (32%) patients had surgery for thyroid cancer. Thirty-six percent of surgeries were hemithyroidectomies and 43% total thyroidectomies. Of the thyroid cancer patients, 2105 had a simultaneous neck dissection (17.1%). Sixty-four patients had neck dissection with a hemithyroidectomy. This was presumed to be a completion “hemi” thyroidectomy with neck dissection being performed for a previous diagnostic hemithyroidectomy that returned malignant results.</p>
<p>The average age of the sample was 49.1 (2-114.9) years. Eighty-one percent of the patients were female. Racial designation was as follows: 75% white, 13% black, 3% Hispanic, and 9% other. The number of thyroidectomies in both admission settings has increased over time, about 4000 to more than 10,000 for outpatients and about 5000 to more than 8000 for inpatients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599813477823"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). This is consistent with a reported rising incidence in thyroid cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599813477823">12</xref></sup> The proportion of inpatient to outpatient thyroidectomies has decreased over the study period. Outpatient thyroid surgery numbers had a Pearson correlation of 0.9442 over the study period, which was significant (<italic>P</italic> = .0046). Inpatient thyroid surgery likewise had a high degree of correlation in numbers over the study, 0.9928 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001).</p>

<p>As of 2010, more than 10,000 outpatient thyroidectomies had been performed annually in our subset of UHC hospitals. Currently, about 55% of thyroid surgery is done as outpatient, up from about 4400 cases in 2005 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599813477823"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). When analyzing outpatient thyroid surgery data from initiation to conclusion, there was a statistical increase for all parameters measured by χ<sup>2</sup> analysis (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Of the patients, 64.2% stayed overnight in the hospital but were discharged within 23 hours, still allowing them designation as outpatients. When examining the “outpatient” designation more closely, same-day discharges dominated only slightly for hemithyroidectomy, whereas an overnight stay was twice as likely for complete thyroidectomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0194599813477823"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>).</p>

<p>All known complications were reported from our 38,362-outpatient data set and compared to inpatient data, 2005 to 2010. Complications searched included myocardial infarction (MI), wound infection, aspiration pneumonia, hematoma, unilateral vocal cord paralysis, bilateral vocal cord paralysis, cerebrovascular accident, and deep venous thrombosis (DVT). No documentation was found of any occurrences of MI, wound infection, aspiration pneumonia, bilateral vocal cord paralysis, or stroke. There were 10 reported episodes of unilateral vocal cord paralysis, which represented 0.02% of the sample. There were also 13 cases of wound hematoma (0.03%), 261 cases of hypocalcemia (0.58%), and 1 case of DVT (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599813477823"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>).</p>

<p>Although some thyroidectomy patients, both inpatient and outpatient, do not have documented and coded AHRQ chronic and/or comorbid conditions, many do. Ninety percent of outpatients and 27% of inpatients had no chronic and/or comorbid condition. A total of 38,599 inpatients and 18,594 outpatients were available for this analysis. The conditions that are present occur in about the same rank order for both inpatients and outpatients. The top 4 chronic/comorbid conditions are hypertension, metastatic cancer, diabetes, and chronic pulmonary disorders, respectively. Inpatient chronic and comorbid conditions appear to be documented and coded more often as outpatient. In summary, healthier patients tended to have outpatient surgery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0194599813477823"><bold>Figure 5</bold></xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A challenge with UHC data is that each admission to discharge event (inpatient or outpatient) is kept as a discrete data set. If an outpatient is readmitted, this is recorded as a separate event with the UHC database and would not be known to an investigator searching the database for outpatient procedures unless it was specifically searched by unique identifier. Following patients for complications is very important to have a realistic view of the advisability of doing any particular procedure in an ambulatory setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599813477823">14</xref></sup> Consequently, we searched for our outpatients by their unique identifiers for 30 days following their procedure to examine for repeat hospital encounters that may have resulted from their outpatient procedures.</p>
<p>Common complications for thyroid surgery appear to be underreported. This likely results from diagnosis of complications being made in the outpatient clinic (unilateral vocal fold paralysis, hematoma, wound infection, or hypocalcemia) that might not transmit to a central electronic medical record. These clinic data are not entered by member institutions into the UHC database even if the outpatient clinic encounter occurs in a hospital-based clinic. Many of these outpatient encounters occur in private offices with stand alone records or do not have connected electronic medical records.</p>
<p>Another challenge with the UHC data is that it reports charges. Charges are not costs. Charge data can be manipulated to arrive at an approximation for cost, but this was not done in this study. This methodology has been better established for UHC inpatient charge data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599813477823">15</xref></sup> Charge data are from 2010 and came from 175 hospitals that filed financial reports for inpatients and outpatients in 2010. In reporting differences between the inpatient and outpatient setting in terms of charges, mean charges for inpatient ($20,510) were significantly higher than outpatient ($14,796) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). This does call into question whether the decreased charges are a reflection of skewed inpatient data from patients with significant comorbidities and excessive hospital stays. The median charges were not statistically different, and this speaks to an upward skewing of inpatient cost data likely from “sicker” patients with longer, more costly stays. “Sicker” patients were more likely to have inpatient surgery, which would potentially explain more costs for inpatients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0194599813477823"><bold>Figure 5</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>The UHC is a consortium of university hospitals and their affiliates. Therefore, one cannot necessarily extrapolate these results to the entire population of the United States. This database, however, is quite broad and well populated, which might overcome its limitation of representing tertiary care facilities and their affiliates. The same clinical problems can be coded differently, which highlights another of the shortcomings of database research where data are obtained from multiple contributors. In addition, many codes are entered retrospectively, not as they occur, by coders. If documentation by clinicians is poor, the data accuracy may be compromised.</p>
<p>Thyroid surgery is increasingly being done in the outpatient setting in the United States. By virtue of improved surgical technique, anesthesia technique, hemostatic methods, and calcium management, this can be done safely. By omitting inpatient hospitalization, the outpatient approach becomes a potentially cost-effective way to manage many benign and malignant thyroid diseases in patients who are otherwise good candidates for outpatient surgery. This is the largest known series reporting the experience with outpatient thyroid surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599813477823">16</xref></sup> Attempts to overcome inherent shortcomings of the database design with respect to this patient population will continue through additional analysis and ongoing research.</p>
