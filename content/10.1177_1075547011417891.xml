<abstract>
<p>This ethnography of communication was concerned with discovering a speech code in the discourse about values in science used by scientists and engineers working in nanoscale science and engineering. It was supported and guided by the theoretical framework of speech codes theory. Materials analyzed included 4 years of fieldwork at a U.S. research university and nanotechnology center and 20 in-depth interviews conducted with scientists and engineers working in nanotechnology. Data sets were constructed and analyzed to identify a distinctive speech code about science and social and ethical implications of nanotechnology that contains beliefs among its users about identity, society, and rhetoric.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In 1959, Richard Feynman delivered a speech titled “There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom” to the American Physical Society in which he proposed developing science and technology that would enable manipulation of matter at molecular and atomic levels. Although this speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1075547011417891">Feynman, 1960</xref>) can be seen as the origin of nanoscale science and engineering (NSE), or nanoscience and nanotechnologies, as a formal proposal, these labels only began to emerge some 25 years later with the publication of K. Eric <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1075547011417891">Drexler’s (1986)</xref> book <italic>Engines of Creation</italic> in which he introduced the term <italic>nanotechnology</italic>.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1075547011417891">Bennett and Sarewitz (2006)</xref> traced the development of the nano phenomenon, showing how U.S. federal funding for NSE shot up dramatically from $6 million in 1991 to $961 million by 2004 and “nano” began showing up in exponentially increasing numbers in titles of journal articles, journal titles, and grant proposals. For example, the number of articles listed in the Science Citation Index containing the word nano in their titles increased from several hundred in the late 1980s to more than 23,000 in 2003 and more than 150,000 in 2009.</p>
<p>Around the same time that the term <italic>nano</italic> was appearing with increasing frequency in journals and grant proposals, K. Eric Drexler, an engineer from MIT, published <italic>Engines of Creation</italic> (1986), the earliest detailed account of how nanotechnologies might develop. And although Drexler’s account was overwhelmingly optimistic, his description of the possible risk of self-assembling nanobots going amuck and attacking the biosphere (a scenario that is referred to as “the grey goo” problem) created concerns about the development of self-assembling molecules, or molecular manufacturing.</p>
<p>These concerns led to consumer and environmental groups such as the ETC Group calling for a moratorium on research that would lead to molecular manufacturing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1075547011417891">ETC Group, 2003</xref>). However, it was not until 2000 when <italic>Wired</italic> magazine ran a cover story by then CEO of Sun Microsystems Bill <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1075547011417891">Joy (2000)</xref> titled “Why the Future Doesn’t Need Us” about the impact of nanotechnologies that it reached a level of noise that began to receive media, public, and scholarly attention.</p>
<p>Although many in the mainstream scientific community reject Drexler’s vision, as well as Joy’s concerns, molecular manufacturing is referred to as “the holy grail” of NSE research and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1075547011417891">McKibben, 2003</xref>, p. 80; and my own personal communication with NSE scientists and engineers), and the same revolutionary narrative that is applied to NSE by Drexler and others is deployed by the mainstream scientific community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1075547011417891">Sparrow, 2007</xref>). Within the past few years, “nanotechnology” has become a trendy buzzword among science and technology circles, as well as in popular media, and was introduced into the mass consumer lexicon with the unveiling of the “nano” iPod by Apple in 2005. In the meantime, true nano-enhanced products have quietly been appearing in the consumer market, particularly in the personal care products market such as transparent sunscreens with high sun protection factors, among more than 1,000 currently available consumer products that use nanoscale materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1075547011417891">The Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies, 2011</xref>). Nanotech research firms estimate that production of nanotech products and services in industries such as information technology, medical devices, energy, and aircraft and auto manufacturing will reach $2.6 trillion by 2015 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1075547011417891">Uldrich, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Although there is significant disagreement about the definition of “nanotechnology” (with some scientists arguing that the label is simply a new construct for old processes), I will use the broad definition used by the participants in this study, that is, that nanotechnology refers to both the tools and the ability to manipulate matter at the nanoscale (1 billionth of a meter). Throughout this text I use the following terms synonymously: <italic>nano</italic>, <italic>nanotech</italic>, <italic>nanotechnology</italic>, <italic>nanotechnologies</italic>, and <italic>NSE</italic>. In doing so, I followed the lead of the participants in my study and the literature I encountered. Although I agree with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1075547011417891">Schummer’s (2007)</xref> point that nanotechnology is an inaccurate term in the singular since, there are presently several hundred different technologies in existence that can be considered nanotechnologies, I found that the singular term was used most frequently by participants in my study and have thus opted to use it here.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1075547011417891">Schummer (2007)</xref> identified three different approaches to defining nanotechnologies, with the caveat that “all are conspicuously vague” (p. 293). The first approach Schummer presents is that of a “nominal definition,” which “provides necessary and sufficient conditions that a technology must meet to be called a nanotechnology.” Schummer notes that “[t]ypical definitions” of nanotechnology refer to a size range of 1 to 100 nanometers but suggests that this definition is problematic as it “covers all the classical natural science and engineering disciplines that investigate and manipulate material objects” (p. 293). Among scientists and engineers, popular definitions of nanoscience and nanotechnology tend to be nominal definitions (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1075547011417891">Ratner &amp; Ratner, 2003</xref>). This may be precisely because the definition is vague, and thus, nonthreatening. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1075547011417891">Ratner and Ratner (2003)</xref> describe their own definition (a nominal definition) as “[not] a very sexy or fulfilling definition” (p. 7).</p>
<p>Schummer also identified a “teleological definition,” which “defines nanotechnology by its future goals.” He criticized this definition, saying it is “impracticable to identify current research as belonging to nanotechnology by the visions that researchers publicly propagate” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1075547011417891">Schummer, 2007</xref>, p. 293). However, teleological definitions do carry the excitement that nominal definitions lack and are commonly used among proponents of nanotechnology, such as Mihail Roco, one of the key figures who developed the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) in the United States.</p>
<p>The third definitional approach Schummer identified is that of “real definition,” which “refers to a list of specific research topics.” Schummer lists many examples of nanotechnology including microelectronical mechanical systems, nanoparticle research, and targeted drug delivery. Interestingly, NNI, the U.S. federal program that oversees federal funding for nanotechnology and development, uses all three of the above definitions to explain nanotechnology on its website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nano.gov/nanotech-101/nanotechnology-facts">http://www.nano.gov/nanotech-101/nanotechnology-facts</ext-link>).</p>
<sec id="section2-1075547011417891">
<title>Social and Ethical Issues (SEI) Raised by NSE</title>
<p>Regardless of which of the above definitions is used, a key aspect of nanotechnology inherent in all three of the definitions Schummer identifies is that it enables, potentially, the discovery of new phenomena and applications such as those that mimic the powerful capabilities of nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1075547011417891">Alivisatos, Roco, &amp; Williams, 1999</xref>). Once mastered, the potential that such ability appears to hold is seemingly all-pervasive in improving the quality of life, with developing applications in the manufacturing of improved materials for aircraft and automobiles, faster and smaller communications devices and electronics, more efficient environmental innovations, improved security devices, and targeted drug delivery systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1075547011417891">Alivisatos et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1075547011417891">Jelinski, 1999</xref>). Perhaps one of the most exciting potential applications of nanoscience is the treatment (and even elimination) of disease through nanomedical applications. Some proponents of the technologies even go so far as to predict human immortality made possible by the convergence of genetics, nanotechnologies, and robotics (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1075547011417891">Kurzweil, 2005</xref>). Some scholars have expressed concern regarding potential military applications of these technologies (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1075547011417891">Altmann, 2004</xref>). Others have suggested that the social and ethical implications of these technologies be examined prior to these anticipated revolutionary developments (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1075547011417891">Macnaghten, Kearnes, &amp; Wynne, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the U.S. Federal Government has prioritized research on NSE since the passage of the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act in 2003 through funding large-scale projects such as the NNI, less than 0.4% of the federal funding of NSE research has been allocated to addressing the social and ethical implications of such research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1075547011417891">Bennett &amp; Sarewitz, 2006</xref>). Research centers dealing with SEI related to nanotech are active at universities around the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union. Some projects, such as the NNI and the NNIN, which are discussed below, are only tangentially concerned with addressing SEI, and the rationale for doing so appears to be in the service of facilitating NSE development rather than raising substantive social and ethical questions about the technologies. The remaining projects reviewed below are explicitly concerned with studying the broad social and ethical implications of nanotechnologies.</p>
<p>The NNI was the first U.S. Federal initiative to address nanotechnology and nanoscience, established in 2000 to coordinate Federal nanotechnology research and development. The rationale for these efforts is to support the NNI “vision” of “a future in which the ability to understand and control matter at the nanoscale leads to a revolution in technology and industry that benefits society” (NNI, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nano.gov/about-nni/what/vision-goals">http://www.nano.gov/about-nni/what/vision-goals</ext-link>). Twenty-five federal agencies participate in the NNI, including the departments of Defense; Health and Human Services; Food and Drug Administration; Homeland Security; and the National Science Foundation.</p>
<p>The National Science Foundation currently funds two Centers for Nanotechnology in Society, one at Arizona State University and the other at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The explicit purpose of these centers is to study various aspects of nanotechnology in society. Additionally, a growing number of university research centers based in the United Kingdom and the European Union have focused on various efforts to engage the public in discussions about nanotechnology at the outset of research and development in order to promote ethical development of technologies (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1075547011417891">Stilgoe, 2007</xref>). These examples are just a few of the federally funded projects at universities and research centers around the world attempting to respond to calls for consideration of SEI in nanotech R&amp;D.</p>
<p>Launched in 2004, the National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network (NNIN) is “an integrated partnership” of 13 nanotechnology user facilities “providing unparalleled opportunities for nanoscience and nanotechnology research” (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nnin.org/index.html">http://www.nnin.org/index.html</ext-link>). The user facilities are located on university campuses across the United States. Eight of the 13 partnering institutions are involved in research on SEI related to nanotechnology, identified by the NNIN as the following: economic and political implications of potential technology; implications for science and education; medical, environmental, space exploration, and national security implications; and social, ethical, legal, and cultural implications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1075547011417891">NNIN, 2008</xref>). I developed and implemented the study that follows over the 4 years (2005-2008) that I worked as a research assistant on the SEI team at one of the NNIN institutions.</p>

<title>Theoretical Background</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1075547011417891">Fetterman (2010)</xref> has stated that “no study, ethnographic or otherwise, can be conducted without an underlying theory or model” to guide one’s research (p. 5) and suggested that the theory should be selected on the basis of “appropriateness, ease of use, and explanatory power” (p. 7). With this in mind, I selected speech codes theory (SCT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1075547011417891">Philipsen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1075547011417891">Philipsen, Coutu, &amp; Covarrubias, 2005</xref>) as the theoretical framework to support and guide this study. This approach originated out of a scholarly enterprise referred to as the ethnography of communication developed in the early 1960s by Dell Hymes (1927-present), an anthropologist and linguist. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1075547011417891">Hymes (1974)</xref> said that “[ethnography of communication] implies two characteristics that an adequate approach to language must have” (p. 3): ethnography, “investigat[ing] directly the use of language in contexts of situtations” (p. 3) and communication, “investigating [a community’s] communicative activities as a whole” (p. 4). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1075547011417891">Hymes (1962)</xref> had earlier described his approach to the study of language as answering “a question of what a foreigner must learn about a group’s verbal behavior in order to participate appropriately and effectively in its activities” (p. 16). In 1972, he recommended that comparative fieldwork studies of cultural ways of speaking be undertaken and called for “new types of discovery procedures and concepts designed to facilitate the empirical collection of data” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1075547011417891">Hymes, 1972</xref>, p. 36). This call was answered by many scholars in multiple disciplines, first in the period of 1964-1972 with the work of prominent scholars such as anthropologists Ethel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1075547011417891">Albert (1972)</xref> and Keith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1075547011417891">Basso (1970)</xref>, folklorist Richard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1075547011417891">Bauman (1970)</xref>, and anthropologist and linguist Joel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1075547011417891">Sherzer (1973)</xref> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1075547011417891">Philipsen &amp; Carbaugh, 1986</xref>, for a bibliography of approximately 210 published studies that responded to Hymes between 1964 and 1984; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1075547011417891">Philipsen, 2010</xref>, for a recent overview of the approach). A second generation of scholars followed the 1964-1972 group, including Gerry Philipsen whose 1975 groundbreaking study of ways of speaking in a south Chicago neighborhood published in the <italic>Quarterly Journal of Speech</italic> is largely regarded as the introduction of the ethnography of communication as a scholarly enterprise into the communication discipline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1075547011417891">Leeds-Hurwitz, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Responding to Hymes’s call for new resources to use when conducting ethnographies of communication, Philipsen introduced SCT in 1992, and the theory was formally explicated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1075547011417891">1997 (Philipsen)</xref> and revised in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1075547011417891">2005 (Philipsen et al.)</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1075547011417891">Philipsen (2002)</xref> described SCT in the following way:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>A speech code, [speech codes theory] posits, implicates a distinctive way of answering the following questions: What is a person, and how is personhood efficaciously and properly enacted communicatively? What is an ideal state of sociation, and how do people efficaciously and properly link themselves into such states through communicative conduct? What are efficacious and proper means of communication, and what meanings are expressed in and through their situated use? (p. 56)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>SCT comprises six propositions which assert that in a given speech community, one or more speech codes implying a “distinctive psychology, sociology, and rhetoric” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1075547011417891">Philipsen, 1997</xref>) can be identified through the communicative conduct of its users. Moreover, the theory asserts that an understanding of such speech codes used enables one to both predict and control some aspects of communicative conduct among those who use the code(s). Thus, SCT is concerned not only with describing the discourse in a given speech community but also with proposing a theoretic explanation specific to each speech community examined that accounts for the particular findings.</p>
<p>In addition to being part of the larger enterprise of the ethnography of communication as described above, this project is situated among the array of research from various disciplines addressing the social and ethical issues related to nanotechnologies in particular, and to science and technology in general. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1075547011417891">Berube (2006)</xref> identified key arguments in the collective public discourse for and against nanotechnology, providing a thorough overview of the controversy around nanotechnology and identifying the primary actors in what Berube refers to as “the nanocommunity” (p. 43). It is my intention that the work presented here should provide additional depth and insight into the perspectives of one group of stakeholders in this conversation, that of the scientists and engineers working at the nanoscale.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1075547011417891">Berne (2006)</xref> presented full texts of interviews with scientists and engineers about ethics in general and beliefs about science and technology, with particular emphasis on nanotechnologies. Using open coding and grounded theory, Berne identified 17 categories in the interviews, including the following categories that are relevant to my own analysis: personal aspirations, beliefs about science, perceptions about nanotechnology generally, conceptual blocks to ethics considerations, and pure science versus engineering or application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1075547011417891">Berne, 2006</xref>, p. 327). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1075547011417891">Berne (2006)</xref> noted that “most [of the scientists and engineers she spoke to] are unable to make direct connections between ethics and what they do” (p. 116), a finding consistent with my own.</p>
<p>In addition to rhetorical analysis and the grounded theory approach, other approaches to studies of science and technology communication include framing theory and folk theories. Framing theory is used to explain how the presentation of a topic, including use of language, word choice, and metaphors, may influence how people think about the given topic, particularly in mass media news coverage. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1075547011417891">Weaver, Lively, and Bimber (2009)</xref> used frame analysis to identify four issue frames for U.S. news media stories about nanoscale science and technology from 1999 to 2008 and found that early frames focused on progress and generic risk whereas frames after 2007 focused on regulation and conflict. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1075547011417891">Cobb (2005)</xref> used framing theory to assess public opinion about nanotechnology in a national survey and found that framing nanotechnology in a particular way in the survey appeared to influence public opinion about nanotechnology.</p>
<p>The concept of folk theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1075547011417891">Rip, 2006</xref>) is similar to SCT. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1075547011417891">Rip (2006)</xref> described folk theories as “evolve[ing] in ongoing practices,” “a form of expectations,” and “part of a repertoire” held by a group (p. 349). Similarly, SCT asserts that speech codes also evolve, that they exert a social force (not always followed, however), and that they function as a communicative resource (or repertoire) from which one may draw in order to communicate with others. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1075547011417891">Rip (2006)</xref> identified three clusters of folk theories related to nanotechnologies and suggested that the evolving nature of these theories provides opportunities for interactions with social scientists where folk theories can be addressed and debated.</p>
<p>While the above approaches are useful in understanding science communication and the discourse of scientists, Philipsen’s approach provides another set of theoretical resources that can be used not only to identify but also to negotiate the multiple, complex perspectives on social and ethical implications of emerging technologies held by diverse publics. Perspectives (folk theories, speech codes, rhetorical strategies, frames, etc.) on nanotechnology can be identified and analyzed using a variety of approaches as described above; however, by identifying the interconnected elements of a given speech code, SCT connects theory to practice by suggesting how these perspectives can be challenged, contested, and replaced through a discursive negotiation process in which parties are able to understand (if not always agree with) each other through the use of a shared speech code.</p>

<title>Support for and Extension of SCT</title>
<p>To date, a significant body of empirical evidence obtained within a diversity of communities, and encompassing many languages, cultures, and communicative practices, supports SCT. This literature includes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1075547011417891">Carbaugh’s (1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1075547011417891">1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1075547011417891">2005</xref>) studies of Blackfeet, Finnish, and American speech codes; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1075547011417891">Fong’s 1998</xref> study of a Chinese speech code; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1075547011417891">Fitch’s 1991</xref> study of Mexican speech codes; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1075547011417891">Katriel’s (1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1075547011417891">2004</xref>) study of Israeli speech codes; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1075547011417891">Coutu’s 2000</xref> study of American speech codes; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1075547011417891">Winchatz’s 2001</xref> study of German speech codes; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1075547011417891">Philipsen’s (1975</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1075547011417891">1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1075547011417891">1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1075547011417891">1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1075547011417891">2000</xref>) studies of American speech codes, to name a few of the many extant studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1075547011417891">Philipsen, 2002</xref>). These studies were used to help develop and provide empirical support for SCT and do so not just by offering a descriptive account of a given community’s culturally distinctive way of communicating but also by providing an understanding of the “culturally distinctive psychology, sociology, and rhetoric” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1075547011417891">Philipsen et al., 2005</xref>, p. 61) embedded within these particular ways of communicating. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1075547011417891">Winchatz (2001)</xref> found that the use of specific pronouns in personal address in Germany reflected the speakers’ beliefs about their relationships with others and had a powerful impact on things such as job satisfaction. Some of the published studies cited above have also extended SCT. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1075547011417891">Coutu (2000)</xref>, for example, found evidence of more than one speech code in her study of discourse about Robert McNamara’s role in the Vietnam War. This led to the addition of a new proposition to SCT stating that multiple speech codes, rather than one, will be deployed in any given speech community.</p>
<p>SCT thus offers a theoretical resource that can be used to discover and illuminate what is culturally distinctive about the ways in which nanotechnology is talked about within a particular segment of the scientific community, that is, scientists and engineers who self-identify as working in nanotechnology. For the researcher embarking on an investigation of a culture that is not his or her own, a cultural codes approach to communicative conduct is useful in obtaining even a rudimentary understanding of the cultural worlds of the community being investigated. The social and ethical implications of nanoscience and nanotechnologies afford one area where an examination of scientific discourse may provide both “descriptive” and “theoretic” value, two goals of ethnographies of communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1075547011417891">Philipsen &amp; Coutu, 2005</xref>, p. 357). An examination of the discourses surrounding NSE would provide descriptive value in identifying the speech codes within a particular scientific “communal conversation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1075547011417891">Philipsen, 2002</xref>). Additionally, such analysis has the theoretical value of suggesting how to understand, engage in, challenge, or otherwise appropriate the discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1075547011417891">Philipsen, 1997</xref>). This research also has the theoretic value of adding to the cumulative extant literature on sociolinguistics and science and technology studies.</p>

<title>Research Questions</title>
<p>With the above descriptive and theoretic goals in mind, the overarching research question guiding this study asks what communal conversation is taking place about the values of technology and science in general, and about nanotechnologies in particular, within the scientific community. This purpose is expressed by the following three research questions:</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>My interest in the discourse of nanotechnology stems from a broader interest in how communication both creates culture and is itself created by culture (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1075547011417891">Philipsen, 1987</xref>). Specifically, I am interested in how the discourse around nanotechnology creates or contributes to the maintenance of a scientific culture and how this culture enables or constrains the discourse that represents it. Thus, in order to examine the relationship between scientific discourse and scientific culture, I turned to an ethnographic approach to interrogate this relationship. Although ethnographies have become common modes of social science research in science and technology studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1075547011417891">Hess, 2001</xref>), to my knowledge, an ethnography of communication has not previously been conducted in a scientific setting. Because my research interest was specifically focused on communication about nanotechnology, I chose to use this methodological and theoretical approach.</p>
<p>My goal in conducting this research was to understand the cultural aspects of the discourse of nanoscience/nanotechnologies through a comparison of observed behavior and actual speech. To achieve this goal, I used multiple modes of inquiry, including fieldwork, participant observation, and interviews based on a method advocated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1075547011417891">Briggs (1986)</xref> described below. This methodological approach is consistent with published ethnographies of communication (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1075547011417891">Katriel &amp; Philipsen, 1981</xref>) as well as general ethnographies conducted in the field of science and technology studies (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1075547011417891">Hess, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Data analyzed for this study were obtained from two main sets of materials. The first set of materials I collected was based on my fieldnotes from 4 years of experiences in nanoscience classrooms, attending scientific lectures, participating and observing three conferences (one on nanoethics, one on nanotechnology, and one on technology in general), and conducting informal interviews with various stakeholders in these arenas. My second set of materials consists of 20 in-depth interviews I conducted with scientists at the university associated with the Center for Nanotechnology in which they discussed their research and their views of SEI posed by the research. The length of time I spent in the field, triangulation of data sources, and use of standard data collection and analysis methods for similar studies all contributed to the validity of this study. Data saturation was achieved at 20 interviews when I began hearing similar responses from those I interviewed. The respondents interviewed for this study are recognized by their peers to be among the leading researchers in nanoscience and nanotechnology in the United States and represent a wide range of disciplines in science and engineering.</p>
<p>I analyzed the data I collected from the interviews using discourse analysis to identify and explicate participant meanings. Additionally, I considered these responses in light of what I had learned during my field-level activities. Although I consulted the fieldnotes I had made from these activities, I did not conduct a formal analysis of these data, opting instead to use the data set as a background for understanding the interview data and indicating (or supporting) the use of particular speech codes. Utilizing an approach described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1075547011417891">Schatzman and Strauss (1973</xref>, p. 117), I conducted multiple readings of all my materials, moving back and forth between my fieldnotes, my observational notes, and the interview transcripts to complete my analysis.</p>
<p>I approached the analysis of the interview data in the following way. First, I printed out copies of each transcribed interview and read through each one on its own terms, making notes in the margins and underlining words and phrases that caught my attention. I also began to map out the linear path of the event, noting how the interview began, how it proceeded, how it ended, and whether there were any shifts in key or genre.</p>
<p>Second, I analyzed the individual responses I received to my questions from each interviewee, considering the metacommunicative features of each response and verifying my interpretations by considering the context. I also used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1075547011417891">Hymes’s (1972)</xref> SPEAKING<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1075547011417891">1</xref></sup> framework, a dialectical system in which one or more of the elements of a communicative interaction can be examined in relation to each other. In all, I read each transcript in its entirety a minimum of six times and reviewed those portions I highlighted during these readings numerous more times throughout the analysis and writing up phases of the project findings.</p>
<p>In presenting portions of the transcripts, I have used a convention illustrated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1075547011417891">Johnstone’s (2002)</xref> text <italic>Discourse Analysis</italic>. Thus, I number each line of text, allowing the breaks in text to occur at the right margin, and including in italics a reference number to indicate the respondent. The transcription conventions I used are from those presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1075547011417891">Silverman’s (2003)</xref> text (see p. 254).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In the analysis that follows I will focus on Proposition 3 of SCT: “A speech code implicates a culturally distinctive psychology, sociology, and rhetoric” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1075547011417891">Philipsen et al., 2005</xref>, p. 61). Psychology in this use refers to how the speakers describe or imply ideas about what it means to be a certain kind of person in light of communication, for example, a man should hit unruly children, not talk to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1075547011417891">Philipsen, 1975</xref>); “an ‘expert’ should speak to the ‘average citizen’ using ‘simple terms’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1075547011417891">Leighter, 2007</xref>, p. 201); or a scientist should not talk about ethics, as I discovered. Sociology refers to ideas about the nature of society, the nature of groups in a society, and the nature of the possibilities or preferred forms of sociation. For example, in some Finnish communities, the preferred form of sociation among groups is one in which the communicative conduct that links people to one another is characterized by quiet observation and respectful silence. This particular speech code values a view of society as one in which its members show respect toward each other by not speaking until they “have something socially worthwhile to say” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1075547011417891">Carbaugh, 2005</xref>, p. 123). Rhetoric refers to ideas within a given speech community about what is appropriate and effective communicative conduct. For example, allowing a close friend to speak on your behalf was considered appropriate and effective within the Teamsterville community that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1075547011417891">Philipsen (1975)</xref> studied. However, this type of communicative conduct was not valued within a mainstream American speech code and, in fact, devalued as Philipsen describes.</p>
<p>Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1075547011417891">Leighter (2007)</xref> before me, Proposition 3 is the primary proposition of SCT on which I focused my study of scientific ways of speaking about nanotechnology. Specifically, I looked for what was culturally distinctive about the ways in which this speech community understood notions of identity, social relations, and the role of communication. Where <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1075547011417891">Leighter (2007)</xref> used the keyword “citizen” to interrogate his materials, I used a more general frame of “talk about nano” (using one of my respondent’s words) to look for distinctive and shared ideas among my respondents and the speech community I studied regarding “the nature of persons, social relations, and the role of communicative conduct in linking persons in social relations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1075547011417891">Philipsen et al., 2005</xref>, p. 61).</p>
<p>I considered aspects of the code that indicate what is culturally distinctive in this speech community regarding understandings of human nature (psychology), social relations (sociology), and strategic conduct (rhetoric; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1075547011417891">Philipsen et al., 2005</xref>, p. 61) by attending to key symbols and their meanings, premises, and rules that correspond to each of the three interrelated areas. I attended to three elements in particular from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1075547011417891">Hymes’s (1972)</xref> SPEAKING framework, “participants,” “ends/goals,” and “acts,” to help elucidate these elements.</p>

<title>What SCT Means by “Psychology”</title>
<p>In what follows, I use the term <italic>psychology</italic> in a particular way that is consistent with how the term is treated in SCT, as “implicat[ing] a view of what a person is and how persons are constituted” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1075547011417891">Philipsen, 1997</xref>, p. 138). In other words, “psychology” in the service of SCT refers to “a local code about the nature of persons” (G. Philipsen, personal communication, January 4, 2008). Thus, when I use the term <italic>psychology</italic> here, I am not talking about how the members of the speech community I investigated <italic>think</italic>, but <italic>their notion of how people think</italic>. My aim is to determine what the scientific speech code I discovered says about the nature of persons from the standpoint of those who use this speech code.</p>
<p>I began my fieldwork activities by attending nanotech seminars open to the public at the university, listening intently for some reference to the issues that had been raised in my literature review but hearing nothing apart from rather dry technical descriptions of the given speaker’s research. During these early months in the field I also attended a nanotechnology conference featuring industry and university researchers working in nanotechnology. As I attended each session and the subsequent question and answer sessions, I detected some tension around the term <italic>nanotechnology</italic> and began to suspect that discussing SEI was not culturally appropriate in this speech community. I had previously detected both these areas as problematic, both the term itself (<italic>nanotechnology</italic>) and the topic of SEI related to nanotechnology, particularly in an early interview with a senior nanotech faculty member in which he had discussed the likelihood that additional faculty members would identify social and ethical concerns with nanotechnology. The following excerpt was preceded by a question about whether scientists would perceive risks to be associated with research in nanotechnology:</p>

<p>Several aspects of the above excerpt were particularly helpful in my early formulation of the appropriate ways of communicating within this speech community. First, the respondent clearly suggests that scientists are not concerned about risks associated with nanotechnology. He references these concerns in the following ways:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>“[no] big concerns”</p>
<p>“the innate fear of [nano]”</p>
<p>“new dangers”</p>
<p>“knee jerk reactions”</p>
<p>“extreme reactions”</p>
<p>“perceived dangers”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In all the above instances, except for the reference to “new dangers,” the language used suggests an unscientific perspective, “reactions” that are based on “fear” or “perceived dangers” rather than reason or fact. The statement that scientists do not have “big concerns” suggests that scientists are in control of their research, that is, they might have “small” concerns, but nothing that they are unable to handle. This confidence in scientists being able to handle whatever may arise is reinforced by the respondent’s reference to scientists being “very supportive” (line 17) of addressing “new dangers” (line 15) that may arise. These references effectively diminish the possibility of adverse implications of nanotech research, implicitly suggesting that to think otherwise would be unscientific, because, after all, scientists themselves are not worried about these issues. This usage is also suggestive of an attitude that scientists are simply not concerned because there is nothing about which to be concerned.</p>
<p>Second, in line 7, the respondent had one very long pause of 7 seconds between “nano” and “technology” (the pause was an anomaly as there were not additional pauses of this length in the remainder of the interview), suggesting a discomfort with using the term in this way (as opposed to “nanoscience”). Earlier, in fact, the respondent had stated that scientists did not consider themselves to be working in nanotechnology, thus differentiating between theory and application and highlighting the ambivalence many basic researchers feel toward identifying their work as “nanotechnology.”</p>
<p>Finally, the co-occurrence of the terms <italic>regulation</italic> or <italic>regulatory</italic> with the terms <italic>evolution</italic> or <italic>evolve</italic> bears noticing. Out of the four uses of the term <italic>regulation</italic> or <italic>regulatory</italic>, the respondent uses the word <italic>evolve</italic> or <italic>evolution</italic> twice to describe the process of adjusting regulations to meet the needs of nanotech research and development:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>“there should be proper, you know, <bold>regulation</bold>” (lines 3-4)</p>
<p>“it’s gonna be kind of an <bold>evolution</bold> to figure out how to set up proper <bold>regulatory</bold> agencies” (lines 4-5)</p>
<p>“There’s a certain amount of, uh, <bold>regulation</bold> to be done as these things <bold>evolve</bold>, you know” (lines 11-12)</p>
<p>“All that stuff (xxx) will ultimately be handled by the same <underline><bold>regulatory</bold></underline> things that are already covering—mostly chemical type stuff” (lines 13-15)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The above usage suggests inevitability in the process of nanotech development and implies that “proper” regulation (which he refers to twice in lines 4 and 5) will automatically occur. In his last usage of “regulatory” in line 14, the respondent emphasized this word, suggesting its importance to his statement. I refer to this aspect of the code of science I observed in this speech community as a deterministic stance toward the development of science and technology.</p>
<p>The notion that discussing SEI related to science and technology with basic researchers was not appropriate reappeared after a nanotechnology conference presentation that took place at the university. During the presentation, the presenter had said that the goals of his research were to “emulate proven biological designs” and “impart life-qualities to robust engineering materials” (0088). After the presentation, an audience member asked that, given fascinating goals such as emulating nature, what kinds of applications might such research have and what kinds of issues might they raise. The presenter answered, “Applications? We don’t really think too much about applications? We’re just chemists” (0088). He laughed somewhat nervously and his answer was met with scattered laughter throughout the audience and a frustrated shrug from the questioner. At this point, another presenter on the panel spoke up and said that it would require at least 15 years to get through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval process to market a biomedical application, suggesting that the path from research to product development was a lengthy one involving many different agents and implying that it was quite understandable that the presenter would not have an application in mind.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1075547011417891">Philipsen (1992)</xref> has observed, “Not every meaning is given a word in every language or culture.” Overall, “social and ethical issues” appears to be a term that is largely without use in this speech community apart from a value about carefulness within and among scientific workers for their own health and on-the-job personal safety that is implicitly understood. Moreover, within the corpus of speech I heard in this study, I did not encounter a term addressing the study of long-term and widespread social impact or of broad, normative ethical questions.</p>
<p>In the excerpt that follows, the respondent suggests why scientists are not worried about social and ethical implications of nanotechnology or any area of science and technology. The excerpt took place near the end of the interview. The respondent had talked for nearly half an hour without interruption about nanotechnology. During his discussion of scientists’ perspectives on nanotechnology, he mentioned the book <italic>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1075547011417891">1986</xref>) by Richard Rhodes, which is a book about the physicists who developed the science that led to the development of nuclear weapons. In the following excerpt he refers to the book again:</p>

<p>The notion that scientists are, qua scientists, attuned to SEI is implicit in the above characterizations of being a scientist. Indeed, it is part of the nature of scientists as the previous respondent indicated in Excerpt 23: “we will always be smart enough . . . and we’re moral enough . . . to figure out how to . . . make the integrated result to the benefit of mankind. . .” (lines 7-9).</p>
<p>An additional understanding of a scientist’s nature was articulated as wanting to climb a mountain simply because it is there. For example, in the following excerpt, the scientist describes science and technology as “a mountain” that scientists “wanna climb”:</p>

<p>When I chuckled (line 5), the scientist responded in a serious tone, making it clear that she was not joking with her use of the analogy (line 6).</p>
<p>As the respondent in Excerpt 24 had asserted, she believes that scientists consider their purpose, and the goal of science and technology, to be motivated by a desire to benefit society. Consistent with her assertions, other respondents described the motivations of scientists and engineers in the following ways:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>“scientists aren’t supposed to worry about ethics” (0087)</p>
<p>“scientists are always interested in bettering society” (0073)</p>
<p>“[scientists] spend countless hours trying to do things that . . . help people” (0073)</p>
<p>“[as a scientist] you should be thinking about the possible applications of what you’re doing. . .” (0076)</p>
<p>“[as a scientist] you do have to think about [health and safety issues] all the time” (0076)</p>
<p>“people [including scientists and engineers] don’t really know what the ethical implications are going to be” (0058)</p>
<p>“[scientists and engineers] are trying to ease the problems that are present in. . . society” (0074)</p>
<p>“[a scientist’s goal is] to understand things” (0076)</p>
<p>“[scientists and engineers] are pushing the limits of science and technology” (0074)</p>
<p>“[scientists want] to do what you can in general to make this a better place to live” (0060)</p>
<p>“[science is] like a mountain—we wanna climb it” (0073)</p>
<p>scientists “don’t really deal with [social and ethical issues]” (0057)</p>
<p>considering SEIN is “no different than any other scientific project” (0056)</p>
<p>“scientists are scientists because they believe that they’re working to help mankind by being scientists” (0056)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These characterizations paint a picture of the scientist as someone who is motivated by curiosity, intellectual challenge, and the desire to benefit society, what I have termed the altruistic nature of a scientist.</p>

<title>Sociology/Social Relations</title>
<p>In addition to distinctive notions about psychology and identity, a speech code also implicates specific notions about sociology, or what the proper way for people to interact with one another is. In the first excerpt I present here, the respondent talks about the need for ethics training in the sciences, how he would handle a hypothetical ethical scenario, and the different roles of scientists and industry related to ethics and research and development:</p>

<p>Three aspects of the above excerpt are particularly relevant to the present discussion. First, the respondent’s statement in lines 1 to 4 that “bringing [scientists] to think in a different manner <underline>does</underline> require a proactive . . . effort” indicates a perceived need within this community, at least from this respondent’s perspective, for outside training in how to “think differently” about ethics related to nanotechnologies.</p>
<p>The interview and fieldwork data I collected indicated that understandings of ethics were implicit with science and largely limited in scope to “internal ethics” (0089) such as plagiarism, lab safety, and so on. Thus, to “think differently” about ethics (line 4) implies thinking about these issues in terms that are different from the present understanding of ethics as internal issues.</p>
<p>The need for thinking differently about ethics was raised by scientists during a panel presentation for social studies of science faculty at the university. One of the scientists said that although scientists do not need help with science, they could use some “guidance” in ethics (0089). He clarified by saying that he was not talking about “internal ethics” such as fraudulent data but “external ethics” or “what science <underline>should</underline> be done,” an area he said that scientists “don’t normally think about” (0089).</p>
<p>The second aspect of Excerpt 1 that is relevant to a discussion of social relations within science is seen in lines 4 to 12 where the respondent says that ethics is not “ignored” in the sciences and as an example says that he “would think twice” before publishing something that might have “very ugly application.” He goes on to imply, however, that doing so would be futile because “ultimately everybody has access to the same amount of information, and the ideas are ripe and they will come up one way or another” (line 12).</p>
<p>In lines 12 to 17, the respondent describes the different motivations of scientists and industry. Scientists, he suggests, are motivated by “visibility,” “recognition,” and “more grant money”; where industry is motivated by “turn[ing] a profit quickly” and not “get[ing] sued.” This implies a related understanding of the roles of each within science. That is, a scientist’s role, these data would suggest, is to pursue activities that promote his or her research. These activities include visibility, recognition, and funding. Those in industry would be expected not only to be motivated by making a profit as quickly as possible, but also to want to avoid lawsuits. Thus, they can be expected to “cover [their] butt” in order to avoid lawsuits.</p>
<p>The implication here within the larger context of a discussion on broad SEI is that when these issues refer to the safety of the consumer, it is not only the responsibility but also the motivation of industry to ensure that their products are safe. This understanding was reiterated in various ways throughout the interviews: that consideration of SEI (where these are understood as health and safety issues) falls within the domain of “commercialization” (0056) as the following references from the interviews indicate:</p>

<p>It is clear from the above excerpts that for these respondents, it is</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>“a company trying to commercialize something”</p>
<p>“they”</p>
<p>“the individual company”</p>
<p>“the people who are in industry”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>who are</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>“duty <underline>bound</underline>”</p>

<p>“[show] data”</p>
<p>“look at social and ethical issues”</p>
<p>“make sure that their products are safe”</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, within this speech community, ensuring product safety is the appropriate role of industry, not scientists. Not only is it the industries’ “moral responsibility” (0067) but also, as the respondent in Excerpt 1 pointed out, those in industry can be expected to ensure product safety if for no other reason than to avoid being sued.</p>
<p>Rather than focusing on product safety, which is, after all, the role of industry, a more appropriate social role for scientists according to this speech code might be phrased, in the words of the respondents, as follows:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>“discovering new things and understanding new things” (0076)</p>
<p>“always with the eye that hopefully . . . you <underline>are</underline> going to help society in some way” (0063)</p>
<p>“[in order to] make life as good as possible at a biological level for everybody in the world” (0064)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When I first asked respondents about SEI related to nanotechnology, some responded with a reference to K. Eric <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1075547011417891">Drexler’s (1986)</xref> concerns about self-replicating nanobots turned into environmental grey goo, a scenario they dismissed as “science fiction” (0056), “completely ridiculous” (0075), and one that caused one respondent to “want to distance myself from those guys as much as possible” (0062). That these references were invoked by the respondents without any prodding from me indicated that the respondents were aware of a larger discourse about SEI related to nanotechnology and understood this discourse in terms of some of the more bizarre and far-fetched claims made by prominent figures in the field such as Drexler.</p>
<p>The respondents raised concerns that science journalists and news departments are disappearing and that the media cannot be depended on to provide thorough and accurate coverage of science and technology (0069), that people will mistake science fiction or inaccurate news coverage for fact (0056), and that when a particular area of science loses public support it also loses funding (0070). Many of the respondents called for public education as an antidote to the above concerns, illustrating another particular understanding of social relations within this speech community. In the excerpts that follow, I address each of these concerns in more detail and suggest how the respondents understood the role of society at large (including the public, the media, and educators) vis-à-vis science.</p>
<p>In the first excerpt I present in this section, the respondent raised a concern about inaccurate portrayals of nanotechnology in popular media:</p>

</array>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the above excerpt, the respondent suggests that the portrayal of nanotech in popular media has led to an inaccurate public understanding of what nanotechnology is. Implicit in this statement is that concerns about nanotechnologies in the public sphere are a result of fictional portrayals and that these concerns are based on fiction, not reality. When I asked one respondent what came to mind when he heard the phrase “social and ethical issues related to nanotechnology and nanoscience,” he answered as follows:</p>

<p>Other respondents made references to science fiction portrayals of nanotechnology, implying that such portrayals had led, or would lead, to unwarranted public concern about nanotechnologies as the following excerpt indicates:</p>

<p>Not all the respondents were concerned about science fiction portrayals leading to negative public reaction. Several respondents suggested that the links between nanotechnology and science fiction appealed to the larger public. For example, one respondent suggested “people like the science fiction aspect, nanorobots and stuff” (0067). Another said that the fact that the prefix “nano” was being used by Apple to market one of their iPods in late 2005 was proof that the public was favorable to the idea of nanotechnology, even if they did not understand it:</p>

<p>Contrary to the statements that many respondents made about the inaccurate portrayal of science in science fiction, one respondent said that science fiction scenarios often proved to be quite accurate:</p>

</disp-quote></p>
<p>Overall, however, I detected an undercurrent throughout my fieldwork and interviews that public misunderstanding of nanoscience and nanotechnology would lead to impeding scientific progress. For example, the respondent who pointed out that Apple’s use of the prefix nano indicated favorable public opinion of nanotechnology said that he was concerned that “who’s using the word nano” is “out of control” (0070) and that an inevitable product mistake will lead to a loss of public support, loss of federal support, and collapse of the field:</p>

<p>Indeed, at the time the above interview was conducted, the first nanoproduct recall had recently occurred, a German bathroom powder named “Magic Nano,” the use of which caused respiratory problems in 77 people (this figure was later updated to include more than 100 people) and prompted the ETC Group, a human rights advocacy organization specializing in the impact of new technologies on poor populations, to issue a press release “renew[ing] its 2003 call for a global moratorium on nanotech lab research and a recall of consumer products containing engineered nanoparticles” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1075547011417891">ETC Group, 2006</xref>). Although it was later determined that the product had nothing to do with nanotechnology, apart from the label (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1075547011417891">Talbot, 2006</xref>), the reactions the case prompted appear to confirm the fears expressed by the scientist quoted in Excerpt 42. Thus, one of the major ethical issues associated with nanotech, from the perspective of the speech community of nanotech researchers, was that the inaccurate use of the label would lead to consumer injury and subsequent loss of public support and federal funding. Again, this issue was characterized by some of the respondents as insufficient public education. For example, one respondent identified a “major problem” of ethics as lack of public understanding of science:</p>

</disp-quote></p>
<p>For these respondents, one of the main SEI they identified related to nanotechnology was the unsatisfactory relationship between science and the public. As the above references illustrate, they attributed this relationship to the failure of the media and the U.S. educational system. These references indicate that the media and the U.S. educational system are not fulfilling their appropriate role vis-à-vis science, that is, communicating science to the public. Additionally, some respondents said that lack of public support for science resulted in lack of funding for their research. Considering the data presented earlier regarding the role of the scientist in society, it would seem reasonable to conclude that for this speech community, lack of public support and lack of funding lead to thwarted progress in improving the human condition. Specifically, two respondents cited lack of public (and federal) support for stem cell research and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) as obstacles to their research. For example, one of these respondents described molecular biology as “overregulated” saying “it’s virtually impossible to get under reasonable conditions, reasonable experiments, to get approval” to conduct research with GMOs (Respondent 0070). He added that the case of GMOs was “a good example of where, they [regulatory agencies], because of the large public concern, they overshot . . .” (Respondent 0070). Thus, public concern led to overregulation and impeded scientific progress.</p>
<p>The public protest and controversy that took place in the United Kingdom in the 1990s over genetically modified food and agriculture has been described as a model of technology development to be avoided if nanotechnology is to be developed responsibly and receive public support (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1075547011417891">Kearnes, Grove-White, Macnaghten, Wilsdon, &amp; Wynne, 2006</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1075547011417891">Torgersen et al., 2002</xref>, for a full discussion of the history of the GMO debate). Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1075547011417891">Torgersen et al. (2002)</xref> noted that the GMO debate in Europe and the United Kingdom did not extend to the United States, the parallels between biotech and nanotech are many. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1075547011417891">Torgersen et al. (2002)</xref> describe biotechnology as deviating from the “traditional” path that a new technology follows when introduced into society, that of society “catch[ing] up” with the new technology (p. 21). The reasons for this change, they suggest, include uncertainty regarding risks, “a difference between public and expert experience of what biotechnology really ‘is,’” that biotech is “usually invisible to laypeople,” that it takes place “behind closed doors in laboratories indistinguishable from the outside,” and that “its products are not at all specific” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1075547011417891">Torgersen et al., 2002</xref>, p. 22). “For experts, on the other hand,” they add, “[biotechnology’s] character is no different from that of other technologies” (p. 22). All the above points can be noted about nanotechnology. Additionally, the authors point to the dual role of European governments as both funder and regulator of biotechnology as generating distrust among European publics who perceived the dual role as a conflict of interest. It remains to be seen whether the American public will perceive as problematic the dual role that the United States government serves as both the primary funder of and regulator of nanotechnology.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1075547011417891">Kearnes et al. (2006)</xref> cite additional comparisons between development of the two technologies and suggest that the history of the GMO debates in the United Kingdom offers lessons that can be (and should be) applied to nanotech development. Their primary recommendation is for science communication with the public, or public engagement, to occur at the outset of research and development (an idea referred to in this literature as <italic>upstream engagement</italic>) rather than after the fact (i.e., <italic>downstream engagement</italic>).</p>

<title>Rhetoric/Strategic Conduct in a Code of Science</title>
<p>In addition to beliefs about human nature and social relations, a speech code indicates distinctive beliefs about strategic conduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1075547011417891">Philipsen et al., 2005</xref>, p. 61). Here, strategic conduct refers to “the appropriate and efficacious symbolic resources available to interlocutors for constituting themselves as persons in social relationships” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1075547011417891">Philipsen, 1992</xref>, p. 127). In what follows I will present evidence for a specific understanding among users of the science code I identified for appropriate uses of strategic conduct concerning science.</p>
<p>Although I found that many of the scientists I encountered during the course of this study <italic>did</italic> consider broad SEI, as described earlier, it is not part of the dominant code of communicative conduct I documented in this speech community to bring attention to these issues by talking about them. As some nanotechnology graduate students told me: Why would a scientist want to bring attention to what they called “negative” (0081) aspects of their work (e.g., broad social and ethical implications)? It is important to highlight the positive aspects in order to get published, secure funding, and gain public support, they told me. Similarly, writing about these issues is not appropriate communicative conduct because, as one scientist explained to me off record, scientists would not get published if they pointed out negative aspects of their work. Additional examples of inappropriate use of strategic conduct regarding science included science fiction writers, as well as popular nonfiction writers on nanotech such as the aforementioned K. Eric Drexler, Bill Joy, and Ray Kurzweil. In what I understood as a reference to these writers, one scientist said that a lack of understanding exists about nanotechnology because some “people on the fringes . . . oversold it” (0076). In the excerpt that follows, I had just told the respondent that I had read that nanotechnology was going to be the next Industrial Revolution. He responded as follows:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Excerpt 1</p>
<array id="array18-1075547011417891">

</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, according to this respondent, “people on the fringes, and journalists, and some individuals” not “people actually doing the science,” (that is, scientists) made the claim that nanotechnology was going to be the next Industrial Revolution. It is actually Mihail Roco, the National Science Foundation’s senior advisor on nanotechnology, and other proponents of nanotechnology who have repeatedly referred to nanotechnology in terms that evoke the next Industrial Revolution (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1075547011417891">Sparrow, 2007</xref>, p. 60; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1075547011417891">Berube, 2006</xref>) rather than Joy, Drexler, or Kurzweil. Significantly, Roco and his colleagues garner respect within the scientific community. I base this assertion in part on the fact that several articles authored by Roco and his colleagues were included in the assigned reading packet in a science and engineering class focused on nanotechnology at the university where I conducted this study. Additionally, as the architect of the NNI, Roco is indisputably a valuable advocate to scientists for allocating federal funding to nanotechnology research and development. Without exception, those I spoke to involved in nanotech research disagreed with the characterization of nanotechnology as the next Industrial Revolution. Despite the fact that scientists such as Roco are actively promoting such characterizations, no one I spoke to for this project criticized Roco or other prominent mainstream scientists but rather criticized K. Eric Drexler for introducing the term <italic>grey goo</italic> in 1986 to the world and Bill Joy for publicizing Drexler’s fears in a cover story for <italic>Wired</italic> magazine in 2000.</p>
<p>Thus, there appeared to be a subtle distinction between appropriate and inappropriate use of rhetoric among those I talked to for this project and I found it difficult at first to distinguish between the two. As I analyzed my materials, I begin to suspect that the distinction was closely tied to the results within the scientific community which the rhetoric produces. For example, the rhetoric of figures such as Drexler, Joy, and Kurzweil is rejected by those in the scientific community perhaps because it resulted in widespread concern about the social and ethical implications of nanotechnology, as the analysis below will indicate. Additionally, inappropriate rhetoric can be viewed as that which brings on the <italic>ethics police</italic> (0077), a term used by one of the ethicists I interviewed for this project. Earlier, I presented respondents’ comments and concerns about what one called “science fiction” (0056) portrayals of nanotechnology with implicit and explicit references to figures such as Michael Crichton, K. Eric Drexler, and Ray Kurzweil, only one of whom (Crichton) actually writes fiction. I revisit these comments in the following two excerpts to illustrate the type of communication considered inappropriate by the respondents. In the excerpt that follows, the respondent had explicitly referred to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1075547011417891">Crichton’s 2002</xref> book <italic>Prey</italic> immediately preceding these comments:</p>

<p>Of particular salience to me as I analyzed the above excerpt was the respondent’s reference to Crichton’s work as “just completely bogus kind of science fiction that . . . masquerades under science fiction” (lines 4, 5) and I wondered why the respondent differentiated between “scientifically sound” science fiction, science fiction that was “good entertainment,” and “completely bogus” science fiction. I will revisit this matter shortly, but first present an excerpt in which the respondent refers to both Drexler and Kurzweil as “nuts.” I had told the respondent about seeing futurist and nanotech enthusiast Ray Kurzweil talk about nanotechnology leading to human immortality.

<p>Turning to the SPEAKING framework, consider the following terms referring to “participants” (in a communicative interaction):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>“people on the fringes”</p>
<p>“journalists”</p>
<p>“some individuals”</p>
<p>“[not] people actually doing the science”</p>
<p>“science fiction [and its authors]”</p>
<p>“Those guys [i.e., Drexler, Kurzweil, etc.]”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The following terms referring to “acts” (i.e., communicative acts) from the above excerpts indicate clearly what these respondents think about the communicative conduct pertaining to nanotechnology made by the above participants:</p>
<list id="list2-1075547011417891" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>“[employing] rhetoric”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“[having] unrealistic expectations”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“oversold [nanotechnology]”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“masquerades under science fiction”</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Combining terms for “participants” with the terms for “acts” from the above excerpts helps explain why the communicative conduct was rejected by the respondents. This motley group of “journalists,” nonscientists, fringe individuals, and science fiction writers employed “rhetoric” that created “unrealistic expectations” that “oversold” nanotechnology and was not “scientifically sound.” Respondent 0056’s implication that Crichton’s <italic>Prey</italic> was neither “scientifically sound” nor “good entertainment” but rather “masquerade[ing] under science fiction” suggests that, for users of this speech code, even science fiction writers are expected to employ rhetoric that serves to advance the goals of science. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1075547011417891">Sparrow (2007)</xref> has noted, proponents of nanotechnology must maintain a careful balance between exciting the interest of funders and the public in this “revolutionary” technology and assuring them that there is nothing to fear (p. 61).</p>
<p>Overall, as the following data set illustrates, there was a shared, ex-pressed “disdain” (0072) among members of this community for the word nanotechnology, although they all used it to describe their work. For example, respondents referred to the term in the following ways:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>“the quote unquote nanotechnology field” (0061)</p>
<p>“a new spin on words [that] people have taken . . . to mean everything and anything that they want it to mean” (0060)</p>
<p>“largely politically driven” (0070)</p>
<p>“a buzzword” (0072), (0076)</p>
<p>“jargon” (0076)</p>
<p>“fancy new words that can appeal to the public” (0076)</p>
<p>“so called nanoscience” (0076)</p>
<p>“a non-useful term” (0074)</p>
<p>“a little bit like Swiss made . . . just a stamp” (0062)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The use of words such as “politically driven,” “jargon,” “a buzzword,” and “spin” indicates why the respondents expressed distaste for the term <italic>nanotechnology</italic>. These words are suggestive of the inappropriate strategic conduct referred to earlier, what one respondent called “rhetoric” and overselling (0076).</p>
<p>Recalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1075547011417891">Schummer’s (2007)</xref> three approaches to defining nanotechnology helps illustrate the difficulty some scientists and engineers have with the term. A general nominal definition based on size was the most common way of defining the term among these scientists; however, many of them also used a real definition to refer to the specific research topics they were developing and expressed preference for a specific term (e.g., nanoelectronics) rather than the general term, <italic>nanotechnology</italic>. Although few of the scientists I talked to used a teleological definition based on future applications when talking about their own work, they all acknowledged that this definition was necessary for obtaining funding.</p>
<p>Considering the tension in this speech community around the term <italic>nanotechnology</italic> helps illustrate the overlap between understandings related to human nature, social relations, and strategic conduct. In addition to recognizing the term as a violation of a rule about appropriate communicative conduct, the term violated a sense of identity held by some respondents. For example, those respondents who identified themselves as basic scientists did not like the implication of applied science that the term <italic>nanotechnology</italic> held. As one respondent said, “most people doing [basic science] don’t see themselves as technologists, so we have an instinctive discomfort with the word” (0076). Thus, use of the term <italic>nanotechnology</italic> comes into tension with beliefs and values pertaining to a scientist’s identity, mainly that basic science does not involve developing products for application. Finally, use of the term <italic>nanotechnology</italic> threatens appropriate social relations within this speech community by implying that the role of the scientist vis-à-vis society is to make technology rather than to “just understand things” (0076).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>I was surprised to find, in interview after interview, that scientists and engineers developing nanotechnologies seemed unwilling to discuss broad normative ethical issues related to their work. After analysis of the data in toto, I concluded that a strong cultural norm that posits science and technology as serving to benefit society simply did not support a full consideration of other outcomes. This finding is consistent with Proposition 6 of SCT, that “[t]he artful use of a shared speech code is a sufficient condition for predicting, explaining, and controlling the form of discourse about the intelligibility, prudence, and morality of communicative conduct” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1075547011417891">Philipsen et al., 2005</xref>, p. 63). Thus, even if a member of the speech community I investigated was concerned about broad ethical issues associated with scientific and technological development, the force of the speech code is such that it discourages the speech code user from discussing these issues in ways outside their code. As one respondent told me,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Scientists in general are always interested in bettering society so the idea that anything they could do could harm society is not a part of—cuz they spend countless hours trying to do things that would help people, not to hurt people. (0073)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Considering the strength of this norm, it is perhaps not surprising that the related understandings regarding the role of the researcher vis-à-vis the public and the need for strategic communication accompanied this perspective.</p>
<p>Central to SCT is the premise that while speech codes exert cultural force, that force is not absolute. The purpose of Proposition 6 is to address the question “what force do culture in general and speech codes in particular have in social life?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1075547011417891">Philipsen, 1997</xref>, p. 146). The answer to this question is that Proposition 6 “does not generate predictions that in all circumstances interlocutors will <italic>perform</italic> actions that are congruent with a code, but does generate predictions about how interlocutors will <italic>talk</italic> about such performances” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1075547011417891">Philipsen, 1997</xref>, p. 148, italics added). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1075547011417891">Philipsen (1997)</xref> explains that the process of discursive force described in Proposition 6 is possible because speech codes are made up of elements that “derive their meaning from their place in a network of reinforcing and interanimating code elements” (p. 149). An example of this network of elements from the present study would be the symbols “science” or “scientist” deriving their meaning in part by the associated premises and rules such as “a scientist is motivated by the desire to benefit society.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1075547011417891">Philipsen (1997)</xref> also says that speech codes have the force they do because they are “socially legitimized,” that is, “[t]he association of code elements, which are involved in discourse, with the memory of life experiences in these socializing contexts, endows them with a sense of legitimacy and normalcy” (p. 149). Thus, the schooling of scientists and subsequent limited interactions outside their departments and disciplines create the “socializing contexts” in which the elements of a speech code are learned.</p>
<p>In beginning my analyses, I looked first at the culture of science (i.e., the system of signs, meanings, premises, and rules that pertained to doing and understanding science) by attending to the way those scientists and engineers with whom I interacted talked about science, nanotech, ethics, society, interdisciplinary research, funding, and so on. As I examined these responses I began to put together a speech code pertaining to these areas, presenting what I suggest are some of the code’s symbols, meanings, and premises. From within this framework, I specifically considered what the overall code’s implications were for concepts related to personhood, social relations, and strategic conduct. I have presented a cultural code that appears to have some force in the scientific community in which I conducted my research, presented elements of the dominant speech code, and suggested what implications the cultural code and attendant speech code have for understandings of personhood, social relations, and strategic conduct.</p>
<p>The scientists and engineers I spoke to did not seem to have the language for talking about broad SEI related to science and technology. This indicated to me the need for an articulation of a speech code (or codes) that would enable scientists (and nonscientists) to understand their patterned ways of speaking, identify areas of linguistic need (such as the scientist on the panel referred to above did), and introduce new terms and concepts that meet those linguistic needs. Indeed, the need for new language to discuss the social and ethical implications of nanotechnologies has been noted by other communication researchers studying this topic (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1075547011417891">Keating &amp; Jarmon, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Calls for a move in science communication with the public from a one-way model to a two-way model have become commonplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1075547011417891">Borchelt &amp; Hudson, 2008</xref>). Leshner (2003), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1075547011417891">Borchelt and Hudson (2008)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1075547011417891">Macnaghten et al. (2005)</xref> have noted that recent public engagement efforts in science communication are a departure from past efforts not only in the move from a one-way to a two-way information flow but also in the expectation that the goal of the efforts is not to convince the public to share the views of the science community but to understand the public’s views and incorporate them into science policy. While replacing a one-way information model with a two-way model and changing expectations regarding the goal of the model of scientific communication are not simple tasks, these challenges are further intensified by what appears to be a deeply embedded view within the scientific community regarding the appropriate strategic conduct of scientists as illustrated by the interviews I conducted with scientists and engineers.</p>
<p>When I began collecting data for this study in 2004, I did so as part of a group of interdisciplinary and international scholars, of whom I was largely unaware, who were also beginning to study a field that has since grown into a discrete area of study, that of the study of social and ethical implications of nanotechnology. I discuss three of those published studies below and their relationship to the present study in terms of significance of findings. Additionally, the first professional society for this subject, the Society for the Study of Nanoscience and Emerging Technologies (S-NET) has been formed and convened its first meeting in 2009. A professional journal devoted to the topic, <italic>Nanoethics</italic>, began in 2007, and an <italic>Encyclopedia of Nanoscience and Society</italic> was published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1075547011417891">2010 (Guston)</xref>.</p>
<p>What I have found here is also supported by a 2007 study conducted with a similar population. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1075547011417891">Powell (2007)</xref> interviewed 20 scientists at a major U.S. research university, which is also a leader in nanotechnology, about their research in nanotechnology and their views on risks associated with nanotechnologies. Powell’s findings were remarkably similar to my own, thus indicating transferability of each of our studies. Powell was primarily concerned with identifying the “risk frames” used by “upstream” scientists (e.g., engineers, chemists, etc.) and “downstream” scientists (e.g., toxicologists) to talk about nanotechnology (see p. 174). Powell found that downstream scientists considered concerns about nanomaterials safety to be “scientific” while upstream scientists did not consider these concerns to be scientific and in fact considered them “<italic>nonscience</italic>” (p. 183)</p>
<p>Moreover, Powell suggested that “risk concerns based on newness are <italic>nonscience</italic>, while claims about the exciting potential of nanotechnology research, based on similar novelty claims, are science” (p. 184). Thus, risk concerns were seen as “societal” rather than “scientific” issues by the upstream scientists (p. 184). Powell’s findings are consistent with my findings regarding the appropriate role of communication that I presented earlier, specifically concerning hype among the scientists I interviewed, all of whom were upstream scientists. Respondents rejected what they called hype, that is, concerns about negative effects of nanotechnology and science fiction portrayals of nanotechnology (e.g., Crichton’s “Prey”), while accepting visionary claims made by the NNI that nanotechnology will lead to “a revolution in technology and industry that benefits society” (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nano.gov/about-nni/what/vision-goals">http://www.nano.gov/about-nni/what/vision-goals</ext-link>). In his <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1075547011417891">2008</xref> networkwide survey with the NNIN, which likely included some of the same respondents I interviewed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1075547011417891">McGinn (2008)</xref> found that “respondents view hype much more negatively from an ethical point of view when it stands to <italic>directly</italic> benefit the person doing the hyping than when s/he stands to benefit only indirectly” (p. 112). This is consistent with my finding that hype was considered appropriate when it served to advance the goals of science.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1075547011417891">McGinn (2008)</xref> also found a statistically significant, positive correlation between respondents’ reported knowledge of ethical issues related to nanotechnology and their indicated willingness to learn about these issues. In other words, the more the respondents knew about ethical issues, the more likely they were to report that they were interested in learning more, concluding that “there is good reason to believe that a strong majority of the sample is not oblivious to, resistant to, or dismissive of ethical concerns related to nanotechnology” (p. 123). This conclusion is significant to the present study in that although the majority of those whom I encountered in this study were not oblivious, resistant, or dismissive, they did not seem to have the language (i.e., speech code) that facilitated their willingness to speak substantively about macro-level SEI related not just to nanotechnology but to science and technology in general.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1075547011417891">Patra, Haribabu, and McComas (2010)</xref> conducted in-depth interviews with scientists and engineers working in nanotechnology in India. They found that the majority of these practitioners were both aware of ethical issues related to their work and were able to offer specific examples. They suggested that these high levels of awareness, and, I would add, willingness to discuss these issues, may be due to cultural factors that warrant future cross-cultural research in this area. The findings presented here contribute to the extant literature in science and technology studies and science communication by suggesting additional ways in which the discourse of those working in nanoscience can be investigated. As suggested earlier, a speech codes approach, as presented here, can provide an additional layer of analysis that helps reveal further insight into the discursive practices of some scientists and engineers working in nanotechnology and suggest ways to communicate effectively with those who use and understand a particular way of speaking about science and technology and their attendant values. The identification and articulation of a speech code (or codes) allows for interlocutors to better understand themselves and each other and paves the way for the development of new speech code elements that allow for truly interdisciplinary conversations to take place about SEI related to emerging science and technologies. By identifying the various elements of a given speech code, one can, presumably, learn to speak and interact in a way that is intelligible to others who use and understand the code. In doing so, a communal conversation in which perspectives on emerging science and technologies, and the associated social and ethical implications, are discussed, contested, replaced, or expanded is made possible.</p>
<p>The materials collected for this study provide opportunities for multiple additional analyses that would add to the analysis presented here. Additional analyses are warranted that would identify and describe in detail other speech codes within the science community. Future studies in this area might also focus exclusively on basic scientists or applied scientists and engineers in order to further develop some of the themes that I have presented regarding the different roles that each of these areas holds in the social relations of science. Cross-cultural work between scientists in different countries is warranted, particularly given the findings described above (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1075547011417891">Patra et al., 2010</xref>). Finally, a comparative study of speech codes among social scientists or humanities scholars might prove worthwhile, particularly in aiding integrative work between scientists and social scientists.</p>
<p>In a seminar with graduate students from the social sciences, humanities, and physical sciences I participated in at the close of my study, the question was raised of how we negotiate the multiple perspectives on social and ethical implications of emerging science and technologies represented by diverse publics, not only in the United States but also around the world, to ensure that advances in nanotechnology are beneficial to all. I would suggest that SCT offers one avenue for beginning to articulate, and engage with, the multiple perspectives that surround these issues. This study is one attempt to do so.</p>
