<abstract>
<p>The authors evaluated the validity and reliability of the Block Kids Food Frequency Questionnaire (BKFFQ) and the Block Kid Screener (BKScreener) in Mexican American children living along the Texas–Mexico border who participated in the National Institutes of Health–funded Proyecto Bienestar Laredo. The Bienestar/NEEMA health program is a school-based diabetes and obesity control program, and the Proyecto Bienestar Laredo is the translation of the Bienestar/NEEMA health program to 38 elementary schools in Laredo, Texas. Par ticipants included 2,376 eight-year-old boys (48%) and girls (52%) from two school districts in Laredo. Two Food Frequency Questionnaire (BKFFQ and BKScreener) dietary intakes were collected, and an expert panel of nutritionist assigned a classification response quality of “Good,” “Questionable,” and “Poor,” based on playfulness (systematic or nonrandom) patterns and completion rates. In addition, both instruments were assessed for reliability (test–retest) in 138 students from a San Antonio School District. Children’s height, weight, percentage body fat, reported family history of diabetes, and Texas Assessments of Knowledge and Skills in reading and mathematics scores were collected. This study showed that for Mexican American children living along the Texas–Mexico border, within the time constraints of the classroom, BKScreener yielded better data than the BKFFQ.</p>

<p>Energy intake in free-living humans is commonly assessed by methods ranging from intensive and expensive doubly labeled water (DLW; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524839911405847">Schoeller &amp; van Staten, 1982</xref>) and 24-hour dietary recalls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524839911405847">Institute of Medicine, 2002</xref>) to less-intensive and inexpensive methods such as food frequency questionnaires (FFQs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524839911405847">Institute of Medicine, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1524839911405847">Thompson &amp; Byers, 1994</xref>). The self-administered FFQ asks participants to report the frequency of consumption and portion size of food items over a defined period of time (e.g., yesterday, last week, the last month, the last 3 months; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1524839911405847">Thompson &amp; Byers, 1994</xref>). Unlike DLW and 24-hour dietary recalls, FFQs are not used to quantify mean energy intake of a study group but to determine estimates of average diets and/or to compare subgroups within samples studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839911405847">Baranowski et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839911405847">Eck et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839911405847">Frank et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524839911405847">Molag et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524839911405847">Rockett et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524839911405847">Rockett, Wolf, &amp; Colditz, 1995</xref>). Despite the limitations of FFQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524839911405847">Schoeller, 1995</xref>), it is widely used in studies of free-living adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839911405847">Block, Coyle, Hartman &amp; Scoppa, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839911405847">Block et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839911405847">Block, Thompson, Hartman, Larkin &amp; Guire, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839911405847">Block, Woods, Potosky &amp; Clifford, 1990</xref>), adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839911405847">Cullen et al., 2004</xref>), and elementary school children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839911405847">Cullen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839911405847">McPherson et al., 2002</xref>) because it is relatively inexpensive and easy to administer in many settings (i.e., school, home, workplace, church). However, it requires the respondent to recall retrospective intake, to use literacy skills, and to use perceptual skills to visualize typical portion sizes. The Block Kids FFQ (BKFFQ) has been previously validated for use in minority children and adolescents 10 to 17 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839911405847">Cullen et al., 2004</xref>). However, studies using the BKFFQ in children 10 years of age and younger have not been reported.</p>
<p>Reported factors affecting results of self-reported dietary assessments in children are language barriers, poor reading comprehension, behavioral maturity, and cultural/ethnic diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839911405847">Cade, Thomson, Burley, &amp; Warm, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839911405847">Field et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1524839911405847">Taylor &amp; Goulding, 1998</xref>). Generally, as levels of diet quality diminish, increases in body weight and decreases in academic performance follow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839911405847">Florence, Asbridge &amp; Veugelers, 2008</xref>). These factors may directly affect a child’s reading comprehension, including the child’s ability to accurately complete a self-reported questionnaire, which requires proficient levels of reading. This article focuses on the comparison of the child’s responses in two separate versions of self-reported FFQs administered to mostly low-income third-grade Mexican American children living in South Texas with different academic performance levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1524839911405847">Texas Education Agency [TEA], 2010</xref>). Quality of the responses was defined by the patterns observed, and the student’s completion of the entire instrument in a group setting, during a single classroom period. Specific aims were to correlate measures of quality with anthropometrics and reading and math scores.</p>

<title>Proyecto Bienestar Laredo</title>
<p>Proyecto Bienestar Laredo (PBL) is a cluster, randomized trial (38 elementary schools; 19 control and 19 intervention) with a primary aim of translating the evidence-based Bienestar/NEEMA school health program from San Antonio, Texas, to Laredo, Texas. Laredo is located along the impoverished Texas–Mexico border. Briefly, the Bienestar/NEEMA is a coordinated school-based diabetes and obesity prevention health program developed in 1997 to determine whether fasting capillary glucose and body mass index (BMI) can be decreased in high-risk children who attend schools that have adopted the program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524839911405847">Treviño et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524839911405847">Treviño et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1524839911405847">Treviño, Hernandez, Yin, Garcia, &amp; Hernandez, 2005</xref>). The PBL consists of health education, physical education, parent and family, food service, and after-school programs. The study operates in the two Laredo school districts and starts with a cohort of third-grade children followed through fifth grade. The objectives are to increase dietary fiber intake, decrease dietary saturated fat intake, increase physical fitness, decrease blood glucose, and decrease obesity rates. Two of the objectives are diet-related requiring measures of dietary intake.</p>

<sec id="section3-1524839911405847">
<title>Theoretical Framework</title>
<p>Social cognitive theory (SCT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839911405847">Bandura, 1986</xref>) was selected to provide the theoretical framework for the Bienestar Health Program/NEEMA and PBL and has been described in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524839911405847">Treviño et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524839911405847">Treviño et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1524839911405847">Treviño et al., 2005</xref>). Briefly, according to the SCT, personal factor (health knowledge and beliefs), social systems (family, peers, and teachers), and behaviors (dietary saturated fat intake, dietary fiber intake, and physical activity) must be affected to affect health outcomes. The cultural relevance of the Bienestar/NEEMA and PBL was ensured through the use of bilingual culturally and contextually relevant themes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524839911405847">Treviño et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524839911405847">Treviño et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1524839911405847">Treviño et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1524839911405847">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Third-grade students attending schools in two Laredo school districts (Study Site 1), and one San Antonio school district (Study Site 2) consented to participate in this study between September and October 2006. The selected schools were participating in the Bienestar/PBL program, and each student was enrolled in the program. Consent forms were provided in English and Spanish to parents and were written at a fourth-grade level. Students and their parents were recruited by teachers, school nurses, parent liaisons, and school principals. In addition, parents were invited to a scheduled presentation about the study, and additional announcements were made by postal mail and telephone calls. All consented participants received a school backpack containing school supplies, a PBL t-shirt, and health promotion materials as incentives for their participation. This study was approved by the University of Texas Health Science Center Institutional Review Board.</p>

<title>Block Kids Food Frequency Questionnaire (2004 version)</title>
<p>Since 1982, <italic>BKFFQs</italic> have been developed using a data-based approach to questionnaire design. That is, the developer of Block Questionnaires, NutritionQuest, uses large representative national dietary surveys such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to inform the selection of the foods and to identify appropriate portion sizes and nutrient composition that describe questionnaire items. A recent version of the BKFFQ has been used in several large-scale dietary studies of children and adolescents 10 to 17 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839911405847">Block et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839911405847">Block et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839911405847">Cullen et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The BKFFQ is a semiquantitative tool that consists of 73 food and beverage line items. Each line item includes questions about the frequency of consumption and the usual portion size. The questionnaire also includes five additional questions to help further refine fat and carbohydrate intake. Additionally, a portion-size estimation handout, including pictures of serving sizes can be used during the BKFFQ administration. All tools used included Mexican American ethnic food items. BKFFQ, which is at the third-grade reading level, has been used by others to measure the dietary intake of third graders because of its suggestive age range of 8 to 17 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839911405847">Hovland, McLeod, Duffin, Johanson, &amp; Berryman, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1524839911405847">
<title>Block Kid Screener (BKScreener)</title>
<p>An abbreviated dietary screening tool, the BKScreener, was developed by NutritionQuest to address concerns with the time required to complete the longer BKFFQ, the reading level, and the comprehension challenges for third graders. A reduced-length, 41-item food list was developed through the analysis of the dietary recall data of 8- to 10-year-old Mexican American respondents in the NHANES 2001-2004 data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839911405847">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2001</xref>). This questionnaire addresses dietary intake during the previous week and includes both a 6-point frequency of intake and corresponding 3-point quantity of intake scales to target the overarching nutritional objectives of the PBL program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839911405847">Block et al., 1986</xref>). The 6-point frequency refers to the number of times each week a food item was consumed, ranging from “none to daily”; and how many times that food items was consumed per day, ranging from “none to five or more times a day.” A 3-point quantity scale refers to how much was consumed and ranged from “small to medium to large” amounts. The BKScreener is written at a third-grade reading level and can be administered within the standard 50-minute elementary class period mandated by the TEA.</p>
<p>Six registered dietitians and nutritionists from the Social and Health Research Center (SHRC), the participating school districts in Laredo and San Antonio, and the city of Laredo Health Department served on an expert panel to evaluate the school food service menus and assured that the items included in the BKFFQ and BKScreener were commonly served on the selected elementary school cafeteria’s breakfast and lunch menus. In addition, NutritionQuest used NHANES data to match food items in the BKFFQ and BKScreener. The NHANES data included in the analysis was restricted to information provided by Mexican American children between 8 and 10 years of age during the 2001-2004 aggregated time period.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1524839911405847">
<title>Reliability</title>
<p>A test–retest of the BKFFQ and BKScreener was completed on a convenience sample of 138 third-grade students from an inner school district in San Antonio, Texas. The two questionnaires were administered twice, 2 weeks apart in November 2007.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1524839911405847">
<title>Methodology</title>
<p>We assessed the dietary intake of the children in the PBL using the BKFFQ 2004 version developed by NutritionQuest (Berkeley, California). The student to facilitator ratio during the administration of both the BKFFQ and BKScreener was 20 to 2. One facilitator read the instructions from a script with little or no deviation, and the other facilitator walked up and down the aisles to keep the students focused on answering their questionnaire and assisting them to clarify the instructions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1524839911405847">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section10-1524839911405847">
<title>Quality of Responses</title>
<p>To identify the quality of responses to the BKFFQ and BKScreener, the questionnaires were separated into three responses: (1) “Good,” (2) “Questionable,” and (3) “Poor.” We conducted a visual inspection of each participant’s test–retest response to the BKFFQ and BKScreener, and then categorized them according to the extent of systematic (nonrandom) patterns and completion. Systematic patterns were assigned if the student selected answers in a straight vertical line or zigzag pattern (exhibiting playfulness) on the questionnaire.</p>
<p>The “Good” response category was defined as an FFQ that had no playful patterns and was completed. The “Questionable” response category was defined as an FFQ that exhibited some signs of playfulness and was completed. The “Poor” response category was defined as an FFQ that consisted entirely of playfulness patterns and was partially completed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1524839911405847">
<title>Anthropometric Measures</title>
<p>A registered nurse or trained evaluation staff collected all the anthropometric data (height, weight, and body fat). All children were wearing indoor clothing at the time of testing and were asked to remove their shoes and socks for these measurements. Height was measured to the nearest 0.5 cm with a stadiometer (Seca Bodymeter 206; Seca Corp, Hanover, Maryland). Weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg with an electric scale. Body fat percentage (%BF) was measured using bioelectric impedance analysis (Tanita Corporation of America Inc., Arlington Heights, Illinois). BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters using the Quetelet Index measure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1524839911405847">
<title>Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills</title>
<p>We defined academic performance as the student’s reading and math proficiency scores in the state-mandated Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1524839911405847">TEA, 2010</xref>). The TEA developed the TAKS test to measure if students met state and federal requirements mandated under the No Child Left Behind Act. TAKS measures reading and math levels, and it has three general performance descriptors: (1) “Met the Standard,” (2) “Did Not Meet the Standard,” and (3) “Commended Performance.” A student has “met the standard” if the TAKS math or reading numerical score is 2,100 and above.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1524839911405847">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>We used Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) Version 9.2 to analyze the descriptive, demographic, and behavioral survey data. Test–retest reliability was assessed with the Spearman-rho correlation coefficient. The BKFFQ and BKScreener were contrasted with regard to outcome quality category with Bowker’s chi-square test for symmetry. All statistical testing was two sided with a significance level of 5%.</p>

<p>Participant characteristics are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524839911405847">Table 1</xref>. The students of San Antonio were similar in ethnic and economic characteristics to those of Laredo. Among children from both cities, more than 89% were Mexican American and 84% qualified for free and reduced school lunch and breakfast program. There were about equal number of males (48%) and females (52%) in the Laredo sample, and slightly more males (56%) than females (44%) in the San Antonio sample. Most school characteristics were similar in both groups. The Laredo group had slightly higher staff size (68 and 61 staff), whereas San Antonio had a slightly higher average in the years of teacher’s experience (13 and 11 years).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A finding that we observed was that less than half (43%) of participants who were offered the BKFFQ was classified as having “Good” response quality. Furthermore, children in the “Poor” response quality category had a significantly lower mean reading score, and higher body fat and BMI than those in the “Good” category. This implies that the utility of the published 73-item BKFFQ may not be appropriate for Mexican American children this young, when self-administered in a classroom setting.</p>
<p>One difficulty reported by PBL field research staff was the limited school class time allotted for questionnaire administration. Though the BKFFQ may produce good results when administered one-on-one, without time restrictions, to older children with or without parents present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839911405847">Cullen, Watson, &amp; Zakeri, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524839911405847">Marshall, Eichenberger-Gilmore, Broffitt, Stumbo, &amp; Levy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839911405847">Smith &amp; Fila, 2006</xref>), this particular protocol is not feasible when administered to a group in a time-sensitive classroom period to younger children. The design of evaluation tools and the logistics to collect them in the field are at times two independent components that must require detailed coordination at various levels for a successful response and completion.</p>
<p>In this study, concerns with the BKFFQ’s length and reading level were highlighted. The long, 73-item BKFFQ took some students longer to complete. This exceeded the TEA-approved 50-minutes classroom time limit as well as the average third-grader’s attention span. Reading comprehension, as reflected by mean TAKS reading scores, correlated adversely with BKFFQ classification response quality category. This implies that the BKFFQ’s reading level posed a challenge for these study participants.</p>
<p>A finding was the higher levels of %BF and BMI in the “Poor” response quality category of the BKFFQ. This poses the questions of whether obese children are unwilling to answer the FFQ correctly or have lower reading skills. We performed a correlation between reading TAKS scores and %BF and BMI to determine the latter question. Although there was an inverse relationship between TAKS and %BF and BMI, the relationship was not significant. Another study with a different design may be able to answer this question.</p>
<p>Alternatively, when we offered the newly developed BKScreener, a more user-friendly and shorter form of the BKFFQ, significant improvement in the classification of response quality was observed compared with the BKFFQ. This study showed that among third-grade Mexican American children living along the Texas–Mexico border, within the time constraints of the classroom, the BKScreener yielded better data than the BKFFQ instrument.</p>
<p>The improved response quality of the BKScreener may be attributed to several key strategies. First, the BKScreener was designed to address the time parameter within school settings. This allowed us to perform dietary intake assessments in a time-sensitive classroom period. Second, food items not frequently eaten by this age group or ethnic population were excluded in the BKScreener. The BKScreener included only age-appropriate items that reflect students’ usual intake while maintaining the computational integrity of NutritionQuest’s nutrient analysis. This allowed NutritionQuest to shorten the longer, 73-item BKFFQ to a two-page, 41-item BKScreener.</p>
<sec id="section22-1524839911405847">
<title>Limitations of the Study</title>
<p>Study limitations must be noted. First, this study was a one-time assessment in selected school districts in two South Texas cities with predominately Mexican American children. Thus, the study’s findings may not be generalizable to other children populations. Additional studies should examine the relationship between reading level and FFQ response quality in other children populations. Second, we only targeted third-grade students, and assessing the utility of the BKFFQ and the BKScreener in other grade levels was out of the scope of this study. Therefore, further psychometric studies of the BKFFQ and the BKScreener in other age groups are needed. Third, although the BKScreener has shown promising results in its ability to estimate the dietary intake of children compared with the BKFFQ, we did not compare the BKScreener with other methods of dietary assessment and cannot comment on the comparison of the BKScreener with other methods.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1524839911405847">
<title>Strength of the Study</title>
<p>There are three notable strengths to this study. First, our study included feedback from a disparate population with elevated risk of obesity and associated type 2 diabetes. Because reliable and quantifiable indices of diet in children are important to help reverse the obesity and associated diabetes epidemics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839911405847">Cullen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524839911405847">Marshall et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839911405847">Smith &amp; Fila, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524839911405847">Treviño et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524839911405847">Treviño et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1524839911405847">Treviño et al., 2005</xref>), the BKFFQ and BKScreener may help advance our understanding of the behavioral mechanisms associated with obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839911405847">Gurnell, 2007</xref>). Second, the BKScreener was targeted at 8-year-old (third-grade) children, and few studies have evaluated dietary assessment tools for this young age. Last, this is the first study to our knowledge to heed the importance of reading levels and responses to FFQ.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-1524839911405847">
<title>Implication of Study Results</title>
<p>These study findings provide evidence for use of a simplified screening tool to assess dietary consumption in children. The BKScreener simplified tool could be used by practitioners in a variety of settings with much more ease (for practitioner and participants) and accuracy. Furthermore, the BKScreener shows promise for improving the assessment of a high-risk population and thus for improving the prevention of many diet-related chronic conditions. Last, from our experience, finding appropriate instruments for among Latino children is difficult. Therefore, practitioners may find the BKScreener tool as an appropriate instrument for use to assess the dietary intake patterns of Latino children in school-based settings.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, the findings presented here add to the understanding of response quality in self-reported FFQs administered to mostly low-income third-grade Mexican American children living in South Texas with different academic performance levels. Forty-three percent of participants to whom the BKFFQ was offered were classified as having “Good” response quality. Furthermore, children in the “Poor” response quality category had a significantly lower mean reading score, and higher body fat and BMI than those in the “Good” category. The “Good” response quality category significantly improved with the BKScreener compared with the BKFFQ. The “Good” response quality was nearly five times higher with the BKScreener when compared with the BKFFQ. The “Poor” response quality category was significantly decreased when using the BKScreener. Thus, these study findings showed that within the time constraints of the classroom, the BKScreener yielded better data than the BKFFQ instrument in this population.</p>
