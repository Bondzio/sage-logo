<p><bold>The Problem.</bold></p>
<p>While a variety of factors have historically limited access by women to top-level leadership positions across higher education, these factors become more complicated when juxtaposed with the theological commitments that influence the leadership journeys of women in these settings.</p>
<p><bold>The Solution.</bold></p>
<p>This article reviews the literature related to women in higher education leadership, with a particular focus on the state of women in leadership found in faith-based colleges and universities—as represented by the 110 member institutions of the Council for Christian Colleges &amp; Universities (CCCU). It describes the results of in-depth research on the impact of a CCCU Women’s Leadership Development initiative, launched in 1998. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation data are discussed and implications outlined.</p>
<p><bold>The Stakeholders.</bold></p>
<p>The lessons emerging from this initiative and research can be helpful for postsecondary leaders, HRD and leadership development professionals, and all those who focus on developing women in higher education settings.</p>

<title>The Cultural Context for Leadership in Higher Education</title>
<p>Updates on the status of women in U.S. society occur with regularity in various news publications. A few years ago, <italic>Time</italic> magazine’s special report on “The State of the American Woman” opened with this striking reminder:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If you were a woman reading this magazine 40 years ago, the odds were good that your husband provided the money to buy it. That you voted the same way he did. That if you got breast cancer, he might be asked to sign the form authorizing a mastectomy. That your son was heading to college but not your daughter. That your boss, if you had a job, could explain that he was paying you less because, after all, you were probably working just for pocket money. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1523422311427429">Gibbs, 2009</xref>, p. 27)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As American culture has experienced shifts in gender roles over recent decades, changes have also occurred in terms of gendered realities within the field of higher education. Colleges and universities first opened their doors to women in 1855 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1523422311427429">Thelin, 2004</xref>); by 1980, the percentage of women attending higher education had eclipsed the percentage of men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1523422311427429">U.S. Department of Education, 2006</xref>). The trend toward increasing numbers of women in higher education has continued, with documentation that as of 2007-2008 women earned 57.3% of bachelor’s degrees, 60.6% of master’s degrees, and 51% of doctoral degrees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1523422311427429">U.S. Department of Education, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Educational attainment by women has therefore increasingly provided the preparation typically required for professional advancement. However, women continue to be underrepresented in higher education senior administrative positions. According to data from the American Council on Education, the percentage of women serving as university presidents more than doubled from 9.5% in 1986 to 23% in 2006; women held 38% of the chief academic officer positions, the primary pathway into a presidency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1523422311427429">King &amp; Gomez, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Perceptions about women’s leadership in higher education may be skewed due to recent appointments of women to lead prestigious universities such as Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Princeton University, Harvard University, the University of Michigan, and the University of Pennsylvania. Harvard University’s decision to name Dr. Drew Gilpin Faust as president in 2007, for example, represented a symbolic step forward for women in academe. Susan Scrimshaw, president of Simmons College, described the impact of this appointment: “I think of it as the last really big glass ceiling in higher education. A woman becoming president of Harvard is breaking the last barrier” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1523422311427429">Wilson, 2007</xref>, p. 1).</p>
<p>Despite such rhetoric, these high-visibility presidencies by women must be viewed in light of the fact that only 14% of the public doctoral universities and 7% of the private doctoral universities nationwide are currently led by women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422311427429">Hartley &amp; Godin, 2009</xref>). Most of the women holding presidencies serve in institutions of less than 3,000 students and in community colleges. Documenting this pattern, the Council of Independent Colleges (CIC), an association of more than 600 liberal arts colleges and universities, reported that 28% of first-time presidents in its membership were women, as compared to 30% of the community college presidents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422311427429">Hartley &amp; Godin, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite gains in the educational attainments of women students and, more modestly, in the percentages of women holding senior-level leadership roles in higher education, concerns have persisted about the chilly climate on many campuses first described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1523422311427429">Hall and Sandler (1982)</xref>. Subsequent studies revealed that the chilly climate phenomenon continued throughout the 1990s on college campuses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1523422311427429">Whitt, Edison, Pascarella, &amp; Terenzini, 1999</xref>) and is an ongoing concern, as documented in a recent assessment entitled “On Campus with Women” published by the Association of American Colleges and Universities. The lead article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1523422311427429">Vaccaro, 2010</xref>) was titled “Still Chilly in 2010: Campus Climates for Women.”</p>
<p>The chilly climate on campuses mirrors similar broader concerns about organizational cultures that are unsupportive of women. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1523422311427429">Helgesen and Johnson (2010)</xref> have described the phenomenon of talented women choosing to leave well-paying jobs because “the <italic>structure</italic> of work was designed to reflect the realities of an all-male workforce” (p. 58), also suggesting “a fundamental mismatch between what the marketplace assumes people will value in their work and what women . . . most deeply value” (p. 58). Several researchers have examined the gendered nature of organizational structures that have limited access by women to top-level leadership positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1523422311427429">Ayman &amp; Korabik, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1523422311427429">O’Neil, Hopkins, &amp; Bilimoria, 2008</xref>). From the business perspective, a 2000 <italic>Harvard Business Review</italic> article discussed evidence that subtle and systemic forms of discrimination still linger. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1523422311427429">Myerson and Fletcher (2000)</xref>, both professors of management, summarized their assessment of organizational culture:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It’s not the ceiling that’s holding women back; it’s the whole structure of the organizations in which we work: the foundation, the beams, the walls, the very air. The barriers to advancement are not just above women, they are all around them. . . . We must ferret out the hidden barriers to equity and effectiveness one by one. (p. 136)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Male-normed organizational cultures are a contributing factor to the scarcity of women in senior leadership positions, a reality that contributes to tokenism—an added challenge faced by women. Indeed, many women in senior leadership positions are the only female at their rank, or carry memories of being in that position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1523422311427429">Kezar, Carducci, &amp; Cantreras-McGavin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1523422311427429">Madsen, 2008</xref>). A substantial body of literature has explored the concept of tokenism, building in part from Kanter’s (1993) research about the beneficial impact that gender-balanced executive teams can have on organizational culture. Research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1523422311427429">Tiao and Tack (2007)</xref> on factors affecting executive women’s leadership experiences identified that “the most effective way to improve executive women’s experiences at work is to place more women in powerful leadership positions” (p. 14).</p>

<title>Leadership Within Faith-Based Higher Education</title>
<p>Within faith-based higher education, the 110-member Council for Christian Colleges &amp; Universities (CCCU) has drawn together institutions representing 29 Christian denominations, with some member institutions being nondenominational or interdenominational. These campuses collectively serve 314,000 students, have 1.6 million alumni, and have annual operating budgets of US$4.3 billion (Council for Christian Colleges &amp; Universities [CCCU; Profile], <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1523422311427429">2010-2011a</xref>). Membership in the CCCU requires institutions to be <italic>intentionally Christ centered</italic> and to have (a) a public, board-approved institutional mission or purpose statement that is Christ centered and rooted in the historic Christian faith and (b) full-time faculty members and administrators who profess faith in Jesus Christ (Council for Christian Colleges &amp; Universities [CCCU; Member Application], <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1523422311427429">2010-2011b</xref>).</p>
<p>Research on this sector of faith-based higher education confirms that women are significantly underrepresented in all senior leadership roles. In 2010, only six of 110 presidents were female, with the two most recent additions only in the 2009-2010 academic year. Given that the role of chief academic officer is the primary pathway to the presidency, it is notable that as of 2010, only 18 female chief academic officers in the CCCU were women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1523422311427429">Longman &amp; Anderson, in press</xref>). Trends in CCCU senior-level leadership from 1998 to 2010, analyzed by Longman and Anderson, documented that as of 2010, the average number of individuals serving in vice presidential roles or higher across the 108 U.S. member institutions was 4.9 men and .99 women; the percentage of institutions with no women in such executive positions was 33% (36 institutions) while the percentage with one woman in executive leadership was 44% (48 institutions).</p>
<p>This lack of women’s voices in senior leadership is problematic in part because of the gender balance of students across the CCCU. According to data gathered by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1523422311427429">U.S. Department of Education (2009)</xref> through the Integrated Postsecondary Data System, the gender balance of 105 CCCU institutions that reported data in 2009 was 60% women in undergraduate population and 61% women for all students. Regarding gender representation on the faculty, UCLA’s Higher Education Research Institute (HERI) data reflects that approximately 66% of the CCCU faculty are male and 34% are female (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1523422311427429">Council for Christian Colleges &amp; Universities, 2004</xref>). Drawing from the same HERI database, CCCU female faculty (43.8%) were significantly less likely to hold a doctoral degree than male faculty (67.4%) or than female faculty elsewhere (54.6%). Fewer women faculty (27.2%) in the CCCU were tenured, reflecting a significantly lower rate than male faculty within the CCCU (46.2%) or female faculty elsewhere (37.3%).</p>
<p>While these gendered patterns of fewer women holding senior-level administrative and faculty roles are consistent across higher education, the disparities are particularly striking in the faith-based institutions of the CCCU. In this sector of higher education, historical and theological patterns and commitments are often juxtaposed with deeply held personal beliefs about authority structures and gender roles. Numerous authors have discussed connections between hierarchy and traditional Christian beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1523422311427429">Creegan &amp; Pohl, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1523422311427429">LaCelle-Peterson, 2008</xref>). While a spectrum of opinions and practices related to gender roles exists across various Christian traditions, a major study supported by the Pew Charitable Trusts noted that “gender persists as a central, salient and effective element of the boundary work that maintains evangelical subcultures and identity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1523422311427429">Gallagher, 2004</xref>, p. 216) and that the “vision of a hierarchically ordered universe has been drawn on with great success historically and continues as the orienting gender story among the majority of conservative Protestants today” (pp. 218-219).</p>
<p>The implications of these cultural factors in terms of the experiences of female students, faculty, and administrative leaders have been documented through a variety of studies. For example, early research reported in <italic>Research on Christian Higher Education</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1523422311427429">Sequeira, Trzyna, Abbot, &amp; McHenry, 1995</xref>) described the microinequities evident in attitudes and comments within one Christian university setting that contributed to “pain and disappointment” (p. 1) for many of the female faculty. Using historical data from the catalogues of 90 CCCU institutions, dissertation research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1523422311427429">Garlett (1997)</xref> compared faculty roles and ranks in 1970 and 1995 to determine what changes had occurred in the status, number, and academic placement of female faculty as compared with their male colleges. Garlett concluded that women on these campuses did, indeed, face more career impediments than did their secular counterparts.</p>
<p>The results of a 2007 survey of more than 1,900 faculty serving at CCCU institutions concluded that gender inequities persist in Christian higher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1523422311427429">Joeckel &amp; Chesnes, 2009</xref>). These authors reported that survey responses reflected an “unfortunate pattern of gender polarization, a pattern that reveals more acutely the level of gender inequities on CCCU campuses” (p. 117). For example, in response to the statement “Female faculty at my college/university are treated equally to male faculty” (p. 117) only 24% of the female respondents strongly agreed, compared with 47% of the male respondents. These researchers concluded from an analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In short, gender inequities have become subtly institutionalized, woven seamlessly into the daily, unquestioned workings of the school—hence the invisibility of sexism on campus, as indicated by our data—reinforced by a theological, political, and social campus climate that has become normative and therefore functionally homogenous. It is this homogeneity, among other dead weights, that stalls attempts to eradicate sexism. (p. 123)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Only limited research has focused on women’s leadership roles in evangelical higher education. Dissertation research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1523422311427429">Lafreniere (2008)</xref> on individuals’ perceptions of ideal leadership qualities in CCCU institutions found no social-cognitive explanation for prejudice to exist toward women in leadership; therefore, an acceptance of women in these roles might be expected. In addition, respondents indicated a preference for transformational and relational leadership styles, which are more characteristic of women’s leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1523422311427429">Eagly &amp; Carli, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1523422311427429">Eagly &amp; Johannesen-Schmidt, 2001</xref>). However, very few women currently serve in senior leadership roles of the CCCU institutions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1523422311427429">Dahlvig’s (2011)</xref> narrative study of five women leaders serving in CCCU institutions identified a variety of self-imposed and culturally imposed barriers to leadership for women, including theological perceptions of gender roles and generational assumptions that contributed to fewer women pursuing or obtaining senior-level roles.</p>
<p>In summary, women who seek leadership positions in CCCU institutions continue to meet more barriers than men. Some of these challenges include a lack of role models, theological conservatism that limits access to top leadership positions, embracing a collaborative leadership style that can be misunderstood or disrespected, and feeling “out of sync” with the command-and-control leadership style of some male-dominated administrative cabinets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1523422311427429">Schreiner, 2002</xref>). One faculty member at a CCCU institution commented in a 2005 <italic>Chronicle of Higher Education</italic> article, “. . . at conservative religious institutions, women face a stained-glass ceiling, with the Bible and church tradition routinely used to justify gender discrimination” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1523422311427429">Mock, 2005</xref>, p. B24).</p>

<title>The CCCU’s Women’s Leadership Development Initiative</title>
<p>In part as a response to these concerns, the CCCU in 1996 launched a multifaced project, the Executive Leadership Development Institutes (ELDI) designed to identify and equip future leaders across CCCU member institutions. The following sections describe the background of the ELDI, with particular attention to the Women’s Leadership Development Institute (WLDI) that was first offered in 1998. The summary includes both quantitative and qualitative evaluation data of the WLDI’s impact on the lives of participants. Implications for HDR conclude the article.</p>
<sec id="section4-1523422311427429">
<title>Creation of the Executive Leadership Development Institute</title>
<p>The catalyst for launching the CCCU’s Leadership Development Institutes was a concern expressed by CCCU leaders for collaborative work in developing future leadership for Christian higher education. With supportive funding provided by a foundation, a Steering Committee was formed to oversee the development of a project called the Executive Leadership Development Institute (ELDI); the goal was to provide professional development for newer presidents, newer chief academic officers, and emerging leaders.</p>
<p>The first Presidents’ Institute, held in 1996, involved 10 individuals who had served in the presidency for many years as well as 10 newer presidents who had been in the role 3 years or less; all 20 presidents were male. During the following year, each new president had the opportunity to shadow a mentor president. In 1997, this same model was used with 10 newer and 10 senior chief academic officers. That pattern of every-other year offerings for presidents and chief academic officers has continued, with some variation, in subsequent years.</p>
<p>During a time of evaluation with the Steering Committee after the 1996 Presidents’ Institute, the proposal of having presidents and chief academic officers of CCCU institutions identify emerging leaders on their campuses for a formalized training opportunity was discussed. Since very few women and almost no ethnic minorities were in CCCU senior leadership roles at that time, the concern emerged that nominees for the first offering of the Leadership Development Institute (LDI) would likely be predominantly White and male.</p>
<p>Given the CCCU’s commitment to expand the leadership presence of women and persons of color across Christian higher education, the importance of diversifying the pipeline into senior and administrative leadership was clear. In response, funding was obtained to provide an LDI targeted specially to women with identified leadership potential; thus, the WLDI concept was launched. Qualified ethnic minority applicants were given priority in the selection process for the Mixed (i.e., men and women) LDI and the Women’s LDI (WLDI). Nominations for these new groups were solicited from senior leadership across the member campuses, with 17 participants identified for the 1998 mixed-group LDI and 15 for the WLDI group. Two 4-day Institutes for emerging leaders were held in June 1998, a pattern that has continued every other year between 2000 and 2010. Participant groups consist of 16 to 22 Fellows plus a Resource Team of cabinet-level leaders. Since 1996, the entire ELDI initiative has served more than 350 participants through an array of Presidents’ Institutes, Chief Academic Officers’ Institutes, and Leadership Development Institutes.</p>
<p>Model programs used to develop the LDI/WLDI curriculum include the Institute for Education Management initiative at Harvard, the Max De Pree Center for Leadership at Fuller Theological Seminary, the Fellows Program sponsored by the American Council on Education (ACE), and the HERS Summer Institute for Women in Higher Education. Over the past12 years, the WLDIs have served 125 female participants; the LDIs have served 62 women and 50 men. Related to the goal of equipping persons of color for senior leadership, 23 women and 12 men of color have participated in the WLDIs and LDIs to date.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1523422311427429">
<title>Application Process</title>
<p>Selection criteria for WLDI participation have included (a) being recognized at an institutional level as someone with demonstrated leadership skills, (b) holding a doctorate or nearing completion of a doctorate, and (c) providing evidence of increasing levels of leadership responsibility within and/or beyond higher education. In addition, applicants must provide two letters of reference, at least one submitted by a senior administrator on their campus or elsewhere. Applicants also address key questions about their experiences and aspirations for leadership in higher education, their philosophy of Christian leadership, a self-evaluation of their strengths and leadership potential, identification of mentors, and a description of their professional, personal, and spiritual goals. Individuals nominated for participation in the LDI or WLDI have typically been assistant deans, department heads, division chairs, or other faculty leaders.</p>
<p>The starting point for the year-long WLDI/LDI experience is a 4-day Institute held in June every other year (1998-2010) at a retreat center located in Washington state. In addition to the Institute itself, the broader year-long WLDI/LDI program includes (a) the gift of a modest leadership library of articles and books; (b) the design of a 1-year Professional Development Plan; (c) networking with experienced administrators on the Resource Team; (d) financial support toward a 2- or 3-day “shadowing” experience with a senior leader on another CCCU campus; and (e) opportunities to attend an Advanced Leadership either at the conclusion of the year or in future years.</p>
<p>The Resource Team at each Institute offers a variety of presentations and panel discussions, with ample time for group interaction. Sessions typically have included an introduction to board governance, higher education finance, understanding organizational culture, external constituency relations, conflict resolution, decision making, strategic planning, team building, and balancing multiple responsibilities. In addition, participants in recent years have entered the summer institute having taken the <italic>Clifton StrengthsFinder</italic>, a web-based instrument developed by The Gallup Organization and used with more than 5 million individuals worldwide to assess patterns of natural giftedness. Discussions about individual talents and giftedness have been combined with opportunities to discuss and discern the participants’ sense of calling in their personal and professional lives.</p>

<sec id="section6-1523422311427429">
<title>Research Method</title>
<p>An initial study of the WLDI’s impact on the 71 women who had participated in 1998-2004 was conducted in 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1523422311427429">Lafreniere &amp; Longman, 2008</xref>). Early in 2010, the participants from the 2006 and 2008 WLDI groups were sent the same survey, yielding an overall response rate of 79% among the WLDI participants between 1998 and 2008. A web-based survey instrument consisting of 44 questions was created by the researchers. Survey questions were related to the desired outcomes for the WLDI program; participants used a 7-point Likert-type scale to indicate the impact of various program components (1 indicating <italic>not at all</italic> and 7 indicating <italic>a great degree</italic>). In addition, one open-ended question asked participants to specify what they deemed to be “the single most beneficial impact of the WLDI” in their professional and/or personal life.</p>
<p>To examine the extent to which the program met its desired outcomes, participants’ responses were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. In the inferential analyses, the independent variables were those components of the on-site Institute that were perceived as contributing most significantly to the equipping of participants for leadership roles, the perceived beneficial impact of increased confidence through the nomination and selection process, the creation of a 1-year Professional Development Plan, and participation in a 2- or 3-day shadowing experience with a senior leader on another campus. The dependent variable was participants’ ratings of the extent to which the WLDI was helpful to their professional development.</p>

<title>Assessment of the WLDI Initiative</title>
<p>To analyze which components of the WLDI program explained the most variation in participants’ ratings of the program’s effectiveness, six multiple regression analyses were conducted, entering all predictor variables simultaneously in one block. Each analysis used the same predictor variables: (a) creating a Professional Development Plan to serve as a building block to consider future academic leadership opportunities; (b) the beneficial impact of the WLDI experience being limited to other women; (c) the shadowing experience on another campus as an influencer to consider future academic leadership positions; (d) the helpfulness of informal conversations with other women during the WLDI; (e) the helpfulness of the books, handouts, and other written resources provided before, during, and after the WLDI; and (f) the helpfulness of the workshop sessions for professional development.</p>
<p>The first regression analysis utilized as its criterion variable the participants’ rating of the extent to which the WLDI had met their expectations for leadership development training. The model explained 74% (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .743) of the variance in the ratings of expectations, with the following three predictor variables reaching significance. The workshop sessions had the greatest influence on whether participants’ expectations for leadership development training had been met through the WLDI experience (β = .557, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), followed by the helpfulness of books, handouts, and other written resources (β =.356, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and the impact of the Institute being limited to other women (β = .183, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). In all cases, here and in the following sections, the direction of influence of the predictor variables was positive.</p>
<p>Participants’ increased self-confidence as an academic leader as a result of participating in the year-long WLDI experience was the criterion variable in the second regression equation. The model explained 50% (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .499) of the variance in the ratings, with two predictor variables reaching significance. The shadowing experience on another campus as an influencer to consider future academic leadership positions accounted for the most variance in increasing the participants’ self-confidence as an academic leader (β =.423, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), followed by the helpfulness of the written resources for professional development (β = .321, p&lt;.001).</p>
<p>In the third regression analysis, the criterion variable was the extent to which involvement in the WLDI changed the way participants perceived themselves as being viewed by male colleagues on campus. The model explained 43% (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .430) of the variance in the ratings, with two predictor variables reaching significance. The creation of the Professional Development Plan to organize participants’ thinking about future academic leadership strategies had the greatest predictive ability (β = .360, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), followed by the beneficial impact of the informal conversations with other women during the WLDI (β = .264, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).</p>
<p>The extent to which participants’ thinking about their own leadership potential changed as a result of involvement in the WLDI was examined through the fourth regression analysis. The model explained 42% (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .424) of the variance in the ratings, with two predictor variables reaching significance. The shadowing experience on another campus as an influencer to consider future academic leadership positions had the greatest impact (β =.364, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), followed by the helpfulness of the workshop sessions for professional development (β = .356, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>The fifth regression analysis examined whether WLDI participation had encouraged respondents to consider positions elsewhere and/or be willing to move into a new level of responsibility on their home campus. The model explained 34% (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .343) of the variance in the ratings, with one predictor variable reaching significance. The beneficial impact of informal conversations with other women during the WLDI had the greatest influence on encouraging participants to consider positions elsewhere and/or be willing to move into a new level of responsibility (β = .287, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).</p>
<p>In the final regression analysis, the criterion variable was the extent to which involvement in the WLDI served as an encouragement for participants to remain in Christian higher education. The model explained 32% (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .317) of the variance in the ratings, with one predictor variable reaching significance. The beneficial impact of the WLDI being limited to other women had the greatest influence as an encouragement for participants to remain in Christian higher education (β = .290, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).</p>
<p>Overall, 60% of respondents indicated that they had moved into a new position that reflected increased leadership responsibilities since participating in the WLDI. Most of these women reported having an affirming experience in their first expanded leadership position after attending.</p>
<p>Through an open-ended question, participants were asked to identify the single most beneficial impact of the WLDI on their professional and/or personal life. In rank order, the key themes that emerged included the following:</p>
<list id="list1-1523422311427429" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The women cited the positive benefits of <italic>getting to know other women through the WLDI</italic>. One noted, “The networking relationships that occurred during the week gave me multiple opportunities to reflect on my goals and strengths within the context of Christian higher education.” Another commented, “I believe the most important benefit is that of becoming aware of a women’s leadership network within the CCCU institutions, and having the opportunity to learn from others within the network.”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For many respondents, the <italic>mentoring/shadowing experience</italic> was significant in reframing their thinking about their own potential leadership. One individual responded, “Being mentored as a female professional into the ‘big picture’ of how a university really works.” Another commented on the importance of learning about how to juggle multiple responsibilities: “It gave me insight into how other women in positions of leadership at institutions of Christian higher education balance the responsibilities of being a wife, mother, and administrator.”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>An additional beneficial impact was the <italic>opportunity to form ongoing professional relationships</italic>. One woman commented that she appreciated “having a highly qualified group of peers to encourage me in my leadership journey.”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Many women expressed <italic>appreciation for the opportunity to interact with others who shared similar commitments</italic>. One woman noted, “So often we (women administrators) are the only one or one of a few on our campus, so it was good to connect with other women to hear their realities and see that we have similar experiences.”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For some participants, <italic>having time to focus, reflect, and clarify their personal sense of calling to the academic profession and/or to leadership</italic> was of primary importance. One respondent said that she appreciated “. . . the time set aside to learn and assess my capabilities. We live at such a hectic pace that we rarely have time to constructively think about ourselves, our dreams, and how to realize those dreams.”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Many participants reported <italic>finding encouragement to press on in spite of resistance to women in leadership in Christian higher education</italic>. One respondent identified the single most beneficial impact for her as “networking with other women of similar calling and drive and finding support in their similar struggles.” Participants expressed appreciation for the opportunity to dialogue about the issues that women in leadership face; one described the encouragement of “knowing there are others like me who understand the unique nature of being a woman leader on a Christian campus.”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>An important aspect of the WLDI was its role in <italic>acknowledging the value of women in leadership in Christian higher education</italic>. From one participant: It delivered me from the myth that women must operate like men in the administrative world, or that there is one prescription for leadership that one must follow. I learned to appreciate different forms of leadership as well as different expressions of Christianity and saw that the struggles within my own institution were common to many institutions.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Some <italic>experienced heightened confidence in their personal leadership abilities</italic>. One woman commented that the WLDI built my confidence by placing me in a supportive community of like-minded women. I found I was neither too old, nor too shy, to move ahead in Christian higher education. Two women from WLDI remain my best friends and mentors.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Another stated, “After participating in WLDI, I realized I had the skills and talents to take on a senior leadership role. WLDI gave me the confidence to do the work.”</p>
<p>The significance of being nominated as a high-potential individual was noted by several participants. Some reported that the nomination process itself caused senior administrators to articulate, for the first time, their confidence of the leadership potential in these women. This expressed confidence from a senior-level leader, especially a male leader, caused women to view their potential future contributions in a different light.</p>
<p>Research into the professional journeys of WLDI participants is contributing to our understanding of what factors motivate or discourage women from moving toward senior-level leadership. A grounded theory study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1523422311427429">Dahlvig and Longman (2010)</xref> researched the defining moments that were pivotal in the personal and professional journeys of WLDI participants. Three themes emerged as common to the self-described “most defining moment” on the leadership development journey of these women: (a) someone speaking potential, sometimes as succinctly as a single sentence, into their lives, leading to enhanced confidence of leadership abilities; (b) encountering a person or situation that resulted in reframing the participant’s understanding of leadership in ways that allowed these women to begin perceiving themselves as leaders; and (c) experiencing a situation that led to feeling compelled to stand up for a conviction or a strong belief. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1523422311427429">Longman, Dahlvig, Wikkerink, Cunningham, and O’Connor (2011)</xref> explored how WLDI participants understood the role of calling as a factor in their leadership journeys. An understanding of giftedness combined by internal and external validation of gifts and calling were pivotal in women moving into more senior leadership positions.</p>
<p>An analysis of participants in the leadership institutes held between 1998 and 2008 was conducted in 2009 to compare the role of participants while attending the LDI/WLDI with their current role. This comparison revealed that a majority of female participants had moved into more advanced positions on their campus or elsewhere. The LDI advancements have included 3 provosts, 5 vice presidents, 8 deans, 3 directors, and 6 faculty rank advancements. The WLDI advancements have included 2 presidents, 7 provosts, 11 vice presidents, 14 deans, 9 directors, and 11 faculty rank advancements.</p>

<title>Leadership Development—Implications for Practice</title>
<p>Lessons emerging from this Women’s Leadership Development initiative can benefit leadership development and HRD professionals within and beyond higher education. With critical needs for effective leadership facing organizations, businesses, and social structures, learning from leadership development research and generating informed theory and practice is essential. Given that information about existing programs has not been widely shared, several implications distilled from 12 years of experience with the WLDI initiative are noted.</p>
<p>First, leadership development initiatives such as the WLDI can have a cumulative impact on an organizational culture, particularly when individuals advocate for the program from a variety of perspectives. Clearly, intentionality about the task of identifying and equipping high-potential future leaders needs to be taken seriously both by HRD professionals and by leaders throughout every facet of the organization. The WLDI initiative began with enthusiastic support from the CCCU board in addition to member college presidents and provosts, who have been asked to nominate program participants over the past 12 years and fund their involvement. In addition, as the WLDI alumnae network across faith-based higher education has expanded and the program’s visibility and effectiveness have been established, many others have advocated for and encouraged professional colleagues to become participants. Creating an organizational culture that affirms individual giftedness and opens opportunity for leadership development is a broadscale responsibility.</p>
<p>Second, it should be recognized that effective leadership development programming is targeted to meet particular needs and audiences. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1523422311427429">O’Neil and Bilimoria (2005)</xref> have observed that women’s careers can be divided into three age-related phases: the <italic>idealistic achievement</italic> phase, the <italic>pragmatic endurance</italic> phase, and the <italic>reinventive contribution</italic> phase. Although the WLDI has focused primarily on emerging leaders, a new multiyear, multitiered proposal has been developed that seeks to address the realities present in each of these three phases. HRD professionals working with organizational leadership need to prioritize among the multitude of possibilities for leadership development, being attentive to the skills, knowledge, and attributes necessary at various stages of the professional journey.</p>
<p>Third, leadership development and HRD professionals can benefit from reviewing what is known about effective leadership development programs such as those identified in the articles of this Issue of <italic>Advances</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1523422311427429">Hopkins, O’Neil, Passarelli, and Bilimoria (2008)</xref>, for example, reviewed the literature on women’s leadership development and identified strategic practices related to assessment, training and education programs, coaching, mentoring, networking, experiential learning, and career planning. These authors advocate for the use of leadership assessment tools; the WLDI has introduced participants to the Clifton <italic>StrengthsFinder</italic> as a mechanism for identifying patterns of giftedness. They also argue that “leadership development needs to be unique and different for women, tailored to meet their specific developmental needs” (p. 349), citing the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1523422311427429">Vinnicombe and Singh (2003)</xref>, whose research concluded that women-only leadership training was “essential” for participants to develop both a stronger sense of self and the beneficial relationships that are important to leadership effectiveness. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1523422311427429">Hopkins et al. (2008)</xref> have emphasized the value of establishing professional networks with other women. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1523422311427429">Gibson (2008)</xref> has described the importance of “developmental relationships” that extend beyond one’s own workplace. Participants in the WLDI repeatedly affirmed that such networks are vital in carrying them through challenging times on their own campuses.</p>
<p>Fourth, emerging leaders benefit from both internal and external validation of their talents and an awareness of calling. Whether from a religious or nonreligious perspective of life, talents and strengths represent an innate part of who one is, reflecting an internal source of the calling. Awareness of calling is viewed as conceptually overlapping meaning and purpose, with beneficial results to individuals and organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1523422311427429">Hall &amp; Chandler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1523422311427429">Hunter, Dik, &amp; Banning, 2010</xref>). Recent research suggests that women and men discern their calling in different ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1523422311427429">Phillips, 2009</xref>) and have divergent conceptions of career success. Nomination and acceptance to participate in the WLDI was viewed by many participants as an affirmation of giftedness and a potential indication of calling to more senior leadership roles, often with the goal of broader service to the institution. Thus, creating venues and strategies for identifying and affirming natural talent patterns can expand self-understanding that contributes to preparing for more senior leadership.</p>
<p>Finally, the mentoring and shadowing experiences provided by the WLDI were transformational experiences for many of the participants. Observing women carrying out their senior leadership responsibilities caused many WLDI participants to affirm that they, too, could be successful in such roles. Still, it is clear that a proactive approach akin to executive coaching of high-potential individuals is needed. People with positional power can target up-and-comers in opening opportunities such as building bridges to contacts and groups, modeling transparency through sharing information as appropriate, and involving emerging leaders in professionally broadening opportunities such as strategic planning, organization-wide task forces, and professional associations.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Higher education faces a wide array of internal and external pressures related to current economic realities, trends in globalization and the expansion of technology, and issues related to access and affordability for an increasingly diverse student population. Preparing the next generation of leaders for colleges and universities is imperative, yet only modest efforts have been made to expand the potential pool of well-qualified candidates by providing leadership development programs that target women. In that regard, Rita <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1523422311427429">Bornstein (2008)</xref>, an experienced college president, has expressed concern that “. . . progress is slow, tenuous, and limited by the intractability of gendered organizational structures, perspectives, and expectations” (p. 162).</p>
<p>In the face of these challenges, HRD professionals have the opportunity and responsibility of advocating for leadership development that intentionally opens opportunities for women. Further research is needed regarding what motivates women and men to move into senior leadership roles—and to what extent those motivators differ in ways related to gender. In addition, the sources of encouragement and discouragement as women begin moving into leadership roles are only now being researched. Clearly, much of what is known has implications for HRD. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1523422311427429">O’Neil and Bilimoria (2005)</xref>, for example, have emphasized,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Better organizational efforts are needed to ensure that women receive ongoing coaching and mentoring, work for managers who support their development, have access to organizational resources and opportunities to develop their skills, are given challenging assignments, are acknowledged for their unique talents, and are recognized for aptitude learned through life experiences and “nontraditional” work histories. (p. 168)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Well-designed and targeted strategies for women’s leadership development can bring exponential benefits not only by expanding the pool of gifted individuals to meet today’s current leadership challenges but also by providing role models for future generations of leadership.</p>
