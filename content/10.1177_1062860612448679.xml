<abstract>
<p>The use of Lean tools for quality improvement and process refinement is gaining acceptance in many health care institutions. Traditionally, these tools are used to apply incremental changes to established processes in order to reduce waste and improve quality. In this article, the authors describe a novel Lean methodology, the Rapid Improvement Event (RIE), used in a unique way to develop a new treatment protocol for a specific medical condition: alcohol withdrawal. The RIE allowed for the collaboration of a multidisciplinary group of providers invested in the success of a new protocol for alcohol withdrawal that spans areas from the emergency department to the inpatient ward at an inner-city safety net hospital. It also allowed for the definition of measures for its success once it is implemented.</p>

<body>
<p>Denver Health Medical Center (DHMC) is a tertiary care, urban safety net hospital in Denver, Colorado, that has a mission to “Provide access to the highest quality health care, whether for prevention, or acute and chronic diseases regardless of ability to pay.” In fulfilling this mission, DHMC provides largely uncompensated care to a sizable number of patients with acute or chronic alcohol intoxication or dependence. Alcohol withdrawal, in particular, has proven to be a diagnosis that poses a significant burden on hospital resources and was targeted in early 2011 as an area for quality improvement.</p>
<p>Traditional quality improvement techniques involve the establishment of a plan-do-check-act (PDCA) cycle in which a process is continuously refined and evaluated in order to gradually progress. Although such a PDCA cycle is often ultimately successful in creating change, the time required to get from the initial state to the final one is frequently prolonged.</p>
<p>An alternative approach is to incorporate the PDCA cycle into a structured Rapid Improvement Event (RIE). An RIE focuses the energies of multiple invested parties and can be used to develop new or radically different processes that can enhance care and eliminate waste much more quickly than otherwise might be possible. An RIE is an improvement process that was developed specifically for DHMC, although a similar “Kaizen event” has been described elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1062860612448679">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this article, the authors detail how an RIE was used to develop a new protocol for the assessment and treatment of patients with alcohol withdrawal at DHMC.</p>
<sec id="section1-1062860612448679">
<title>Setting</title>
<p>DHMC is a 477-bed urban teaching hospital with approximately 55 000 adult emergency department (ED) patient visits and approximately 19 000 inpatient admissions per year. DHMC is also a regional level 1 trauma center and a well-known model for the integration of a public hospital, community health center clinics, and a public health department.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1062860612448679">2</xref></sup> Approximately 70% of patients served by DHMC are racial or ethnic minorities, and approximately 40% are uninsured.</p>
<p>In 2005, Denver Health began to embrace Lean principles to identify and eliminate waste (eg, unused human talent, waiting, excess inventory, transportation, defects, and wasted motion) and improve efficiency in the DHMC system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1062860612448679">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1062860612448679">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Lean principles are based on the Toyota Production System and, although initially applied purely in industrial systems analysis and improvement, were introduced to the medical domain in the early 2000s.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1062860612448679">4</xref></sup> The Toyota Production System uses the value stream concept, wherein mapping of end-to-end processes reveals activities that do not add value. Products, meanwhile, should flow smoothly from process to process without delay or waste. Lean tools are used to tackle obvious waste (eg, repeat activities) and hidden waste.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1062860612448679">4</xref></sup> Unfortunately, although some authors have reported improvements in quality through the application of Lean tools, strong evidence is lacking to support this assertion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1062860612448679">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1062860612448679"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1062860612448679">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>A total of 18 different areas within the hospital (eg, pharmacy, paramedic division, outpatient clinics), referred to as value streams, have been chosen to conduct RIEs to address inefficiencies in their workflows. Over a period of 12 months, each value stream conducts 8 RIEs, reporting results and metrics directly to executive staff (including the chief executive officer).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1062860612448679">
<title>RIE Composition and Timetable</title>
<p>An RIE team is most likely to succeed when its members have a vested interest in the process being evaluated and when follow-up and sustainment of results are a priority. However, in addition to the team members listed in the following sections, additional members from outside the specific problem area being evaluated are also included to provide the perspective of “outside eyes.”</p>
<sec id="section3-1062860612448679">
<title>Executive Sponsor</title>
<p>At DHMC, all RIEs have an executive sponsor, who generally is someone from the executive staff of the hospital overseeing the value stream within which the RIE is occurring. The executive sponsor works with the process owner and the team leader to plan the RIE and develop a rough draft for the reason for action, initial state, target state, and metrics (detailed in the following sections). In addition, the executive sponsor is responsible for following up after the RIE is completed to survey the identified metrics in order to ensure that predicted outcome targets are being met. In the case of this RIE that examined the management of alcohol withdrawal patients, the chief nursing officer of the hospital served as the executive sponsor.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1062860612448679">
<title>Process Owner</title>
<p>The process owner has the responsibility of shepherding the process from the preparation phase through the RIE; afterward, the process owner tracks the outcomes during follow-up. In addition, the process owner works to overcome barriers to change and promotes the team’s objectives within the organization. For this RIE, the process owner was a hospitalist.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1062860612448679">
<title>Team Lead</title>
<p>Apart from providing leadership, the team lead is responsible for the team delivering real results over the course of the event. In addition, the lead should push the team toward aggressive changes. On this RIE, the team lead was a senior member of the inpatient nursing staff.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1062860612448679">
<title>Lean Facilitator</title>
<p>Denver Health has a Lean department and employs several trained facilitators. One is always assigned to each RIE and guides the team in setting the agenda and provides the Lean tools for process improvement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1062860612448679">
<title>Sensei</title>
<p>Sensei is the Japanese word for teacher. The sensei, together with the facilitator, imparts the Lean culture to the RIE participants along with the Lean tools used in the process. The sensei is traditionally a senior member of the Denver Health Lean department.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1062860612448679">
<title>Team Members</title>
<p>Varying in number, RIEs usually consist of 7 to 9 people, including the team lead and process owner. They generally are pulled from areas that have a stake in the process being evaluated. Team members for this RIE included 2 inpatient hospitalists, an inpatient nurse manager, an inpatient nurse educator, an inpatient floor nurse, a nurse from the intensive care unit (ICU), a nurse from the outpatient detoxification unit (the director), an internal medicine resident, and an emergency physician.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1062860612448679">
<title>Consultants</title>
<p>Depending on the process being evaluated for improvement, consultants generally are scheduled in advance based on the anticipated needs of the team. Additional consultants often are added during the 4-day period and are called on as needed. For this RIE, consultants included representatives from toxicology, psychiatry, risk management, the Veterans Administration Hospital (where a successful alcohol withdrawal protocol had been implemented), ED nursing, information services, and billing, coding, and pharmacy.</p>
<p>RIEs are fairly structured in their agenda and are staged over 4 days with a report out on the morning of the fifth day. RIEs at Denver Health report out on an A3 format (named for the size of paper used to report out the RIE). This tool takes the PDCA improvement cycle and articulates it in an easy-to-read format. The A3 is divided into 9 sections that the RIE progresses through: (1) the reason for action, (2) initial state, (3) target state, (4) gap analysis, (5) solution approach, (6) rapid experiments, (7) completion plan, (8) confirmed state, and (9) insights (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1062860612448679">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>The Reason for Action</title>
<p>As noted previously, alcohol withdrawal patients exert a significant burden on resources at DHMC. These patients have a significant admission rate to both the ward and ICU and, in the case of the latter, were being intubated at an alarming rate. In the ED and in the hospital, alcohol withdrawal patients tax nursing staff and often require restraints or sitters because of inadequate sedation. In part, this is because of the current reliance on a hospital-wide protocol that uses the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment (CIWA).</p>
<p>The CIWA was originally designed for use as a tool in alcohol withdrawal research but has been widely adopted as a clinical tool as well.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1062860612448679">7</xref></sup> This, despite the fact that the CIWA is burdensome to administer, tends to be administered irregularly by nursing staff, is often used for patients who are not appropriate for symptom-guided treatment, and frequently remains in place as a standing protocol long after it has been established that patients are no longer in alcohol withdrawal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1062860612448679">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1062860612448679">9</xref></sup> Although CIWA has become the de facto scoring standard used at many hospitals, dosing regimens, including choice of benzodiazepine; frequency of administration; and use of adjuvant medicines (eg, haloperidol, clonidine) have not been standardized and vary greatly among institutions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1062860612448679">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>An important clinical limitation of the CIWA as a tool to assess alcohol withdrawal is the fact that it does not incorporate vital sign assessment, which can be an important tool in recognizing delirium tremens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1062860612448679">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1062860612448679">12</xref></sup> In addition, studies that have evaluated CIWA frequently have excluded patients with seizures, one of the first signs of severe withdrawal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1062860612448679">13</xref></sup> Finally, few studies have evaluated the CIWA in patients with medical or surgical comorbidities, a subset of patients at particular risk of developing delirium tremens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1062860612448679">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1062860612448679">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1062860612448679">15</xref></sup> Consequently, physicians at Denver Health have expressed concern that the CIWA protocol may be inadequate for the population in whom it is being used.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1062860612448679">
<title>Initial State</title>
<p>Between 2006 and 2010 patients with any discharge diagnosis of alcohol withdrawal were admitted to the ICU 34% to 48% of the time, with 35% to 49% of ICU admissions requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation as part of their management. The median hospital length of stay for all patients with alcohol withdrawal as any discharge diagnosis was 74 hours; however, it was 113 hours for patients admitted to the ICU and 277 hours for those requiring mechanical ventilation. This suggests a disproportionate impact on length of stay for those who are admitted to the ICU (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1062860612448679">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>A long-standing hospital policy inadvertently contributes to the high rate of ICU admission for these patients. This policy states that once a patient receives 10 mg of lorazepam within a 24-hour period he or she is no longer considered appropriate for a regular ward and must either be admitted directly from the ED or transferred to the ICU from a ward bed, irrespective of his or her clinical condition.</p>
<p>This policy was designed with patient safety in mind; for non-alcohol-dependent patients, this dose likely represents an appropriate threshold above which more advanced monitoring should be instituted. However, patients with chronic alcohol dependence are known to exhibit significant tolerance to benzodiazepines, such that 10 mg of lorazepam is an insignificant dose and often is inadequate to control even mild withdrawal.</p>
<p>The inadvertent result of the policy has been the undertreatment of alcohol withdrawal patients, such that they are being admitted to the ICU with worsening withdrawal. Patients are being intubated not because they are oversedated but rather because of progressive agitation.</p>
<p>Finally, an important component of the initial state is the lack of education among staff regarding the pathophysiology and management of alcohol withdrawal. This clearly contributes to many of the other issues previously noted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1062860612448679">
<title>Target State</title>
<p>Ideally, the goal of this RIE was to develop a hospital-wide protocol for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal. In reality, this translated into 2 separate protocols—1 for the ED and 1 for the hospital wards—that integrated seamlessly. These protocols will have the effects of</p>

<list-item><p>a lack of education related to the pathophysiology and treatment of alcohol withdrawal;</p></list-item>

<title>Rapid Experiments</title>
<p>One of the first tasks facing the team was the replacement of the CIWA score with a different assessment tool. Although various scoring tools exist for assessing the severity of alcohol withdrawal, none has been extensively investigated or validated, and as a result, none has been widely preferred over any other. As previously noted, CIWA itself has been validated only in mild-to-moderate withdrawal and then only in a select population of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1062860612448679">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1062860612448679">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1062860612448679">16</xref></sup> The lack of consensus in the literature about any 1 score or assessment tool led the group to consider the advice of local expert consultants who advocated for an assessment tool that had better theoretical validity than the CIWA. After considering a few different options, the team decided to experiment with a locally derived assessment tool: the Severity of Ethanol Withdrawal Scale or SEWS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1062860612448679">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
<fig id="fig2-1062860612448679" position="float">

<caption>
<p>Severity of Ethanol Withdrawal Scale (SEWS)</p>
</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1062860612448679-fig2.tif"/></fig>
<p>SEWS was derived and validated internally at the local Veterans Administration Hospital and was found to be superior to CIWA in terms of its accuracy and ease of use. In their validation, Veterans Administration physicians used SEWS to assess patients admitted to their ICU with severe withdrawal, and it guided therapy as patients transitioned to the wards and eventually to discharge. Internal data demonstrated that SEWS increased the amount of benzodiazepines administered early in the course of withdrawal, decreased the duration and severity of withdrawal, and decreased hospital length of stay. However, these data have not been published.</p>
<p>As a rapid experiment, the RIE team compared SEWS with the CIWA score for 5 patients admitted to the ICU for alcohol withdrawal. The results revealed that SEWS was universally preferred as being simpler to use. In addition, SEWS proved more precise and had improved interrater reliability compared with the CIWA score.</p>
<p>An additional rapid experiment on SEWS was carried out at the Denver Health outpatient detoxification center where nursing staff used SEWS to assess all patients admitted to the facility over a 24-hour period. All were in favor of the scale and found it easy to administer and use.</p>
<p>Finally, physician members of the team favored SEWS because it included vital signs as part of its assessment, making it a more clinically relevant scale for alcohol withdrawal than the CIWA score.</p>
<p>The last rapid experiment was the development of new alcohol withdrawal treatment protocols for the ED and wards. In determining the choice of medications and dosing schedule, we solicited input from the following consultants: pharmacy, toxicology, nursing, risk management, psychiatry, and information services. In addition, we examined dosing protocols at other institutions that demonstrated improved outcomes with more aggressive treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1062860612448679">17</xref></sup> Subsequently, our newly developed protocol uses higher doses and more frequent administration of benzodiazepines.</p>

<sec id="section16-1062860612448679">
<title>Completion Plan</title>
<p>To progress from design to implementation, a completion plan was designed to integrate all aspects of what would need to be accomplished for successful rollout of the new protocols. Principal within this was an education component for nurses and physicians that incorporated lectures on the pathophysiology and treatment of alcohol withdrawal. The idea was to have staff gain an understanding of the biology and medicine prior to the protocol being released. Lectures will be developed for different provider levels.</p>
<p>Concurrently, administrative steps must be completed for the protocols to be reviewed and approved for use in the hospital. Various committees overseeing pharmacy and therapeutics, patient safety, and nursing all must be informed and have the opportunity to request changes or clarification. Submission to these committees is beginning at this time.</p>
<p>Finally, hospital information services must make changes to existing computerized patient order entry and electronic health records to accommodate the new protocol.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1062860612448679">
<title>Confirmed State</title>
<p>The confirmed state represents the objective improvements we expect to achieve with the future implementation of our protocol. In the coming months, we will be collecting data to determine whether the target state described previously has been achieved. The results we hope to accomplish and by which we will judge our success specifically involve reductions in intubation rates and length of stay. If our new protocols reduce ICU admissions by 50%, the number of medical ICU (MICU) admissions should drop to approximately 20% of hospital admissions if hospital admissions remain unchanged. Similarly, if we could reduce the number of patients being intubated by one third, the rate of intubation of patients admitted to the MICU for alcohol withdrawal would decrease to below 25%. We believe these numbers to be conservative, given that implementation of a similarly aggressive protocol at a large city hospital resulted in ICU intubation rates being reduced from 47% to 22%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1062860612448679">17</xref></sup> Because patients admitted to the ICU—especially those who require intubation—have the biggest impact on overall hospital length of stay, these reductions would have the effect of reducing the average length of stay for all alcohol withdrawal patients. The exact amount of the decrease is unknown, but we estimate that it would be by an average of 1 day. As a result, the average hospital length of stay would decrease from 3.6 days to 2.6 days. Because the vast majority of these patients are uninsured and their care is uncompensated, this has the potential to save the hospital almost $2 million annually (based on an average cost of $1935 per hospital day and an annual census of 920 alcohol withdrawal patients admitted).</p>
<p>It should be emphasized that the main focus of this article is to describe the RIE process, specifically in the novel use of designing a complex clinical protocol. It is our intent to observe and analyze the results of our new protocol once it is implemented and to present those separately.</p>
<p>There is, of course, the potential for unanticipated negative effects from the implementation of this protocol, and we have tried to anticipate the various ways in which these could occur along with the means to detect them and intervene.</p>
<list id="list3-1062860612448679" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Potential for patient harm: Some concern has been expressed that aggressive treatment with high doses of benzodiazepines may result in oversedation. Although it is our belief that the high tolerance displayed by our patient population will prevent such complications, we will actively monitor for cases of oversedation, especially among patients who have been transferred to the ICU and intubated. Denver Health has an active patient safety network with anonymous provider-initiated reporting of any adverse events into a computerized data entry portal. This will be one of the main ways in which adverse patient outcomes related to the protocol will be identified. In addition, the MICU will track all admissions for alcohol withdrawal and identify patients who may have been inappropriately treated under the protocol. Finally, the director of quality and safety for the ED is informed of all transfers to the MICU within 48 hours of admission to the ward from the ED. Any such patients who were admitted under the new protocol will have an extensive chart review. If it becomes apparent that any adverse patient outcomes are occurring, the protocol will be changed immediately to address the situation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Provider compliance with the protocol: Change is always difficult, and we anticipate some degree of resistance with the implementation of this protocol. For this reason, we have spent an inordinate amount of time securing buy-in from the highest level of the hospital administration. Thus far, all the administrative, medical, and nursing leadership have agreed that the new protocol would serve patients better than the current protocol; this has been an important contributor to moving the protocol through hospital committees rapidly. Education will be another key component to ensuring compliance, and an extensive program is planned, aimed predominantly at nursing staff but also targeting physicians. Finally, the timing of the implementation is key. By timing the rollout of this to coincide with the new academic year and the start of the new incoming interns and residents, we believe that we can target the education at the best possible time to ensure compliance. Provider compliance will be assessed in the ED using a data collection instrument for all patients admitted with alcohol withdrawal. Compliance on the ward is ensured via the use of computerized provider order entry.</p></list-item></list>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Although this RIE was successful in many regards, the process is not without its limitations. First, because Lean tools were originally developed for industrial and business process development, many of the exercises designed to identify waste and evaluate workflows were not appropriate for this particular project. At times, the exercises actually impeded progress on the RIE. In the future, Lean tools should be used selectively when deemed helpful to the overall goals of the RIE.</p>
<p>An additional limitation relates to the post-RIE obstacles to change and implementation. Although the initial protocol development took a mere 4 days, the process of integrating it into the hospital work flow will take significantly longer. Myriad committees must review and approve it, an extensive education process must be developed and initiated, and the protocol must be built into several existing computerized order entry systems, all of which will take several months. A lack of standardization for the implementation process represents a potential threat to losing the momentum that was initiated by the RIE.</p>
<p>Finally, because the protocol itself has not yet been implemented, we cannot ascertain if we will reach the confirmed state as outlined in the RIE. The focus of this article is not to evaluate the protocol but rather the process by which the protocol was developed, which itself must be considered a success.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>RIEs are a tool originally developed for DHMC to rapidly address wasteful processes. Although Lean tools have shown enormous potential to eliminate waste and enhance efficiency in medical processes, to our knowledge, they have never been used to develop a new clinical protocol. We have demonstrated that the RIE can be a valuable and powerful means to address a complex and systemic process. It can provide a multidisciplinary approach to developing a novel treatment protocol for a commonly encountered medical problem. This represents a significant shift in how protocols are traditionally developed: by individual physicians without input from nursing or ancillary staff who will be integral to their implementation. Most impressively, this RIE produced a new protocol in only 4 days—a significant accomplishment.</p>
<p>If ultimately successful, this particular RIE could have an important impact on the quality of patient care and on the financial bottom line of the organization in which it took place.</p>
