<abstract>
<p>Fretting corrosion tests of steel wires inside a rope were performed on a self-made fretting wear test rig to understand the fretting corrosion behaviors of steel wires under the environment of alkaline mine water trickling using a simulated alkaline corrosion medium. The results indicate that the corrosion rate of steel wire decreases rapidly and then increases with the increase in the duration of immersion. For late immersion, the corrosion rate tends to be smooth because of the large accumulation of corrosion products. It is also found that the evolution of friction coefficient vs fretting cycles can be divided into five stages. With the increase in the fretting cycles, there is an increase in the weight loss of materials and the evolution processes of damage rate can also be divided into four stages. All the results conclude that interaction of corrosion and wear dominates the fretting corrosion and leads to material loss.</p>

<p>Hoister is an important transportation equipment in coal mines, which is used to transport coal, ore, materials, personnel and equipment, etc. Hoisting rope is used to connect the hoister with the hoisting container; therefore, its reliability is directly related to mine production and the life security of the personnel. Once the steel rope fractures, it will lead to serious accidents in a coal mine. The failure of the steel wire rope is from mainly rust, wear, or broken steel wires. On one hand, the steel wire rope in a coal mine is subjected to withstand the axial repeated tension load and bending stretch load on the drum and guide wheel, resulting in fretting wear between the steel wires. The fretting wear leads to a higher wear, crack initiation and propagation of steel wires, and a considerable decrease in the fatigue lifetime of steel wire ropes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350650112445852">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350650112445852"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350650112445852">3</xref></sup> On the other hand, steel wire rope in a coal mine remains in a harsh environment for a long period, such as high humidity, gale force wind, and acid–base erosion. As a large number of harmful ions in mine water trickling and coal bed bring corrosion on steel wire surfaces, the destructive effect of fretting corrosion is more serious than individual corrosion or fretting wear, which can accelerate the failure process of the steel wires.</p>
<p>Some researchers have focused on dry friction in air in order to study the fretting wear and fretting fatigue of steel wires. Urchegui<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350650112445852">2</xref></sup> analyzed fretting wear of thin steel wires using different operational variables such as normal force, stroke, and number of cycles. Also, Cruzado et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350650112445852">4</xref></sup> mainly investigated the effect of contact pressure on fretting wear of thin steel wires and found that the wear coefficient increased with normal load and stroke, wear behavior was more aggressive in the running-in period, and the wear rates in the stable period increased with higher loads or strokes. At the same time, Zhou et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350650112445852">5</xref></sup> reviewed four kinds of main fretting maps in detail. Later, Zhang<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350650112445852">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350650112445852">6</xref></sup> mainly studied the fretting wear mechanisms and fatigue failure behaviors of the steel wire inside a hoisting rope. In addition, Shen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1350650112445852">7</xref></sup> also carried out much research on fretting wear of steel in dry air based on fretting maps. It was observed that few researches were on fretting corrosion of steel wires in seawater, and the researchers have found that lubrication and zinc coating could effectively reduce the corrosive effect of sodium chloride solution and fretting fatigue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350650112445852">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350650112445852">9</xref></sup> However, few attempts have been done to examine the fretting corrosion of steel wires in alkaline mine water trickling. Therefore, it is of significance to analyze the variety of damage mechanisms and degradation behaviors of steel wires as a function of time. In this article, fretting corrosion tests of steel wires in alkaline corrosion medium were performed on self-made fretting wear rig to investigate the interactive damage mechanisms of fretting wear and corrosion at different periods by the variation of material loss and wear morphologies.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1350650112445852"><title>Fretting corrosion tests</title>
<p>The fretting corrosion tests of steel wires were performed using a self-made fretting rig, which is similar to that described by Zhang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350650112445852">3</xref></sup> As observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1350650112445852">Figure 1</xref>, the stationary steel wire specimen was fixed on the upper holder. The other oscillating steel wire specimen was fixed on the lower holder. Prior to the fretting corrosion tests, the specimens were ultrasonically cleaned in absolute alcohol and thoroughly dried. Two wire specimens were aligned at 90° to each other to simulate the fretting wear behaviors of steel wires in hoisting ropes which had also been described in detail in the reference. The specimens were immersed in alkaline corrosion medium. The fretting oscillation was controlled by eccentric drive device (12) and measured by displacement amplitude measuring device (8). The displacement amplitude was maintained at the value proportional to the eccentricity of the driving wheel. A normal load (<italic>F<sub>n</sub></italic>) was applied on the upper specimen by the loading device (3). The friction force was measured by the force measuring device (7). During the fretting test, the variations of tangential force (<italic>F<sub>t</sub></italic>) vs displacement amplitude (<italic>D</italic>) as a function of fretting cycles (<italic>N</italic>) can be recorded. The experimental parameters for the fretting corrosion tests were as follows: displacement amplitude (<italic>D</italic>) 150 µm, normal load (<italic>F<sub>n</sub></italic>) 30 N, constant frequency 1.2 Hz, and the number of fretting cycles (<italic>N</italic>) from 1 to 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> cycles. Because the gross slip in fretting wear could provide useful information to analyze the interaction of corrosion and wear, the displacement amplitude (<italic>D</italic>) was set at a larger value of 150 µm. After the fretting corrosion tests, the weight loss of materials was measured by an electronic analytical balance. Finally, the morphologies of fretting scars and wear debris at different fretting stages were observed by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

<p>Electrochemical tests of the steel wires were performed at the CS electrochemical workstation.

<p>A three-dimensional plot of friction force (<italic>F<sub>t</sub></italic>), displacement amplitude (<italic>D</italic>), and the number of fretting cycles (<italic>N</italic>) is the most basic and important characteristic curve to analyze the fretting running regimes. According to the variation of <italic>F<sub>t</sub></italic>–<italic>D–N</italic> curves, three fretting running regimes are observed, i.e. partial slip regime (straight line), mixed fretting regime (elliptic), and gross slip regime (quasi-parallelogram). Some researches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350650112445852">5</xref></sup> showed that the evolution of <italic>F<sub>t</sub></italic>–<italic>D</italic> curve in the fretting process had a corresponding relationship with the damage characteristic under a given displacement amplitude, which revealed a detailed information on the fretting damage mechanisms of materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350650112445852">10</xref></sup></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1350650112445852">Figure 2</xref> displays the typical frictional log (<italic>F<sub>t</sub></italic>–<italic>D–N</italic> curves) of steel wires in gross slip regime and the variation of friction coefficient with fretting cycles (<italic>μ–N</italic>). From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1350650112445852">Figure 2</xref>(a), it can be noted that all <italic>F<sub>t</sub></italic>–<italic>D</italic> curves are quasi-parallelogram in shape, which indicates that gross slip takes place in any fretting cycle. Obviously, based on the evolution of friction coefficient in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1350650112445852">Figure 2</xref>(b), the fretting process is divided into five stages. The first running-in stage experiences dozens of fretting cycles where friction coefficient is low, about 0.09. The second stage lasts for about 500 fretting cycles and friction coefficient increases rapidly from 0.12 to 0.41 with the increase in fretting cycles. In the third stage, friction coefficient decreases slowly to about 0.38 and gradually becomes stable during about 10<sup>4</sup> fretting cycles. After 5.2 × 10<sup>4</sup> fretting cycles, friction coefficient increases to the maximum value (about 0.60) in the fourth stage. When fretting cycles lasts for 1.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cycles, friction coefficient reduces again until it is in a stable state (about 0.47), which is in the fifth stage.

<sec id="sec8-1350650112445852"><title>Damage rate of fretting corrosion</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1350650112445852">Figure 3</xref> exhibits the evolution of weight loss and fretting damage rate of steel wires vs fretting cycles. It shows that the weight loss and fretting damage rate present obviously different variation trends. In the first running-in period, weight loss of the steel wire is about 0.08 mg, and fretting damage rate increases quickly. It is concluded that the asperities of the contact surfaces is first grinded off at the beginning of fretting; therefore, weight loss of the materials increases quickly. In the second stage, when fretting cycles increases to 500, the weight loss of materials accumulates to 0.22 mg and the fretting damage rate reaches a maximum value and then falls rapidly. It indicates that the rupture of the surface film leads to the increase in adhesion and abrasion during the steel-to-steel contact and then the wear rate decreases owing to relief of abrasive wear when debris amasses a certain thickness. Damage accumulation causes the fretting corrosion mechanisms of steel wires to change. In the third stage, the weight loss of materials increases gently (when the number of fretting cycles is 6.0 × 10<sup>3</sup>, weight loss of materials is about 0.54 mg) and fretting damage rate drops slowly and becomes smooth. After 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> fretting cycles, the weight loss of materials increases rapidly to 8.42 mg and the damage rate also increases slightly in the fourth stage.

<p>The polarization curves of the steel wire immersed for different periods were measured and the corrosion rate was calculated by Tafel curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1350650112445852">Figure 4</xref>). The polarization curves after immersion times of 7 and 14 min show the node area to appear on an obvious platform, which reveals that the passive film had formed on the steel surface during these two stages, and because of its protection, the corrosion rate of steel wire had decreased gradually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1350650112445852">Figure 4</xref>(b)). With the increase in the duration of immersion, all the anode platforms disappear and the passive film is damaged after an immersion time of 3 h. The corrosion rate increases dramatically because the alkaline medium contacts the matrix of the steel wire. While the immersion time changes from 12 to 46 h, a large number of corrosion products gets deposited on the wire surface, resulting in leveling of the corrosion rate.

<p>Wear and corrosion usually present with accelerating actions against each other. But ‘negative’ interaction was also observed by some researchers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350650112445852">11</xref></sup> i.e. the weight loss in terms of wear in the corrosive medium is sometimes less than that under dry friction conditions in air. In this research, interaction of corrosion and wear manifests as a positive interaction. The mathematical model is performed to evaluate the interaction of corrosion and wear using the following relation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1350650112445852">12</xref></sup>
<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-1350650112445852"><graphic alternate-form-of="disp-formula2-1350650112445852" xlink:href="10.1177_1350650112445852-eq2.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>m</italic><sub>total</sub> is the total loss of wear and corrosion (weight loss of wear in alkaline solution); <italic>m</italic><sub>corr</sub> the weight loss of corrosion alone without the impact of wear (according to GB10124-88 in China, static soak experiment); <italic>m</italic><sub>wear</sub> the weight loss of wear alone without the impact of corrosion (due to restriction of experimental conditions, weight loss in air is substituted for that in a vacuum); Δ<italic>m</italic><sub>lubr</sub> the weight loss in lubrication medium (the difference between weight loss of wear in air and deionized water); Δ<italic>m</italic> the weight loss due to the interaction of corrosion and wear.</p>
<p>After fretting tests, we measured the parameters mentioned above, i.e. <italic>m</italic><sub>total</sub> = 8.42 mg, <italic>m</italic><sub>corr</sub> = 0.52 mg, <italic>m</italic><sub>wear</sub> = 0.41 mg, and Δ<italic>m</italic><sub>lubr</sub> = 0.11 mg.

Since Δ<italic>m</italic>/<italic>m</italic><sub>total</sub> was large, it can be concluded that the interaction of corrosion and wear was crucial for material loss of fretting corrosion in an alkaline solution.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1350650112445852">Figure 5</xref> depicts the SEM morphologies of steel wires when the fretting cycles are 20. It is corresponding to the first stage of fretting corrosion. Due to short fretting time, there is no debris or particles that had formed; only a slight plastic flow of materials under tangential forces is observed on the fretting scars. Compared with the original surface morphology of the steel wire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1350650112445852">Figure 6</xref>), the surface of the steel wire is rough due to total corrosion in the alkaline solution. The electrochemical measurements in this stage cannot be used due to a very short immersion time. However, the steel wire corrodes rapidly and forms a thin passive film when it contacted the corrosive solution at the initial period of immersion. The passive film enhances the thickness of the surface protective film and causes the adhesion action to weaken during the steel-to-steel contact; hence, the corresponding initial friction coefficient is low. Thus, the interactive damage mechanisms of steel wires are mild plastic deformation and electrochemical corrosion.

<p>When fretting cycles are 500, a more severe damage occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1350650112445852">Figure 7</xref>), i.e. the worn surface forms porous corrosion products because the passive film is not dense at this stage, which is measured by the electrochemical experiments. Also, the passive film is damaged continuously by the micro-movements between the wires, which results in a small amount of debris on the wear scar area. A slight abrasion on the worn surface can also be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1350650112445852">Figure 7</xref>(c). With the increase in fretting cycles, the surface film is broken under the tangential forces, and the real contact area increases, and finally adhesion and plastic deformation of materials occur, resulting in rapid increase of the friction coefficient. Thus, the interactive damage mechanism of steel wires in this stage is the combination of plastic deformation, abrasive wear, and electrochemical corrosion.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1350650112445852">Figure 8</xref> shows the worn surface morphologies at a fretting cycle of 10<sup>3</sup> in the third stage of fretting wear. The electrochemical result shows that the steel wire has the thickest passive film in this stage. However, the passive film is damaged under the action of fretting wear. Therefore, the morphology shows small corrosion pits and a large number of small debris attached to the worn surface. In addition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1350650112445852">Figure 8</xref>(b) shows micro-fracture cracks whose directions are perpendicular to the fretting direction because micro-reciprocating motion leads to the friction pair surface that causes work hardening. This makes the sub-surface of the friction pair to cause a severe plastic deformation, and metal surface dislocation increases; therefore, many micro-cracks form on the surface and sub-surface under the effect of shear stress. Therefore the main interactive damage mechanisms of steel wires are electrochemical corrosion and surface fatigue.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1350650112445852">Figure 9</xref> shows the morphologies of steel wires after 1.3 × 10<sup>4</sup> fretting cycles. The electrochemical result shows that the passive film starts to get damaged in this stage. The diameter of the corrosion pits on the worn surface increases significantly due to fretting. Because a lot of wear debris produced in the fretting process accumulate on the contacting edge along the sliding direction, which having a high energy to provide the formation of non-spontaneous electrochemical corrosion, corrosion pitting on the edge of the contact area is more serious than the contact area. The two-body wear gradually transforms to a three-body one owing to the intervention of the third body and the scars present with micro-cutting and serious ploughing. Meanwhile, friction coefficient decreases by the virtue of load carrying and accommodation of third-body particles. The interactive damage mechanism of steel wires changes and is characterized by abrasive wear and electrochemical corrosion.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1350650112445852">Figure 10</xref> exhibits the SEM morphologies of wear scars and debris at a fretting cycle of 5 × 10<sup>4</sup>. In the fourth stage, it can be found that the furrow disappears, worn surface is very rough, large-sized fatigue cracks exist on the contact zone, many corrosion pits are at the edge of the contact zone, and a debris bed covers the contact zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1350650112445852">Figure 10</xref>(a) and (b)). As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1350650112445852">Figure 10</xref>(c), debris is a bulk or spherical in shape with a smooth edge. The interactive damage mechanisms of steel wires are dominated by abrasive wear, fatigue wear, and electrochemical corrosion. In this stage, due to gross slip of the contact surface in the whole fretting process, alkaline solution can successfully enter the micro-cracks of the contact zone, and the flow of medium makes it easier for the debris to escape from the friction interface In addition, surface roughness increases due to the effect of electrolyte and corrosion products. Therefore, all these behaviors cause further increase in the friction coefficient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1350650112445852">13</xref></sup> Generally, corrosion products are loose structures and have a weak bonding force with the substrate. So, they are easily removed from the surface during the friction process, and then a fresh surface with high activity is exposed to the alkaline medium, making it the area for electrochemical corrosion to occur. Hence, wear accelerates the process of corrosion reaction. Moreover, corrosion products form again on a fresh surface in a very short time. The break off and formation of corrosion products promotes the wear process due to continuous corrosion reaction; that is, corrosion accelerates the wear process. Therefore, material loss is higher under the interaction of corrosion and wear.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1350650112445852">Figure 11</xref> shows the morphologies of steel wires after 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> fretting cycles. The electrochemical result shows that the corrosion rate of steel wire levels off due to the accumulation of a large number of corrosion products in this stage. However, the corrosion products are separated from the steel wire matrix by the fretting action. Therefore, there still are large corrosion pits on the worn surface. Plastic deformation, painting, and accumulation were found in the contact area of steel wire along the sliding direction, which increases the activity of the metal surface and impacts the metal surface potential.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350650112445852">14</xref></sup> Therefore, the size of the corrosion pits on the contact area edge is even greater. Although aqueous solution has certain lubrication and inhibits effectively the contact between oxygen in air and wear zone to minimize the formation of new oxides, the entrance of liquid into the cracks accelerates the crack growth. Then, delamination of local material and fatigue cracks appear, resulting in much more weight loss of the materials.

<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The evolution processes of friction coefficient vs the fretting cycles can be divided into five stages. In the running-in period, friction coefficient is low (about 0.09). Then, it increases rapidly to 0.41 in the second stage, while decreases slowly and gradually to be stable (about 0.38) in the third stage. In the fourth stage, it increases again to a maximum (about 0.60). Later, it reduces again until being stable (about 0.47).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Electrochemical results show that steel corrosion rate first decreases, then increases, and finally levels off throughout the immersion process. After an immersion time of 14 min, the passive film is thick and the corrosion rate is the least. For immersion times of 12 and 46 h, a large number of corrosion products get deposited on the wire surface, resulting in leveling of the corrosion rate.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>With the increase in the fretting cycles, weight loss of steel wires increases, and the evolution processes of the damage rate can be divided into four stages. The interaction of corrosion and fretting wear was crucial for material loss of fretting corrosion in an alkaline solution.</p>
<p>At the early stage of fretting corrosion, steel wires presents with a slight damage, namely plastic flow of materials and mild electrochemical effects. In the second stage, wear aggravates and the fretting damage mechanisms are mainly dominated by pit corrosion and adhesive wear. In the third stage, material loss increases rapidly and damage mechanisms change, i.e. fatigue wear, electrochemical corrosion, and abrasion wear. The fourth stage presents the main wear mechanisms of fatigue wear and electrochemical corrosion wear. At the final stage, pitting corrosion and crevice corrosion are serious and interaction of corrosion and wear gets aggravated.</p></list-item>
