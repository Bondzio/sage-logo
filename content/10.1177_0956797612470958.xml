<abstract>
<p>The unconscious-thought effect (UTE) occurs when people are better able to make complex decisions after a period of distraction rather than immediately or after a period of conscious deliberation. This finding has often been interpreted as evidence of unconscious thinking. In two experiments, we provided the first evidence that the UTE is accompanied by enhanced memory for the gist of decision-relevant attributes and demonstrated that the cognitive demands of a distraction task moderate its effect on decision making and gist memory. It was only following a low-demand distraction task that participants chose the best alternative more often and displayed enhanced gist memory for decision-relevant attributes. These findings suggest that the UTE occurs only if cognitive resources are available and that it is accompanied by enhanced organization of information in memory, as shown by the increase in gist memory.</p>

<p>In his portrayal of Willem Albert Wagenaar (1941–2011) at the 23rd International Conference on Subjective Probability, Utility and Decision Making, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0956797612470958">Gideon Keren (2011)</xref> emphasized that this brilliant researcher used to work on his papers while driving his car. In line with this “working method,” but contrary to the tenets of classic decision theories (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0956797612470958">Simon, 1955</xref>), recent studies suggest that performing a distraction task improves complex decision making (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797612470958">Dijksterhuis, Bos, Nordgren, &amp; van Baaren, 2006</xref>). This finding, referred to as the unconscious-thought effect (UTE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0956797612470958">Strick, Dijksterhuis, &amp; van Baaren, 2010</xref>), has been interpreted as evidence that unconscious thought occurs during the distraction period.</p>
<p>Unconscious thought is a process that is assumed to occur outside conscious awareness and to involve a transformation of mental representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797612470958">Dijksterhuis &amp; Nordgren, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0956797612470958">Strick et al., 2011</xref>). Although most unconscious-thought experiments have focused on its effect on complex decision making, little, if anything, is known about the presumed representational changes. The present research provides an initial bridge between unconscious-thought theory (UTT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797612470958">Dijksterhuis &amp; Nordgren, 2006</xref>) and fuzzy-trace theory (FTT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0956797612470958">Reyna &amp; Brainerd, 1995</xref>). In memory research, FTT posits that people form two types of mental representations. Verbatim representations are detailed representations of the exact information, whereas gist representations refer to the meaning of the information. In two experiments, we provided initial evidence that the UTE is accompanied by enhanced memory for the gist of the decision-relevant attributes and demonstrated that the cognitive demands of the distraction task moderate its effect on decision making and gist memory: Only the completion of a low-demand distraction task improved complex decision making and enhanced memory for the gist of the decision-relevant attributes.</p>
<p>Unconscious thought is assumed to actively change mental representations outside conscious awareness, defined here as an individual’s awareness of his or her cognitive processing of information at a given moment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797612470958">Dijksterhuis &amp; Nordgren, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0956797612470958">Strick et al., 2011</xref>). So far, no strong empirical support for the transformation of mental representations following distraction has been found. In particular, although the hypothesis that unconscious thought better organizes information in memory than conscious thought does (e.g., information pertaining to the same category is better integrated) has been tested, the results are inconclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956797612470958">Dijksterhuis, 2004</xref>). Three reasons might explain this lack of support.</p>
<p>The first reason comes from a methodological criticism of the paradigm that has been widely used to study the UTE. In this paradigm, participants are first given information on choice alternatives, such as cars or apartments. Following this acquisition period, they are instructed either to consider the alternatives (conscious thought) or to perform a distraction task (unconscious thought). Because the information is no longer available during the deliberation or distraction period, it is assumed that participants make their decision on the basis of their memory of the choice alternatives. However, it has been suggested that this paradigm favors on-line decisions made during information acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0956797612470958">Lassiter, Lindberg, González-Vallejo, Bellezza, &amp; Phillips, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0956797612470958">Waroquier, Marchiori, Klein, &amp; Cleeremans, 2010</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0956797612470958">Strick et al., 2010</xref>). If decisions are indeed made before distraction (or deliberation), there is no reason to assume that they are based on the mental representation of the various alternatives or that this representation changes during the distraction period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0956797612470958">Hastie &amp; Park, 1986</xref>). It is therefore important to use a paradigm that constrains participants to make memory-based decisions.</p>
<p>The second reason is that previous investigations of the effects of unconscious thought on memory have failed to take account of the distinction between verbatim and gist representations introduced by the FTT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0956797612470958">Reyna, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0956797612470958">Reyna &amp; Brainerd, 1995</xref>). Verbatim representation, which refers to memory for an item’s surface details (e.g., its exact wording), is precise and quantitative. Gist representation, which refers to memory for an item’s meaning (e.g., its semantic category), is fuzzy and qualitative. These two independent types of representations are extracted when encoding a situation and are used as a basis for future retrieval. Verbatim representations are assumed to be retrieved through a consciously controlled process, whereas gist representations are thought to be retrieved through an automatic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956797612470958">Brainerd, Reyna, &amp; Mojardin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0956797612470958">Brainerd, Stein, &amp; Reyna, 1998</xref>). Several studies have reported that divided attention at retrieval time, a condition comparable with the distraction condition of the UTT paradigm, reduced verbatim memory but left gist memory unaffected (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956797612470958">Dodson &amp; Johnson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0956797612470958">Gruppuso, Lindsay, &amp; Kelley, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0956797612470958">Koutstaal, Schacter, &amp; Brenner, 2001</xref>). Moreover, unconscious thought is described as a holistic process that provides rough estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797612470958">Dijksterhuis &amp; Nordgren, 2006</xref>). Hence, unconscious thought should be based on gist representations. There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating that experts display more gist memory than novices do (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0956797612470958">Reyna, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0956797612470958">Reyna et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0956797612470958">Reyna &amp; Lloyd, 2006</xref>). It is interesting that distraction improves decision making, particularly among experts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0956797612470958">Dijksterhuis, Bos, van der Leij, &amp; van Baaren, 2009</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0956797612470958">González-Vallejo &amp; Phillips, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The third reason why there is little empirical evidence supporting the hypothesis of a representational change during distraction might be that, as a recent meta-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0956797612470958">Strick et al., 2011</xref>) suggests, the difficulty of the distraction task moderates the UTE. Indeed, the UTE is more likely to occur with easy distraction tasks than with difficult ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0956797612470958">McMahon, Sparrow, Chatman, &amp; Riddle, 2011</xref>). These results nonetheless call into question early theoretical accounts of the UTE, in which it was assumed that conscious attention must be fully loaded if conscious thought is to be completely disrupted and unconscious thought elicited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797612470958">Dijksterhuis &amp; Nordgren, 2006</xref>). To explain these surprising findings, it has been proposed that conscious awareness rather than the availability of cognitive resources demarcates conscious from unconscious thought. Unconscious thought would occur outside conscious awareness but would, like conscious thought, require cognitive resources to operate efficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0956797612470958">Strick et al., 2011</xref>). Hence, if unconscious thought actually produces a change in gist memory, this effect might be observed only when easy distraction tasks are used.</p>
<p>In the present research, we constructed an innovative decision task that constrained participants to make their decision on the basis of their memory for the choice alternatives. Unlike in most previous experiments, participants did not have to choose their favorite alternative but had to satisfy a client request provided after the presentation of the features of the alternatives. The alternatives were equivalent in quality, and only the need to satisfy the client request made it possible to choose between them. The material used to describe the choice alternatives related to different semantic categories. Gist parameters could thus be interpreted as measures of memory for a category of attributes. By contrast, verbatim parameters could be interpreted as measures of memory for specific attributes.</p>
<p>UTT claims that unconscious thought organizes information in memory by integrating items relating to the same category; therefore, we predicted that distraction should increase gist memory. Because a recent meta-analysis suggested that the difficulty of the distraction task moderates the UTE, we examined the effect of performing a low-demand distraction task on decision making and mental representations of the best choice alternative in a first experiment. In a second experiment, we manipulated the value of <italic>n</italic> in an <italic>n</italic>-back task to assess the effect of the cognitive demands of the distraction task on decision making and memory independently of other aspects. Because the UTE is more likely to occur when cognitive resources are not fully loaded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0956797612470958">Strick et al., 2011</xref>), we expected to replicate the UTE only with the less-demanding distraction task and to find that making a decision while performing a low-demand distraction task increases gist memory.</p>

<title>Experiment 1</title>
<sec id="section2-0956797612470958">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Thirty-seven students from Toulouse University participated voluntarily in Experiment 1. They were instructed to adopt the role of a real-estate agent and decide which apartment among four best fitted a client request. Participants were told that they would receive information about each apartment before reading the client request. The attributes used to describe the apartments were either positive (e.g., located in a quiet area) or negative (e.g., located in a noisy area) and pertained to 24 criteria (e.g., level of noise in the area). Each apartment was characterized by a different set of 15 positive and 9 negative attributes pretested as being perceived as similar in terms of importance. The 24 criteria were classified into four distinctive categories (e.g., location). The client requested 3 criteria from each category. The best apartment for the client was positive on these 12 criteria. The second-best apartment was positive on 9 criteria, the midrange apartment was positive on 6 criteria, and the worst apartment was positive on 3 criteria (pretest details and stimulus material are provided in the Supplemental Material available online). Apartments were described sequentially in a random order. For each apartment, the 6 attributes pertaining to the same category were presented simultaneously for 30 s. The order of presentation of categories was randomized. In each category, the order of the attributes in the list was also randomized. Next, the 12 attributes of the client request were presented simultaneously for 60 s. The order of the attributes in the client list was randomized.</p>
<p>Each participant was randomly assigned to one of two decision modes. In the immediate-decision condition, participants were asked to select the best apartment for their client immediately after the presentation of the client’s request. Participants in the 0-back condition were first reminded that their task was to choose the apartment to recommend to their client. They were then told that the director of the real-estate agency had asked them to perform an urgent secondary task and that it was very important to perform this task well. A different number between 1 and 9 appeared in the center of the screen every second for 3 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797612470958">Jonides et al., 1997</xref>). Participants had to press the space bar if the current number matched a constant target (number 4). They then indicated which apartment was the best for their client.</p>
<p>Finally, participants in both conditions completed the recognition task. Participants were presented with a list of attributes. They had to decide whether each of these attributes had been used to describe the apartment, which was named “Lurya.” They were not informed that this apartment was the best fit to the client’s request. The test list consisted of 36 attributes: 12 targets, 12 related distractors, and 12 unrelated distractors. The targets were the 12 attributes of the client request. The related distractors were nonstudied attributes belonging to the studied categories. The unrelated distractors were nonstudied attributes belonging to nonstudied categories. The attributes were presented one by one in random order. Participants had to indicate whether each attribute was identical to one of the attributes of the Lurya apartment previously seen in the study phase (a target), was related to a category of attributes of this apartment, or was new.</p>
<p>Data were analyzed using the simplified conjoint-recognition model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0956797612470958">Stahl &amp; Klauer, 2008</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797612470958">Brainerd, Reyna, &amp; Aydin, 2010</xref>), which provides parameter estimates for verbatim memory for targets (<italic>V</italic><sub>t</sub>) and related distractors (<italic>V</italic><sub>r</sub>) and for gist memory for targets (<italic>G</italic><sub>t</sub>) and related distractors (<italic>G</italic><sub>r</sub>), as well as two parameters for guessing processes (<italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic>). Verbatim-memory (<italic>V</italic><sub>t</sub>) and recollection-rejection (i.e., verbatim memory for related distractors; <italic>V</italic><sub>r</sub>) parameters were used here to measure the extent to which participants could discriminate between the studied attribute itself and a nonstudied one with the same conceptual meaning (i.e., belonging to the same category). The parameters for gist memory for targets (<italic>G</italic><sub>t</sub>) and gist-based false memory (i.e., gist memory for related distractors; <italic>G</italic><sub>r</sub>) measured the extent to which participants encoded the conceptual meaning of each category, which would allow them to reject unrelated distractors but would not allow them to remember whether the attribute itself or a related attribute with the same conceptual meaning (which belongs to the same category) had been presented in the learning phase. Finally, guessing parameters assessed the tendency to accept unrelated distractors as old. After completing the recognition test, participants were thanked, debriefed, and dismissed.</p>

<sec id="section3-0956797612470958">
<title>Results and discussion</title>
<p>As in previous research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797612470958">Dijksterhuis et al., 2006</xref>), the proportion of participants who chose the best apartment was examined as a function of decision mode. As predicted, participants were more likely to pick the best apartment in the 0-back condition (75%) than in the immediate-decision condition (35%), χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 37) = 5.90, <italic>p</italic> = .02, odds ratio = 5.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) = [1.33, 22.73]. Thus, the UTE was replicated with a low-demand distraction task.</p>
<p>Gist, verbatim, and bias parameter estimates are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0956797612470958">Table 1</xref>. Parameter estimation and hypotheses tests were performed with HMMTree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0956797612470958">Stahl &amp; Klauer, 2007</xref>). The omnibus test of goodness of fit showed that the simplified conjoint-recognition model fitted the data well, <italic>G</italic><sup>2</sup>(12) = 0.00, <italic>p</italic> = 1. The null hypothesis that sample data could have been generated by a process that conformed to the model’s equations could not be rejected. As expected, a likelihood-ratio test showed that gist memory for targets (<italic>G</italic><sub>t</sub>) was greater in the 0-back condition than in the immediate-decision condition, Δ<italic>G</italic><sup>2</sup>(1) = 7.02, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. By contrast, gist memory for related distractors (<italic>G</italic><sub>r</sub>), a process that underlies false memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0956797612470958">Stahl &amp; Klauer, 2008</xref>), was not affected by decision mode, Δ<italic>G</italic><sup>2</sup>(1) = 0.05, <italic>p</italic> = .83. The finding that gist memory was greater for targets but not for related items supports the hypothesis that distraction results in a more organized representation. Verbatim memory for targets (<italic>V</italic><sub>t</sub>) was greater in the immediate-decision condition than in the 0-back condition, Δ<italic>G</italic><sup>2</sup>(1) = 7.01, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. This result is consistent with the finding that verbatim memory decays over time (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0956797612470958">Brainerd, Reyna, &amp; Kneer, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0956797612470958">Reyna &amp; Kiernan, 1994</xref>). However, verbatim memory for related distractors (<italic>V</italic><sub>r</sub>), a process that reflects recollection rejection, was not affected by decision mode, Δ<italic>G</italic><sup>2</sup>(1) &lt; 0.01, <italic>p</italic> = .99. Finally, no significant effect of decision mode was observed on guessing parameters, <italic>a</italic>: Δ<italic>G</italic><sup>2</sup>(1) = 0.86, <italic>p</italic> = .35; <italic>b</italic>: Δ<italic>G</italic><sup>2</sup>(1) = 0.16, <italic>p</italic> = .69.</p>

<title>Experiment 2</title>
<p>Our first goal in Experiment 2 was to conduct an experimental study to further examine the moderating effect of the cognitive demands of the distraction task on decision making found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0956797612470958">Strick and colleagues’ (2011)</xref> meta-analysis (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0956797612470958">McMahon et al., 2011</xref>). Another aim was to extend this finding by examining how the cognitive demands of the distraction task affected gist memory. The difficulty of the distraction task was modulated by varying the value of <italic>n</italic> in the <italic>n</italic>-back task (0 or 2). It has been shown that the 2-back task places higher demands on cognitive resources than the 0-back task does (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797612470958">Jonides et al., 1997</xref>). A deliberation condition was also added. This design ensured that the positive effect of distraction obtained in the first experiment was due to an active process occurring during distraction and did not merely reflect a time-lag effect. Because cognitive resources are required for the UTE to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0956797612470958">Strick et al., 2011</xref>), we expected that participants distracted with the less-demanding task would make better decisions and display more gist memory than the other participants.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Sixty students from Toulouse University participated voluntarily in Experiment 2. The experimental material was the same as in Experiment 1. After processing all the information and being reminded that the task was to choose an apartment to recommend to the client, each participant was randomly assigned to one of three decision modes. In the 0-back and 2-back conditions, participants were told that the director of the real-estate agency had asked them to complete an urgent secondary task and that it was very important to perform this task well. As in Experiment 1, participants in the 0-back condition were distracted with the same low-demand version of the <italic>n</italic>-back task for 3 min before making their choice. In the 2-back condition, they worked on a more-demanding version of this task for the same duration. The sequence of numbers was shown on screen as in Experiment 1, but here participants had to press the space bar if the current number matched the one that preceded it by two places. In the deliberation condition, participants were asked to reflect carefully on their decision for 3 min and to write down the reasons for their choice, as if they had to justify it to their client (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0956797612470958">Thorsteinson &amp; Withrow, 2009</xref>). Next, all the participants indicated which apartment they thought was the best for their client and completed the recognition task. They were then thanked, debriefed, and dismissed.</p>

<title>Results and discussion</title>
<p>There was a significant difference in the percentage of optimal choices in the three decision conditions, χ<sup>2</sup>(2, <italic>N</italic> = 60) = 6.54, <italic>p</italic> = .04. As predicted, participants were more likely to pick the best apartment in the 0-back condition (75%) than in the deliberation (40%) and the 2-back (40%) conditions, both χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 40) = 5.01, <italic>p</italic> = .03, odds ratio = 4.5, 95% CI = [1.17, 17.24]. The positive effect of a low-demand distraction task on decision making was replicated, which suggests that cognitive resources are required for the UTE to occur.</p>
<p>Gist, verbatim, and bias parameter estimates are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0956797612470958">Table 1</xref>. Parameter estimation and hypotheses tests were performed with HMMTree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0956797612470958">Stahl &amp; Klauer, 2007</xref>). The omnibus test of goodness of fit showed that the simplified conjoint-recognition model fitted the data well, <italic>G</italic><sup>2</sup>(18) = 0.24, <italic>p</italic> = 1. As expected, decision mode had a significant effect on gist memory for targets (<italic>G</italic><sub>t</sub>), Δ<italic>G</italic><sup>2</sup>(2) = 7.02, <italic>p</italic> = .03. Participants in the 0-back condition were twice as likely to retrieve a target’s gist trace in response to a target probe than participants in the deliberation condition were, Δ<italic>G</italic><sup>2</sup>(1) = 7.02, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. Although they also exhibited more gist memory for targets than participants in the 2-back condition did, this effect was only marginally significant, Δ<italic>G</italic><sup>2</sup>(1) = 3.37, <italic>p</italic> = .07. There was no significant difference between the deliberation and 2-back conditions, Δ<italic>G</italic><sup>2</sup>(1) = 1.06, <italic>p</italic> = .30. Gist memory for related distractors (<italic>G</italic><sub>r</sub>) was not affected by decision mode, Δ<italic>G</italic><sup>2</sup>(2) = 1.75, <italic>p</italic> = .42. These results indicate that the UTE is accompanied by an increase in gist memory, which reflects a better organization of information in memory.</p>
<p>Decision mode also had a significant effect on verbatim memory for targets (<italic>V</italic><sub>t</sub>), Δ<italic>G</italic><sup>2</sup>(2) = 8.44, <italic>p</italic> = .01. The probability of retrieving a target’s verbatim trace in response to a target probe was greater in the 0-back than in the deliberation, Δ<italic>G</italic><sup>2</sup>(1) = 6.73, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, and the 2-back conditions, Δ<italic>G</italic><sup>2</sup>(1) = 6.34, <italic>p</italic> = .01. There was no difference between the latter two conditions, Δ<italic>G</italic><sup>2</sup>(1) &lt; 0.01, <italic>p</italic> = .99. Recollection rejection (i.e., verbatim memory for related distractors; <italic>V</italic><sub>r</sub>) was not affected by decision mode, Δ<italic>G</italic><sup>2</sup>(2) = 1.29, <italic>p</italic> = .52. These findings suggest that verbatim memory decreased more slowly during the low-demand distraction period than during the deliberation period and the high-demand distraction period. Finally, no significant effect of decision mode was observed on guessing parameters, <italic>a</italic>: Δ<italic>G</italic><sup>2</sup>(2) = 2.70, <italic>p</italic> = .26; <italic>b</italic>: Δ<italic>G</italic><sup>2</sup>(2) = 1.73, <italic>p</italic> = .42.</p>

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>This study was the first to integrate the intriguing UTE with an important dual-process theory of memory, the FTT. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797612470958">Dijksterhuis and colleagues (2009)</xref> had assumed that unconscious thought is a gist-based process, but empirical evidence was still needed. We have provided initial evidence that the UTE is accompanied by enhanced gist memory.</p>
<p>In two experiments, we replicated the UTE using a distraction task with low cognitive demands. Performing a low-demand distraction task improved subsequent decision quality compared with making an immediate choice (Experiment 1), as well as when compared with deliberating about the decision or performing a high-demand distraction task (Experiment 2). The second experiment thus provided additional evidence suggesting that the UTE is moderated by the cognitive demands of the distraction task.</p>
<p>To gain insight into the memory processes underlying decision making, we used an innovative task that constrained participants to make memory-based decisions in combination with the FTT’s simplified conjoint-recognition paradigm, which makes it possible to dissociate gist and verbatim representations. We showed that participants’ mental representations changed as a function of decision mode. More specifically, gist memory for decision-relevant attributes (i.e., attributes possessed by the apartment that best fit the client’s request) was improved in the low-demand distraction condition relative to the immediate-decision condition (Experiment 1), as well as relative to the deliberation and the high-demand distraction conditions (Experiment 2). By contrast, decision mode had no effect on gist-based false memory. Although verbatim memory for decision-relevant attributes was enhanced in the low-demand distraction condition relative to the deliberation or high-demand distraction conditions, it was reduced compared with the immediate-decision condition. Decision mode had no effect on recollection rejection.</p>
<p>Our findings are important because they show that the UTE is accompanied by an enhancement of gist memory that reflects a better organization of information in memory. They also suggest that low-demand distraction might help to preserve memory for the verbatim details of the presentation phase. In earlier research, unconscious thought was described as a gist-based process that improves decision making by integrating relevant information into an organized representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956797612470958">Dijksterhuis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0956797612470958">Dijksterhuis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0956797612470958">Strick et al., 2011</xref>). In the current task, memory for decision-relevant attributes was required to make a decision. Participants made better choices after low-demand distraction than after deliberation and high-demand distraction; further, both gist and verbatim memory were greater in the former than in the latter conditions. More striking, low-demand distraction also improved decision making compared with an immediate-choice condition, with gist memory being greater and verbatim memory being reduced in the former condition. Hence, it seems that gist memory contributed more to decision quality than verbatim memory did, which is perfectly consistent with the FTT. For example, recent studies in domains such as medical decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0956797612470958">Reyna, 2008</xref>) have demonstrated that gist-based reasoning, which is especially used by experts, might lead to efficient decision making (i.e., external correspondence to specified criteria). Other experiments have also shown that reducing verbatim memory by removing superficial information from displays might improve reasoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956797612470958">Brainerd &amp; Reyna, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0956797612470958">Reyna, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0956797612470958">Reyna &amp; Brainerd, 1995</xref>). Advanced reasoning and judgment are thus more likely to be based on gist memory than on verbatim memory. Our findings are therefore congruent with the theoretical prediction that gist representations may be a mechanism by which the UTE occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0956797612470958">Dijksterhuis et al., 2009</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0956797612470958">Reyna, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Our results also support <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0956797612470958">Strick and colleagues’ (2011)</xref> hypothesis that the UTE occurs only if cognitive resources are available, because we replicated the UTE only with a distraction task that imposed low cognitive demands. It should be noted, however, that these results question the capacity principle of the UTT, which states that conscious thought is limited by the low capacity of consciousness, whereas unconscious thought, because it is not subject to this constraint, has much greater capacity. According to this view, performing a highly demanding distraction task should prevent the conscious processing of the decision task and allow the considerable processing capacity of the unconscious to operate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797612470958">Dijksterhuis &amp; Nordgren, 2006</xref>). Therefore, in the present experiment, the UTE should have been larger when the more-demanding distraction task was used than when the less-demanding distraction task was used. However, the UTE was replicated only when participants’ cognitive resources were not fully loaded. Moreover, as in previous experiments, the decision goal was given explicitly. This casts doubt on the idea that no consciously aware decision-relevant processes occurred during the low-demand distraction period.</p>
<p>It has recently been demonstrated that thinking consciously about a decision and then performing a highly demanding distraction task is more efficient than either thinking consciously or performing a highly demanding distraction task alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0956797612470958">Nordgren, Bos, &amp; Dijksterhuis, 2011</xref>). This suggests that thinking both consciously and unconsciously is more efficient than thinking solely consciously or solely unconsciously. Therefore, it is possible that performing a simple distraction task does not completely eliminate the conscious processing of the decision task and that the improvement in decision making we observed was due to a combination of unconscious and conscious processes. Indeed, it is difficult to assume that a single process is responsible for performance in a given task or experimental condition (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0956797612470958">Dunn &amp; Kirsner, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797612470958">Jacoby, 1991</xref>). At present, research into the UTE seems to be based more on task dissociations (that is, dissociating deliberation and distraction conditions as a function of experimental variables) than on process dissociations.</p>
<p>This study was the first to dissociate gist and verbatim representations and show that, although it is likely that participants’ conscious awareness was not completely distracted from decision making during the low-demand distraction task, the UTE is accompanied by a representational change that results in increased gist memory.</p>
