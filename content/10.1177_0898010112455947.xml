<abstract>
<p>Art therapy facilitates the expression of thoughts and feelings and thus may serve as a self-care strategy. This paper describes the implementation of an expressive art therapy class to teach self-care during a required sophomore level nursing wellness course and the outcomes of the class through the eyes of six students. While students were initially reluctant to engage in the activity, the shared stories revealed feelings of relaxation, empowerment, value clarification, and increased self-awareness. The implication for nursing education is that the integration of art therapy into curricula may serve as an effective strategy to teaching self-care and core professional values.</p>

<p>Self-care may be defined as an individual’s ability and responsibility to engage in healthy lifestyle behaviors that optimize functioning and human development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898010112455947">Richard &amp; Shea, 2011</xref>). Components of such a healthy lifestyle are thought to include positive behaviors surrounding health responsibility, physical activity, nutrition, interpersonal relations, spiritual growth, and stress management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898010112455947">Pender, Murdaugh, &amp; Parsons, 2006</xref>). The ability to provide self-care is a prerequisite to the practice of nursing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0898010112455947">American Association of Colleges of Nursing [AACN], 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898010112455947">American Holistic Nurses Association ([AHNA], 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898010112455947">Benner, Sutphen, Leonard, Day, and Shulman (2010)</xref> used the term <italic>ethical comportment</italic> to describe behavior consistent with a recognized set of professional values and responsibilities. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898010112455947">National League for Nursing ([NLN], 2010</xref>) posits that self-care, self-awareness, and self-growth are aspects of ethical comportment. The purpose of this article is to describe how an expressive art therapy class was used to teach self-care and self-awareness to a group of sophomore nursing students enrolled in a required wellness course and to describe the outcomes through the stories of the participants.</p>
<sec id="section1-0898010112455947">
<title>Background</title>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898010112455947">NLN (2010)</xref> posits that the seven core values of nursing are caring, diversity, ethics, excellence, holism, integrity, and patient-centeredness. As a core value, caring is defined as promoting health, healing, and hope in self and others. The NLN further posits that graduates’ ability to demonstrate self-care, self-awareness, and self-growth are essential ethical responsibilities ultimately required to provide relationship-centered care.</p>
<p>Self-care is an essential concept in nursing that predicates many patient care interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898010112455947">Richard &amp; Shea, 2011</xref>), but methods used to teach self-care to nursing students too often emphasize theoretical versus practical elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898010112455947">Hensel &amp; Stoelting-Gettelfinger, 2011</xref>). As a result, students and subsequently practicing nurses may fail to apply self-care strategies to their daily lives.</p>
<p>Creative modalities have long been recognized to promote relaxation and healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898010112455947">Lane, 2005</xref>). As such, art may be used as a form of self-care that facilitates the expression of thoughts and feelings through various media. The therapeutic use of art helps the unconscious to become known, leading to greater self-awareness, and may serve as an effective coping strategy to manage stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898010112455947">Seaward, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Although there is much literature surrounding the use of art therapy in clinical settings, less is known about its role in nursing education. A literature search of CINAHL and Medline databases using the key terms <italic>art therapy, nursing students</italic>, and <italic>nursing education</italic> yielded five articles specific to nursing education. Four articles described the use of art therapy to help students express their feelings on certain clinical situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898010112455947">Chen &amp; Walsh, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898010112455947">Marshall, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898010112455947">Proctor, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0898010112455947">Schreiner, Pimple, &amp; Bordonaro, 2009</xref>), and one was specific to teaching stress management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0898010112455947">Walsh, Chang, Schmidt, &amp; Yoepp, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Prior to engaging in a mental health clinical course, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898010112455947">Proctor (1991)</xref> took students to an art studio and had them paint or draw how they perceived the hospital would be. Though this exercise helped the students express their feelings, the instructor concluded that the most important outcome was to help identify students’ needs. Another instructor used art therapy in a mental health clinical course to achieve the course objectives of developing self-awareness, demonstrating communication skills, and demonstrating accountability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898010112455947">Marshall, 2003</xref>). In this class, participants were assigned to groups of 7 to 10 students, and then each group was given a four-foot round piece of paper and art supplies. The students were instructed that they had an hour and a half to create a <italic>mandala</italic>, that is, a symbolic representation originated by Buddhists and Hindus centuries ago that defined who they were as a group. The assignment was repeated at the end of the semester and was followed by group discussion and a reflective evaluation. The faculty believed that the activity helped introduce Eastern philosophies to the students and afforded the opportunity to evaluate their group processes in action. Faculty concluded that the mandala exercise was a creative teaching strategy to help students assess their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>To prepare nursing students to care for children with life-threatening illnesses, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0898010112455947">Schreiner et al. (2009)</xref> implemented a senior elective on pediatric palliative care. One aspect of this course included expressive art to help students reflect on their responses to course content. Projects included designing inside/outside boxes and creating paper pockets of responses to give to families who had lost a child. Students reported an appreciation for diverse teaching methods. They also believed that the course had a great impact on their professional growth.</p>
<p>To increase Taiwanese nursing students’ interest in caring for older adults, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898010112455947">Chen and Walsh (2009)</xref> evaluated an art therapy intervention. In addition to lecture, students were taught art activities to engage in with elderly patients. At the end of the 8-week clinical rotation, the art therapy group had significantly more positive attitudes toward the senior patients compared with a control group.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0898010112455947">Walsh et al. (2005)</xref> studied the use of a creative arts intervention among junior and senior nursing students enrolled in a research course. Using a quasi-experimental design, the intervention group engaged in four art activities designed to reduce stress over 2 weeks. The findings indicated that the intervention significantly reduced stress and anxiety and improved positive emotions. The researchers speculated that art therapy might prove helpful in a variety of populations.</p>

<title>The Class Design</title>
<p>Sixty sophomore nursing students enrolled in a required health and wellness course participated in an expressive art therapy session. For this in-class activity, each student was given two sheets of legal-sized paper and a choice of drawing materials, primarily crayons. Using ideas for drawings suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898010112455947">Seaward (2010)</xref> as part of holistic stress management instructor training, students were told that they could draw two of the following: (a) an expression of how they felt when they were either angry or afraid; (b) a self-portrait; (c) a line, drawn with their eyes closed that they would then transform into a recognizable shape; (d) a mandala; (e) a dream image; (f) a house or a tree; or (g) anything else they felt like drawing. Students were also instructed that, if they wanted a color for their drawing they did not have, they were to borrow it from another student instead of settling for what they had in their color mix. They were given 30 minutes to draw. After 30 minutes, students met in small groups to discuss their drawings. A guide to interpreting colors was posted after the drawings were completed. Following the small group discussion, a larger classroom discussion revealed that the activity was a positive experience. Six students volunteered to share their impressions beyond the classroom, two of whom also offered to share their drawings. Here are their stories.</p>

<title>Students’ Stories</title>

<title>The Calming Effect</title>
<p>When my professor told me that we were going to be participating in art therapy during class, I was extremely frustrated with her and thought the idea was totally ridiculous. I was not paying thousands of dollars to sit in a classroom and draw pictures for an hour. However, I am an extremely nonconfrontational individual and did not want to cause a problem, so I went ahead and followed her instructions. I started by drawing a self-portrait of my emotions and when I was done I thought to myself, “what a waste of my time . . . how am I supposed to draw an emotion?” Thankfully, we were given two pieces of paper for two different drawings and my second drawing was a much better experience and left me feeling more optimistic and calm.</p>
<p>For my second drawing, I closed my eyes and made swirls on a page. I then took these random lines and turned them into something better (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0898010112455947">Figure 1</xref>). The illustration did not necessarily have to be something beautiful or even something real for me to appreciate the activity. Since I am a terrible artist that is what I enjoyed most. For some reason this activity seemed to calm my nerves, and I still do not understand why. What I do understand is that when I become exceedingly stressed from nursing school, I can calm myself by doing another one of these drawings. It is 10 or 15 minutes out of my day that helps save me hours. Instead of sitting at my desk overwhelmed by everything I have to complete, I can calmly approach one assignment at a time.</p>

<title>Self-Expression</title>
<p>I was not the least bit hesitant to participate in the art therapy activity in class. I would not consider myself artistic, and I expected that whatever I created would reflect my lack of talent at drawing. I was open-minded to trying this technique as a coping mechanism but was very skeptical of the outcome. The method that I decided to try required me to close my eyes and draw a line on a piece of paper and then, on opening my eyes, create a picture from that line. At first I could not find any way that I would make a picture from the line that I drew, but I just started to draw and eventually ended up with a shoe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0898010112455947">Figure 2</xref>). I was surprised that I was capable of creating a shoe and even more so when I evaluated the color scheme. I had used orange and red around the shoe, and these represented passion and life change. Prior to this activity I had just began training for a half marathon and running four times a week. The shoe was a mix of black, purple, and blue. These colors represented personal empowerment, spiritual nature, and happiness. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the activity and was pleased with my resulting picture. I found the task to be relaxing and it allowed me to express myself in a positive manner while having fun.</p>

<title>Emotional Release</title>
<p>Of all the alternative therapies we were learning I was most receptive and open to art therapy because under the name of “art therapy” I was coloring in a college nursing course and I enjoyed every minute of it. This exercise came at an opportune moment because not only was I undergoing the usual stress and demands of nursing school but I was also in conflict with my roommate. For the exercise, I chose the method in which I drew a line, turned the paper until I saw “something,” and then drew my emotions. The result was a semblance of an orange and yellow tooth being pulled out of its root, colored in brown, by a yellow instrument. The empty space was filled with reds, yellows, oranges, and some blues. As for the interpretation, I am the tooth. That is, I find it difficult to express my emotions in a coherent way. The yellow instrument pulling the tooth out symbolizes one of my friends who is encouraging me to express the feelings in any manner. However, the tooth’s roots remain connected to the base, which represents my hesitance. As a whole, this was an indication of my feelings concerning the problem with my roommate. Ultimately, I was able to identify as well as release my frustrations and discontentment without saying a word.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0898010112455947">
<title>Value Clarification</title>
<p>Learning about art therapy and performing the exercises was a release from the everyday crazy lifestyle we get wrapped up in. I took on the exercise of drawing a mandala. The mandala I drew was in the shape of a shield divided up into four quadrants depicting important themes in my life. The four quadrants consisted of my family, which showed how my parents and six siblings have each shaped my life, the power of prayer and religion, the significance of education, and the beauty of running through nature. This exercise reiterated what I hold of most importance in my life. The assignment gave me the time to stop and reflect on my life to see where I need to focus my attention and energy. It helped me realize that it’s the little things in life that mean the most. Overall, I thought the exercise to be very beneficial and pleasurable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0898010112455947">
<title>Increasing Self-Awareness</title>
<p>“Art therapy, this is pointless. How can drawing and coloring help me deal with the stress in my life? But, I guess it is better than being lectured at, so I will give it a try.” These were some of the thoughts going through my head as my teacher explained that we would be doing an in-class art therapy exercise. I skeptically grabbed my crayons and chose to draw a self-portrait of myself. I am not an artist by any stretch of the imagination, but when my crayon hit the paper, I seemed to let go of all my inhibitions. To my surprise I wasn’t consciously thinking about what I was putting down on the paper. I was creating an image of truth, my truth. As I finished my drawing, I put down my crayon and looked down at my self-portrait. It was four different people all coming together to shape who I am. The various roles of my life are so diverse, yet integrated in a unique way. Through art therapy I became aware of my inner feelings about my life. I am so busy in life and I have never really stopped to think about how I feel about myself. My life is filled with a constant need to achieve certain expectations and it was calming to draw with none of these expectations on me. I ended up really enjoying this exercise and want to do more of the art therapy exercises that my teacher presented in class. I encourage everyone to take a moment and explore who they are through art therapy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0898010112455947">
<title>Peace of Mind</title>
<p>There could not be a more closed-minded person than myself when it comes to mental techniques for healing. I honestly thought it was a pseudoscience to create jobs in our challenged economy before I took a stress management class. This class is obviously required by the university or I would not have originally thought twice about taking it. I actually have a lot of family and academic stress stimuli going on, but my faith in stress therapy was nonexistent before that class. As an in-class exercise for expressive art therapy, I drew a tree. I chose a tree because it was quick and simple and I was sure I could get away with the least amount of effort. After I drew my simple tree, I had some time left over so I drew on some vines and put a garden scene in the background. I also put a halo of bright yellow behind my tree. I thought, for trying to do the least, I had outdone myself. The class moved in groups shortly after that to discuss what our drawings meant. I studied my tree and looked at it upside down and realized that since I impulsively added veins, the tree looked like the embroidery of the wedding dress I am shopping for. I also feel that the bright yellow halo is my spiritual struggle I am experiencing. And the garden scene I drew had five purple flowers, the number of children I plan to have after I am married. I have decided to hold on to my picture because of the peace of mind it gave me. I am constantly stressed about getting my future plans together and my drawing shows it. I am currently more open-minded about such activities and will not deny the emotional healing qualities they provided for me.</p>

<sec id="section10-0898010112455947">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Despite the initial reluctance of three participants, the students’ stories revealed themes of relaxation, empowerment, value clarification, and increased self-awareness. However, these stories only partially represented the group’s experience. There was lightness in the room while students drew that included laughter. During the group share time, discussions were rich. The mood in the room following the art therapy session was notably relaxed, something all too rare in nursing education lecture courses. The greater group conversation revealed that most students found the experience enjoyable and enlightening. In the weeks to come several students, whose stories are not told here, approached the instructor to share something that they had learned through the art therapy experience.</p>
<p>During the greater group discussion most students shared positive impressions, but a few students expressed feelings of pressure. One student expressed feeling pressure to draw. Another said that she would have enjoyed the experience more if she did not have to engage in the small group discussion regarding her work. Given that feedback, a suggestion for revision would be to allow any student, who did not want to discuss his or her drawing, to simply pass during the group share time.</p>
<p>The outcomes suggest that the integration of art therapy into nursing courses may fulfill many curricular needs. Ethical comportment includes understanding what constitutes good and bad practice and developing the moral resources to deal with large-scale and everyday ethical issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898010112455947">Benner et al., 2010</xref>). As previously discussed, developing self-care, self-growth, and self-awareness of personal strengths, weakness, biases, and values is part of learning ethical comportment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898010112455947">NLN, 2010</xref>). The NLN posits that awareness and internalization of ethical values is necessary for professional identity formation, an important outcome of all nursing programs from practical to research doctorate.</p>
<p>Stress management is part of self-care, and self-care is a prerequisite for the practice of nursing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0898010112455947">AACN, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898010112455947">AHNA, 2007</xref>). Self-care and reflection help increase the nurse’s awareness of the self, others, and the healing process (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ahna.org/AboutUs/WhatisHolisticNursing/tabid/1165/Default.aspx">http://www.ahna.org/AboutUs/WhatisHolisticNursing/tabid/1165/Default.aspx</ext-link>). Thus, learning self-care is important for professional growth.</p>
<p>This intervention also promoted spiritual growth, another aspect of self-care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898010112455947">Pender et al., 2006</xref>). Spiritual growth is enhanced as individuals identify, clarify, and act within their personal value systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898010112455947">Seaward, 2009</xref>). The student stories reflected spiritual growth through personal value clarification. This was exemplified by the student who reflected on creating an “image of truth.” Spiritual growth contributes to a nurse’s health and well-being and is associated with increased perceptions of professional adequacy and a stronger professional identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898010112455947">Hensel, 2011</xref>)</p>
<p>This article was designed to describe how an expressive art therapy was used as a teaching intervention. Students shared their feedback to help evaluate the experience, but this was not a research study with rigorous controls. Too often nurse educators feel the need to cover content in their lecture courses, but traditional lecture format does not support value formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898010112455947">Benner et al., 2010</xref>). The outcomes of this teaching intervention suggest that art therapy can successfully be used to teach attitudes consistent with professional values including self-care. Studying the best practices surrounding the use of expressive art therapy in nursing education and its long-term effects offers a direction for future research.</p>
