<abstract>
<p>Four-hundred-and-eighty children in the age groups of four and six years, 240 each from Brazil and Norway, were asked how their feelings of anger, sadness and fear were reduced in a recollected episode, to propose emotion regulation strategies for protagonists and to envisage the result of regulation strategies. A majority of even the youngest children could propose a strategy. <italic>Play, Social interaction, Entertainment</italic> and <italic>Situation change</italic> were the most frequent strategy types, and the Brazilians showed a higher frequency of <italic>Entertainment</italic> and <italic>Play</italic>, a lower frequency of <italic>Situation change</italic>, and proposed more frequent help from others than the Norwegians. The results also showed that strategies were related to emotion type. <italic>Play</italic> was, for instance, more frequently proposed as a strategy mainly to reduce anger and sadness, and motoric activities were proposed to reduce anger more frequently than sadness and fear. Children’s goals for emotion regulation were good feelings, a quiet environment, play and forgetting negative emotions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The regulation of emotions is a key part of people’s lives the world over. The manner in which negative emotions such as sadness and fear are endured, and positive emotions such as interest and happiness are enjoyed, resonates in their physical and psychological health, as well as in their self-conceptions and the meaning of their lives. Indications are that regulation is an intrinsic goal of children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476718X12456981">Bridges and Grolnick, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476718X12456981">Kopp, 1989</xref>), that it is part of their temperamental dispositions in terms of attentional and behavioural control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1476718X12456981">Derryberry and Rothbart, 1988</xref>), and that it is shown as early as shortly after birth as avoidance responses to painful stimulation such as head turning and hand-to-mouth movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1476718X12456981">Rothbart et al., 1992</xref>). Thompson’s definition of emotion regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476718X12456981">1994</xref>: 27–28) as ‘processes responsible for monitoring, evaluating, and modifying emotional reactions’ is widely accepted and includes attempts to increase and decrease emotional responses.</p>
<p>Although equipped with basic regulation at birth, children need a lengthy development in close interaction with caregivers in order to attain some mastery of emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476718X12456981">Sroufe, 1996</xref>). The present study is related to the part of this development when children begin to verbalize strategies to regulate their emotions. Findings have indicated that three- and four-year-olds’ proposals for how to stop being angry or sad include such strategies as <italic>Play with someone, Go to mother, Go to my room</italic>, and <italic>Don’t think about it</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476718X12456981">Dias et al., 2000</xref>). This is an age with rapid growth in emotional understanding, as is shown, for example, in children’s ability to identify emotions from drawings and pictures of peoples’ faces and the insight that emotions are different in terms of their causes and consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476718X12456981">Cutting and Dunn, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1476718X12456981">Pons et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, indications that standards and values are internalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476718X12456981">Sroufe, 1996</xref>), that knowledge of how things are done is integrated with how one should act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1476718X12456981">Lagatutta and Thompson, 2007</xref>) and that regulation strategies are related to problem-solving behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476718X12456981">Cole et al., 2009</xref>) mean that children’s proposals are not ‘just verbal’, but integrated parts of their general adaptation. Strategies may, for instance, be used by a child as instructions for their emotional management. This simplifies and stabilizes the child’s adaptation because instructions lead to a finite set of responses in a wide variety of situations. Help in establishing regulation strategies may, thus, assist children in their emotional development toward becoming responsible, self-confident and socially generous people.</p>
<p>While much assistance can be and is offered on an intuitive basis from the knowledge of the individual child, additional research is needed to understand how children’s emotion regulation can be supported. Some evidence is provided by recent studies that have suggested that three- to four-year-old children can recognize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476718X12456981">Cole et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1476718X12456981">Dennis and Kelemen, 2009</xref>) and verbalize regulation strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476718X12456981">Dias et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1476718X12456981">Endrerud and Vikan, 2007</xref>), and that number of recognized strategies is related to behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476718X12456981">Cole et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, soothing and reassurance of emotional outbursts at this age may be combined with instructions about how the child might contribute to their own regulation by, for example, slowing down their respiration, thinking about a positive event and/or engaging in an activity.</p>
<p>Other research in the area has shown that age changes in emotion regulation are surprisingly small for the age range of four to nine years and that strategies may show variation related to the type of emotion. The somewhat contradictory evidence for emotion variation is that children may propose similar strategies for anger and sadness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476718X12456981">Dias et al., 2000</xref>), but not for fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1476718X12456981">Endrerud and Vikan, 2007</xref>), and similar strategies for sadness and fear, but not for anger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1476718X12456981">Dennis and Kelemen, 2009</xref>). The present study included tests for children’s proposed strategies for regulating anger, sadness and fear both to compare the results to findings from previous studies and because these emotions are associated with most problems in children.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the usefulness of prior research is limited by several problems. A main problem is that children’s knowledge of regulation strategies has been tested in relation to a protagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476718X12456981">Dias et al., 2000</xref>), a puppet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476718X12456981">Cole et al., 2009</xref>) or toy animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1476718X12456981">Dennis and Kelemen, 2009</xref>). This may facilitate responses, but may also lead to refusals and guesses because children conceive these artificial figures as different from themselves. A check on this was included in the present study through interviews about children’s regulation of emotions in self-experienced emotional episodes. Another problem is that all the previous studies tested children for their knowledge of strategies of how to stop an emotion. Preschool children seem to know the meaning of ‘stop’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1476718X12456981">Denham, 1997</xref>), but a total stop of emotions may not refer to a common emotional experience. The adjustment in this study was simply to ask for proposals to ‘reduce’ rather than ‘stop’ emotions.</p>
<p>A third problem in prior research is that all testing has been directed at how a protagonist might regulate her/his emotion singlehandedly. This might distract the child from reporting on how emotions can be regulated in social interaction, and is a theme that relates to a question of how children in day care or preschool groups can be stimulated to mutual regulation. The present study simply included direct questions about help from others in relation to their self-experienced episodes and to standardized protagonist episodes. A fourth problem is that prior research generally has included rather small samples. This was remedied by a four- to fivefold increase of previous levels in the sample size of the present study.</p>
<p>The present study included two additional tests of variation related to children’s emotion regulation. The first was a follow-up question about why children thought a particular strategy could lead to a reduction in emotions. This is a rather simple question, but it relates to children’s motivational orientation as hedonistic or instrumental by testing whether regulation is directed at, respectively, a pleasurable state or obtaining an advantage or reward. The authors have not been able to find any studies on children’s orientation in this respect, but the self-serving biases of young children as pointed out in classic work on perspective-taking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476718X12456981">Piaget and Inhelder, 1956</xref>) and moral judgment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1476718X12456981">Damon, 1979</xref>) led to the expectation that the children in the present study would mainly show a hedonistic orientation in emotion regulation.</p>
<p>A final test in the present study was a cross-cultural comparison of regulation strategies in Brazilian and Norwegian children. Samples from these countries have been shown to comprise, respectively, a collectivistic interdependent and an individualistic independent orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1476718X12456981">Biaggio et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1476718X12456981">Hofstede, 1991</xref>) to their focused group. Indications of corresponding differences among eight- to 13-year-olds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1476718X12456981">Vikan and Dias, 1996</xref>) and four- to six-year-old children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476718X12456981">Dias et al., 2000</xref>) that show that Brazilians use less frequent cognitive and more frequent social strategies than the Norwegians also served as an expectation of results for both self-experienced and protagonist episodes in the present study.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-1476718X12456981">
<title>Design</title>
<p>The study was conducted as a semi-structured interview with 11 questions asked in a fixed sequence. The dependent variables were emotion regulation strategies and regulation goal (motivational orientation), and were measured in terms of scoring categories for responses to questions, respectively, about how anger, sadness or fear could be reduced, and about the results of the proposed regulation. Independent variables were emotion type (anger, sadness, or fear), cultural background (Brazilian collectivistic or Norwegian individualistic), gender and age of participants (four- and six-year-olds). The interview questions are provided in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1476718X12456981">Appendix</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1476718X12456981">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The participants were 480 children, 240 each in two gender-balanced age groups from Brazil and Norway. Mean age was 4.0 years (SD = 4.2 months) for the youngest, and 5.11 years (SD = 3.9 months) for the oldest age group, with mean ages for Brazilians and Norwegians, respectively, of 48.0 (SD = 4.1 months) and 48.1 (SD = 4.3 months) for the youngest, and 5.11 (SD = 3.8 months) and 5.11 (SD = 4.1 months) for the oldest age group. The participants attended day-care centres and schools in middle-class neighbourhoods in Recife, Brazil and Trondheim, Norway. Separate age groups were established by the selection of participants who were four or six years +/- six months at the date of the interview. In addition to the subjects’ willingness to participate, selection depended on written consent from parents who were informed by letter about the procedure, type, and subject of the interviews, the name and affiliation of the responsible researcher, and an email address and a telephone number if further information was needed. Selection of day-care centres and schools was pragmatically related to access by car, and by consent of and co-operation from the participants’ day-care and school teachers. The teachers were informed about the subject of the interviews, and were instructed to distract a child from participation if the child seemed sceptical and/or negative, or if they felt that the interview would be too difficult, or would provide an emotional disturbance to the child.</p>
<p>A drop-out percentage is not noted as this was very infrequent. A small number of children who wanted to take part were drop-outs because they were obviously not able to understand the procedure and/or were not able to identify emotions (see the procedure section). These children were led to believe that they did take part in the interview by being asked a few questions they were able to answer, such as their names and favourite toys, but they were not included in any sample.</p>
<p>The participants were interviewed on one emotion each (<italic>n</italic> = 80). Note that <italic>n</italic> = 480 for the whole sample, <italic>n</italic> = 240 for cultural background, gender and age-level samples, and <italic>n</italic> = 160 for responses to an individual emotion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1476718X12456981">
<title>Materials and protagonist episodes</title>
<p>Materials for the study were schematic drawings on an A4 sheet of paper of a child protagonist’s faces with a happy, angry, sad or frightened expression, and drawings on A4 sheets of a child protagonist with an angry, sad or frightened expression in a situation which corresponded to the emotional expressions. The situations depicted a protagonist who 1) was told to leave a football game, for anger, 2) broke a favourite toy, for sadness, and 3) was being the subject of aggression from two dogs, for fear. The dogs were drawn as seen from the flank, and as growling toward the door of a car or a house where a protagonist was shown in the window.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1476718X12456981">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The participants were interviewed individually in their day-care centre or school by five native psychology student interviewers in each country. The interviewers were in their fourth or fifth year of study, and were presented to the group of children by the children’s teachers before the interview. The interviewers started the procedure by showing drawings of faces and inviting the participants to point to the emotion that had been selected for that particular interview. This procedure has shown parallel responses in Brazilian and Norwegian children in previous interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476718X12456981">Dias et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1476718X12456981">Vikan and Dias, 1996</xref>); for example, only four participants, two Brazilians and two Norwegians, incorrectly identified emotions in the present interview. Specific adjustments in the procedure were not needed because the words for the three main emotions have similar meanings in Portuguese and Norwegian.</p>
<p>The ordinary interviews began with the experimenter telling the participants that all children had felt the selected emotion at one time or another and then asking, ‘Could you tell me about one time that you felt this emotion?’ Then the participants’ responses were followed with questions about how they felt, how long it took before the emotion was reduced and what they themselves, other people or other events contributed to reducing the emotion (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1476718X12456981">Appendix</xref>). The participants were asked about the reason for their emotion if the cause of their reaction was not implied in their first response.</p>
<p>The self-experience part of the interview was followed by a test for children’s knowledge of a protagonist’s emotion regulation. The interviewers introduced the test by showing and describing the drawing of a same-sex protagonist who represented the emotion in the self-experience episode and asking how the protagonist could be less angry, sad or frightened. This was followed up with the result questions about why the protagonist was less angry, sad or frightened after the regulation. Subsequent questions were if the protagonist’s emotion could be reduced by other means (strategies), and if the protagonist, other people or an event could help reduce the emotion.</p>
<p>It can be assumed that questions about negative emotions might provide some stress for small children. Teachers were asked to report on examples of this both in previous studies and the current research, but no report was registered in any of the studies. The reason for this may be that children’s emotional reactions depend on the context, especially regarding significant people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476718X12456981">Sroufe, 1996</xref>). The context for the interview, illustrations and questions about emotions in the present study was probably shown as a relaxed confidence both by the children’s teachers and the student interviewers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1476718X12456981">
<title>Recording</title>
<p>Responses were recorded verbatim in the interview sheet.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1476718X12456981">
<title>Scoring</title>
<p>The participants were assigned a score for their recall of episodes as spontaneous, delayed, or dependent on an exemplification of a typical cause of an emotion (e.g. ‘have you experienced being frightened by the dark or a dog. . .’). The question about the time it took to reduce an emotion was employed as an indication of whether children associate emotional processes with different time frames, that is, with differences in duration; therefore, responses were scored by reference to subjective representations of time as <italic>Immediately, After a short time</italic> or <italic>After a long time.</italic></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1476718X12456981">
<title>Scoring categories</title>
<p>Scoring categories were established empirically, that is, by first registering similar responses that were later merged into more comprehensive categories according to criteria suggested by the response types. This resulted in eight categories for both types of responses. Reliability tests for scoring half the responses for each emotion from the Brazilian and Norwegian samples showed a mean agreement of 90.1 percent (range 87.3% to 92.2%) for two independent scorers.</p>

<title>Causes of emotions</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1476718X12456981">Table 1</xref> shows the causes of emotions cited for the self-experienced episodes. The 29.2 percent of missing responses was mainly due to <italic>No response</italic> (11.9%), <italic>No cause</italic> (4.0%), <italic>No emotion</italic> (2.1%), and <italic>Other</italic> (7.1) (<italic>n</italic> = 480). Frequencies below five were too low for testing. The <italic>Conflict</italic> category comprised approximately equal frequencies for quarrelling and pestering/teasing.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1476718X12456981">Table 1</xref> may suggest that children may be either angry or sad (or perhaps both) for the same interpersonal events. <italic>Conflicts</italic>, which were more frequent for anger, resulted in anger because ‘My mother wanted me to bath in cold water and I wanted warm’, and in sadness because ‘My mother quarrelled with me.’ <italic>Physical aggression</italic> was a cause of anger because ‘My sister hit me’, and a cause of sadness because ‘Felipe poked me.’ <italic>Prohibitions</italic> stimulated anger because ‘I was not allowed to play outside after six o’clock’, and sadness because ‘I was not allowed to look at the telly.’ <italic>Rejection/devaluation</italic> such as: ‘Joao Marcelo called me an imbecile’ and ‘My sister didn’t want to play with me’ related somewhat more frequently to anger than to sadness, while <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1476718X12456981">Table 1</xref> shows that <italic>Being robbed</italic> was more clearly a cause of anger, and <italic>Accidents/falling</italic> almost exclusively caused sadness.</p>
<p>The emotional ambiguity implied in these causes may be examples that children may be helped to clarify, and stimulated to understand and tolerate both their own and other people’s responses by recalling and discussing their emotional reactions. The percentages shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1476718X12456981">Table 1</xref> may suggest that fear provides less rich material by being straightforwardly related to environmental (darkness, animals and insects, film/video) rather than interpersonal causes. Also, fear was almost unique in being related to an intrapersonal cause (dreams).</p>
<p>The only notable difference related to age in these responses was a decrease in fear of animals and insects from 63.9 percent (<italic>n</italic> = 47) in four-year olds to 35.4 (<italic>n</italic> = 48) in six-year-olds. There were two differences related to country, which both seemed to refer to environmental rather than culture characteristics. Brazilians, with their near tropical environment, showed a much higher frequency of fear of animals and insects (58.0%, <italic>n</italic> = 69) than Norwegians (26.9%, <italic>n</italic> = 26), whereas Norwegians, from a part of the country where the surface is unpredictable because of snow and ice six months of the year, showed more frequent sadness because of accidents and falling as causes of sadness (frequencies were, respectively, 42.1%, <italic>n</italic> = 57, and 12.3%, <italic>n</italic> = 65).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1476718X12456981">
<title>Strategies to reduce self-experienced emotions</title>
<p>The results indicated that recall was spontaneous for two-thirds of all participants, that anger was recalled as being reduced somewhat more slowly than sadness and fear, and recalled spontaneously by 68.8 percent of participants, as compared to 59.4 percent for sadness, and 52.5 percent for fear (<italic>n</italic> = 160).</p>
<p>An overview of emotion regulation responses is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1476718X12456981">Table 2</xref>. The high percentages for participants’ refusals to do something and system missing responses means that percentage strategy responses were 45.6 percent for anger, 33.1 percent for sadness and 34.3 percent for fear (<italic>n</italic> = 160). While this may seem low, it must be considered in relation to the challenges represented by this question. The participants were asked to recollect their own behaviour (regulation strategy) in episodes that were not stored for later recall. These are formidable challenges for small children. Participants generally mentioned only one strategy, but two strategies were mentioned by 13 participants.</p>
<p>The results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1476718X12456981">Table 2</xref> suggest that children needed the comfort and nearness of others by using <italic>Social</italic> strategies (being near and/or talking to others) to a greater extent for fear than for anger and sadness, while <italic>Play</italic> (with dolls, football, or video games) was the main strategy for the latter emotions. The reasons for these differences may be that fear stimulates a need for protection and activates a tension that does not function well in play, while the main point for reducing anger and sadness is to distract oneself from negative emotions by playing.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1476718X12456981">Table 2</xref> shows other indications that strategies related to emotion type were the comparatively high percentages for using <italic>Eat-drinking-motor</italic> strategies to reduce anger (mainly because of frequent references to motor activities such as bicycling and swimming), and <italic>Cognition, Avoidance</italic> and <italic>Emotion work</italic> to reduce fear. The culture difference in the distribution of these strategies was more frequent proposals of <italic>Entertainment</italic> strategies (mostly by looking at videos) from Brazilians (16.0%) than Norwegians (3.8%) (<italic>n</italic> = 240).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1476718X12456981">
<title>Help from others</title>
<p>The strategies in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1476718X12456981">Table 2</xref> are not examples of participants’ independent efforts to regulate their emotions. On the contrary, 82.2 percent (<italic>n</italic> = 73) of those who recalled strategies for anger, 83.0 percent (<italic>n</italic> = 53) who recalled strategies for sadness, and 89.0 percent who recalled strategies for fear responded that they had help from others in reducing their emotions. Help was proposed more often by Brazilians (41.7%) than Norwegians (22.5%), and more often by girls (36.3%) than boys (27.9%) (<italic>n</italic> = 240).</p>
<p>Helpers were most often parents (63.6%), followed by friends (11.7%), others in the family (9.1%) and other persons (7.8%) (<italic>n</italic> = 154). Friends as helpers increased and help from parents decreased in frequency from four to six years of age. Furthermore, friends as helpers were more frequent for anger and sadness than for fear, and were used more by Norwegians than Brazilians. Brazilians, on the other hand, referred more frequently than Norwegians to help from family members.</p>
<p>The question about events that might be helpful resulted in only 5.4 percent responses (<italic>n</italic> = 480) that were not repetitions of the question about help from others.</p>

<sec id="section17-1476718X12456981">
<title>Strategies to reduce protagonists’ emotions</title>
<p>The responses to the test for protagonists’ strategies to reduce emotions are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1476718X12456981">Table 3</xref>. ‘Don’t know’ was the most frequent system missing response to anger (61.9%) and sadness (63.6%), but only for 21.8 percent of responses for fear, which had ‘Redefining the episode’ (52.7%) as a dominant system missing response.</p>
<p>The main differences between the emotion regulation responses in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1476718X12456981">Table 2</xref> (self-experienced episodes) and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1476718X12456981">Table 3</xref> (protagonist episodes) were a higher response frequency and a higher frequency of situation change responses in the latter. The former was probably due to protagonists’ episodes being directly accessible and not dependent on participants’ memory, while the much higher frequency of <italic>Change situation</italic> strategies may be related to protagonists’ episodes as comprising situational hindrances or disturbances (a broken toy, an angry dog and a prohibitive parent), whereas the causes of emotions in the self-experienced episodes were mostly interpersonal (anger and sadness) or environmental (fear). It should be noted that 68.2 percent (<italic>n</italic> = 114) of children between 37 and 48 months of age (<italic>M</italic> = 3.9 years, SD = 2.5 months) proposed a regulation strategy.</p>
<p>The parallels between the frequencies in responses to the two types of episodes may, except for these main differences, be described as salient. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1476718X12456981">Table 3</xref> shows, specifically, the comparatively low frequency of <italic>Play</italic> as a strategy for fear, a high <italic>Eat-drink-motor</italic> frequency for anger, and a high frequency for <italic>Cognition</italic> as a strategy for fear reduction. The three high-level strategies of <italic>Social, Play</italic> and <italic>Entertainment</italic> were also the same for self-experienced and protagonist episodes. These parallels suggest that there are structural differences between these emotions, especially between anger and sadness on the one hand and fear on the other.</p>
<p>Three differences related to culture were a higher frequency of Brazilian proposals of <italic>Play</italic> (26.0%) and <italic>Entertainment</italic> (17.7%) than Norwegians (9.5% for both), and a lower frequency of <italic>Change</italic> (29.2%, compared to Norwegians 52.4%).</p>

<sec id="section18-1476718X12456981">
<title>Additional strategies</title>
<p>A total of 40.9 percent of the participants proposed an additional regulation strategy for the protagonist. The distribution of responses was similar to the distribution in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1476718X12456981">Table 3</xref>.</p>
<p>The follow-up question on the protagonist’s ability to reduce her/his emotions resulted in 38.0 percent confirming responses (<italic>n</italic> = 480), which were more frequent for anger (60.0%) than for sadness (28.9%) and fear (30.6%) (<italic>n</italic> = 160).

Help was proposed more often for anger and sadness than for fear, more often by Brazilians (41.7%) than Norwegians (22.5%), and more often by girls (36.3%) than boys (27.9%) (<italic>n</italic> = 240), and referred more often to parents (40.6%) than to friends (11.6%).

<title>Goals of emotion regulation</title>
<p>Responses related to goals of emotion regulation are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1476718X12456981">Table 4</xref>. More than 83.2 percent (<italic>n</italic> = 339) of participants who proposed a regulation strategy could describe a goal for the strategy. This was mostly as short responses such as the following examples for the four most frequent goals shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1476718X12456981">Table 4</xref>.</p>
<list id="list3-1476718X12456981" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Good feeling</italic>: ‘Because it is good’, ‘because it gives good feelings’.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Cognition</italic>: ‘Because then he/she will sleep and forget’, ‘because he/she will not think about it’.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Change of situation</italic>: ‘Then he/she will not be teased any more’, ‘he/she will be a long way from the others’.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Play</italic>: ‘Then he/she can play again’, ‘he/she will have more time for playing’.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Each of these most frequent types of responses was associated with the reduction in one or two specific emotions. <italic>Good feeling</italic> was associated with reduction in anger, <italic>Cognition</italic> with reduction in anger and fear, <italic>Changed situation</italic> with reductions in sadness and fear, and <italic>Play</italic> with reductions in anger and sadness. The association of <italic>Agreement with parents</italic> with sadness might be an effect of the episode where the protagonist conflicted with parents.</p>
<p>Two variations in response frequencies were related to age. <italic>Good feeling</italic> decreased from 45.5 percent in four-year olds to 32.3 percent in six-year-olds, and <italic>Cognition</italic> increased from 6.2 percent to 14.3 percent in this age range. Indications of cultural differences were higher frequencies for <italic>Cognition</italic> (15.4%) and <italic>Play</italic> (13.7%), and lower for <italic>Good Feeling</italic> (17.9%) in Brazilians (<italic>n</italic> = 182) compared to the corresponding Norwegian (<italic>n</italic> = 192) frequencies of 5.7 percent, 3.6 percent and 52.6 percent. All but one <italic>Agreement with parents</italic> responses were from Brazilians. Cross-tabulations of responses to questions about regulation strategies and results did not show systematic relations for self-experienced or protagonist episodes.</p>

Less frequent proposals from the participants in the study were to reduce an emotion by thinking about something else (C<italic>ognition</italic>), eat, drink or engage in motoric activity (<italic>Eat-drink-motoric strategy</italic>), run away from a problem encounter (<italic>Avoidance</italic>) and trying to be calm and/or to stop an emotion (<italic>Emotion work strategy</italic>).</p>
<p>Other findings were that regulation strategies showed little variation in the four- to six-year age range, that variation in strategy frequencies was related to the type of emotion, and that variation in regulation was related to cultural characteristics. An assumption that emotion regulation in young children should not be considered as a lone and independent project was supported by responses from a majority of participants signalling that they themselves were helped, and that protagonists could profit from help in emotion regulation. In fact, the findings of Rime and co-workers (e. g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1476718X12456981">Rime et al., 2004</xref>) that around 90 percent of adults want to share emotional experiences can suggest that a social dependency in emotion regulation is not a ‘childish’ phase in development.</p>
<p>The results support previous studies that emotion regulation strategies can be verbalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476718X12456981">Dias et al., 2000</xref>) and recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476718X12456981">Cole et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1476718X12456981">Dennis and Kelemen, 2009</xref>) by three- to four-year-old children. Interviews about reducing rather than stopping emotions and about self-experienced and protagonist emotion episodes did not make a difference in strategy types. Furthermore, the self-experienced and protagonist episodes showed the same high-frequency strategies. The exception was a much higher frequency of <italic>Change the situation</italic> strategies in protagonists’ proposals. This might be due to situational illustrations of causes of emotions in this type of approach, while the main causes mentioned for the self-experienced episodes were interpersonal for anger and sadness, and specific environmental (darkness, animals, insects) and intrapersonal (dreams) for fear.</p>
<p>The results mean that pedagogues may use children’s emotional arousal as an opportunity to serve as ‘emotional coaches’ for emotion regulation from as early as the age of three (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1476718X12456981">Gottman et al., 1996</xref>). At times this may be a primary pedagogical aim. A child who comes crying for comfort after being hit back after throwing sand at another child should, for instance, first be calmed and advised how to reduce their emotion before instructing the child about offensive behaviour. A pedagogue should be aware that regulation strategies may relate to emotion type. The present study found, for instance, that <italic>Social</italic> strategies are preferred to <italic>Play</italic> for regulating fear, and vice versa for anger and sadness, that motoric activities are preferred to reduce anger, and that <italic>Avoidance</italic> may be preferred to reduce fear in specific situations.</p>
<p>Other indications of strategies related to emotion type have been noted in studies of children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1476718X12456981">Dennis and Kelemen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476718X12456981">Dias et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1476718X12456981">Diener and Mangelsdorf, 1999</xref>) and adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1476718X12456981">Mikolajczak et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1476718X12456981">Rivers et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1476718X12456981">Vikan et al., 2009</xref>), and support the differential emotions theory that each emotion forms a distinct adaptation structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1476718X12456981">Izard, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1476718X12456981">Izard and Ackerman, 2000</xref>). Pedagogues and parents should accordingly focus their support on specific emotions. Also, regulation is related to the causes of emotions such as avoidance to regulate fear of dogs, snakes and insects. Therefore prevention programs for emotion regulation might follow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1476718X12456981">Izard’s (2002)</xref> recommendations for coping with different types of causes of emotions and regulation strategies by having children make a list of causes of different emotions, strategies to reduce or increase emotion intensity, and the effects of different strategies. Pedagogues and parents must depend on their experience and insights in emotional coaching because there is no clear evidence as yet as to what might be the ‘best’ or most healthy regulation strategies. There are, however, convincing clinical findings that a child’s health is closely related to his or her emotional management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1476718X12456981">Bradley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1476718X12456981">Cole et al., 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Emotional responses are largely universal, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1476718X12456981">Mesquita and Frijda’s (1994)</xref> thorough review. The exception is emotion regulation, as is demonstrated by the contrast between the Utku Eskimo’s nearly total suppression of anger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1476718X12456981">Briggs, 1970</xref>), and the Venezuelan Yanomamo’s constant stimulation and reward of aggressive behaviour in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1476718X12456981">Chagnon, 1997</xref>). Differences in regulation strategies between the Brazilian and Norwegian samples in the present study might be expected, but the specific expectations of differences in frequencies of <italic>Social</italic> and <italic>Cognitive</italic> regulation strategies were not supported.</p>
<p>The two types of differences found can, on the other hand, correspond to Brazilian collectivistic and Norwegian individualistic cultures. First, Brazilian children, as compared to Norwegian children, showed more frequent references to passive and playful strategies such as <italic>Entertainment</italic> and <italic>Play</italic>, and a less frequent reference to <italic>Change the situation</italic> strategies that can refer to collectivist less active, energetic expressions of self. A similar difference was found in a study of students from the two countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1476718X12456981">Vikan et al., 2009</xref>). Second, the Brazilians showed more frequent references than Norwegians to help from others in regulating emotions, especially their family, which is consonant to the collectivism characteristic of relative social dependency, especially regarding in-groups such as the family.</p>
<p>The study included an exploration of children’s concepts of the goals of emotion regulation, and identified seven goals. Approximately one-fourth of the participants supported the expectation of primarily hedonistic orientations in children by describing the goal as <italic>Good feeling</italic>, for example, as feeling pleasure, calmness or liking after having reduced an emotion. However, it may be doubted whether these goals should be conceived as motivational orientations at all since nearly half the regulations were conceived as resulting in a changed situation and there was no correlation between strategies and goals. Therefore, emotion regulation in young children may be steered by short-term, pragmatic concerns rather than general motivational orientations. There may be a difference related to getting rid of an emotion by having the emotion disappear directly or by forgetting (<italic>Emotion disappears</italic> and <italic>Cognition</italic>) and by obtaining some positive alternative by <italic>Play</italic> or <italic>Good</italic> feeling. This can be explored further in conversations with children and may be useful in expanding their emotional consciousness.</p>
<p>It is necessary in closing this discussion that all results must be evaluated against the weaknesses of the study. One key weakness is a standardized method that may not have allowed an optimal presentation of strategies. <italic>Play</italic> as a response might, for instance, be a reference to playing with someone rather than playing with something, in which case the response should be scored as <italic>Social</italic> rather than <italic>Play</italic>. A Piagetan clinical interview or conversations with children might be alternatives, but these are time-consuming methods that require extensive preparation of interviewers and are difficult to employ in order to establish statistically meaningful sample sizes.</p>
<p>A related weakness is that the double problem of establishing too specific or general scoring categories is reflected in the present results. One indication of this is that the present strategies, <italic>Play, Entertainment, Eat-drink-motor</italic> and <italic>Avoidance</italic> were not differentiated in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476718X12456981">Dias et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1476718X12456981">Endrerud and Vikan, 2007</xref>). However, this may result from a much larger sample and a focus on younger children than in previous studies. Another indication is that the <italic>Social</italic> category in the present study included several forms of social contact that might have been differentiated into specific categories.</p>
<p>There is probably no better answer or adjustment to these problems than to hope for further research into children’s efforts to handle their emotional development. A weakness that might be fairly easy to remedy is that the present study was limited to three negative emotions. A priority for further research should be children’s regulation of happiness, interest, shame and guilt, all main agents in their emotional adaption that are basically unexplored in systematic studies.</p>
