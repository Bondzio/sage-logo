<abstract>
<p>This study explored the prevalence of peer physical aggression (PPA) and its association with aggressive beliefs, empathy, self-control, and cooperation skills among 1,719 7th-to-9th-grade students in a rural town in the central China province of Henan. The data were collected by the self-administered questionnaire anonymously. Results showed that 17.9% of the students reported that they had one or more times of physical aggressive behaviors toward their peers in the past 12 months. The reported rate of PPA was significantly higher in boys (24.7%) than in girls (10.7%). After adjusting the factors of gender and grade, result of logistic regression analysis showed that having a higher level of aggressive beliefs was PPA risk factor; a higher level of self-control was protective factor, but there were no significant association between PPA and the factors of empathy and cooperation skills. These results indicated that helping students to decrease their aggressive beliefs and to improve their self-control skill would aid in the prevention of youth violence.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Violence among children and youth is a public health problem that may result in direct physical injury including cuts, bruises, broken bones, lasting disability, and even death. Not all injuries are visible, and violence also can result in psychological problems (e.g., depression, loneliness, anxiety, worry, and suicidal ideation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260512441256">Cheng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512441256">Hazemba, Siziya, Muula, &amp; Rudatsikira, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886260512441256">McMahon, Reulbach, Keeley, Perry, &amp; Arensman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886260512441256">Reijntjes, Kamphuis, Prinzie, &amp; Telch, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512441256">World Health Organization [WHO], 2009</xref>) and negative behaviors (smoking, drinking, and problems with schoolwork; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512441256">Hazemba et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886260512441256">McMahon et al., 2010</xref>). As is well known, students who involved in violence may be aggressor or victim. Thus far, the large majority of researches on school violence among Chinese students have focused on violence victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260512441256">Cheng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512441256">Jing, Wang, Chen, Wu, &amp; Liu, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260512441256">Luo, Sun, Yu, Yan, &amp; Xiong, 2007</xref>); less attention has been paid to aggressive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260512441256">Chi, Chen, &amp; Wang, 2007</xref>), especially on the topic of peer physical aggression (PPA) among rural students in China. In current literature, there were little research exploring the association among PPA and aggressive beliefs, empathy, self-control, and cooperation skills in Chinese students. This study aims to report the prevalence of PPA in adolescent students in a rural town of China and explore the associations between PPA and aggressive beliefs, empathy, self-control, and cooperation skills, and the findings will promote evidence-based prevention of school violence.</p>

<title>Review of Literature</title>
<sec id="section3-0886260512441256">
<title>School Violence and Physical Aggression</title>
<p>Generally, school violence is the exercise of power over others in school-related settings, by some individual, agency, or social process, that denies those subject to it their humanity to make a difference, either by reducing them from becoming what they might be. The type of school violence can be distinguished by their perpetrators’ level within the social structure, for example, Level 1 contains student on student, student on teacher, and student on school; Level 2 contains teacher on students and other similar ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512441256">Henry, 2000</xref>). According to nature of violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260512441256">Krug, Dahlberg, Mercy, Zwi, &amp; Lozano, 2002</xref>), school violence can be physical violence, sexual violence, psychological violence, deprivation, or neglect. In an event of school violence, people may be an aggressor, victim, or aggressive-victim (both aggressor and victim; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260512441256">Gumpel &amp; Sutherland, 2010</xref>). The key to violence prevention is to reduce or prevent violence aggression behavior happen. Among adolescents, physical aggression is the typical manifests for aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260512441256">George &amp; Thomas, 1997</xref>). Involvement in aggression may result in bruises, bones broken, cuts, and so on, and these injuries can increase health care costs, decrease property values, and disrupt social services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260512441256">Krug et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, these injures are visible and easy to recognize, which are different from other types of aggression, such as excluding from the group on purpose or completely ignored. So in this study, peer physical aggression was adopted, and it is only the type of a student who aggresses toward another student physically.</p>

<title>Prevalence of School Violence</title>
<p>Researches on school violence will help people to learn the prevalence of different regions, nations, cities, and communities. The results can improve people’s cognition of school violence and promote evidence-based prevention and intervention efforts. Results from five African countries indicated that 27% to 50% of the children there were involved in physical fights during the past 12 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512441256">Brown et al., 2009</xref>). During the past 12 months, 31.2% to 45.4% of the students in five developed countries were involved in physical fights and 15.8% of them were injured in the fighting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512441256">Smith-Khuri et al., 2004</xref>). A survey among 692 Turkish high school students found 35.5% of the students had been bullied physically at least once during the academic year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260512441256">Kepenekci &amp; Cınkır, 2006</xref>). Lee et al. conducted a survey on adolescent students in Negeri Sembilan, and results showed 27.9% of the students had been involved in physical fight during the past 12 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260512441256">Lee, Chen, Lee, &amp; Kaur, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>There have been some relevant researches about school violence in China. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260512441256">Luo et al. (2007)</xref> reported that 24.3% of middle school students had been aggressed physically by their peers during the past 12 months in Changsha, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260512441256">Chi et al. (2007)</xref> found that 11.9% of middle school students engaged in physical aggression with their peers during the past year in Guangzhou. Though there have been several studies on school violence in some areas of China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260512441256">Cheng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260512441256">Chi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512441256">Jing et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260512441256">Luo et al., 2007</xref>), research into school violence is still rare, especially among the students who are living in rural area. In the process of urbanization, wherein a growing rural population worked in urban areas, many children were left at home lacking attention from their parents and it is necessary to understand the prevalence of school violence among rural students.</p>
<p>In addition, most of the studies published reported the prevalence of violence victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260512441256">Cheng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512441256">Jing et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260512441256">Luo et al., 2007</xref>), whereas few studies showed the prevalence of violence aggression in current literature. If there was less violence aggression, violence victim will decrease, and the main aim of school violence prevention was to reduce the prevalence of violence aggression. Thus, more studies are needed not only on victimization but also on violence aggression. Combined with the characteristics of physical aggression discussed earlier, it is important to study the physical aggression among Chinese students as well.</p>

<title>Aggressive Beliefs, Empathy, Self-Control, Cooperation Skills, and School Violence</title>
<p>In the past several decades, school violence has received a great deal of attention in developmental psychopathology, educational studies, and related organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260512441256">Krug et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260512441256">WHO, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512441256">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886260512441256">Wong, Lok, Lo, &amp; Ma, 2008</xref>). Studies have evidenced that students who endorse higher aggressive belief are more likely to engage in violent behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886260512441256">McConville &amp; Cornell, 2003</xref>). Chaux et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512441256">Chaux, Molano, &amp; Podlesky, 2009</xref>) and Chen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512441256">Chen &amp; Astor, 2010</xref>) also reported that higher level of school bullying was related to higher level of aggressive belief.</p>
<p>Empathy is defined as one’s capacity to feel and understand what another is feeling. Researches indicated higher rate of aggression was related to lower level of empathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512441256">Chaux et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260512441256">LeSure-Lester, 2000</xref>). Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that students who are empathic will be less aggressive toward others than their counterparts with lack of empathy.</p>
<p>A study on middle school students in Taiwan showed that lacking of impulse control was significantly associated with aggressive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512441256">Chen &amp; Astor, 2010</xref>), and Unnever et al. had indicated that higher rate of aggression was related to lower level of self-control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260512441256">Unnever &amp; Cornell, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260512441256">Champion, Vernberg, and Shipman (2003)</xref> had indicated that female victims had fewer means of self-controlled responses to conflict and less cooperative behavior than female nonvictims.</p>
<p>In current literature, among the studies of school violence on Chinese students, more studies examined personal behavior factors with violence including smoking, playing violent computer games, loafing, truancy, and so forth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260512441256">Chi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0886260512441256">Xue et al., 2010</xref>). Fewer studies examined the psychological competence of aggressive beliefs, empathy, self-control, and cooperation skills. Do these psychological factors which influence school violence in Western countries have a similar effect on Chinese students? If the associated result is true, school violence will decrease by reducing students’ aggression beliefs and improving their empathy, self-control, and cooperation skills in China.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section7-0886260512441256">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>Cluster sampling method was used in junior high schools of a rural town, in the central China province of Henan. Two public and two private schools were included in our investigation, and two classes were selected randomly from Grade 7 to Grade 9 separately in each school. All students in the 24 classes selected were expected to participate voluntarily in the survey.</p>
<p>The survey was carried out by class between April and June 2010. Of the 1,907 enrolled students, 1,798 completed the questionnaire, and the response rate was 94.28%. Eventually, 79 questionnaires were excluded from data analysis for the following reasons: not having reported the participant’s gender, not having answered all of the questions about aggression and victimization (in this study, we only used the data on physical aggression), or having missed more than 10% of all the questions in the questionnaire. A total of 1,719 questionnaires remained, accounting for 95.61% of the 1,798 participants.</p>

<title>Questionnaire</title>
<p>The questionnaire was developed based on a literature review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260512441256">Baldry, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260512441256">Dahlberg, Toal, Swahn, &amp; Behrens, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512441256">Ji, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512441256">Mynard &amp; Joseph, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886260512441256">Wong et al., 2008</xref>) and findings from interviews with students and teachers. Items derived from an English version were translated from English into Chinese and back-translated into English, and they were then revised and translated again into Chinese. The questionnaire was also revised after a pilot study among 158 junior high school students. Apart from the demographic questions (i.e., sex, grade, and age), peer physical aggression, aggressive beliefs, empathy, self-control, and cooperation were investigated.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study was designed to explore the prevalence of PPA and its association with aggressive beliefs, empathy, self-control, and cooperation skills among junior high school students in a rural town of China. First, results showed that the prevalence of PPA was 17.9%, higher than that reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260512441256">Chi et al. (2007)</xref>, who found that 11.9% of the 1,064 students aged 11 to 19 years engaged in physical aggression with their peers during the past year in Guangzhou, China; our result was also higher than that reported by Qiao (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260512441256">Qiao et al., 2010</xref>), who indicated that 14.3% of the students from Grades 7 to 12 were involved in physical fights in school during the past 12 months in Beijing, and lower than the average prevalence of physical fights during the past 12 months in 5 developed countries (40.3%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512441256">Smith-Khuri et al., 2004</xref>), 5 African countries (42%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512441256">Brown et al., 2009</xref>), and junior high school students in cities of China (32.6%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512441256">Ji, 2007</xref>). The difference may be due to the difference in the operational definitions of physical aggression, numbers of the items, and different areas. Nevertheless, the prevalence of physical violence was between 12% and 32.6%, and approximately 1 in 5 students had peer physical aggressive behavior toward their peers in this study, this is a serious situation and preventive program is urgently needed to be developed in China.</p>
<p>Though this study only provide an area’s PPA data, result add the data of PPA which is less reported among Chinese rural students. Study spot was focused on rural area where a sizeable population of China lived. The findings from this study had an important contribution to understand physical aggression among adolescents, the main problem of school violence in China, and it is also the first step for violence prevention at schools in China. In addition, boys had a higher prevalence than girls, which was similar to the findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260512441256">Chi et al. (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260512441256">Qiao et al. (2010)</xref>. Logistic regression analysis also indicated that being a boy was a risk factor for PPA. The current situation of PPA prevalence and gender association merits public attention.</p>
<p>Second, this study explored the association among PPA and psychological competence of aggressive beliefs, empathy, self-control, and cooperation skills, which expanded influencing factors research for school violence or aggression, in addition to personal behavior factors, such as smoking, playing violent computer games, loafing, truancy, and so forth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260512441256">Chi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0886260512441256">Xue et al., 2010</xref>). These factors provide new evidence for violence prevention.</p>
<p>Among the 1,719 students, students in the PPA group had a higher score for aggressive beliefs compared with the students in the non-PPA group, and the prevalence of PPA increased with increasing scores for aggressive beliefs; the logistic regression indicated that a higher level of aggressive beliefs is a risk factor for PPA. This relationship between PPA and aggressive beliefs was similar to the results reported by Chaux et al. who reported that higher level of school bullying was related to higher level of aggressive belief among students from Grade 5 through Grade 9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512441256">Chaux et al., 2009</xref>). A study from Taiwan also found the association between violence attitude and school violence among students from Grade 7 through Grade 9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512441256">Chen &amp; Astor, 2010</xref>). Aggressive belief is an important factor to school violence; much attention should be paid to help students understand the risk of violence and increase their no-violence beliefs for resolving conflict in the effort to prevent school violence.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260512441256">Unnever and Cornell (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512441256">Chen and Astor (2010)</xref> found that lack of self-control was significantly associated with school violence and that lower level of self-control skill was potential risk factor for bullying. Consistent with this finding, the present study also show higher level of self-control was a protecting factor for PPA in both the single-factor and logistic regression analyses. It is mandatory for students to increase their self-control skills in order to prevent school violence.</p>
<p>Previous studies have indicated that a higher rate of aggression is related to a lower level of empathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512441256">Chaux et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260512441256">Jagers et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260512441256">LeSure-Lester, 2000</xref>); however, Lovett et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260512441256">Lovett &amp; Sheffield, 2007</xref>) reviewed relevant articles and found no relationship between empathy and aggression in children less than 13 years old, but a negative association was found in adolescents aged from 13 to 21 years. In this study, the PPA group had lower empathy score than the non-PPA group, and PPA prevalence decreased as the empathy score increased; however, the logistic regression found no association. Similarly, a relationship was also found between PPA and cooperation in single-factor analysis, but logistic regression analysis did not find an independent effect of cooperation on PPA. Two reasons may explain these results. First, different operational definitions of aggressiveness may result in different conclusions: some studies defined violence as including verbal and physical aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512441256">Chaux et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260512441256">LeSure-Lester, 2000</xref>), whereas physical aggression only was used in this study. Second, the relationship between PPA and empathy and cooperation were also analyzed by logistic regression adjusting for gender and grade. More studies of the relationships between violence and empathy and/or cooperation should be undertaken in the future.</p>
<p>In this study, a higher level of aggressive beliefs and a lower level of self-control were the risk factors for PPA after adjusting for gender and grade. There were also relationships between PPA and empathy or cooperation in single-factor analysis. Decreasing students’ aggressive beliefs and improving their empathy, self-control, and cooperation skills will contribute to PPA prevention. How to achieve this goal is a key issue. We therefore asked two questions: (a) Can aggressive beliefs be changed? Can empathy, self-control, and cooperation be increased? (b) How to reach the change and increase?</p>
<p>First, Aber et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260512441256">Aber, Jones, Brown, Chaudry, &amp; Samples, 1998</xref>) reported that a violence prevention intervention increased students’ self-control and cooperation skills and decreased aggression among the students from second to sixth grade. This result provided the evidence for the possiblility of the first question we asked. Second, life skills education, which can be defined as abilities for adaptive and positive behavior that enable individuals to deal effectively with the demands and challenges of everyday life, as an example of violence prevention by the WHO, has been used to foster anger and stress management, impulse control, coping skills, empathy, and conflict management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260512441256">WHO, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512441256">2009</xref>). Life skills had been widely used in programs for promoting children’ and adolescents’ health all over the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260512441256">Kingsnorth, Healy, &amp; Macarthur, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260512441256">Magnani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260512441256">Wenzel, Weichold, &amp; Silbereisen, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260512441256">Jagers et al. (2007)</xref> adopted communal values orientation, empathy, and violence avoidance efficacy beliefs to determine their mediating effects on the development of youth violent behavior. In China, life skills education has been used for smoking prevention in children and adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0886260512441256">Zhou &amp; Ye, 2001</xref>) and HIV/AIDS prevention in middle school students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260512441256">Liao, Jiang, Yang, Zeng, &amp; Liao, 2010</xref>). Life skills education, as the bridge connecting health knowledge, attitudes, values, and behavior, can be used to help meet this goal. Thus, it is important and feasible to conduct health education based on life skills to help prevent violence in survey area and may be extended.</p>
<sec id="section16-0886260512441256">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Although the results indicated the relationships between PPA and aggressive beliefs, empathy, self-control, and cooperation, only aggressive beliefs and self-control were indicated as PPA risk and protecting factors, respectively. A primary limitation of this study is that cause and effect cannot be determined by its cross-sectional nature, and an experimental study should be conducted to confirm the results of this study.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>PPA is common in junior high school students and was associated with a higher level of aggressive beliefs and lower levels of empathy, self-control, and cooperation in this study. It is expected that these results will raise the public awareness of peer violence and prompt increased attention to school-based life skills education aimed at helping students improve their self-control skill and changing students’ aggressive beliefs in the effort to prevent youth violence.</p>
