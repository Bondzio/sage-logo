<p>Lightbulbs! How many times do you see them? I love seeing them, don’t you? Every time I see a lightbulb appear on a student’s face, I feel affirmed as a music educator and motivated to be an even more effective teacher. And I imagine you have the same experiences.</p>
<p>As general music teachers, we have the incredible opportunity to foster the musical souls of children. We see those lightbulb moments become beacons that guide children through adolescence and into adulthood, living as sensitive, caring, and complete human beings.</p>
<p>You may remember Kathy Jacobi-Karna’s letter from the chair one year ago. She eloquently described our economic situation in education. Here in Wisconsin, I have witnessed the impact of both economic and political decisions that educators face. I offer no solutions to either economic or political realities. What I do offer is collective memory; thousands of us providing our students with those “lightbulb” experiences, empowering the next generation with an understanding of the importance of an inclusive balanced life. Additionally, those of us who are regular readers of <italic>General Music Today</italic> have been provided “lightbulb” experiences by the authors, editorial board, and the members of the Council for General Music Education.</p>
<p>The next time you fly over a large city at night, remember that the massive glow you are witnessing started with just one lightbulb. Each magical moment we experience in our classroom will multiply and develop into a love and understanding of music for years to come.</p>
<p>The Council for General Music Education is served by dedicated and creative music educators across the country. We sincerely thank the following council members who have given freely of their time while serving their term on the Council: Christopher Roberts, Barbara Balch Packales, Martina Miranda, Molly Widolf Lueken, Catherine Pollard, Kimberly Inks, and Joe Eppink. Kathy Jacobi-Karna has masterfully led the Council as Chair for the past 2 years. Her insights and vision during a time of great transition have been essential to the continued strength of this Council and our ability to effectively serve general music educators in the future. Thank you, Kathy! Kathy will continue on the Council as Past-Chair. A final thank you goes to editor Shelly Cooper and the Editorial Board of <italic>General Music Today</italic>. We thank Brent Gault as he finishes his term on the board. Their work has consistently produced a high-quality, forward-thinking journal that guides music educators daily.</p>
<p>I am honored to serve you and our profession as the chair of the NAfME Council for General Music Education. As a public school elementary general music teacher, I welcome working together for a future of strong music programs for every child.</p>
