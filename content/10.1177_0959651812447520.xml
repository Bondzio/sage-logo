<abstract>
<p>The real “golden age” of electronic suspension can be probably located in the 1980s; during that decade the exceptional potential of replacing a traditional spring-damper system with a fully fledged electronically controllable fast-reacting hydraulic actuator was demonstrated. High costs, significant power absorption, bulky and unreliable hydraulic systems, and uncertain management of the safety issues: the fatal attraction for fully active electronic suspensions lasted only a few years. In the second half of the 1990s, a new trend emerged: it became increasingly clear that the best compromise of cost (component cost, weight, electronics and sensors, power consumption, etc.) and performance (comfort, handling, safety) was to be found in the technology of electronically controllable suspensions: the variable-damping suspension or, in brief, the semi-active suspension. After a decade this technology is still highly promising and attractive: it has been introduced in the mass-market production of cars; it is entering the motorcycle market; a lot of special vehicles or niche applications are considering this technology; many new variable-damping technologies are being developed. Semi-active suspensions are expected to play an even more important role in the emerging trend of electric vehicles with in-wheel motors: in such a vehicle architecture the role of suspension damping is more crucial, and semi-active suspensions can significantly contribute to reduce the negative effects of the large unsprung mass. As in many other electronically controlled systems, the actuator is not “smart itself”: it simply inherits the smartness (or dumbness) of its control algorithm designer. The key of semi-active suspensions is in the algorithm. For the discussed reasons, this paper briefly reviews the basic theoretical concepts for variable-damping shock absorber technologies and the available control algorithms.</p>

<title>Overview</title>
<p>A suspension, in its classic conventional configuration consists of the following three main elements.</p>
<list id="list1-0959651812447520" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>An elastic element (typically a coiled spring), which delivers a force proportional and opposite to the suspension elongation; this part carries the entire static load.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A damping element (typically a hydraulic shock absorber), which delivers a dissipative force proportional and opposite to the elongation speed; this part delivers a negligible force at steady-state conditions, but plays a crucial role in the dynamic behavior of the suspension.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A set of mechanical elements which links the suspended (sprung) body to the unsprung mass.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Roughly speaking, the suspension is a mechanical low-pass filter which attenuates the effects of a disturbance (e.g. an irregular road profile) on an output variable. The output variable is typically the body acceleration when comfort is the main objective; the tire deflection when the design goal is road-holding. For a passive suspension, from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959651812447520">Figure 1</xref>, it is clear that these two objectives are somewhat in conflict: the tuning and design of a mechanical suspension try to find the best compromise between the competing goals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959651812447520">1</xref></sup></p>

<p>All in all, the bulk of the design problem of a mechanical suspension consists in the definition of spring stiffness and a damping ratio, in order to deliver a good compromise between comfort and handling, with an additional bound on the suspension travel. In this respect, the birth of electronic suspensions for the car mass-market can probably be dated to the early 1960s, when Citroen introduced hydro-pneumatic suspensions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959651812447520">1</xref></sup> the modification of this concept led the way to the idea of “on-line” electronic adaptation of suspension. The “golden age” of electronic suspension was probably located in the second half of the 1980s; analog electronics were already well-developed, the era of embedded digital micro-controllers was starting, and the magic of full-active suspensions attracted both the Formula1 (F1) teams and the car manufacturers. During these years the exceptional potential of replacing a traditional spring-damper system with a fully-fledged electronically controllable fast-reacting hydraulic actuator was demonstrated. High costs, significant power absorption, bulky and unreliable hydraulic systems, and uncertain management of the safety issues ensured that the fatal attraction for fully-active electronic suspensions lasted only a few years. They were banned in F1 competitions in the early 1990s, and they never made a significant impact on mass-market car production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959651812447520">1</xref></sup> In the second half of the 1990s, a new trend emerged: it became clear that the best compromise between cost (component cost, weight, electronics and sensors, power consumption, etc.) and performance (comfort, handling, safety) lay in the technology of electronically controllable suspensions, namely, variable-damping suspensions or, in brief, semi-active suspensions. From the paper by Ahmadian and Song<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959651812447520">2</xref></sup> it is clear that the semi-active control system is stable regardless of the damping tuning approach. One of the main features of semi-active control systems is that they are fail-safe. This means that if the control system fails for any reason (including power failure or sensor failure), the system acts as a passive system. Thus, semi-active suspension systems are becoming more popular because they offer both the reliability of passive systems and the versatility of active systems without imposing heavy power demands.</p>
<p>Six literature surveys concerning advanced suspension systems were found in the literature. Tomizuka and Hedrick<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959651812447520">3</xref></sup> discuss advanced control methods for automotive applications in general and include a paragraph on suspension systems. Various control methods are mentioned for fully active systems as well as semi-active dampers. No mention is made of the existence or control of controllable spring systems. Sharp and Crolla<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959651812447520">4</xref></sup> discuss suspension system design in general and include aspects such as road surfaces, tires, vehicle models and performance criteria. Passive, active, semi-active and slow active suspension systems are also included in the survey. Mention is made of slow active (3 Hz bandwidth) controllable pneumatic and hydro-pneumatic systems. The application of neural networks and fuzzy logic to vehicle systems is reviewed by Ghazi Zadeh et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959651812447520">5</xref></sup> An introduction to neural networks and fuzzy logic is given. The techniques have been applied to active and semi-active suspension systems by various authors. Elbeheiry et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959651812447520">6</xref></sup> give a classified bibliography of advanced ground vehicle suspension systems. A reference list of 71 papers concerned with semi-active suspensions and 58 papers concerned with adaptive, actively damped and load-leveling suspensions is given but not discussed. Applications of optimal control techniques to the design of active suspension systems are surveyed by Hrovat.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959651812447520">7</xref></sup> The main emphasis of the survey is on linear quadratic optimal control and active suspension systems, but related subjects such as semi-active suspensions and related control topics are also discussed. Some 256 papers are included in the list of references. Although these surveys do not provide sufficient detail on each topic to be really useful for the purposes of the current study, they provide a valuable source of references and a general overview on the specific subject. This paper is intended to be a review of the history of semi-active vehicle suspension systems and its ride comfort and road holding properties, the description of the current trends and challenges ahead and the prediction of potential paths forward.</p>
<p>Electronically controlled suspensions can be classified according to two main features: when energy is “added” into the suspension system, the suspension is classified as “active”; however, when the suspension is electronically modified without energy insertion (apart from a small amount of energy used to drive the electronically controlled element), the suspension is called semi-active. Roughly speaking, a suspension is “active” when it can “lift” the vehicle, semi-active otherwise. This section presents the ideal classification of controllable suspensions, originally introduced by Isermann.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959651812447520">8</xref></sup> The classification of a controllable suspension may be carried out according to the energy input and the bandwidth of the actuator. More specifically, three features may be observed: the controllability range, in other words the range of forces that the actuators may deliver; the control bandwidth which is a measure of the speed of the actuator action; the power request that is mainly due to the mix of controllability range and control bandwidth. Based on the discussed features, there are five main classes of electronically controlled suspensions see Guglielmino et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959651812447520">9</xref></sup> Among these five classes there are three “active” suspension classes.</p>
<list id="list2-0959651812447520" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Load-leveling suspensions (namely active suspensions with an actuation bandwidth well below the main suspension dynamics).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Slow-active suspensions (active suspensions with a bandwidth in-between body and wheel dynamics).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Fully-active suspensions (full-bandwidth active suspensions).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The remaining two classes concern “semi-active” suspensions.</p>
<list id="list3-0959651812447520" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Adaptive suspensions (suspension with slowly modified damping ratio; typically this modification is simply made with an open-loop architecture).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Semi-active suspensions (suspensions with a damping ratio modified in a closed-loop configuration over a large bandwidth).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The resulting classification is concisely shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0959651812447520">Table 1</xref>, which highlights five families of controllable suspensions.</p>

<title>Semi-active suspensions</title>
<p>Among the various classifications of a suspension system, a semi-active suspension may be considered as the best compromise between achievable performance and cost. Semi-active suspensions are an amazing mix of appealing features; among others, the most interesting are the following: negligible power-demand, safety, low cost, low weight and significant impact on the vehicle performance. Many types of vehicle are equipped (or are being equipped) with a semi-active suspension; the list is long, multi-faceted and continuously increasing. Such vehicles range from small vehicles such as motorcycles, snowmobiles, etc. to large off-road vehicles (agricultural tractors, earth-moving machines, etc.), passing through classic cars and duty-vehicles such as trucks, ambulances, fire-trucks, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959651812447520">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959651812447520"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959651812447520"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959651812447520"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959651812447520"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959651812447520"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959651812447520"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959651812447520"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959651812447520">18</xref></sup> It should be borne in mind that the main semi-active control challenge lies in the dissipative constraint of the damper control and not in the description of the non-linear behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959651812447520">19</xref></sup> Hence, semi-active suspensions are implemented by the use of controllable shock absorbers. The technologies available are based on devices with variable orifices (electrohydraulic dampers) or on devices with fluids capable of varying their viscosity as a function of an electric or magnetic field (electro-rheological and magneto-rheological dampers). These technologies are comparable in terms of bandwidth and controllability range, except for the particular shape of the characteristics of each kind of shock absorber. A semi-active damper may be viewed as a system with two inputs (suspension deflection and damping request) and one output (damping force). A simple but effective description of this kind of actuator is extremely important for control design purposes. The electrohydraulic dampers use controllable electromagnetic valves that are usually modified passive hydraulic (or gas) dampers improved by the addition of a solenoid valve with a variable orifice. The appropriate parameter of the semi-active damper to be controlled is the pressure in the damper, which can be modified by opening and closing a proportional valve: the cross-section can be tuned to any arbitrary size. This allows the continuously variable adaption of the pressure and therefore of the damper characteristics from stiff to soft in a range defined by the completely closed and the opened valve cross-section. An electric current between zero and a maximum value commands the adjustment of the valve. The damper force is then a function of the actual damper velocity and the valve’s cross-section, i.e. the actual current. Originally, discrete state (two or more) semi-active dampers were produced with one or more two-state (on–off) solenoid valves. Currently, continuously variable devices are available on the market. One of their significant advantages is that that this concept does not require significant changes in vehicle design – just a replacement of the shock absorber. According to the paper by Milliken and William<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959651812447520">19</xref></sup> servo-valves can provide very high speeds, linearity and accuracy of flow control at high operating pressures. Servo-valves have been used successfully in fully active suspensions which use a hydraulic pump, reservoir, accumulators and hydraulic cylinders to connect the wheels to the chassis. Unfortunately, servo-valves are very expensive and complicated devices. Solenoid valves provide an alternative to servo-valves. A solenoid valve does not have as fast or accurate a response as a servo-valve; however, a servo-valve is much more expensive than a solenoid valve. The paper by Kim et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959651812447520">20</xref></sup> reports that a solenoid valve is much simpler in design than a servo-valve, and it is possible to manufacture the valve in-house, bringing the added benefit of being able to optimize the valve design for a particular application. Solenoid valves have also been used in two- or three-state dampers that can change characteristics between hard damping and soft damping by opening or closing a bypass valve. These dampers have resulted in improvements in ride quality when appropriate control schemes are used. Although these dampers do not have the capability of being continuously variable, continuously variable solenoid valve dampers are also available. Solenoid valves of this type have been tested, with promising results by Kitching et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959651812447520">21</xref></sup> The paper by Park et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959651812447520">22</xref></sup> presents semi-active dampers with external solenoid valves that were modeled taking into account the flow forces on the valve, but not including variable fluid compressibility. Elmer and Gentle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959651812447520">23</xref></sup> and Vaughan and Gamble<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959651812447520">24</xref></sup> investigated more complex modeling of hydraulic control valves, including variable coil inductance and valve spool dynamics. Semi-active dampers based on the by-pass principle use a hydraulic valve (mostly electrically operated) in parallel with a conventional damper orifice and valve assembly. If the bypass valve is closed, all the flow goes through the conventional damper orifice and valve assembly, giving high damping or the “on” characteristic. If the bypass valve is open, most of the flow will pass through the bypass valve due to the lower flow resistance. This results in the low damping or “off” characteristic. During valve switching some transient response will result between the “on” and “off” characteristics. The bypass valve can have several discrete stages, or it can be a servo-valve giving continuously variable damping characteristics. The choice of valve is based on the pressure drop and flowrate characteristic, as well as the required response time. Examples of two-state semi-active dampers, using the bypass valve principle, are discussed by Nell <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959651812447520">25</xref></sup> and Nell and Steyn.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959651812447520">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recent advances in smart materials have led to the development of new semi-active dampers, which are widely used in various applications. In view of these semi-active dampers, the electro-rheological and magneto-rheological fluids probably serve as the best potential hardware alternatives for the more conventional variable orifice hydraulic dampers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959651812447520">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959651812447520">28</xref></sup> Both the electro-rheological and magneto-rheological effects are very fast (response times of less than a millisecond) and fully reversible. Winslow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959651812447520">29</xref></sup> was the first to patent the magneto-rheological fluid concept; however, it was not until the 1980s that industrial applications of magneto-rheological fluids were developed by Jazar and Golnaraghi.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959651812447520">30</xref></sup> Recently, a very attractive and effective semi-active suspension system featuring magneto-rheological dampers was proposed in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959651812447520">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959651812447520"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959651812447520">33</xref></sup> Peel et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959651812447520">34</xref></sup> demonstrated the applicability of a magneto-rheological fluid in vibration isolation.

This subject has resulted in an extensive number of publications. El-Aouar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959651812447520">37</xref></sup> reported that magneto-rheological fluids are materials that exhibit a change in rheological properties (elasticity, plasticity or viscosity) with the application of a magnetic field. Typically, embedded electromagnets offer a simple means to alter the magnetic field in these damping devices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959651812447520">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959651812447520">39</xref></sup> Dampers using a magneto-rheological fluid as the working fluid are disclosed in various US patents, including those by Carlson and Chrzan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959651812447520">40</xref></sup> and Jolly et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959651812447520">41</xref></sup> Also, Choi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959651812447520">42</xref></sup> and Liu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959651812447520">43</xref></sup> have developed semi-active isolators using magneto-rheological dampers.

Experts in the field know that the magneto-rheological characteristics can be affected by harmful phenomena such as large hysteresis and variable friction. The literature on the modeling of magneto-rheological dampers and on their application is extremely large. For comprehensive presentation see Guglielmino et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959651812447520">46</xref></sup> and Savaresi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959651812447520">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>Electro-rheological fluids exhibit rheological changes when an electric field is applied to the fluid. However, there are many drawbacks to electro-rheological fluids, including relatively small rheological changes and extreme property changes with temperature. The main difference between both fluids is that magneto-rheological fluids require large currents but low voltages, whereas electro-rheological fluids require low currents but high voltages. The main advantage of using magneto-rheological fluids is that the required voltages can be generated directly from the car’s own electrical system without the need for an additional power supply.</p>

<title>Semi-active control approaches</title>
<p>More specifically, when dealing with semi-active control strategies, the two main aspects of interest (for both academic and industry applications) are concerned with:</p>
<list id="list4-0959651812447520" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>the comfort characteristics;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the road-holding (or handling) characteristics.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In this section, the most common comfort-oriented semi-active suspension control strategies are reviewed. The skyhook damping control strategy is a classic semi-active control approach that was first proposed by Crosby et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959651812447520">48</xref></sup> This control strategy has been widely adopted to control semi-active suspensions. The principle of the approach is to design an active suspension control so that the chassis is “linked” to the sky in order to reduce the vertical oscillations of the chassis and the axle independently of each other. When semi-active dampers are concerned, the active behavior that creates the skyhook phenomenon may be then approached by using semi-active dampers only, as in Emura et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0959651812447520">49</xref></sup> Many studies have been carried out on the skyhook control strategy since it represents a simple way to achieve a good comfort requirement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959651812447520">50</xref></sup> as, for instance, the no-jerk version proposed by Ahmadian et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959651812447520">51</xref></sup> Some extended versions of the skyhook control concept have been developed, such as the adaptive approach proposed by Song et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959651812447520">52</xref></sup> for application to magneto-rheological dampers or the gain-scheduled approach proposed by Hong et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959651812447520">53</xref></sup> An improved version of skyhook control has been used to handle variable damping, either with discrete damping coefficients, or with a continuously variable damper, as illustrated in Sammier et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0959651812447520">54</xref></sup> and Sohn et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0959651812447520">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>Acceleration-driven damper (ADD) control is a semi-active control law described in Savaresi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0959651812447520">56,57</xref></sup> This strategy has been shown to be optimal in the sense that it minimizes the vertical body acceleration when no road information is available (therefore, this control law is a comfort-oriented approach). Since it requires the same number of sensors as the skyhook and the linear approximation control laws, this control law is simple from the implementation point of view. Note that the control law is very similar to the two-state approximation of the skyhook algorithm, with the difference that the switching law depends on body acceleration instead of body speed (which is easier to measure on real vehicles). It is worth noting that the ADD design is well suited to comfort improvement but not to road-holding. Moreover, the “switching dynamic” may influence the closed-loop performance. Morselli and Zanasi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0959651812447520">58</xref></sup> showed that a power-driven damper (PDD) strategy provides results comparable to those of the ADD control law, while avoiding the chattering effect of the damping control value. Then, the advantages of the PDD control are clearly linked to this non-chattering phenomenon.</p>
<sec id="section4-0959651812447520">
<title>Road-holding-oriented semi-active control approaches</title>
<p>There only a few studies in the literature that consider the possible improvement of road-holding using a suspension actuator. Indeed, the usual main issue in suspension control for which such “actuators” have been considered is ride comfort. In recent years, studies on global chassis control have emphasized that the suspension system may also help in obtaining better road-holding and handling characteristics. Among the papers dedicated to road-holding characteristics, the groundhook approach, which is in some sense the dual of the skyhook approach, has been described by Valasek and Kortum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0959651812447520">59</xref></sup> It consists in increasing the damping and then reducing the deflection, to reduce the road–tire forces. As in the skyhook case, the ideal groundhook cannot be achieved and needs to be approximated. The cases of the two-state and continuous groundhook strategies are described by Koo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0959651812447520">60</xref></sup> and Koo et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0959651812447520">61</xref></sup> In these two papers details are given about this control method (even if this concerns floor vibration applications and not vehicle ones), and where some extended cases, such as displacement and velocity-based groundhook control policies, are presented and tested experimentally. Note that some hybrid approaches, combining skyhook and groundhook strategies have been developed, for instance in Flores et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0959651812447520">62</xref></sup> However, the switching strategy is not straightforward and needs an accurate tuning to achieve an improvement in both the comfort and road-holding criteria</p>

<title>Modern semi-active control approaches</title>
<p>In this section, some studies dedicated to semi-active suspension control are presented. Here the emphasis is put on robust or predictive approaches, which are currently of great interest in vehicle dynamics. Many of the papers published in the literature have concerned the application of the <italic>H</italic>∞ control approach (sometimes in the framework of linear parameter variation (LPV) to suspension systems. However, most of the reported results were obtained for active suspensions, as in Zin et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0959651812447520">63</xref></sup> When applied to semi-active dampers, the dissipative constraint on the damper is usually handled using a simple projection (i.e. saturation). While it is not always referred to as “the clipped approach,” the latter is very widespread in control strategies for semi-active suspensions. Indeed, the aim is very simple: Karnopp<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0959651812447520">64</xref></sup> and Margolis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0959651812447520">65</xref></sup> suggested a semi-active controller by passing the optimal active controller through a limiter (saturation). In the control step, the force applied by the semi-active damper is then chosen to be as close as possible to the force required by the controller for a given suspension deflection speed and for the possible range of forces the damper can deliver. This simple strategy has been applied in many cases, whatever the control method: optimal, robust, skyhook, state-feedback etc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0959651812447520">66</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0959651812447520"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0959651812447520">68</xref></sup> A static output feedback (clipped) <italic>H</italic>∞ controller was designed for a suspension equipped with a magneto-rheological damper. It was shown that it allows the comfort and road-holding to be improved compared to a passive suspension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0959651812447520">66</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0959651812447520"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0959651812447520">68</xref></sup> This strategy uses two measured outputs: the suspension deflection and the velocity of the sprung mass. Sammier et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0959651812447520">54</xref></sup> reported an <italic>H</italic>∞ methodology that was claimed to be open to any control design engineer in the automotive industry. The performance specifications were expressed as weighting functions on the usual sensitivity functions, which corresponds to a mixed sensitivity problem. The only measured output needed for control is the suspension deflection, which is widely used in the automotive industry because of its low cost and simplicity. The controlled variables create greatly improved comfort as well as road-holding performances. The designed <italic>H</italic>∞ control was subsequently applied to a semi-active damper available in some Peugeot-Citroën vehicles, for which only a discrete number of damping coefficients can be provided. It was shown that the <italic>H</italic>∞ controlled semi-active suspensions were more efficient than skyhook ones or passive ones, in terms of comfort and road-holding performance. Palmeri et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0959651812447520">69</xref></sup> described the application of <italic>H</italic>∞ optimal control theory to the design of a fully active suspension system for an experimental Lancia Thema sedan car. The system functions as a multiple-input single-output (MISO) regulator with hub acceleration, actuator force and actuator position as inputs. The <italic>H</italic>∞ control strategy was chosen to take advantage of the possibility to design a competitive MISO controller as well as exploit robust disturbance rejection which the <italic>H</italic>∞ theory grants. Each corner of the vehicle was modeled as a seventh-order state-space model. The <italic>H</italic>∞ regulator was a model-based compensator, which means that it contains the system’s state-space model that is observed and the control compensates for the error. Vehicle tests on a laboratory test setup indicated that <italic>H</italic>∞ performs significantly better at all speeds than the skyhook baseline, especially at low frequencies around the body roll frequency.</p>
<p>Hybrid model predictive control (Hybrid MPC) approaches are currently being increasingly studied, but they still lack robustness properties and are not easy to apply. An illustration of the application of such techniques on semi-active suspensions is presented in Giorgetti et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0959651812447520">70</xref></sup> In this case, the optimization problem is solved off-line and then transformed in a set of explicit controllers which may be implemented. Canale et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0959651812447520">71</xref></sup> introduced another MPC semi-active suspension which returned a good performance compared to those of the skyhook and linear quadratic-clipped approaches.</p>

<sec id="section6-0959651812447520">
<title>Some other approaches</title>
<p>Linear quadratic (state feedback) control was one of the first methodologies to be applied to suspension control, mainly in the case of active suspensions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959651812447520">7</xref></sup> since it allows criteria to be minimized to create optimal comfort and the road-holding objectives. Its application to semi-active suspensions has been proposed using clipped strategies in Giua et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0959651812447520">72</xref></sup> and Tseng and Hedrick.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0959651812447520">73</xref></sup> The quasi-linearization control approach of Kawabe et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0959651812447520">74</xref></sup> consists in a two-step design. The first step is a quasi-linearization, on the basis of the oscillating properties of the suspension system. The second one is a frequency loop-shaping. The first step is aimed at attenuating the oscillation in the lower-frequency region, and the second step at attenuating the oscillation in the higher-frequency region. Oustaloup et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0959651812447520">75</xref></sup> proposed a design method which can be applied to passive, semi-active and active suspension systems on the basis of classic control theory. This method is applied to a quarter-car model in which the vehicle suspension system is simplified by extracting only its bouncing motion.</p>
<p>Two new control strategies mixed skyhook-ADD (SH-ADD) and the one-sensor-mix, have been introduced in Savaresi and Spelta.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0959651812447520">76,77</xref></sup> It was proven that these control strategy rules are able to perform optimally on the entire range of frequencies (for comfort purposes), using apparatus and computational effort comparable to traditional suspension strategies, like SH and ADD. In particular the one-sensor-mix even ensures a sensor reduction, with a negligible loss of performance. The papers by Poussot-Vassal et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0959651812447520">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0959651812447520">79</xref></sup> are concerned with the presentation of a robust semi-active suspension control design using a LPV approach. More specifically, the proposed semi-active suspension control strategy is designed so that it minimizes the <italic>H</italic>∞ performance criteria while guaranteeing the limitations of the semi-active damper (i.e. dissipative constraint and force limitations) through a specific parameter-dependent structure and a scheduling strategy design. The <italic>H</italic>∞ control synthesis solution for LPV systems is extended from the linear time-invariant system. The <italic>H</italic>∞ “LPV semi-active” problem is solved using polytopic approaches (the first one is related to the feasibility, and the second one, to controller reconstruction).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0959651812447520">80</xref></sup> For more details on this approach the interested reader is referred to Scherer et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0959651812447520">81</xref></sup> Apkarian and Gahinet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0959651812447520">81</xref></sup> and Chilali et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0959651812447520">82</xref></sup> Note that proofs and comments are also provided in Poussot-Vassal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0959651812447520">83</xref></sup></p>
<p>An extensive literature survey on the applications of fuzzy logic and neural networks to vehicle systems, including suspension control, is given by Ghazi Zadeh et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959651812447520">5</xref></sup> Chou et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0959651812447520">84</xref></sup> presented a control scheme referred to as the gray-fuzzy control method that consists of two parts namely the gray predictors and the fuzzy logic controller. The system is said to be able to control excessive tire deflection and improve ride comfort. The Taguchi method is employed to search for the optimal control parameters and the results, obtained by computer simulation of a quarter-car model, is said to be satisfactory. Hashiyama et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0959651812447520">85</xref></sup> presented a method to generate fuzzy controllers through the use of a genetic algorithm (GA). Appropriate combinations of input variables, number of fuzzy rules and parameters for membership functions are determined automatically through the GA operations. A fuzzified version of Karnop’s law of suspension control was incorporated as the initial fuzzy rules. These initial rules are not modified by the GA rather the GA with a new local improvement mechanism is applied to find additional fuzzy rules for better performance. The performance index is improved but no comparisons are given to the passive suspension performance. Yoshimura et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0959651812447520">86</xref></sup> presented a semi-active suspension controlled by fuzzy reasoning. The input variables to the fuzzy control rules are the suspension travel and its derivative. The aim is to minimize body vertical and roll acceleration at the center of gravity under the constraints of suspension travel and tire deflection. A half-car simulation model is used. Simulation results show that the proposed system is very effective in improving the vertical and rotary accelerations of the vehicle body as well as tire deflections.</p>

<title>Control strategies for magneto-rheological dampers</title>
<p>Recently, semi-active suspensions based on magneto-rheological dampers have attracted increasing attention because of their fast response characteristic to magnetic fields, insensitivity to temperature fluctuations or impurities in the fluid, obtainment of convenient power and wide control bandwidth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0959651812447520">87</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0959651812447520"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0959651812447520"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0959651812447520"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0959651812447520"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0959651812447520">92</xref></sup> The damping force generated by the magneto-rheological damper cannot be controlled directly because it depends on the input current (voltage) to the magneto-rheological damper and the relative velocity and displacement between the piston and the damper shell, among which only the input current (voltage) can be controlled. Therefore, the designation of the damper controller remains an important unresolved issue in the application of a magneto-rheological damper. Basically, there are three major approaches reported in the literature that have been utilized in the design of a controller for the magneto-rheological damper. The first method is based on force feedback control by a force sensor. Dyke<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0959651812447520">93</xref></sup> was the first to propose the clipped-optimal controller. The command current (voltage) varies between two states based on a comparison of the desired force and the actual force. Yoshida and Dyke<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0959651812447520">94</xref></sup> added a function in the clipped-optimal switching, which can control the current between zero and the maximum value. The second approach is focused on the inverse magneto-rheological damper model, which is a numerical model to calculate the magneto-rheological damper’s required control current (voltage) based on a known control force. The third approach is based on the fuzzy controller design methodology, which is becoming increasingly popular.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0959651812447520">95</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0959651812447520">96</xref></sup> Among them, the force feedback control-based method is the simplest, but the magneto-rheological damper can only approximately generate the desired optimal control force, because the command current (voltage) is not precisely calculated and an extra force sensor is needed which increases the level of complexity and the cost. The fuzzy controller design methodology does not need accurate models of the control object or the magneto-rheological damper, but it is very challenging to establish reasonable fuzzy rules because no systematic method can be adopted. Compared with the force feedback control method and the fuzzy controller design method, the reverse magneto-rheological damper model-based method has two main advantages: one is that a more precise command current (voltage) can be calculated to track the desired force, the other is no force sensor is needed. Several dynamic models for magneto-rheological dampers to obtain the command current (voltage) have been proposed to overcome the difficulties in building the dynamic model due to the inherent hysteresis and strong non-linearity of the magneto-rheological damper. Generally speaking, they can be categorized as non-parametric and parametric models. For parametric models, Wang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0959651812447520">97</xref></sup> proposed a hysteretic force–velocity model based on the symmetric and asymmetric sigmoid functions, with attractive features of decoupling the current control gain function and the hysteron function. Sakai et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0959651812447520">98</xref></sup> proposed a modified LuGre model, whose dynamic model can analytically determine the necessary input current. A phenomenological model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959651812447520">45</xref></sup> can accurately describe the forward behavior of the magneto-rheological dampers. However, the corresponding inverse model is difficult to obtain due to its non-linearity and complexity. Tsang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0959651812447520">99</xref></sup> developed a simplified inverse dynamics model for the phenomenological model using the exponential function to emulate the controllable force. For non-parametric models, Choi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0959651812447520">100</xref></sup> developed a polynomial model, which can easily calculate the input current with measurable velocity and has been used in several semi-active control systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0959651812447520">101</xref></sup> Wang and Liao<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0959651812447520">102</xref></sup> proposed a direct identification and an inverse dynamic modeling method for magneto-rheological dampers using recurrent neural networks. Wang and Hu<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0959651812447520">103</xref></sup> designed a kind of nuero-fuzzy system on the basis of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) technology to build the inverse model which has been applied in semi-active control systems. However, its effectiveness is limited because it is not precise enough in predicting the control current. The neural network model and the ANFIS model are relatively more accurate in predicting the command current (voltage) of the magneto-rheological dampers. When identifying the inverse model of magneto-rheological damper with ANFIS, the curse of dimensionality of a fuzzy system can occur, which will dramatically increase the time required for network training, and even the inverse model may not be identifiable. Thus, it is crucial to design a reverse model in which the command current (voltage) can be calculated more precisely to track the desired force.</p>

<title>Concluding remarks</title>
<p>In this review first a general presentation of suspension systems (passive and controllable) has been provided. In general a controllable suspension system may be classified according to the bandwidth of actuation and the energy that the suspension might introduce into the system. According to these criteria, five classes can be defined: fully active, slow active, load leveling, semi-active and adaptive damping. Among them, the semi-active suspension may be considered as the best compromise between achievable performance and cost. Semi-active suspensions are implemented by the use of controllable shock absorbers. The technologies available are based on devices with variable orifices (electrohydraulic dampers) or on devices with fluids capable of varying their viscosity as a function of an electric or magnetic field (electro-rheological and magneto-rheological dampers). A semi-active damper may be viewed as a system with two inputs (suspension deflection and damping request) and one output (damping force). Then, some of the control approaches that have been applied to controllable dampers were reviewed. Even if it is not complete (due to the large literature in this area), the aim was to emphasize that few strategies are generic and optimal enough to be applied to any kind of semi-active suspension. Then, two new control algorithms for semi-active suspensions were analyzed: the mixed SH-ADD and the one-sensor-mix algorithm. Their performances were compared with other comfort-oriented semi-active control strategies. The comparison confirmed the quasi-optimality of the one-sensor-mix algorithm. This algorithm seems to provide the best compromise between cost and performance. Its one-sensor setting also guarantees superior reliability characteristics. Finally, it is worth observing that the rationale used here for the one-sensor-mix algorithm can be – in principle – extended also to mixed (comfort-handling) control objectives. Finally, a detailed review was performed on a semi-active suspension based on magneto-rheological dampers which is the most recent trend of application of semi-active suspension control.</p>
<sec id="section9-0959651812447520">
<title>Trends and future research</title>
<p>Comfort improvement has been a very active research field in the last decade and, naturally, a large variety of dedicated (and efficient) control strategies have emerged. As a consequence, one of the next issues in semi-active suspension control concerns the handling of stroke limitations which is linked to the comfort objective. Therefore, the development and implementation of road-holding-oriented semi-active suspension strategies is now an open issue where no clear strategy has been successfully deployed. Finally, the development of semi-active suspension control strategies is now strongly linked to the so-called global chassis control concept, and further issues will also concern the management of several control algorithms in a global vehicle dynamic framework.</p>
