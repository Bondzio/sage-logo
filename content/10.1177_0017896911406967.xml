<abstract>
<p><bold>Objective</bold>: To assess the extent to which university students are following UK Government advice regarding appropriate consumption of alcohol, and to investigate if students can be placed into distinct clusters based on their drinking behaviour.</p>
<p><bold>Design</bold>: A descriptive questionnaire study.</p>
<p><bold>Setting</bold>: One hundred and nineteen undergraduate students from Leeds Metropolitan University, UK.</p>
<p><bold>Method</bold>: An online survey, which included a diary to record daily alcohol consumption over the previous week, was completed during the winter of 2007/08. Cluster analysis was used to classify students into subgroups based on comparable alcohol-drinking characteristics. National recommended sensible drinking behaviour guidelines in terms of total weekly alcohol intake, maximum daily alcohol intake, number of alcohol-free days and estimated blood alcohol levels were used to compare drinking behaviour the previous week by age, sex and cluster group.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: Consuming weekly alcohol levels considered hazardous was common (58%) with nearly 70% of responders binge drinking at least once over that period; most students (80%) were, however, following the government’s recommendation for two consecutive alcohol-free days per week. No significant differences in drinking behaviour by sex were found, but binge drinkers tended to be younger. Four distinct alcohol-drinking behaviour clusters were identified based on alcohol consumption frequency and quantity. Only students in the <italic>non or light drinkers</italic> group all remained within national recommended guidelines for weekly intake and alcohol-free days.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: Students who consume alcohol are commonly drinking daily and weekly alcohol levels in excess of national sensible drinking guidelines; most students, however, abstain from alcohol on at least two consecutive days. The four distinct drinking clusters suggest that students would benefit from targeted interventions. In particular, personalization of interventions to reflect the distinct patterns of drinking behaviour could increase intervention effectiveness.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Heavy alcohol consumption and heavy drinking over a short period of time (binge drinking) amongst undergraduates have been well documented,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0017896911406967">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0017896911406967"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0017896911406967">3</xref></sup> with national and international research providing evidence that undergraduate students generally drink more than their non-student peers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0017896911406967">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0017896911406967"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0017896911406967">6</xref></sup>The public health impact of prolonged heavy alcohol use or binge drinking are numerous and include: risky sexual behaviour,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0017896911406967">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0017896911406967">8</xref></sup> increase in road traffic accidents;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0017896911406967">9</xref></sup> injuries and violence;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896911406967">10</xref></sup> and alcohol-related conditions including cancers of the digestive system, hypertension, liver cirrhosis and chronic pancreatitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896911406967">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The UK Government and public health initiatives have been employed to moderate drinking behaviour and associated consequences within the general population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896911406967">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0017896911406967">12</xref></sup> Prevention and intervention strategies have included: efforts to slow down the rate of absorption of alcohol (e.g. eating before); slowing down the rate of consumption (e.g. alternating with non-alcoholic drinks); and providing time for the body to recover from heavy levels of consumption (e.g. alcohol-free days). There is limited evidence, however, on if these strategies are used by student populations.</p>
<p>Evidence suggests high levels of problematic drinking within the student population,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0017896911406967">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0017896911406967">14</xref></sup> but the frequency and quantity of consumption do not appear to be homogeneous.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0017896911406967">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0017896911406967">4</xref></sup> We have limited understanding of how discrete measures of consumption (e.g. binge drinking, weekly consumption) cluster together. Such an understanding would provide insight into how some students mitigate against the negative consequences of alcohol by the inclusion of some protective strategies. Knowledge of those strategies more likely to be used by those students most at risk could help inform future interventions.</p>
<p>Recent UK research suggests that less than 5% of students could accurately recall the recommended daily consumption limits. Approximately 85% did not see the current UK limits as having relevance for them. While this study had a number of limitations, most notably it was carried out using a small number of female students, it does highlight a lack of awareness of key guidelines around alcohol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0017896911406967">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to investigate if students report following UK Government advice regarding appropriate drinking behaviour and if there are distinct groups of reported student drinking behaviour. In particular, this study investigated how behaviours could be clustered to form distinct groups of students.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0017896911406967">
<title>Setting and participants</title>
<p>During the winter of 2007/08 undergraduate students from Leeds Metropolitan University who were participating in a longitudinal study to investigate changes in weight were invited, via email, to complete an online alcohol consumption survey. The email contained a standardized invitation to participate in the survey and included a direct link to an electronic questionnaire. As an incentive, participants were entered into a prize draw to win a £25 Amazon voucher. To ensure that student responses remained anonymous, the contact information provided by students interested in being entered into the prize draw was stored separately.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0017896911406967">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire electronically, using the Bristol Online Survey System.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0017896911406967">16</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section5-0017896911406967">
<title>Measurement of alcohol consumption</title>
<p>Students were asked to recall how many alcoholic drinks they had consumed in the last week. To assist recall students were presented with a seven-day drinking diary. The diary listed common drinks (e.g. pint of ordinary strength lager, 175 ml glass of red wine). Students were asked to indicate the number of drinks consumed on each day. This method is recommended by Dawson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0017896911406967">17</xref></sup> for use within sample populations that consume alcohol regularly, and has been successfully used within the UK population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0017896911406967">1</xref></sup> For each drinking day, students reported the time that drinking commenced, the time that drinking ended and the number of non-alcoholic drinks consumed.</p>
<p>Using the same methodology, students were asked to detail their level of alcohol consumption over a typical week.</p>
<p>In addition, students were asked to choose, from a list of options, how often they typically consumed alcohol (never, once every 6 months, once a month, once a fortnight, 1–3 times per week, 4–5 times per week or 6–7 times per week).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0017896911406967">
<title>Measurement of height and weight</title>
<p>In addition, participants were asked to self-report their height and weight using either metric or imperial measurements. As part of the wider study, students were aware that their height and weight would be measured using standardized equipment; this is likely to have increased the honesty of reporting.</p>

<sec id="section7-0017896911406967">
<title>Demographic information</title>
<p>Participants’ sex, date of birth, course, year of study and study status (full time or part time) were recorded from the longitudinal study.</p>

<title>Outcome measures</title>
<sec id="section9-0017896911406967">
<title>Units of alcohol</title>
<p>Units of alcohol consumed (UK units) each day were calculated based on the self-report drinking diaries, with one unit of alcohol equivalent to 8 g of pure ethanol. From these values we calculated the number of units consumed per week, the maximum daily number of units consumed and the number of binge-drinking episodes per week (maximum of seven episodes in any week). The definition used of a binge episode was a female consuming at least 48 g ethanol on a single occasion and a male consuming at least 64 g ethanol on a single occasion.</p>
<p>In addition, we classified weekly consumption into the following four groups, based on current UK guidelines:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0017896911406967">12</xref></sup> No alcohol; Sensible (female 1–14 units, male 1–21 units); Hazardous (female 14–30 units, males 21–50 units); and Harmful (female 30+ units, male 50+ units). This procedure was followed for both the previous week and a typical week of reported drinking.</p>

<p>For the purpose of this equation only, the number of UK units was converted to USA standard drinks, that is one unit is equal to 14 grams of pure alcohol. The gender constant was 9.0 for females and 7.5 for males and the metabolic rate used was 0.017 g/dl (average metabolic rate). Estimated concentration was calculated at the estimated time alcohol drinking ended.</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>UK national recommendations for alcohol-free days, maximum daily, and weekly alcohol intake<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896911406967">11</xref></sup> and multipliers of the UK drink driving blood alcohol limits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0017896911406967">19</xref></sup> (no more than 800 mcg per 1 ml blood) were used to compare alcohol consumption patterns by age, sex and year of study. The chi-squared test, Spearman’s correlation coefficient, Tamhane’s T2 test and the Binomial test were used to assess differences in data that were non-parametric or did not satisfy the assumptions needed in order to undertake parametric testing. Parametric data were presented using mean and 95% confidence intervals around the mean (95% CI) and assessed using the <italic>F</italic>-test and <italic>t</italic>-test (with Bonferroni adjustment), when the variation between categories was equivalent based on the Levene’s test, or the Welch test and Games–Howel test when there was significant heterogeneity between the variances at the 5% level.</p>
<p>Cluster analysis was used to split participants into subgroups sharing common alcohol consumption characteristics. The selection of variables used to define the subgroups were chosen to reflect alcohol intake, volume and frequency, and were as follows: total alcohol consumption for the whole of the previous week; total number of days alcohol was consumed in the previous week; and the total number of days binge drinking in the previous week. These variables were standardized using <italic>z</italic>-scores to level out the effects of the different scales and Ward’s hierarchical method using Squared Euclidian Distance was used to define clusters. The number of clusters was determined subjectively from visual inspection of the dendrogram, based on distance and the need to identify a representative and sensible number of clusters.</p>
<p>Data were analysed using SPSS version 16.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section14-0017896911406967">
<title>Descriptive statistics</title>
<p>The online questionnaire was completed by 119 students, from a total of 162 students who initially registered an interest in the project (73%). Six students were excluded from the analysis for one or more of the following reasons: they did not provide details of their sex (one responder) or date of birth (five responders), or did not provide enough information to calculate eBAC for at least one of the seven days (two responders).</p>
<p>The average age of participants was just under 23 years [mean = 22.87; standard deviation (SD) = 6.27]. Most participants were female (<italic>n</italic> = 88; 78%) and most were full-time students (<italic>n</italic> = 100; 89%). The majority were from the Faculty of Health (<italic>n</italic> = 67; 59%), with 35% (<italic>n</italic> = 40) from the Faculty of Sport and Education. The distribution of participants by year of study was fairly even with 33% in year one (<italic>n</italic> = 37), 30% in year two (<italic>n</italic> = 34) and 29% in their third and/or final year (<italic>n</italic> = 33); 3% reported their year of study as other (<italic>n</italic> = 6), and 5% had missing data (<italic>n</italic> = 3).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0017896911406967">
<title>Alcohol consumption</title>
<p>Responses to how often students typically consumed alcohol were grouped into three categories: less than once per week; one to three times per week; and over three times per week. Reported typical alcohol consumption was strongly correlated with the reported consumption of alcohol in the previous week (Spearman’s correlation coefficient = 0.628; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, two tailed). The mean age of participants was not significantly different between the categories of typical alcohol consumption (Welsh = 2.58, <italic>df</italic> = 2, <italic>p</italic> = 0.09). Both males (<italic>n</italic> = 14, 56%) and females (<italic>n</italic> = 53, 62%) most commonly reported that they consume alcohol between one and three times per week; however, there was a significant difference in the pattern of reported typical alcohol consumption by sex (chi-squared = 6.557, <italic>df</italic> = 2, <italic>p</italic> = 0.038), with 24% of males reporting that they typically consume alcohol more than three times per week compared with 7% of females.</p>

<title>UK national recommendations</title>
<p>The UK Government consider a sensible weekly intake of alcohol per week to be no more than 14 units for women and no more than 21 units for men.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0017896911406967">20</xref></sup> Drinking over these limits is considered hazardous to health. In addition, women consuming 35 or more units, or men consuming 50 or more units within one week are considered harmful to health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0017896911406967">12</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0017896911406967">Table 1</xref> shows that 32% of responders are drinking levels that place them in the hazardous category, with a further 26% drinking at weekly levels considered to be harmful to health. While the mean age for responders in the hazardous and harmful categories was lower than the no alcohol and sensible alcohol categories, the difference in age was not statistically significant (Welsh = 2.239, <italic>df</italic> = 3/50.0, <italic>p</italic> = 0.095). In addition, there was no significant difference in weekly alcohol intake group between males and females (chi-squared = 2.279, <italic>df</italic> = 3, <italic>p</italic> = 0.517).</p>

<p>The government recommend a maximum daily alcohol intake of no more than three units for women or four units for men; women drinking in excess of six units and men drinking in excess of eight units within one day are considered to be binge drinking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896911406967">11</xref></sup>. Overall, 73% of responders reported drinking above the recommended maximum daily alcohol intake level at least once during the previous week, with 69% of these drinking levels that place them in the binge-drinking category. There was a significant difference in the age of participants by maximum daily alcohol intake level (Welsh = 3.814, <italic>df</italic> = 3/13.0, <italic>p</italic> = 0.037), with post hoc tests revealing that this difference was predominantly due to responders who consumed no more than the recommended maximum daily alcohol intake the previous week being, on average, older than responders who were binge drinking at least once the previous week (Games–Howel = 9.46, <italic>p</italic> = 0.054). There was, however, no significant difference between males and females in the percentage who had at least one binge episode during the previous week (Binomial test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.124).</p>
<p>Over 80% of participants (including 16% who did not consume alcohol) acted in accordance with the government’s recommendation that people should have at least two consecutive alcohol-free days each week.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0017896911406967">12</xref></sup> Age did not influence the number of alcohol-free days reported (<italic>F</italic>-test = 0.212, <italic>df</italic> = 3/109, <italic>p</italic> = 0.888) and there was no significant difference in the proportion of participants acting in concordance with the guidelines by sex (chi-squared = 0.420, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic> = 0.517).</p>
<p>Over half (57%) of participants had an estimated blood alcohol level over the legal drink driving limit (i.e. over 80 mcg per 1 ml blood) on at least one occasion in the previous week. Age did not appear to be a significant factor (Welsh = 2.42, <italic>df</italic> = 3/44, <italic>p</italic> = 0.078) and there was no significant difference in the proportion of participants drinking over the legal driving blood alcohol limits by sex (chi-squared = 0.001, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic> = 0.977).</p>

<p><italic>Non or light drinkers</italic> represents just over one quarter (<italic>n</italic> = 29, 26%) of all participants and includes the 18 students who did not consume alcohol the previous week.</p>
<p><italic>Less frequent drinkers who binge drink</italic> accounts for the largest proportion of participants (<italic>n</italic> = 50, 44%). These participants consumed alcohol on average approximately twice per week (95% CI: 1.8–2.2 days), but binged on these occasions over 70% of the time.</p>
<p>The two groups identified as <italic>habitual drinkers who binge infrequently</italic> and <italic>habitual drinkers who binge drink</italic> account for 12% (<italic>n</italic> = 13) and 19% (<italic>n</italic> = 21) of responders, respectively. <italic>Habitual drinkers who binge infrequently</italic> consumed alcohol on most days (mean: 5 days, 95% CI: 4.2–5.8), but binged on average less than once per week (mean: 0.77 days, 95% CI: 0.32–1.22) and consumed a similar amount of alcohol overall to <italic>less frequent drinkers who binge drink</italic> – 23.7 units (95% CI: 16.0–31.3) and 22.2 units (95% CI: 19.6–24.8), respectively.</p>
<p>Perhaps not surprisingly, the <italic>habitual drinkers who binge frequently</italic> group consumed the greatest mean volume of alcohol (mean = 61.1 units; 95% CI: 50.3–72.0), consumed alcohol on most days (mean: 4.7 days, 95% CI: 4.1–5.2) and binged on average 73% of the time (mean number of binge-drinking days = 3.3 days, 95% CI: 2.8–3.8).</p>
<p>There was a significant difference in age between the groups (Welch = 7.159, <italic>df</italic> = 3/32, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001). Post hoc tests revealed that responders in the <italic>less frequent drinkers who binge drink</italic> group (mean = 20.3 years, 95% CI: 19.67–20.93) were significantly younger than both the <italic>non or light drinkers</italic> (mean = 26.24 years, 95% CI: 22.69–29.79) and the <italic>habitual drinkers who binge infrequently</italic> (mean = 25.62, 95% CI: 21.57–29.67) groups. The mean age for responders in the <italic>habitual drinkers who binge drink</italic> group was 22.62 years (95% CI: 20.50–24.73). The distribution of alcohol-drinking behaviour by sex was significantly different (chi-squared = 6.466, <italic>df</italic> = 2, <italic>p</italic> = 0.039), with a greater proportion of females in the <italic>less frequent drinkers who binge drink</italic> group compared with males (50% compared with 24%) and a greater proportion of males in the habitual drinkers groups (binge infrequently and binge drink; 12% and 36% compared with 11% and 14%, respectively).</p>

<p>Nearly all (95%) of the participants in the <italic>habitual drinkers who binge drink</italic> group consumed harmful levels of alcohol the previous week.

All participants in the <italic>less frequent drinkers who binge drink</italic> and <italic>habitual drinkers who binge drink</italic> groups binged at least once during the previous week, compared with just over half (54%) in the <italic>habitual drinkers who binge infrequently</italic> group. The pattern of alcohol-free days reveals that everyone in the <italic>non or light users</italic> and <italic>less frequent drinkers who binge drink</italic> groups, and over half (54%) of participants in the <italic>habitual drinkers who binge infrequently</italic> group remained alcohol free for at least two consecutive days. Comparatively, less than one quarter (24%) of participants in the <italic>habitual drinkers who binge drink</italic> group remained alcohol free for at least two consecutive days; most participants (90%) in this group did, however, remain alcohol free on at least one day. All participants in the <italic>non or light drinkers</italic> group and over half (54%) of participants in the <italic>habitual drinkers who binge infrequently</italic> group remained within the safe drink driving limits throughout the previous week; this contrasts with only 22%, and 10%, respectively, of participants in the <italic>less frequent drinkers who binge drink</italic> and <italic>habitual drinkers who binge drink</italic> groups.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Within the current sample most students appear to be following the UK Government’s recommendation for two consecutive alcohol-free days per week. Total weekly alcohol consumption is, however, generally high with 58% drinking levels considered hazardous (over 14 units for females, over 21 units for males). Most students reported binge drinking (over six units for females, over eight units for males) at least once during the last week. Cluster analysis revealed four distinct groups. Members of the <italic>non or light drinkers</italic> group, which was made up of approximately one quarter of all students, was the only group in which the majority of students were following national guidelines for sensible drinking. <italic>Less frequent drinkers who binge drink</italic> was the largest group, with all members binge drinking at least once and abstaining from alcohol on two consecutive days the previous week. Eighty per cent of students in the <italic>less frequent drinkers who binge drink</italic> were consuming hazardous or harmful weekly levels. Of the problematic alcohol consumption behaviours we investigated, the results suggest that binge drinking is the most common problematic behaviour within our sample.</p>
<p>The overall percentage of students drinking over the government’s sensible weekly limits identified in this study is similar to the results found in other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0017896911406967">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0017896911406967"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0017896911406967">23</xref></sup> Where previous studies found higher percentages of males drinking in excess of sensible weekly limits (58–63%) compared to females (17–48%), this current study found similar proportions of males and females exceeding recommended weekly limits. The current study also found higher levels of binge drinking than reported elsewhere (previous studies have reported rates of 28 and 46%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0017896911406967">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0017896911406967">23</xref></sup> This difference could be due to the differences in the definition used to identify binge-drinking episodes and the methods used to identify binge episodes. Previous work has defined binge drinking as drinking at least half the weekly sensible number of units in one drinking episode (i.e. 10.5 units males, seven units females). The distinct alcohol-drinking behaviour groups identified in the current study are similar to the groups identified in the general population by Slater et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0017896911406967">24</xref></sup> Slater et al. defined five distinct groups: non-drinkers, light drinkers, moderate drinkers, episodic drinkers and regular heavy drinkers. Within the current study, however, the analysis placed non-drinkers and light drinkers in the same category.</p>
<p>One of the strengths of our study is the inclusion of a measure of eBAC. It is acknowledged, however, that the accuracy of this estimate depends upon the accurate reporting of alcohol consumption and weight. Additional limitations of the current study relate to the sample population. The sample is predominantly female and most were recruited from only two faculties. In addition, while over 100 students were recruited, this still represents a small and self-selected percentage of the overall population. As such, any extrapolation to the wider student population should be done with caution. Finally, this study provides only a snapshot of student drinking behaviour over one week and therefore does not provide information on drinking habits over time, or the likely consequences of short-term and long-term heavy drinking.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, this study is the first to systematically apply UK Government guidelines to the reported alcohol consumption of students. It provides insight into those behaviours that could be targeted by future interventions. Social norms-based interventions could be one way of reinforcing the positive behaviour of the majority of students while altering problematic drinking behaviour. In addition, this study suggests that there is a sizeable minority of students who would benefit from targeted brief intervention (i.e. the habitual drinkers who binge drink). In particular, those students reporting levels of consumption of at least three times over the driving limit level are of concern.</p>
<p>It is acknowledged that not all students who reported risky behaviour will continue to do so across the life course. These students are, however, at increased risk of immediate consequences, such as visits to accident and emergency (A&amp;E), missed classes and unsafe sexual behaviour. This, combined with the evidence that high levels of consumption while at university increase the risk of long-term alcohol misuse/dependence, makes intervening with this group worthwhile.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study confirms that a sizeable number of students are drinking at daily and weekly alcohol levels in excess of national sensible drinking guideline, but that most students abstain from alcohol on two consecutive days. Four distinct alcohol consumption behaviour groups were identified, suggesting that consumption patterns are not homogeneous across the student population. While members of one group generally exhibited sensible alcohol-drinking behaviour, members of other groups were participating in risky alcohol-drinking behaviour in terms of weekly consumption and/or daily consumption. The distinct patterns of behaviour across the four groups identified suggest that personalizing interventions to address specific problematic behaviours, while using population level intervention to reinforce positive behaviour, may be an effective way of moderating the level of alcohol (mis)use within the student population.</p>
