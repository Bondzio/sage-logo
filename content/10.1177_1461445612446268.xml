<p>Using the data from her ethnographic study of a San Francisco Bay area high school in the mid-1990s, Mary Bucholtz explores the ways in which white youth position themselves in an ever-changing, multiethnic social order. She addresses the topic from the perspective of sociocultural linguistics, a framework that draws on sociolinguistics, linguistic anthropology and conversation analysis, among others. Specifically, sociocultural linguistics conceptualizes identity as a repertoire of styles, defined as ‘ways of doing things that are associated with culturally recognizable social types’ (p. 2). While not ignoring the stylistic choices of young people from other ethnoracial backgrounds, the book intends to pull into view the identity-implicative practices of a group that has not garnered much research interest so far. As the author argues, whiteness is not always salient in interaction, but rather can be found in its absence in discourse or in contrast to the styles of other groups. Although the hegemonic status of whiteness in the United States and its treatment as unremarkable may make it a more challenging subject to explore, this book shows convincingly that whiteness, too, is a discursive accomplishment rather than a state of being.</p>
<p>The first two chapters of the book serve as an introduction to the subject matter explored within the volume. The first chapter is a brief discussion of identity, racial discourse, whiteness and the theoretical frameworks of the study. The second chapter is a description of the local cultural context at the site of the ethnographic study. In addition, the author discusses her methods as well as several ethical issues she faced as a white researcher in her collection of data, which consisted primarily of audio-recorded ethnographic interviews and informal interactions, field notes, student-drawn maps and various school-related items such as yearbooks and fliers.</p>
<p>The rest of the chapters, save for the concluding one, contain the main analytical component of the volume. Chapter 3 focuses on the social geography of the school through the eyes of the students themselves. In this chapter, the author analyzes student-drawn maps of the different social groups and explores how they view, label and discuss the physical space around them in terms of racial and stylistic divisions that are pertinent to their own social experience. Chapter 4, building upon the previous chapter, explores race and style in the use of slang, especially the appropriation of linguistic features of African American Vernacular English (AAVE) into white youth styles, and the issues of linguistic ownership that arise from these practices. Chapters 5 through 7 are the main focus of the book, and examine three different white youth styles: nerds, hip hop fans and preppies. Bucholtz’s analyses take into account a variety of semiotic resources, from clothing choices to the use of specific linguistic features. Particularly interesting are her discussions of social evaluation by the preppies, stylistic uses and maintenance of AAVE by hip hoppers, and the refusal of ‘coolness’ by nerds, for whom the author appears to have a particular liking.</p>
<p>The next three chapters move away from discussions of style, and focus on how white students discuss race. Chapter 8 is concerned with the discourse of colorblindness and how it manifests in talk about cross-ethnic friendships; in contrast, Chapter 9 addresses the issues of racial fear and resentment in narratives of conflict. In Chapter 10, the author analyzes how youth of European-American ancestry categorize themselves ‘for the record’ in ethnographic interviews and the different types of responses she received, ranging from unmarked to those that problematized the very task of answering questions of ethnicity.</p>
<p>Although the book does a good job of demonstrating the discursive nature of identity, the main weakness of this study is the lack of recorded observational data of the students engaged in their daily lives inside and outside of school. The maps and interviews, which make up the vast majority of her transcript data, are important components of the research database, and the fact that the interviews often break from the traditional dyadic format is excellent as well. Yet, while these interviews are a rich source of data, the researcher is always present as a participant and intended overhearer who shapes the interaction through her questions, reactions and responses even when participants talk to others present in the interaction. To be sure, Bucholtz follows a well-established tradition in sociolinguistic ethnographies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461445612446268">Eckert, 2000</xref>), but the inference that students’ language practices in the interview correlate to their practices in ordinary peer activities can be problematic. It would have perhaps strengthened the author’s arguments if there had been more data of students interacting with each other outside of the institutional activity of the interview, especially since, as the author herself notes, the students were very much attuned to the fact that race was a topic of great local and national interest and this may have impacted the ways – or even the very fact – that they approached race-related topics in conversation.</p>
<p>Despite these reservations, <italic>White Kids</italic> is an excellent study of the generally overlooked identities and styles of white youth, and is a recommended read for not just race and youth researchers, but any researcher with an interest in the study of identity, especially from a discursive view. This book is an excellent addition to a growing literature on identity in interaction. Bucholtz intelligibly compiles and applies theories and methodology from a variety of disciplines, but because the theoretical underpinnings of this study are not always explained in much detail, the book will speak most immediately to readers with a sociolinguistic background. However, the language of this book is erudite but easily accessible, and with the right guidance, even a relative novice to interactional sociolinguistics or linguistic anthropology will find this book an outstanding, enlightening read.</p>
