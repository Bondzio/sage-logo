<abstract>
<p>A 15-year-old boy presented with a locked knee after a football injury. Sudden valgus impact to the planted right leg caused a patellar osteochondral fracture diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging. The 2.5-cm fragment had avulsed off the medial facet without damage to the medial retinaculum or the medial patellofemoral ligament. The fracture was stabilised with headless compression screws. It had healed at 8 weeks, with the patient being able to bear full weight, and with a full range of active knee movement. At 4 months, he had returned to playing football for his school team.</p>
<p>Normally, such a fracture occurs due to sheering force on the patella against the femur during the relocation phase of an acute patellar dislocation. In this case, the patella may have subluxed and then reduced spontaneously, without causing a true dislocation or damage to the medial soft tissue restraints. The energy dissipated at contact with the femur would however be sufficient to sheer the fragment off the patella. We believe this is the first report of successful repair of an osteochondral patellar fracture sustained by this mechanism.</p>

<p>Lateral dislocations of the patella are a common injury in young patients. Osteochondral fractures of the medial patellar facet are almost pathognomonic of a traumatic lateral patellar dislocation. Kronen first described the association between patellar osteochondral fractures and patellar dislocation in 1905 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1460408612465367">Rorabeck and Bobechko, 1976</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1460408612465367">Nomura et al. (2003)</xref> have reported a 19% incidence for osteochondral fractures in knees that sustain an acute lateral patellar dislocation; 95% of these involved the medial patellar facet.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1460408612465367" sec-type="cases"><title>Case report</title>
<p>A 15-year-old boy suffered a tackle playing football at school. This was a valgus type injury to his right knee with the foot planted, following which he was unable to stand and fell over. No displacement of his kneecap was reported. In the trauma clinic, he complained of pain mainly over the lateral aspect of his knee. Examination revealed a tense suprapatellar effusion with the knee locked in 30° of flexion. There was no laxity in any of his other extremity joints. Initial radiographs did not show any obvious fracture or subluxation, but the lateral view suggested a small osseous fragment near the lateral femoral condyle. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed a defect in the medial facet of the patella, likely to be the source of the osteochondral fragment lying near the lateral femoral condyle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1460408612465367">Figure 1(a)–(c)</xref>). The medial patellofemoral ligament and medial retinaculum were not bruised and cruciate and collateral ligaments and menisci were normal.
<fig id="fig1-1460408612465367" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Intra-operative images showing the fracture and its repair. (a) Osteochondral fracture and medial patellar facet. (b) Anatomically reduced. (c) Fixed with headless compression screws.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1460408612465367-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Repeat examination suggested that this was a true locking. A diagnostic arthroscopy was planned for him. He had a full range of motion when examined under anaesthesia without significant laxity in either knee. Arthroscopy revealed the osteochondral fragment lying in the lateral gutter after drainage of the haemarthrosis. No structural derangements were seen in the menisci or the cruciate ligaments. The joint was opened through a 5-cm medial parapatellar arthrotomy. The osteochondral fragment (2.5 × 2 × 0.75 cm) had avulsed off the medial facet of the patella but still had an intact synovial fold at its inferior edge. This was anatomically reduced on to the patella, held temporarily with K-wires and fixed rigidly with three headless compression screws (3 mm Bold™ screws, Newdeal SA, Lyon, France) buried deep into the cartilage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1460408612465367">Figure 2(a)–(c)</xref>). The medial retinaculum and medial patellofemoral ligament were intact and did not need any reinforcement. The knee was washed out thoroughly, closed in layers and placed in a controlled motion knee brace (locked at 30°). The patient was allowed to mobilise non-weight bearing and discharged home on the 1st postoperative day. Outpatient physiotherapy was organised for gentle range of motion within the brace.

</fig></p>
<p>At a 3-week postoperative clinic visit, his wounds had healed, there was a mild residual effusion in the knee and he could easily flex beyond 100°. Radiographs confirmed maintenance of a satisfactory reduction, whilst a computed tomographic (CT) scan confirmed that the screw heads were buried in articular cartilage. He was allowed to commence weight bearing, and began an intensive exercise regime to strengthen his quadriceps. At his last clinic review 4 months after surgery, his knee was stable and dry, with strong quadriceps and a full range of pain-free movement. He had resumed playing football for the school team and was discharged from follow-up.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1460408612465367" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Tangential shear forces acting across the knee during an acute patellar dislocation cause its medial facet to impact against the lateral femoral condyle during the relocation phase. This dislocation-relocation produces a spectrum of lesions including:
<list id="list1-1460408612465367" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>A <italic>patellar</italic> lesion: this may be a chondral patellar lesion, (e.g. tear or flap), a detached chondral fragment with a crater on the patella or a sheared-off osteochondral fragment with a corresponding defect in the patella.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A <italic>soft tissue</italic> lesion: usually a tear in the medial patellofemoral ligament and medial retinaculum.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A <italic>femoral</italic> lesion or contusion: an infrequent finding on the lateral aspect the lateral condyle.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The patellar fragment may not always be visible on plain biplanar radiographs. A skyline view can be difficult to achieve because of the effusion and locking in the knee, but an MRI can reliably identify the osteochondral fragment and associated patellar defect. Other findings on MRI scans of these injuries include a tear in the medial patellar retinaculum or medial patellofemoral ligament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408612465367">Balcarek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408612465367">Elias et al., 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1460408612465367">Hoshino and Thomas (2010)</xref> have previously described fixation of a similar fracture using mini-Accutrak™ headless compression screws (Acumed, Hillsboro, Oregon). This was a late repair after being missed initially in the setting of a traumatic patellar dislocation.</p>
<p>It is rare to see an osteochondral patellar fracture without patellar dislocation. A literature review (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1460408612465367">Table 1</xref>) revealed two case reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1460408612465367">Bhatt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408612465367">Goh et al., 2008</xref>) where osteochondral fractures occurred without an overt patellar dislocation. Goh et al.’s patient had true locking and underwent an urgent exploratory arthroscopy. Bhatt et al. investigated their patient with an MRI prior to surgery. This showed the medial soft tissues to be intact. The fragment however could not be reattached due to size mismatch. We have reported what we believe is the first successful repair of an osteochondral patellar fracture sustained without a patellar dislocation, and without any identifiable injury to the medial retinaculum or the medial patellofemoral ligament. The mechanism suggests that the initial deformation was a subluxation, which reduced spontaneously, thus avoiding a true dislocation and any discernible tensile failure in the medial soft tissue restraints. The force during the rebound phase was however still of sufficient magnitude and at such a tangent that it caused the fragment to shear off the medial patellar facet upon contacting the femur. Early intervention allowed anatomical reduction of a sizable fragment without incurring any problems due to dimensional mismatch. The headless compression screws achieved satisfactorily rigid fixation and allowed earlier mobilisation.

<sec id="sec4-1460408612465367" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Although uncommon, the possibility of an isolated patellar osteochondral fracture should be borne in mind in a particular setting. When a young person presents with a locked knee after athletic or recreational activity in the absence of convincing clinical and radiological signs of a patellar dislocation, this diagnosis should be considered if the mechanism suggests rotational force to a fixed leg and planted foot.</p>
