      <p>Breast augmentation surgery is continuing to grow in popularity, with more than 316 000 operations performed in 2011.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X12472980">1</xref>
         </sup> This is a 213% increase from 1997.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X12472980">1</xref>
         </sup> Numerous studies have shown the positive impact of breast augmentation surgery on patients, citing overall satisfaction rates of 80.5% to 96.4%.<sup>

         </sup>
      </p>
      <p>Furthermore, improvements in quality of life (QOL)—specifically, self-confidence, social relations, and sexual function—have been noted following breast augmentation.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X12472980">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X12472980">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090820X12472980">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090820X12472980">11</xref>

         </sup> The study by Murphy et al<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090820X12472980">8</xref>
         </sup> of 455 breast augmentations showed significant improvements in sexual attractiveness, social relations, daily living, and self-image. Young et al<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X12472980">5</xref>
         </sup> reported that 82% of patients saw an improvement in self-confidence, and Stofman et al<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090820X12472980">12</xref>
         </sup> reported that 80% of patients saw an improvement in sexual satisfaction. Furthermore, although some have questioned the higher rate of suicide in breast augmentation patients,<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090820X12472980">15</xref>
         </sup> multiple studies have shown the benefits of breast augmentation from a psychological standpoint.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090820X12472980">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090820X12472980">14</xref>
         </sup> In a study of 79 breast augmentation patients, improvements were seen in self-esteem, depression, and body satisfaction at an average of only 7 months postoperatively.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090820X12472980">13</xref>
         </sup>
      </p>
      <p>Although improvements in satisfaction and QOL have been documented in the literature, few studies have used validated survey instruments. The BREAST-Q is a questionnaire designed for use in measuring patient-reported outcomes of breast augmentation, breast reconstruction, and breast reduction.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090820X12472980">16</xref>
         </sup> Six areas are examined in the questionnaire: satisfaction with breasts, satisfaction with overall outcomes, psychosocial well-being, sexual well-being, physical well-being, and satisfaction with care.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090820X12472980">16</xref>
         </sup> In terms of breast augmentation surgery, the BREAST-Q is the only questionnaire that meets international and federal standards for questionnaire development.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090820X12472980">17</xref>
         </sup> Although the BREAST-Q has been used in breast reconstruction studies,<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1090820X12472980">18</xref>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090820X12472980"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1090820X12472980">20</xref>
         </sup> this is the first study to utilize the BREAST-Q to determine patient satisfaction and QOL following breast augmentation surgery.</p>
      <p>Although enormous satisfaction has been demonstrated in an overwhelming majority of patients, dissatisfaction in a small percentage of patients has also been noted. According to van Elk et al,<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090820X12472980">21</xref>
         </sup> the cumulative prevalence of chronic pain in breast augmentation patients is 31%. Young age and small preoperative breast size were correlated with increased incidence of chronic pain. In another study by Brattwall et al,<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090820X12472980">6</xref>
         </sup> 10% of patients had increased pain and 6% had mobility difficulties 1 month postoperatively. Studies attempting to correlate dissatisfaction with patient characteristics have proven unfruitful.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X12472980">3</xref>
         </sup> Therefore, the aim of this study is, first, to use the validated BREAST-Q survey to analyze patient satisfaction and QOL improvement after breast augmentation by comparing preoperative and postoperative surveys and, second, to determine if overall satisfaction correlates with outcomes of any other category included in the postoperative survey.</p>
      <sec id="section6-1090820X12472980" sec-type="methods">
         <title>Methods</title>
         <p>This prospective study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Wexner Medical Center at The Ohio State University. All patients who were seen in consultation for breast augmentation surgery between January 2008 and May 2009 by the senior author (A.T.) were asked to fill out BREAST-Q surveys for both the preoperative and postoperative periods. Questionnaires were completed in an anonymous fashion. Preoperative surveys were completed during the initial consultation, and postoperative surveys were completed at the 6-week postoperative visit. This was a cross-sectional study, and therefore the patients who completed preoperative surveys were potentially different from those who completed postoperative surveys. Since surveys were completed anonymously, there was no way to identify those patients who completed both surveys. Patient factors collected from all women who underwent breast augmentation during this time period included age, body mass index (BMI), type of implant, size of implants, pocket used, concurrent procedures, and complications (seroma, hematoma, or wound infection).</p>
         <p>Statistical analysis was done using descriptive and summary statistics to identify a central tendency. The BREAST-Q score was calculated using the Q-score program, which converts raw survey scores of 1 through 4 or 5 to scores of 0 to 100. Larger numbers signified that patients were more satisfied, had symptoms more often, or more strongly agreed with a specific statement. An unpaired <italic>t</italic> test was done to examine the significance of changes in mean scores of satisfaction with breast appearance, psychosocial well-being, sexual well-being, and physical well-being between the preoperative and postoperative surveys. Fisher exact test was used to detect significant differences between pre- and the postoperative satisfaction for a dichotomous outcome. A <italic>P</italic> value of &lt;.05 was considered significant. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was calculated to determine whether satisfaction in the overall outcomes section of the postoperative survey correlated with any other section.</p>

         <title>Results</title>
         <p>From January 1, 2008, to May 31, 2009, 155 patients underwent breast augmentation with the senior author (A.T.). Of these patients, 59 (38%) completed the preoperative survey and 70 (45%) completed the postoperative survey. Follow-up time for all patients in this study was 6 weeks, as this was when the postoperative survey was conducted. Patient demographics are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1090820X12472980">Table 1</xref>. Demographic information for 5 patients was not available as their charts were not transferred from paper to our current electronic medical record. Average age was 35.9 ± 9.2 years (range, 18-61 years). Average BMI was 22.45 ± 3.3 (range, 16.0-36.5). Average silicone gel implant size was 384 ± 72 cc (range, 225-600 cc; 114 patients, or 76%, received silicone gel implants). Average fill volume of saline implants was 349 ± 78 cc (range, 210-540 cc; 36 patients, 24%, received saline implants). The retropectoral pocket was used in 99% of cases. Four patients experienced a complication: 1 seroma requiring in office drainage, 1 hematoma requiring a return to the operating room, and 2 wound infections that resolved with antibiotics. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090820X12472980">Figure 1</xref> shows a typical breast augmentation patient at the preoperative and 6-week postoperative time periods.</p>

            </sup> stated nearly 30 years ago, “The purpose of all aesthetic surgery is to improve the quality of life of the patient through an enhancement of her or his own self-image.” This attitude has been upheld over the years, making it important to understand patients’ self-assessments and feelings regarding the effectiveness of their treatments.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1090820X12472980">23</xref>
            </sup> When evaluating these outcomes, we should strive to use reliable, validated, and rigorously tested survey instruments.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1090820X12472980">24</xref>
            </sup> Therefore, we chose to utilize the BREAST-Q for the first time in breast augmentation patients to evaluate satisfaction and QOL in the short-term follow-up.</p>
         <p>Breast augmentation surgery remains one of the most popular aesthetic surgeries performed, with satisfaction rates of 80.5% to 96.4% reported in the literature.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X12472980">2</xref>

            </sup> Aside from improvements in breast appearance alone, patients have also noted a better QOL.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X12472980">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X12472980">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090820X12472980">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090820X12472980">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1090820X12472980">25</xref>
            </sup> In our study, we confirmed results previously reported in the literature, including statistically significant improvements in the categories of breast appearance, psychosocial well-being, and sexual well-being.</p>
         <p>Although breast augmentation surgery is extremely satisfying and is associated with QOL improvement, there have been reports of decreased function and chronic pain following surgery.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090820X12472980">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090820X12472980">21</xref>
            </sup> In our study, physical well-being was the only category to significantly decrease following breast augmentation surgery. A total of 19% of patients reported pain and/or tightness in the breast area at their 6-week postoperative visit. Since the senior author (A.T.) uses the retropectoral pocket, postoperative discomfort is likely increased due to manipulation and stretch on the pectoralis muscle, which could affect the number of patients reporting discomfort. Comparisons assessing physical well-being scores between different implant pockets would be interesting for future study. In addition, repeating the postoperative survey at a time further out in the postoperative course in future studies would help elucidate changes regarding the number of patients potentially reporting postoperative pain.</p>
         <p>Identifying factors that correlate with patient satisfaction may help to improve an already high satisfaction rate. In our study, we found that overall satisfaction was most strongly correlated to satisfaction with appearance of breasts. This emphasizes the importance of building a strong patient-surgeon partnership and providing extensive preoperative counseling to give patients a realistic expectation of their postoperative breast appearance. Interestingly, we found no correlation between overall satisfaction and physical well-being. Patients may be willing to tolerate a small amount of discomfort, especially if anticipated to be transient, for such a great improvement in breast appearance and other aspects of life. Sexual well-being and psychosocial well-being were also correlated to satisfaction with overall outcomes. Patients often will report—without being prompted—that they feel more comfortable during sex and have more confidence postoperatively. This finding is important to note because although the actual breast augmentation procedure changes the appearance of breasts, the positive effects of breast augmentation surgery extend far beyond just the physical appearance of the patients’ breasts.</p>
         <p>Future studies with larger sample sizes are needed to verify these findings. Our low response rate, which is not unexpected in a cosmetic population, may be a source of bias. Perhaps those who did not fill out surveys are in fact unsatisfied, therefore giving our study a positive bias. Conversely, if those patients who were unsatisfied might have completed surveys as a means to express their dissatisfaction, our study would be negatively biased. Fortunately, secondary to the standardized scoring system utilized by the BREAST-Q, results could easily be compared across different institutions and surgeons, which would help determine whether others’ results were similar.</p>
         <p>We also plan to collect BREAST-Q surveys from patients in a nonanonymous fashion to perform a longitudinal paired analysis and examine patient demographics in relation to satisfaction before and after breast surgery. The cross-sectional nature of this study is a limitation of our conclusions. Furthermore, this new survey instrument does not have subcategories for primary augmentation, secondary augmentation, or augmentation combined with mastopexy, so patients who fell into all of these were included in our study. Collecting surveys nonanonymously would allow us to analyze separately those patients who had primary breast augmentation versus secondary augmentation versus augmentation-mastopexy. Although only a small number of patients underwent other concurrent procedures, this should be mentioned as a limitation of this study, as the other procedures may have had a confounding effect on our results. Last, as mentioned above, we plan to conduct future studies administering the postoperative survey at a point later than 6 weeks postoperatively, because we believe that the short follow-up of the present study also limits the applicability of our conclusions. Currently, in the senior author’s practice, breast augmentation patients are not followed for 2 to 3 years postoperatively. Therefore, in the future, we will plan to continue follow-up until 2 or 3 years postoperatively to be able to administer the survey at that time and obtain necessary long-term data.</p>

         <title>Conclusions</title>
         <p>As the implementation of evidence-based medicine continues to grow in everyday practice, there is increasing pressure to use validated survey instruments to demonstrate patient-reported outcomes. In this study, we have shown that breast augmentation significantly improves satisfaction with breast appearance, psychosocial well-being, and sexual well-being. These improvements exist regardless of the significant decrease our patients reported with their physical well-being. Furthermore, patients who were satisfied with their overall outcomes were also satisfied with the appearance of their breasts and, to a lesser extent, had better psychosocial and sexual well-being. Physical well-being did not correlate with satisfaction in overall outcomes. Using a validated survey tool, we have discovered that following beast augmentation, patients are very satisfied and have improved quality of life.</p>
