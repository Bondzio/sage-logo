<p>The recent actions by the IMF and the EU in Cyprus and the threat of sequestration in the United States which will result in 10 years of devastating cuts to social programs further highlight how much the current global financial systems are in disarray.</p>
<p>Social Workers around the world came together to celebrate World Social Work Day, which is celebrated annually on the third Tuesday in March, to highlight for the global community the social work’s professions many contributions to society, and to be a part of an on-going dialogue with partners as to how various social challenges can be responded to. The theme selected this year was “Social Workers: Promoting Social and Economic Equalities” and this is a theme that I believe captures what we as social workers must be a part.</p>
<p>In 1957, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., wrote: “Our goal is to create a beloved community and this will require a qualitative change in our souls as well as a quantitative change in our lives.”</p>
<p>For over 100 years our profession has been instrumental in achieving increased civil and human rights advances in all parts of the globe. A key aspect of social works primary mission is that of enhancing human well-being and working to ensure that people are able to meet their basic needs, especially the most vulnerable among us. We have done this through our many different roles in society and in our varied fields of practice, and now we must work to ensure that those who are the most vulnerable amongst us are at the front of all of our efforts as we work for a more just economic system to be put into place.</p>
<p>Mahatma Gandhi said that “poverty is the worst form of violence”. As social workers we must redouble our efforts to eradicate poverty and to make sure that the impact of so called austerity measures which hurt the most vulnerable around the world are identified and pushed back against… and resisted…! The current global economic situation calls for us raise our collective voices and to increase in our professional unity and engagement, so that as a profession we can be more influential and relevant in the international political and economic arenas.</p>
<p>Our profession has historically dedicated itself to improving the welfare of society, of the individual and working with communities towards self-realization. We work to ensure that people are able access their own power at both the individual and community levels, and that solutions to problems are driven from the service user perspective which help to influence the way systems function and social work services are provided!</p>
<p>Paulo Freire (1970) said that:
<disp-quote>
<p>The radical, committed to human liberation, does not become the prisoner of a ‘circle of certainty’ within which reality is also imprisoned. On the contrary, the more radical the person is, the more fully he or she enters into reality so that, knowing it better, he or she can better transform it. This individual is not afraid to confront, to listen, and to see the world unveiled. This person is not afraid to meet the people or to enter into dialogue with them. This person does not consider himself or herself the proprietor of history or of all people, or the liberator of the oppressed; but he or she does commit himself or herself, within history, to fight at their side.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Freire also said that “those who authentically commit themselves to the people must re-examine themselves constantly” (Freire, 1970, p. 60).</p>
<p>The Global Agenda for Social Work and Social Development is just such a vehicle to help us to do this very thing.</p>
<p>This joint effort between the International Federation of Social Workers (IFSW), the International Association of Schools of Social Work (IASSW), and the International Council on Social Welfare (ICSW) has resulted our organizations becoming stronger, and with a shared belief that the world can be changed for the better if the profession stands together, advocating for the dignity and worth of the person; a more just world; and celebrate the importance of human relationships through the creation of more healthy environments and promoting social and economic equalities amongst people and societies.</p>
<p>In 1968, Dr. King, in his last speech in Memphis said that: “the ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy” (King, 1968). Former Secretary General Kofi Annan in a speech delivered in New York City at the United Nations said that: “the house of man will never be secure while billions live in the basement; and while a few live in the penthouse and do as they please” (Annan, 2003).</p>
<p>Our history as a profession is that of standing up and being counted when it matters … and it matters now. There are so many dedicated social work practitioners around the world who stand together during these times of challenge and controversy, and who through their commitment dedication and hard work are working to helped to ensure that the Global Agenda becomes a reality and that its impact will be felt around the world!</p>
<p>In solidarity,</p>
