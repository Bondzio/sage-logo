<abstract>
<p>Computer technology provides innovations for research but not without concomitant challenges. Herein, we present our experiences with technology challenges and solutions across 16 nursing research studies. Issues included intervention integrity, software updates and compatibility, web accessibility and implementation, hardware and equipment, computer literacy of participants, and programming. Our researchers found solutions related to best practices for computer-screen design and usability testing, especially as they relate to the target populations’ computer literacy levels and use patterns; changes in software; availability and limitations of operating systems and web browsers; resources for on-site technology help for participants; and creative facilitators to access participants and implement study procedures. Researchers may find this information helpful as they consider successful ways to integrate informatics in the design and implementation of future studies with technology that maximizes research productivity.</p>

<p>The growth of computer technology includes its use as a research tool. Optimal application of computer technology as a research tool requires nurse researchers with informatics expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193945913477245">Gugerty, 2006</xref>). Web-based studies have proven feasible and acceptable for allowing study access by diverse populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0193945913477245">Hamel, Robbins, &amp; Wilbur, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193945913477245">Moloney et al., 2009</xref>). Some challenges and/or lessons from informatics-assisted studies have been reported by nurse researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193945913477245">Bond, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0193945913477245">Conn, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0193945913477245">Duffy, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193945913477245">Loescher, Hibler, Hiscox, Hla, &amp; Harris, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193945913477245">Moloney et al., 2009</xref>) as well as researchers in other fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193945913477245">Adaji, Schattner, &amp; Piterman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0193945913477245">Chen &amp; Goodson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0193945913477245">Danaher &amp; Seeley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0193945913477245">Hamel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0193945913477245">Suarez-Balcazar, Balcazar, &amp; Taylor-Ritzler, 2009</xref>). This article presents real-life challenges and solutions encountered in informatics-assisted studies by one research-intensive college of nursing. At the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Nursing (CON), our researchers use a variety of informatics strategies to deliver interventions and aid in data collection. The Nursing and Health Informatics Core of the Center of Excellence for End-of-Life Transition Research facilitates CON investigators’ use of informatics in their studies. As part of the Core’s work, CON faculty were polled to identify recent informatics challenges and solutions in their research.</p>

<title>Intervention Integrity</title>
<p>Compliance with surveys and interventions may be an issue due to the anonymous nature of web intervention and data collection. In the reaching out, lifting up (ROLU; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193945913477245">Table 1</xref>) study, key challenges were (a) participants completing the pre- and postvideo assessments but not watching the entire video and (b) changes in the university streaming server. Solutions to these problems were to
<list id="list1-0193945913477245" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>stress, when promoting the study to prospective participants, that the entire video needed to be watched to earn the incentive;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>add a pop-up message at the top of video screen that stressed the importance of watching the entire video, informed the participant that the page would be monitored, and asked for the participants’ help by their watching and listening to entire video. This message was repeated if the participant tried to complete the postassessment without watching the video;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>add a new function—if the participant did not watch the entire video and clicked the next page to advance to the postassessments, a pop-up informed them that they had the choice of withdrawing from the study and not receiving an incentive or going back to complete viewing the video and be eligible for the incentive; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>analyze the manipulation check questions to ascertain whether participants seemed to have watched and paid attention to the video.</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>The function that documented the amount of time that the participant remained on each page was another issue. Researchers captured the time from the participant’s computer (client) rather than from the server and found that some participants spent an unreasonable amount of time completing the study (several days). Researchers learned that some college students use an application that changes the time on their computers so that they can get extra time to play computer games. To overcome this problem in future studies, our researchers recommend that the time be captured from the server rather than from the client.</p>
<p>A final issue was the deactivation of the university-supported streaming server just as the study was in the final testing phase. Without a streaming server, the participants would not be able to view the web-based video. Researchers solved the problem by dividing the video into three parts, each 10 min or less in length, and posting them to a private channel on YouTube. This solution prevented nonparticipants from gaining access to the video and allowed the participants to watch each of the three parts without leaving the single video screen.</p>

<title>Software Updates and Compatibility</title>
<p>The heart failure symptoms (HFSx; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193945913477245">Table 1</xref>) study investigators used a self-designed symptoms inventory tool and a symptoms Q-sort instrument administered via FlashQ, a web-based Q-sorting program. The FlashQ program was built based on a specific version of RealPlayer media player, and automatic updates delivered to the study pentablet computers after the study was initiated made the program nonfunctional and inaccessible to the study because FlashQ could not run the updated version. To solve this problem, the study pentablets were configured to return to the version of RealPlayer that was compatible with the FlashQ program and to block future automatic updates.</p>
<p>The physical activity in type 2 diabetes (PAT2D; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193945913477245">Table 1</xref>) study used software for the CGM iPro for continuous interstitial glucose monitoring that was only compatible with Windows XP® or earlier operating systems, and the agency where data collection was taking place upgraded its entire computer network to newer operating systems. An update was not available, and an alternate instrument was not identified. Therefore, an older computer with Windows XP® software was retained to process the study data.</p>
<p>In the strength training following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (STHSCT; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193945913477245">Table 1</xref>) studies, upgrades to the Actiwatch Score (an accelerometer with a subjective event marker) and Actiware (the software that analyzes the data from the Actiwatch Score) presented challenges. During the course of the study, additional Actiwatch Scores were needed to accommodate the growing enrollment. The subjective event marker, however, was upgraded, and the differences in the visual aspect of the subjective event marker had the potential to influence real-time data collection. A software upgrade to the Actiware further complicated matters because the older model Actiwatch Scores were not compatible with the new software. Instead of mixing devices with two different subjective event markers in the study, additional older model Actiwatch Scores were borrowed from a colleague to maintain consistent real-time data collection across all participants. The older software was used to program the Actiwatch Scores and download data were stored on the device. The data were then imported into the upgraded Actiware software, which allowed use of the enhanced data analysis components.</p>
<p>The PAIN<italic>Relieve</italic>It for adult sickle cell disease (PR-SC; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193945913477245">Table 1</xref>) study team encountered a software storage capacity problem with Access™ (Microsoft, Redmond, Washington). The study included 27 months of follow-up data collection. Given the massive amount of data collected, the database exceeded the software’s maximum size (2 GB) after 4 years. To solve the problem, the team exported the image files to an archive database and restored capacity to collect data. For future longitudinal, repeated-measures studies, the investigators plan to use a SQL (Structured Query Language) database instead of Access™ to avoid such space issues. Open source versions of SQL are available.</p>
<p>Two studies encountered issues related to use and understanding of software packages by participants. The relieve children’s pain (RCP; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193945913477245">Table 1</xref>) study researchers noted that participants using non-Windows-based computers could not access parts of the web-based intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0193945913477245">Vincent, Wilkie &amp; Wang, 2011</xref>). In the pilot study, participants were required to find a Windows-based computer to participate. In the subsequent study, two Windows-based computers were purchased for participants who did not have access to one.</p>
<p>Researchers in the physical activity in survivors of childhood cancer (PASCC; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193945913477245">Table 1</xref>) study used a self-developed, web-based survey instrument administered to a nationwide sample of young adults. Although the instructions specified what web browser (Internet Explorer) participants should use, some participants were unclear what a web browser was. Researchers communicated by email with participants who had problems, and also had phone conversations with some participants to clarify this issue.</p>
<p>The Hands-on Automated Nursing Data System (HANDS) study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193945913477245">Table 1</xref>)researchers learned that addressing all possible technical contingencies is not feasible when deploying an electronic application via the web to multiple hospitals because each health care organization typically has its own unique electronic infrastructure. Because it is essential that informatics interventions be studied under real-time conditions and beyond a single site to demonstrate generalizability, the researchers approached individuals in institutions who had in-depth knowledge of the health care organization’s technical infrastructures to help determine a common set of constraints that could be implemented simply and at little cost. As a result, those researchers were able to deploy HANDS in each study institution without adapting the software. The main lesson learned was that it is important to talk with parties within institutions who have expertise and are in a position to help design a feasible solution before approaching administrators.</p>

<title>Web Accessibility Challenges</title>
<p>The HFSx study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193945913477245">Table 1</xref>) researchers took pentablet computers to two hospital-based sites to have participants complete web-based instruments. At one clinic, the firewall blocked transmission of the data to the server located three blocks away. Negotiation with the information technology department allowed the hospital to grant a firewall exception so that data could be transmitted to the server. At the second data collection site, wireless access was not available. The researchers initially tried an external wireless access device that operated like a cell phone, but interference related to the building and hospital equipment made wireless access with the device unreliable. The solution to this issue involved connecting the laptops to the web via a cable located in the exam rooms where data collection occurred.</p>
<p>The oral conditions (OC; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193945913477245">Table 1</xref>) study team collected data at patients’ homes, where web access was often not available. The researchers anticipated this challenge and advised the programmers to save data onto the computer’s hard drive rather than entering data through a web-based data capture system. After the study visit, the data were downloaded onto a secure data storage system.</p>
<p>The PAIN<italic>Relieve</italic>It protocol for cancer pain (PR-CA; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193945913477245">Table 1</xref>) investigators planned to avoid daily synchronization of multiple pentablets by writing data to a secure local area network using the wireless capacity. Unfortunately, wireless connections do not provide instantaneous access. There can be millisecond periods of time that the wireless connection is unavailable and automatically restored, and if the software attempts to write data at that precise moment, the software does not work properly. The financially feasible solution was to abandon the wireless connection and use a cable to connect to the secure local area network. In the PR-SC (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193945913477245">Table 1</xref>) study, however, cable connections were not available at the data collection site, which meant that frequent synchronization was required. Now, the software is available as a web application with data-writing requirements accounting for the frequent break in signal access that is a function of wireless connections.</p>
<p>The CHOICES (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193945913477245">Table 1</xref>) study investigators posted the study advertisement on the Chicago craigslist website but volunteers responded from across the United States. Because the Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved the study only for recruitment from the Chicago area, these volunteers were ineligible. The investigators, however, recognized that the study procedures could be adapted to a web-only recruitment process. They applied for additional funding to conduct a multicity pilot study using only web-based recruitment and retention strategies that would potentially reduce costs.</p>
<p>The preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) study and fertility preservation study (FPS; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193945913477245">Table 1</xref>) developed and implemented informational websites to augment web recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193945913477245">Hershberger et al., 2011</xref>). One challenge that researchers in these studies recognized was the need to identify and work with moderators or gatekeepers of web communities to gain access to these communities for recruitment purposes. Our researchers recommend the following actions to prevent or alleviate issues related to the relationship among gatekeepers, website managers, and investigators:
<list id="list2-0193945913477245" list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Use clear and respectful language in all email and phone communications.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Establish a communication log to track dates, time, and text in emails, and (if appropriate) phone conversations. Include a calendar in the log to facilitate recontacting individuals at appropriate intervals if emails or calls are unanswered.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Provide gatekeepers and stakeholders with information about the high quality of the study and the credibility of the investigators early in the process. Provide examples of published research articles or other examples of the investigator’s activities to improve the health of the target population and also demonstrate sensitivity toward the population.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Consider adding a “virtual” community partner to the research team to screen the language of announcements on websites, discussion boards, or other web media for sensitivity to the target population and also to enhance engagement with the research study.</p></list-item></list></p>

<title>Hardware and Equipment Challenges</title>
<p>The Mzanga (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193945913477245">Table 1</xref>) study was conducted in rural Malawi, which presented challenges of hardware stability and power. The investigators purchased sturdy Panasonic Toughbook model computers and purchased a back-up battery for each computer.</p>
<p>The massage study (MAS; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193945913477245">Table 1</xref>) investigators encountered two equipment-related issues because computers remained in the homes of participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0193945913477245">Wilkie et al., 2009</xref>). Some participants were suspicious of the green power-indicator light, stating that they did not want “Big Brother” watching them. The researchers solved the problem by placing the pentablet in a drawer so that the light was not visible and the participant removed it to complete the daily questionnaires. Although the investigators insured the pentablets against theft, one was stolen (by a nonparticipant). In anticipation of such an issue, the investigators protected the database with a strong password and encrypted all Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)–protected data as they were written to the database.</p>

<sec id="section6-0193945913477245">
<title>Computer Literacy of Participants</title>
<p>The issue of computer literacy presented challenges to several of the study investigators in this article. In the HFSx and the OC studies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193945913477245">Table 1</xref>), many participants were older and unfamiliar with computer usage. Consequently, many participants did not choose to use the computer-based data entry system. Some patients had limited dexterity and were physically unable to use the mouse or mouse pad or touch screens on the laptop computer to enter data, and some had low literacy that prevented them from being able to read the questions on the screen. As a solution to these issues, a family member who was present or a trained research assistant entered the patient’s responses into the computer-based data collection instruments.</p>

<sec id="section7-0193945913477245">
<title>Programming Challenges</title>
<p>Researchers in the knowledge of heart attack and stroke symptoms (KHASS; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193945913477245">Table 1</xref>) study envisioned an intervention tailored to participants’ responses to previous questions that progressed through specific educational content. These researchers found it painstaking to anticipate all possible scenarios and to work with the programmer to establish this progression. Researchers in the PR-CA and PR-SC studies worked with a system analyst to develop tailored interventions prior to giving specifications to the programmers.</p>
<p>Researchers in the HFSx study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193945913477245">Table 1</xref>) carefully diagrammed the screens that they wanted for their instruments, but programmers independently inserted color. Unfortunately, the programmers elected to use red for the answer that would be most desirable, thus cueing participants to choose that response. Colors were subsequently changed to be equally appealing for all possible responses, thus avoiding undue influence on the responses.</p>
<p>Two studies illustrated that assuring that data were appropriately written to the database prior to starting data collection was essential. Researchers in the KHASS study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193945913477245">Table 1</xref>) began to analyze the data and discovered that the data to three key questions had not been written to the database. Unfortunately, the data could not be retrieved, and more participants needed to be recruited into the study to collect the necessary data. Researchers in the HFSx study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193945913477245">Table 1</xref>) found that data from the Q-sort portion of the data collection instrument were written to the database, but in a format that could not be imported into the data analysis program. The researchers contacted the creator of the program and were told that there was no solution and that data would need to be entered manually. Fortunately, a programmer with the Informatics Core wrote another program that successfully transferred the data. These researchers stressed that thorough pilot testing, including analysis of pilot data, is necessary to assure that all programming functions correctly.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A variety of challenges to informatics-assisted research have been reported previously, and our experiences support these and suggest additional challenges. Obtaining a representative sample, correct contact information, and successful delivery of study materials have been reported as key elements to prevent sampling errors when recruiting potential respondents over the web (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0193945913477245">Chen &amp; Goodson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0193945913477245">Duffy, 2002</xref>). Limiting recruitment to a specific geographic area may be challenging because the web is widely used. This issue was demonstrated in the CHOICES study when volunteers responded from across the country even though the recruitment materials were posted on the Chicago craigslist website. If the sample frame does not match the target population, results are not meaningful due to unrepresentative sampling issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0193945913477245">Chen &amp; Goodson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0193945913477245">Duffy, 2002</xref>); therefore, the researchers in this study expanded the recruitment to include a wider geographic area.</p>
<p>Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193945913477245">Loescher et al. (2011)</xref> reported that lost login passwords to access web-administered questionnaires/programs could decrease the response rate, we did not have direct experience with this challenge. Another challenge identified in the literature was that study emails could be identified as spam or junk mail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0193945913477245">Chen &amp; Goodson, 2010</xref>) and attached email files could not be opened by the intended user (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193945913477245">Loescher et al., 2011</xref>). We also did not experience this challenge because our study materials resided on separate websites or servers.</p>
<p>Contacting some participants (e.g., members of professional organizations/groups) by email has been identified as more difficult than most researchers expected because it took time to collect their email addresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0193945913477245">Chen &amp; Goodson, 2010</xref>). Although we did not experience this problem, our researchers have noted that working with “gatekeepers” may be challenging but necessary to gain access to sensitive populations. Tracking how many emails are opened and read by participants (cited as a problem in a previous study; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193945913477245">Loescher et al., 2011</xref>) is now possible through common software.</p>
<p>Environmental factors such as technical compatibility and users’ computer/web literacy affect validity of web-based studies. User literacy was particularly prevalent in several studies, especially studies recruiting older participants or economically disadvantaged participants. Compatibility of operating systems (PC vs. Apple) presented a technical challenge that was solved by providing specific equipment. We also noted that transmission of data to servers was a challenge due to firewall issues, signal interference, and how data were transmitted to servers.</p>
<p>Computer errors and inconsistent web access can decrease willingness among participants to complete questionnaires or a study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0193945913477245">Conn, 2010</xref>). Our researchers have provided some solutions to this issue. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0193945913477245">Chen and Goodson’s (2010)</xref> study, those researchers had to change their software package to personally guide some participants on how to link to or fill out the web-based questionnaires or both, and to assure participants about the anonymity of their responses. Although our researchers also encountered this issue, our researchers found that family members or trained research assistants could provide on-site assistance. In another study, some participants had problems viewing a video because the web service was not fast enough to keep them watching the video (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193945913477245">Loescher et al., 2011</xref>). Our researchers experienced challenges with the web, but they were able to transfer our video interventions to YouTube, which is widely available, reliable, and free. Limited familiarity with web technology, especially among low-income populations, is recognized as contributing to participants’ experiencing frustration as they search for information about web-based studies, and such frustration can decrease the response rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0193945913477245">Suarez-Balcazar et al., 2009</xref>). As the web becomes increasingly familiar to more people, web-based studies are not only increasingly possible but also in some cases superior to traditional methods.</p>
<p>Our biggest category of challenges is related to software updates. We found that it is critical to be aware of the software necessary to run various data collection and data analysis programs and be able to revert back to systems available before updates in order to continue to collect and analyze data.</p>
<p>It is also crucial to consider acceptability and usability of web technologies among target populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0193945913477245">Sandars &amp; Lafferty, 2010</xref>). Our experiences indicate that pilot testing increases the usability of websites by identifying and resolving possible difficulties in advance. Large fonts and icons and designs tailored to older adults with chronic illness make web-based health care interventions more feasible and acceptable among the elderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193945913477245">Bond, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0193945913477245">Chen and Goodson (2010)</xref> suggested that use of such tailored formatting to increase relevance to participants in web studies requires proper pretesting and cautious application. Our researchers concur and strongly recommend that researchers work closely with programmers and informatics experts, conduct usability testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0193945913477245">Wilkie et al., 2003</xref>) with cognitive interviews and think-aloud approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0193945913477245">Jha et al., 2010</xref>), pilot test interventions, and test data retrieval prior to launching any studies that use web technology. Well-designed screens with sufficient usability testing with the target audience will reduce the impact of web literacy issues, and newer technologies can accommodate for reading problems such as eyesight issues or inability to read.</p>
<p>Application of web technologies requires adequate financial support and qualified and resourceful human resources. When financial support is limited, one strategy is to seek computer equipment from a university surplus division, library system, or local charitable and nonprofit organizations, or to use a rebuilt product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193945913477245">Adaji et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193945913477245">Bond, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Other financial costs include the incentives to motivate participants to initiate, continue, and complete web-based studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193945913477245">Gajic, Cameron, &amp; Hurley, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0193945913477245">Suarez-Balcazar et al., 2009</xref>). Our researchers found, however, that, when using financial incentives, it is necessary to closely monitor participation and responses to assure that participants complete the required intervention prior to applying for the incentive.</p>
<p>Use of technology opens doors for nursing researchers in areas such as access to participants, delivery of interventions, direct methods of data entry, and expeditious data analysis. Using new technologies can also create some unexpected challenges. Researchers need to be aware of best practices for computer-screen design and usability testing, especially as they relate to the target populations’ computer literacy levels and use patterns; changes in software; availability and limitations of operating systems and web browsers; resources for on-site technology help for participants; and creative facilitators to access participants and implement study procedures. Researchers can use the information in this article as they consider successful ways to integrate informatics in the design and implementation of future studies with technology that maximizes research productivity.</p>
