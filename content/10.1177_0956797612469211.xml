<abstract>
<p>In the past decade, there has been an increasing interest in the effects of rewards on visual perception. Exogenous rewards have been shown to increase visual sensitivity and to affect attentional selection. Human beings, however, also feel rewarded by the correct execution of a task. It has been proposed that this form of endogenous reward triggers reinforcement signals in the brain, making the sensory system more sensitive to stimuli that have been extensively and repeatedly paired with the rewarding experiences and modulating long-term cortical plasticity. Here, we report the striking observation that a well-known visual illusion, the tilt aftereffect, which is due to a form of short-term cortical plasticity, is immediately enhanced by a concurrent and independent target-recognition process. Our results show that endogenous rewards can alter visual experience with virtually no delay.</p>

<p>Rewards modify not only people’s behavior but also their attentional priorities and perceptual analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0956797612469211">Della Libera &amp; Chelazzi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0956797612469211">Kiss, Driver, &amp; Eimer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0956797612469211">Raymond &amp; O’Brien, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, the visual system can develop an increased sensitivity to stimuli that, albeit unattended and unconsciously processed, are repeatedly and extensively paired with exogenous rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797612469211">Seitz, Kim, &amp; Watanabe, 2009</xref>). Human beings, however, usually also feel rewarded by the sense of achievement evoked by the correct execution of a task, such as the identification of a target. It has been suggested that like exogenous rewards, endogenous rewards trigger reinforcement signals in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797612469211">Karni &amp; Bertini, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0956797612469211">Seitz &amp; Watanabe, 2003</xref>). These signals, in turn, lead to enhanced processing of incoming sensory information, making the sensory system more sensitive to stimuli that have repeatedly been paired, over several days of training, with the rewarding experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797612469211">Sasaki, Nanez, &amp; Watanabe, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0956797612469211">Seitz &amp; Watanabe, 2005</xref>). In addition, in rats, learning-related cortical reorganization also can be induced by direct stimulation of reward-related neural structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956797612469211">Bao, Chao, &amp; Merzenich, 2001</xref>). Hence, rewards can increase visual sensitivity through a slow, incremental learning mechanism.</p>
<p>However, rewards can exert much more rapid effects on selective attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797612469211">Della Libera &amp; Chelazzi, 2006</xref>). For example, if a given visual feature, such as the color of an item, is paired with a monetary reward on a trial, attention will tend to be deployed to items possessing the same feature on the next trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956797612469211">Hickey, Chelazzi, &amp; Theeuwes, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, it recently has been shown that endogenous rewards also can have rapid effects on visual memory, as documented by fast task-irrelevant perceptual learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797612469211">Leclercq &amp; Seitz, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956797612469211">2012</xref>).</p>
<p>But can reward also alter immediate visual experience? To address this question, we investigated whether the rewarding experience associated with target recognition can affect the short-term form of plasticity that underlies a phenomenon of visual adaptation, the direct tilt aftereffect (TAE). The TAE is a well-known visual illusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956797612469211">Dragoi, Sharma, &amp; Sur, 2000</xref>) in which prolonged exposure to an oriented stimulus affects the perception of subsequent orientations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0956797612469211">Gibson &amp; Radner, 1937</xref>). For example, if a first grating (the adapter) is presented for a number of seconds tilted to one direction, then a subsequent vertical grating (the test grating) appears tilted to the opposite direction. Therefore, we predicted that if endogenous rewards can increase the strength of the adapter during its exposure, then a more pronounced TAE should be observed.</p>
<sec id="section1-0956797612469211">
<title>Experiment 1</title>
<p>In Experiment 1, we investigated whether the successful execution of a discrimination task during the adaptation period induced a boost in the TAE (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797612469211">Fig. 1a</xref> for an example trial sequence). To this purpose, at the end of each trial, observers reported the orientation of a briefly presented low-contrast test grating tilted to the left or to the right at various orientations. The test grating appeared after a period of exposure to an adapter grating, at the center of which a series of characters was presented in quick succession (rapid serial visual presentation, RSVP) for approximately 5 s.</p>

<p>Example sequence of trials in (a) the target-present conditions of Experiments 1 and 3 and (b) Experiment 2. In all experiments, a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) was displayed on top of a gray disk centered on an adapter grating at the center of the screen. Targets (numbers) and distractors (letters) were superimposed on the grating. Each trial began with the presentation of a fixation cross for 500 ms (not shown), followed by the presentation of the adapter and the RSVP. In Experiments 1 and 3, the adapter was presented for the whole duration of the RSVP sequence (50 frames in Experiment 1 and 20 frames in Experiment 3); in Experiment 2, the adapter was present for only the first 40 of 60 frames. A 500-ms blank-screen interval followed the end of the RSVP sequence, and then the test grating was presented for 50 ms. In Experiments 1 and 2, participants were asked to decide whether the test grating was vertical or tilted. In Experiment 3, participants were asked to discriminate whether the test grating was tilted to the right or to the left.</p>

<sec id="section3-0956797612469211">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Twenty students (14 females, 6 males; mean age = 21.3 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.77) from the University of Trento participated in the experiment. In this experiment and the two subsequent experiments, all participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and were naive as to the purpose of the research. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, and all experiments were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0956797612469211">
<title>Apparatus</title>
<p>In this experiment and the two subsequent experiments, stimuli were presented on a 19-in. ViewSonic G90fB CRT monitor (1,280 × 1,024; 85 Hz). Generation and presentation of the stimuli was made using MATLAB (The MathWorks, Natick, MA) and the Psychophysics Toolbox 3.8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0956797612469211">Pelli, 1997</xref>) on a computer with a Windows 7 operating system.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0956797612469211">
<title>Stimuli</title>
<p>The RSVP was presented on top of a gray disk (44.7 cd/m<sup>2</sup>, 1° visual angle in diameter) centered on the adapter grating at the center of the computer screen. In Experiment 1, the targets, presented on half of the trials, were three different numbers embedded within an RSVP sequence of distractor letters superimposed on a flickering (45 Hz) full-contrast adapter grating.</p>
<p>The distractors had random values of luminance drawn from a discreet uniform distribution (± 20% of contrast from the gray background, 44.7 cd/m<sup>2</sup>). The targets were chosen randomly from the numerals 2 to 9, and their luminance changed according to a staircase procedure pointing at 75% of correct recognition (of three targets). The contrasts of the adapter and the test gratings were fixed at 100% and 20%, respectively, and both covered 3° of visual angle, with a spatial frequency of 1.5 cycles per degree. The former was tilted −10° from the vertical orientation, whereas the latter could have one of five possible orientations: −4°, −2°, 0°, 2°, or 4° from the vertical orientation.</p>
<p>The RSVP sequence consisted of 50 frames (total duration = 4,400 ms), and each frame (duration = 88 ms) contained a single character. In the target-present condition, the targets could appear at any point between the second frame from the beginning and the penultimate frame in the RSVP sequence. In the target-absent condition, no targets were presented in the RSVP sequence. In this experiment and the two subsequent experiments, two consecutive targets were separated by a minimum of 5 frames (440 ms). The adapter was presented for the whole duration of the RSVP sequence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0956797612469211">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants sat at approximately 60 cm from the monitor in a dark room. Each trial started with the presentation of a fixation cross for 500 ms, followed by the adapter and the RSVP. After a 500-ms blank-screen interval, the test grating was presented for 50 ms, and participants had to report its orientation (vertical vs. tilted) by pressing one of two keys on the computer keyboard. Then a blue question mark appeared at the center of the screen, and participants were asked to report the identity of the targets by using the corresponding keys (participants pressed the space bar to indicate the absence of targets in the RSVP sequence). Visual feedback was given after each response.</p>
<p>The experiment consisted of 200 trials. On 80 trials (40%), the orientation of the test gratings was vertical, and on the remaining 120 trials (60%), it was tilted from the vertical orientation (30 trials for each of the four inclinations).</p>

<sec id="section7-0956797612469211">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Data (proportion of “vertical” responses) were entered into a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with target presence and test-grating orientation as factors. Both main effects were significant—target presence: <italic>F</italic>(1, 19) = 7.550, <italic>p</italic> = .013; test-grating orientation: <italic>F</italic>(4, 76) = 30.128, <italic>p</italic> = .0001. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0956797612469211">Figure 2a</xref> shows the proportion of “vertical” responses in Experiment 1, which suggests two important considerations. First, we observed a robust TAE, indicated by the fact that the proportion of “vertical” responses was greatest when the test grating was tilted to the left rather than vertical (as it was in a control condition in which, as depicted by the dotted gray line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0956797612469211">Figure 2a</xref>, the adapter was not presented). Second, pairwise comparisons (<italic>t</italic> tests) confirmed that the visual illusion was significantly stronger when, during adaptation, the target digits were successfully identified as compared to when no targets were presented (−4°: <italic>p</italic> = .004; −2°: n.s.; Bonferroni corrected).</p>

</fig>
<p>Data were also analyzed with best-fitting procedures, using the parameters of the psychometric functions derived for the two conditions. In this and the two subsequent experiments, the results were consistent with the ANOVA.</p>
<p>This result is consistent with the idea that target recognition, which occurred on the majority of trials (approximately 80% of correct responses), may have been accompanied by a sense of fulfillment that acted as an internal reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797612469211">Karni &amp; Bertini, 1997</xref>), thus enhancing the representation of the concomitant stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0956797612469211">Nishina, Seitz, Kawato, &amp; Watanabe, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0956797612469211">Seitz &amp; Watanabe, 2003</xref>)—namely, the adapter—and leading to a stronger visual illusion.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0956797612469211">
<title>Experiment 2</title>
<p>Although the results of Experiment 1 were consistent with the hypothesis that target recognition should trigger reinforcement signals that strengthen the representation of the adapter, an alternative interpretation is possible. Because there is evidence that attention potentiates the TAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0956797612469211">Spivey &amp; Sprin, 2000</xref>), one may hypothesize that target-present and target-absent trials involved different attentional loads. Specifically, participants could have paid more attention to the RSVP sequence when they detected the occurrence of the targets. If this were the case, and if paying more attention to the RSVP also entails a larger amount of attention deployed to the underlying adapter, then the stronger TAE could be attributed to different attentional loads between target-present and target-absent trials.</p>
<p>To rule out this possible explanation of the results of Experiment 1, in Experiment 2, the targets always were presented in the RSVP sequence. However, they could occur while the adapter was visible or after it was removed (approximately 1 s before the end of the RSVP sequence; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797612469211">Fig. 1b</xref>). If the strength of the illusion is increased by the endogenous reinforcement signals, then this effect should occur only when the targets are presented (and recognized) while the adapter is visible but not after its removal. By contrast, because the targets always were presented and their time of occurrence was unpredictable, the RSVP sequence should be attended continuously and uniformly. Therefore, the attentional explanation predicts no difference in the TAE between the two conditions.</p>

<title>Apparatus, stimuli, and procedure</title>
<p>In Experiment 2, the apparatus, stimuli, and procedure were the same as those in Experiment 1 with the following exceptions. The targets were always present during the RSVP sequence, which consisted of 60 frames (5,280 ms), but the adapter was presented only for the first 40 frames. Hence, in the during-adaptation condition, the targets appeared between the 2nd and 40th frames, whereas in the after-adaptation condition, the targets were presented during the last 15 frames. The experiment consisted of 240 trials. On 96 trials (40%), the orientation of the test gratings was vertical; on the remaining 144 trials (60%), the gratings were tilted from the vertical orientation (36 trials for each of the four inclinations).</p>

<sec id="section12-0956797612469211">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Data (proportions of “vertical” responses) were entered into a two-way repeated measures ANOVA with target time and test-grating orientation entered as factors. The main effect of test orientation and the interaction were significant—test-grating orientation: <italic>F</italic>(4, 68) = 242.182, <italic>p</italic> = .0001; Target Time × Test-Grating Orientation: <italic>F</italic>(4, 68) = 2.865, <italic>p</italic> = .03. The results in Experiment 2 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0956797612469211">Fig. 2b</xref>) replicated those that emerged in Experiment 1. Pairwise comparisons (<italic>t</italic> tests) confirmed that the visual illusion was indeed significantly stronger in the during-adaptation condition than in the after-adaptation condition (−4°: <italic>p</italic> = .009; −2°: <italic>p</italic> = .024; Bonferroni corrected).</p>
<p>This pattern of results is entirely consistent with the reward interpretation, whereas it does not appear to be compatible with the different-attentional-load explanation.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0956797612469211">
<title>Experiment 3</title>
<p>In the previous experiments, we interpreted the increased probability of the test grating’s being perceived as vertical when it was tilted at −4° as evidence that the rewarding effect of target discrimination enhanced the strength of the adapter. However, we cannot definitively exclude the possibility that, for some reason, the result was instead due to a stronger decisional bias toward the “vertical” response in the target-present as opposed to the target-absent condition rather than to a genuine change in the appearance of the test-grating orientation. To control for this possibility, we asked participants to report whether the test was tilted to the left or to the right. In addition, this modification allowed us to control how the TAE was modified by target recognition. If in the present paradigm endogenous rewards increase the strength of the adapter, then on target-present trials, the test grating should be more often perceived as being tilted to the right then to the left, at least for some of the tested orientations.</p>

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>In three experiments, we found that the TAE was magnified by target recognition during the adaptation period. We used a central discrimination task similar to that used in task-irrelevant perceptual-learning studies. This form of unintentional learning, which typically involves unseen and unattended stimuli, has been explained by proposals that the identification of the targets in the RSVP sequence triggers endogenous reinforcement signals that modulate cortical plasticity and induce long-lasting learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797612469211">Sasaki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0956797612469211">Seitz &amp; Watanabe, 2003</xref>). Here, we showed that the same mechanism also can alter the TAE, a visual illusion due to a form of short-term plasticity whose neural bases are located in the primary visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956797612469211">Dragoi et al., 2000</xref>). This finding seems to suggest that endogenous reinforcement signals, like exogenous ones, can reach early stages of cortical visual processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0956797612469211">Pilly, Grossberg, &amp; Seitz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0956797612469211">Shuler &amp; Bear, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0956797612469211">Watanabe et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the effect of reward on visual perception that we documented is different from that previously reported in task-irrelevant perceptual-learning studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0956797612469211">Seitz &amp; Watanabe, 2003</xref>). First, the effect observed in our experiments resulted in a rapid phenomenological change in perception (of the inclination of the test grating), not in a more accurate representation of the reward-paired stimulus. An analogous phenomenological change in perception, likely caused by endogenous rewards and consisting in a perceptual bias in motion detection, previously was reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0956797612469211">Seitz, Nanez, Holloway, Koyama, and Watanabe (2005)</xref>, but this change in perception emerged only after extensive training. Second, because the effect emerged for the same adapter and only on target-present trials, which were intermingled with target-absent trials, the perceptual change must have occurred at the single-trial level (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797612469211">Leclercq &amp; Seitz, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956797612469211">2012</xref>). Such fast alteration of visual perception induced by endogenous rewards is quite different from the previously reported increment in visual sensitivity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797612469211">Seitz et al., 2009</xref>), which instead relies on a slow, cumulative learning process that gradually strengthens or refines the neural representation of the stimulus repeatedly paired with the reinforcement signals.</p>
<p>To conclude, expanding on previous findings showing that monetary rewards can immediately influence attentional priority and that endogenous rewards can rapidly alter visual memory, our results indicate that endogenous rewards can also induce a fast change in visual sensory experience by modulating the form of short-term cortical plasticity underlying the TAE.</p>
