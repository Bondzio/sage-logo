<p>While I was reviewing Peter Nolan’s latest short book <italic>Is China Buying the World?</italic>, a student, sitting opposite to me on the train, was reading Oscar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309132513494318">Guardiola-Rivera’s <italic>What if Latin America Ruled the World?</italic> (2010)</xref> for her assignment. This coincidence indicates the rising curiosity of, as well as perceived threat from, the increasing influences of BRICS in global business and politics. This is particularly the case for China where news about China’s sovereign wealth fund buying a stake in Thames Water in the UK and the attempt to take over Canada’s 12th biggest oil company, Nexen Inc., have fuelled the fear that the West is about to be eclipsed to the rise of China. Popular economic books, such as <italic>Eclipse: Living in the Shadow of China’s Economic Dominance</italic> by Arvind <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309132513494318">Subramaniam (2011)</xref>, further reinforce the impression that China is buying the world indeed!</p>
<p>What makes Nolan’s book inspiring and outstanding is that he challenges this ‘consensus’. Drawing on economic data and well-constructed arguments, he suggests that ‘China has not yet bought the world and shows little sign of doing so in the near future’ (p. 143). He makes his motivation for writing this book very clear early on: ‘fear is often stimulated by lack of knowledge’, and that is detrimental to ‘peaceful international relations’ (p. 14).</p>
<p>Overseas mergers and acquisitions may provide a shortcut to global expansion for China. Nolan, however, argues that existing global business structures constrain, rather than facilitate, China from buying the world. His discussion focuses on the top 500 global firms, known as FT500. He suggests that these firms, accountable for 60% of the world’s research and development expenditure, have occupied half of the global market (p. 17). The investments of these firms inside China are almost 20 times as high as China’s FDI stock in the high-income countries (p. 98). Industries, such as aircraft, are highly concentrated and high-tech. Based on the economic penetration, Nolan stresses that ‘“we” (high-income countries) are inside them (China), but they are not inside “us”’ (p. 141). In other words, the high-income countries are literally buying China, not vice versa. Nolan also notices that the current economic recession has not undermined the domination of the global firms because they continue making profits, thanks to the support of high-spending consumers in China.</p>
<p>In contrast, China remains a ‘premature superpower’, a term coined by Martin Wolf, the chief economist of the <italic>Financial Times</italic>, as she is just a beginner in joining the global business game. According to Nolan, China fails to nurture a few ‘national champion’ firms in banking, construction, telecommunication and aircraft industries to compete with the global players. Additionally, China has limited experience in merging, and many attempts at overseas acquisitions have ended up in failure. Nolan highlights the fact that China has only succeeded in making two major acquisitions because they were sold by ‘a leading Western multinational of a low-margin, “commercialized” division that it no longer wished to operate’ (p. 141). China may have US$3.2 trillion foreign exchange reserves, but Nolan argues that they are ‘small in comparison with the combined market capitalization of Western companies and are far from sufficient for China to buy the world’ (p. 141). With reference to the economic decline of Japan since the 1990s, Nolan also wonders whether the economic growth of China will last for ever.</p>
<p>Nolan’s tenacity and skills in drawing on a wide range of economic data offer a persuasive account of the complex global business structures and intricacy. It is, however, not so certain if his arguments are able to change people’s perception about the threat of China, especially among the politicians in the high-income countries. To avoid strong political scrutiny, China has adopted a more flexible and realistic approach by joining international consortiums, such as working with the French to bid for the UK’s Horizon Nuclear Project. This incremental approach is testing China’s patience but, when opportunities come, merging any global firms in FT500 is not impossible. In the 1980s, Japan showed her determination for global expansion by overpaying for overseas acquisitions. Although it ended up in disaster, it is not certain whether China may follow similar steps in an attempt to build a strong China to divert internal discontent. Finally, recent initiatives to promote London as an offshore renminbi trading centre paves the way of making the renminbi an international currency. This will have far-reaching impacts on changing the rules of engagement in global business and politics.</p>
