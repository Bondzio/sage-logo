<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>We read with interest the article by Franz et al. regarding the use of Octenisept® for the irrigation of penetrating hand wounds. Such an article raises a multitude of questions regarding the appropriate method for management and potential for irrigating penetrating hand wounds. The complexity of penetrating hand injuries lies in their variety — the external appearance of a wound caused by a nail or dog’s tooth may appear very similar, but the damage to the soft tissues and potential complications of both mechanisms of injury are entirely different. Indeed, a small penetrating injury like a puncture wound may appear to be a small external cut, but may be hiding a partial tendon injury or foreign material inserted at the time of injury. We believe it is important that such matters are discussed for the benefit of the trainee reader, as they are often the first line in the management of such injuries.</p>
<p>We therefore insist that all penetrating wounds are thoroughly assessed and that one should maintain a high index of suspicion for injury, using surgical exploration if there is any doubt. Exposure should be adequate to allow the structures of concern to be visualized and performed with great care in the appropriate environment. We find that if exploration is required it is easier to identify structures prior to irrigation; also, the tract can be more easily seen. Any necrotic tissue should undergo debridement and the wound may have to be extended if the mechanism of injury or clinical picture raises suspicions of underlying structural damage. Late-presenting deep infection or tendon rupture is best avoided. Care should always be taken to avoid the situation whereby the wound extension causes greater morbidity than the initial wound. Finally, when irrigating any penetrating hand wound we advocate ideally irrigation from proximal to distal or deep to superficial where possible, using a low-pressure irrigation, as high pressures may spread any debris or infection proximally along the tissue planes.</p>
<p>This paper highlighted the problems of using Octenisept®; indeed, our practice is to recommend only using normal saline to irrigate wounds, as other substances can cause cell death, induce tissue swelling, or leave tissues stained, making later assessment more difficult. If appropriate, post-irrigation drainage of any cavity created is achieved using silicone multi-tubular drains. This aids in the removal of fluid and blood that may cause secondary infection.</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Re: Franz T, Vögelin E. Aseptic tissue necrosis and chronic inflammation after irrigation of penetrating hand wounds using Octenisept®. J Hand Surg Eur. 2012, 37: 61–4</p>
<p>We would like to thank Drs Riddell, Douglas, and Southern for their interest in our recent article on severe side effects after irrigation of penetrating hand wounds using Octenisept®. The authors raised some important issues regarding the appropriate method for management of penetrating hand wounds, and we totally agree with the complementary statements they made. We believe that a simple laceration of the hand, encountered in an emergency setting, is one of the most common reasons to overlook a significant injury to the tendons and neurovascular structures. Studies have shown that there is a significant incidence of under-diagnosis when emergency department staff clinically assess penetrating hand injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412443610">McNicholl et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412443610">Nassab et al., 2007</xref>). To prevent overlooking these injuries, a high level of suspicion and sound knowledge of assessment techniques are mandatory; and surgical exploration is indicated if there is any doubt.</p>
<p>The authors also made some useful comments regarding irrigation of wounds. We agree with their recommendations to use only normal saline instead of antiseptic solutions, to avoid high-pressure irrigation, and to use silicone drains for post-irrigation drainage. However, indication for irrigation and drainage of wounds without formal exploration is limited solely to simple laceration if injury to deeper structures can be excluded with absolute certainty because of wound location, accident history, and clinical assessment.</p>
<p>The key message of our article is to alert the reader of the severe side effects of Octenisept® when used inappropriately. Following submission of our article, we have already had to treat four other patients with severe aseptic tissue necrosis and chronic inflammation after rinsing of penetrating hand wounds using Octenisept®.</p>
