<abstract>
<p>This article introduces the Continent of International Law (COIL) research project on international agreement design. COIL stems from the conviction that the International Organization subfield's focus on the couple hundred international organizations with physical headquarters had to be broadened to include the tens of thousands extant international agreements, that is, international law. Each piece of international law can and should be studied as an institution. Together, this set of institutions, which truly is a “continent,” is theoretically very interesting and empirically very diversified. COIL's basic theoretical premise is that international agreement design and comparison across agreements begins by understanding the underlying cooperation problem(s) the agreements are trying to solve. COIL identifies 12 distinct and recurrent cooperation problems, which may occur alone or in combinations. The data collection features a random sample of international agreements conditional on the issue areas of economics, environment, human rights, and security. The first large-n, systematic operationalization of the cooperation problems underlying real international agreements is highlighted, and descriptive statistics are presented – some of which challenge conventional wisdom. For instance, enforcement problems (Prisoner's Dilemma-like situations) are important, but far from universal, with 30% of the agreements characterized by that underlying problem. The numerous and diverse COIL variables allow for a multi-dimensional operationalization of the difficult-to-measure concept of the “incomplete contract.” Hypotheses from contract theory are tested, confirming the appropriateness of the new measure, the weakness of measures based on number of pages, and most significant, the rationality and efficiency of the continent of international law.</p>

<body>
<p>Just over fifty years ago, in a field-defining article in the <italic>Journal of Conflict Resolution</italic>, Thomas Schelling called attention to the kind of games that intrigue scholars of international cooperation: “games in which, though the element of conflict provides the dramatic interest, mutual dependence is part of the logical structure and demands some kind of collaboration or mutual accommodation” (1958, 203). These are Schelling’s “mixed-motive games” or “non-zero sum games,” and what I refer to as “games of cooperation.”</p>
<p>Schelling argued that game theory is underdeveloped with respect to mixed-motive games—likely because of its preoccupation with zero-sum games. He states, “non-zero-sum game theory may have missed its most promising field by being pitched at<italic> too abstract a level of analysis</italic>.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022002712448904">1</xref>
</sup> By abstracting from communication and enforcement systems and by treating perfect symmetry between players as the general case rather than a special one, game theory may have overshot the level at which the most fruitful work could be done” (1958, 221). In some sense, Schelling’s 1958 article was a call to action regarding what game theory might accomplish for promoting cooperation more generally, not just for avoiding conflict. (Interestingly, Schelling’s statement is quite a contrast to that of Morton Kaplan, also published in the <italic>Journal of Conflict Resolution</italic> in 1958. Kaplan was not optimistic about the promise of game theory).</p>
<p>How did international cooperation scholars respond? Important insights were gained in the decades following Schelling’s article, especially in the 1980s. Some very noteworthy scholars suggested general means by which cooperation can be facilitated. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022002712448904">Axelrod (1984</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022002712448904">Oye (1986</xref>) suggest devices such as lengthening the shadow of the future, practicing reciprocity, and improving recognition capabilities. Krasner (1983) studies the role of international regimes in promoting and maintaining cooperation, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022002712448904">Keohane (1984</xref>) argues that regimes reduce the transactions costs of international cooperation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022002712448904">Stein (1982</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022002712448904">Snidal (1985</xref>) refine our understanding of cooperation through their analyses of Coordination Games versus Prisoners’ Dilemmas, using 2 × 2 Games to illustrate how the game states play affects the choice of regime. Indisputably, these seminal works furthered our understanding of cooperation, especially given the raging debates in international relations (IR) more generally about whether cooperation was possible and whether institutions mattered.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022002712448904">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In the 1990s, most scholars, with important exceptions elaborated below, continued debating the possibility and importance of cooperation, despite the scholarly achievements of the 1980s. And, if the possibility of cooperation was still being debated, the question of whether international institutions matter was as well. Put bluntly, the details of the earlier literature were being refined, but the analyses remained extremely abstract, with no details about specific institutional arrangements or questions of institutional design. This literature failed to investigate the precise mechanisms through which cooperation can emerge. Possibility theorems were the most common type of claim.</p>
<p>Things are changing. We are moving away from possibility theorems to empirically testable comparative static predictions. We are moving away from viewing almost every interesting problem as a Prisoners’ Dilemma (with deliverance coming from the shadow of the future) to conditional and nuanced theories. We are moving away from separate studies of games and solutions to institutions explicitly incorporated as options in the game—<italic>equilibrium institutions. </italic>We are moving away from mostly case studies to a combination of case studies and large-<italic>n</italic> testing with “scientific” data sets. And, finally, we are moving away from abstract debate to policy-relevant conclusions.</p>
<p>How are we getting there? First, we are refining the dependent variable. We accept cooperation is possible. That leads us to focus on the form cooperation takes. One implication is we are taking international law seriously. It almost seems the year 2000 was a turning point as international institutional design definitely took the front seat. Two volumes were devoted to the subject: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022002712448904">Goldstein et al. (2000</xref>) on <italic>Legalization and World Politics</italic> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022002712448904">Koremenos et al. (2001a)</xref> on <italic>The Rational Design of International Institutions.</italic> Additionally, a number of articles on the subject appeared, like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022002712448904">Smith (2000</xref>), Helfer (2005), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022002712448904">Mitchell (1994</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022002712448904">Downs and Rocke (1995</xref>), who were ahead of the curve.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022002712448904">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Second, we are refining the independent variable, differentiating among enforcement, distribution, commitment, and uncertainty problems among others. We are distinguishing among uncertainty about behavior, preferences, and the state of the world. (This is critical because these three uncertainties have unique implications for institutional design.)</p>
<p>Third, we are testing our theories. This implies we are putting a priority on collecting data. After over fifty years of intense realist–antirealist debate in IR theory, much of which turned on the question of the value of international agreements, few had systematically collected data on important dimensions of international agreements. Now, just as scholars of comparative law and politics cherish their almost two hundred countries and the institutions within them that serve as potential data points, scholars of international cooperation have discovered they too have a universe of data, including the tens of thousands original agreements registered with the United Nations (UN).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022002712448904">4</xref>
</sup> It is a vast continent indeed, with extremely detailed institutional variation. Not only are IR scholars well aware of the realities of anarchy taking seriously the details of international law; the field is also realizing its potential to study comparative institutional design.</p>
<p>The systematic collection of data on international agreements is gaining momentum. Along with high standards of intercoder reliability, testing requires precise definitions of the dependent variables regarding the form cooperation takes. Another necessary element for testing is creative, multiple operationalizations of the independent variables.</p>
<p>This article introduces the Continent of International Law (COIL), which features theoretical development, data collection, and empirical testing. Theoretically, COIL focuses on the underlying cooperation problems that bring states to the negotiating table and looks at the connections between these problems and the institutional solutions offered by optimally designed international law. In terms of data collection, COIL features a random sample of agreements across the issue areas of security, economics, environment, and human rights. It includes both bilateral and multilateral agreements, and in addition to the coding of the design features of agreements, it codes the underlying cooperation problems that brought state actors to the negotiating table—the independent variables.</p>
<p>In the following, present the theoretical and empirical foundations of COIL and briefly describe the project itself, presenting descriptive statistics that inform some current debates in IR. I then present a new analysis exploiting a set of coded variables to investigate a theoretical conjecture stemming from the economic theory of contracts: Is the incompleteness of international agreements connected to delegation of dispute resolution (just as incompleteness of legal rules increases the role of courts)? Given that incompleteness is a complicated concept to measure, the analysis, elaborated in detail in the following, hints at the research possibilities of this project.</p>

<title>Theoretical Foundations</title>
<p>The literature of the 1980s provided an important and resounding “yes!” to the question, “Can states and other international actors produce cooperative outcomes by their own, self-interested choices?” There was also general recognition that institutions may alter circumstances in ways that make cooperation more likely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022002712448904">Krasner 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022002712448904">Keohane 1984</xref>; Axelrod and Keohane 1985).</p>
<p>A major contribution of the 1990s was the recognition that, unlike the simple 2 × 2 Prisoners’ Dilemma game, states actually have a wide range of choices (i.e., many possible cooperative outcomes), often with different distributional consequences. If actors prefer different outcomes, this range of possibilities creates bargaining problems.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022002712448904">Krasner (1991</xref>) argues that coordination games do not require institutionalization if a powerful state can coordinate the actions of others, choosing which states are allowed to participate in negotiations, dictating the rules of the game, or changing payoffs. Krasner’s broader argument is that national power should be in every analysis because it has an impact on the solution of the often-present distribution problem. Morrow (1995) finds that distributional differences can undermine typical cooperative solutions and shows how regimes can structure communication among actors to promote efficient information sharing.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022002712448904">Fearon (1998</xref>) makes an important argument regarding disaggregating cooperation problems more generally. Fearon’s model integrates the bargaining over the terms of an agreement into the cooperation problem. This formulation reveals that the same shadow of the future that allows self-enforcing agreements also makes reaching an agreement more difficult by increasing the distributional effects of the selection of the initial equilibrium. Fearon’s key claim is that categorizing cooperation problems based on different games obscures important strategic patterns, like bargaining, that are omnipresent; however, the importance of bargaining and enforcement varies.</p>
<p>In their introduction to the Rational Design special issue, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022002712448904">Koremenos et al. (2001a)</xref> focus on the relationship of problems and solutions and argue for a research program based on the notion that states rationally design international institutions to solve problems. Instead of using a typology of games, they disaggregate cooperation problems as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022002712448904">Fearon (1998</xref>) suggested. Because COIL essentially continues the Rational Design research program, I expand on the latter next.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0022002712448904">
<title>From Rational Design to COIL</title>
<p>The starting point for Rational Design is a simple observation: institutionalized international cooperation is organized in radically different ways. Institutionalized international cooperation (what I and the Rational Design authors call international institutions) is any explicit arrangement—negotiated among international actors—that prescribes, proscribes, and/or authorizes behavior.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022002712448904">5</xref>
</sup> So, this includes the tens of thousands of international agreements that are registered with the UN. Crucial to Rational Design is the following theoretical premise: we cannot understand institutional design and compare across institutions without understanding the cooperation problem/problems the institutions are trying to solve. Fundamentally, states face distribution and enforcement problems. These are shaped by various degrees of uncertainty about the state of the world, the behavior of other actors, and their preferences. Finally, the number of actors and asymmetries among them affect the nature of the cooperation problem.</p>
<p>That one must understand the cooperation problems before making sense of design may sound obvious, but it is overlooked with great frequency in the policy community. For instance, many North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) specialists bemuse the fact that NAFTA does not resemble the European Union (EU). The prior question is, “Should NAFTA look like the EU?” The cooperation problems Europeans were facing when the institutions of the EU began to form in post–World War II were far more dramatic than those ever facing North America. While trade issues involve incentives to defect and hence that cooperation problem is a common one, Europeans faced a problem with Germany that could be characterized as either significant uncertainty about preferences (i.e., Could Germany be trusted? Was Germany a peace-loving state or would it go down the same path that brought about two World Wars?) or a Commitment Problem (i.e., It is just a matter of time before some future German leader follows the same destructive path). Given the Europeans had to solve either an Uncertainty about Preferences or Commitment Problem, the institutional design of the EU would likely be more elaborate than that called for by the pre-NAFTA environment.</p>
<p>Rational Design focuses on five dimensions of international institutions—the dependent variables: membership rules, scope of issues covered, centralization of tasks, rules for controlling the institution, and the flexibility of arrangements. These are not the only dimensions of institutions, but among the most important.</p>
<p>Rational design offers a set of conjectures linking one cooperation problem with one institutional design solution, for example, “Restrictive Membership increases with Uncertainty about Preferences.” I do not replicate the volume here. Suffice it to say, every conjecture has game-theoretic underpinnings.</p>
<p>Koremenos et al. are essentially arguing that the study of international cooperation problems should be more tightly linked to the study of their solutions. Indeed, one problem with the early literature is that international institutions are not explicitly incorporated as options in the game, so their causal influence has to be assessed separately from problems. While its focus on equilibrium institutions is useful, the Rational Design program also shows the study of international cooperation is by no means exhausted. With six independent and five dependent variables and straightforward game-theoretic reasoning, a list of empirically testable institutional design conjectures are generated, but this list does not consider potential interactions of different cooperation problems or design variables. COIL expands the list of both independent and dependent variables, operationalizes both with concrete definitions and examples, considers interactions, and begins the large-<italic>n</italic> testing of equilibrium institutions. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0022002712448904">
<title>Empirical Foundations</title>
<p>For researchers studying international conflict, comprehensive data sets exist.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022002712448904">6</xref>
</sup> Consequently, there has been a proliferation of empirical analyses over the past decades. Until recently, the empirical side of the field of international cooperation consisted mostly of case studies. Thus, we have lots of information about how certain variables operate in specific cases but little information about how those variables operate over the range of cases that international cooperation presents. We know much about specifics but little about averages. Simultaneously, game theory was revolutionizing the way we think about international cooperation, but without data, we were unable to test the implications systematically. This is no small matter as the process of confronting models with data should discipline the evolution of modeling.</p>
<p>There were notable exceptions. A few authors embarked on systematic studies focusing, not on international agreements, but on the much smaller set of intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) —entities with hallways and bathrooms. Some of these studies were theoretically driven; some were not. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022002712448904">Wallace and Singer (1970)</xref> undertake a purely descriptive analysis, in which they count the number of IGOs in the global system from 1815 to 1964. To be included, an IGO must consist of at least two qualified members of the international system, hold regular meetings, and have a “permanent secretariat and some sort of permanent headquarters arrangement” (p. 246). They conclude, stating, “we have tested no hypotheses, confirmed no models, and demonstrated no statistical or causal relationships between IGO and other phenomena” (p. 284).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022002712448904">Cox and Jacobson (1974</xref>) undertake an impressive, theoretically driven study of IGOs. They examine decision making and influence in eight IGOs, focusing on three independent variables: the stratification of state power, the economic and political characteristics of states, and world patterns of alignment and conflict.</p>
<p>While these works are important contributions to IR scholarship, they suffer from a number of important limitations. If we want to explain details of international cooperation, limiting ourselves to cases in which states decide to create international organizations is problematic. Significant international cooperation can take many forms, ranging from current developments in European integration to tacit bargaining strategies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022002712448904">7</xref>
</sup> Explaining this variation is one of the most interesting and important tasks currently facing scholars of international cooperation. A necessary first step is quantifying the variation.</p>
<p>In concrete terms, existing studies omit two important sources of variation in the extent of international cooperation. First, much formal international cooperation takes the form of agreements that either do not create IGOs at all or do not create IGOs that fit standard definitions. To see the extent of this omission, note that while Wallace and Singer (1970) find 208 IGOs, there are tens of thousands of international agreements. The majority of these do not call for the creation of any intergovernmental entity whatsoever. And given whether to create an IGO is a choice variable for the agreement parties, sampling on the dependent variable makes an analysis of the choice impossible.</p>
<p>Second, simply counting IGOs ignores the fact that the amount of cooperative activity supported by an IGO may change over time. Many new agreements delegate tasks to existing IGOs. Studies that focus on IGOs rather than agreements do not measure the additional international cooperation that occurs as IGOs take on new tasks. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0022002712448904">
<title>New Generation of Data Sets</title>
<p>The new generation of data sets characterizing the field of international cooperation is indeed focusing on agreements. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022002712448904">Leeds et al.'s (2002)</xref> Alliance Treaty Obligations and Provisions data set showcases theoretically driven data on alliance politics for close to a 200-year period. Mitchell’s (2008) International Environmental Agreements Project provides systematic data on variation in international environmental treaties, establishing a system for coding agreement provisions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022002712448904">Gamble (2009</xref>) is creating a working database of multilateral international agreements, with data on the agreement’s relation to other bodies of law, issue scope, and other broad macroscopic issues. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022002712448904">Gibler (1997</xref>) is collecting data regarding agreements that end Militarized Interstate Dispute. On the compliance side, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022002712448904">Simmons (2009</xref>) features a large-<italic>n</italic> database that uncovers the on-the-ground details of compliance across a range of states for four key human rights agreements. These are just some examples of current efforts. I turn to COIL next.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0022002712448904">
<title>The COIL</title>
<p>I describe the population of cases, the coding instrument, training, and glossary, and then turn to the empirical findings. Detailed discussions of these points can be found on the COIL website.</p>
<sec id="section8-0022002712448904">
<title>Population of Cases</title>
<p>The COIL sample comes from the United Nations Treaty Series (UNTS). According to Article 102 of the UN Charter, “every treaty and every international agreement entered into by any Member of the United Nations after the present charter comes into force shall as soon as possible be registered with the Secretariat and published by it.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022002712448904">8</xref>
</sup> Agreements not registered cannot be invoked before any organ of the UN.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0022002712448904">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Given the almost universal membership of the UN and its stature, its list of international agreements is one of the most comprehensive to be found. All agreements registered or filed and recorded with the Secretariat since 1946 are published in the UNTS as well as many dating back to League of Nations times.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0022002712448904">10</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The UNTS Internet site provides subject terms that can be used in searching for agreements. Four different issue areas are sampled: economics, environment, human rights, and security. The economics issue area is composed of agreements under the subject headings, “Monetary matters,” “Investment,” “Finance,” and “Agricultural commodities.” The environmental issue area is composed of agreements categorized under the heading, “Environment.” The human rights issue area is composed of agreements categorized under “Human rights” while the security issue area includes agreements under “Security” and “Disarmament.”</p>
<p>Exactly what counts as an agreement? Every original agreement found in the UNTS is considered an international agreement unless excluded by one of the following five rules: First, I excluded agreements whose goal is to establish the procedures or location of the negotiations of other agreements. Second, I excluded agreements not between at least two states. Thus, agreements between one state and an international organization were excluded; agreements negotiated within an international organization but that involve two or more states were included. Third, I excluded agreements that do not prescribe, proscribe, or authorize behavior that is observable in principle. That is, agreements not specific enough to include (at least potentially) objective criteria for determining performance are excluded. Fourth, I excluded agreements whose sole ambition is to implement the provisions of other international agreements. That is, agreements whose terms are closely anticipated and identified in the underlying agreement were excluded from the sample. Examples of implementing agreements that are included in the sample are those that both implement and extend the underlying agreement, those that specify and/or interpret the provisions of a vague underlying agreement that would be excluded, and those that implement a law of a particular state.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0022002712448904">11</xref>
</sup> Fifth, agreements extended through time, whether by default after the passage of a specified duration or by means other than default, are counted only once, not as separate international agreements. Renegotiated agreements on the other hand, constitute separate international agreements.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0022002712448904">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The sample is displayed on the COIL website. Also detailed there are examples of excluded agreements. By far, the great majority of excluded agreements are between one state and an IGO, so no judgments calls needed to be made. Very few agreements are excluded under the fourth rule, and no agreements are excluded under the fifth rule given I count extensions and renegotiations of agreements just as the UNTS does.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0022002712448904">
<title>Coding Instrument, Training, and Glossary</title>
<p>A coding instrument, with ten sections, was used to record the details of the agreements. The questions cover, among other things, the underlying cooperation problem/problems; main prescriptions and proscriptions; whether there are preambles, annexes, or appendices; membership criteria; and compliance, enforcement, and flexibility provisions. The member states Correlates of War (COW) codes the year the agreement was concluded are also recorded so that other characteristics of the parties (polity score, gross domestic product, etc.) can be easily merged with the data.</p>
<p>The reasonableness and consistency of the coding are very important issues in any data collection effort. Coder training was a nine-month process, including two semester-long courses with the principal investigator (PI). Every agreement in the data set was coded independently by <italic>at least</italic> two coders. An intercoder reliability report was generated and highlighted disagreements among coders for the 375 questions for which there is a quantitative answer (multiple choice, yes/no, etc.). In cases of disagreement, the responses were examined, and the disagreement resolved by the PI in consultation with the coders. The average coded agreement was characterized by disagreement on approximately fifteen questions, or 4 percent of the quantitative questions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0022002712448904">13</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Coding proceeded agreement by agreement. This approach (labeled AVFEC<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0022002712448904">14</xref>
</sup> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022002712448904">Mitchell [2006</xref>, 43]) was used rather than a coding scheme whereby each variable across agreements is coded at the same time. While the AVFEC approach is criticized for reducing empirical regularity in the coding, despite its efficiency in terms of understanding the detailed context of an agreement (which helps coders resolve the meaning of ambiguous provisions), this claim is alleviated by the intercoder reliability report process. Additionally, before certain data are used/released, a third coder checks particular variables across all agreements. For example, as a check on the coding of precision, which unlike many variables requires a judgment call, a third coder looked at the entire set of agreements, focusing only on precision.</p>
<p>A glossary is also displayed on the COIL website, with the main entries being the key terms in the instrument. Examples of variables are provided, featuring well-known international agreements.</p>
<p>This glossary is important for three reasons. First, to ensure intercoder-reliability, coders must be operating with precise definitions. Second, some terms have never been succinctly defined. Concepts such as “international body” are the cornerstone of much IR scholarship yet have never been carefully phrased with definitional boundaries. Third, given the relationship developing between international law and IR, comparison of their respective definitions should prove useful.</p>
<p>A crucial part of COIL is the coding of cooperation problems. The following possible answers were added to the Rational Design independent variables to capture as fully as possible the range of problems states tend to face: domestic commitment/time inconsistency problem, encouraging positive externalities, discouraging negative externalities, breaking deadlock, the exportation/codification of norms, coordination games, and foreign aid/development assistance.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0022002712448904">15</xref>
</sup> Of course, more than one answer can be chosen for each agreement, thus circumventing the problem of forcing real-life issues into 2 × 2 Games. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022002712448904">Table 1</xref>, which is discussed in the following, showcases the full list of cooperation problems.</p>

<p>This aspect of COIL is significant because scholars have been talking about “games of cooperation” for decades. Nonetheless, measuring what these games might look like and their prevalence in real international agreements has heretofore not been attempted, despite their centrality in our theories. Obviously, these questions are not nearly as straightforward as those pertaining to design. An inference must be made from the agreement to the cooperation problem/problems. Nonetheless, some factors should alleviate concerns. First, the inference comes by looking at relevant background information. Sometimes, negotiators reveal and document the problems they were attempting to solve. Other times, the political history of the states must be examined the decade/decades before the agreement is signed to determine whether the agreement may be serving to solve a domestic commitment problems—as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022002712448904">Moravcsik (2000</xref>) argues regarding newly democratized states and human rights agreements. In a bilateral agreement, the relationship of the dyad in the decade/decades before the agreement is signed is examined. Research is also done on the general problems of the sub-issue at the time. Importantly, only the substantive goals of the agreement are looked at when trying to infer the underlying cooperation problem/problems, not the design aspects. This separation is critical to the integrity of the project, which focuses on the nexus between cooperation problems and design aspects of international agreements.<sup>

<title>Empirical Findings</title>
<p>A large number of existing questions can be probed or tested with the data, and new questions can be generated by looking at descriptive statistics. I offer a glimpse here, beginning with the theoretical category of the cooperation problem. Given this is the first large-<italic>n</italic>, systematic operationalization of the underlying cooperation problems in real international agreements, I expand on the findings. I then discuss some design provisions regarding nonstate actors and asymmetries within agreements.</p>
<sec id="section11-0022002712448904">
<title>Cooperation Problems Underlying International Agreements</title>
<p>As the last column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022002712448904">Table 1</xref> demonstrates, Uncertainty about the State of the World is the most common cooperation problem: two-thirds of the agreements attempt to solve it.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0022002712448904">17</xref>
</sup> The pervasiveness of such uncertainty is not surprising, given the numerous potential domestic and technological shocks that may affect international cooperation. The idea that international law can be used to solve domestic problems is given support by the about 24 percent of agreements that solve Commitment problems. Enforcement problems are important, but perhaps not as all important as previously thought, with 30 percent of the agreements characterized by that underlying problem. We rarely see states trying to break a Deadlock problem. And Uncertainty about Preferences is perhaps a great strategic obstacle to initiating negotiations, with only 10 percent of agreements attempting to solve it. Future work will address whether this low incidence results from clear preferences (as is probably the case in economics) or from such uncertainty posing too risky an obstacle to cooperation.</p>
<p>Looking at cooperation problems by issue area, additional interesting findings emerge. Economic agreements are often used to solve Commitment problems, but almost never is the issue area characterized by Uncertainty about Behavior. The prevention of Negative Externalities underlies most environmental agreements, but a nonnegligible number of security agreements can be characterized that way as well.</p>
<p>Consider the human rights issue area in greater detail because it is often argued that a game-theoretic framework is inappropriate for understanding this issue area.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0022002712448904">18</xref>
</sup> Not unexpectedly, human rights score high on Uncertainty about Behavior. It is very difficult to see if human rights standards are being upheld in schools, in offices, in prisons, and so on without on the ground monitoring.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0022002712448904">19</xref>
</sup> But this cooperation problem also characterizes many environmental agreements, where it is difficult to see what individual firms are doing with respect to pollution controls and so on. Human rights is the issue area in which parties are most likely to try to resolve Uncertainty about Preferences<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0022002712448904">20</xref>
</sup> while they never do in economics and environmental agreements.</p>
<p>Additionally, more than any other issue area, one goal of human rights agreements is to Codify/Export Norms. Still, while the prevalence of norm exportation seems to make the issue area unique, many disarmament agreements also attempt to create norms as do agreements in the environmental issue area.</p>
<p>Some human rights agreements, like those bilateral agreements governing reciprocal rights for workers, are indeed characterized by a PD-like payoff structure and hence coded as having underlying Enforcement problems. A state wants its workers to be treated well in other states, but would prefer not to spend resources on foreigners working within its borders.</p>
<p>Finally, human rights is the issue area most likely to be characterized by an underlying Distribution problem. When sitting down at the table to negotiate human rights agreements, states can disagree about a number of things—most principally, what rights should be included and how those rights should be defined. This Distribution problem may arise from ideological differences, cultural differences, or the gap between a state’s current practice and the proposed standard. However, unlike classic issue areas for which there are Distribution problems (territory or technical standards), the human rights issue area rarely poses a Coordination problem, one of the issue area’s unique features.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0022002712448904">21</xref>
</sup> Thus, by looking at the underlying cooperation problems that characterize the human rights issue area as well as those that do not, we gain insight into what makes the issue area unique and how it is similar to other issue areas, thereby deepening our understanding of all issue areas. </p>

<title>Role of Nonstate Actors in International Agreements</title>
<p>Many argue nonstate actors are increasingly important in international cooperation, in particular, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022002712448904">Table 2</xref> illustrates, almost half of the agreements mention nonstate actors, with human rights agreements alluding to them about three-fourths of the time.</p>

<p>Still, as <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022002712448904">Table 2</xref> shows, the most common nonstate actor is an IGO, composed of and controlled by states. In economics, individuals sometimes play a role in dispute resolution.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0022002712448904">22</xref>
</sup> NGOs are mentioned in about 33 percent of human rights agreements but rarely if ever in other issue areas. A recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022002712448904">Green (2010</xref>) on delegation in environmental agreements reinforces these conclusions with data featuring the post–cold war period.</p>
<p>What role do NGOs have in the human rights agreements that mention them? The COIL website lists/defines a possible nine tasks that can be delegated to nonstate actors.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0022002712448904">23</xref>
</sup> Interestingly, in this random sample, only two tasks are delegated to NGOs: having a role in implementing the agreement, as is the case with many International Labour Organization (ILO) agreements that allow workers groups to be consulted regarding policy, and having a role in monitoring compliance.</p>
<p>Has formal NGO involvement increased over time? Measuring time as a continuous variable, in decades, and in thirds, there is no consistent relationship between time and NGO involvement (or nonstate actor involvement, more generally). There is actually a negative relationship between time and nonstate actor involvement in environmental agreements.</p>
<p>Still, NGO involvement may be increasing in ways the data are not measuring and which suggest complimentary research agendas. Foremost is NGOs role in mobilization/agenda setting in the areas of the environment and human rights. NGOs may also be critical to the implementation of agreements in ways not formally called for by states, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022002712448904">Simmons (2009</xref>) demonstrates. Finally, they may be shaping preferences.</p>

<title>Is Power Reflected in International Law?</title>
<p>As stated in the introduction, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022002712448904">Schelling (1958</xref>) claimed symmetry among players is almost always assumed as the general case. Rational Design argues that “Asymmetry of Control increases with Asymmetry of Power” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022002712448904">Koremenos et al. 2001a</xref>). One question we can probe with the data is, “Are power asymmetries reflected in international agreements?”</p>
<p>The symmetry of agreements is coded as symmetric, mildly asymmetric, which implies asymmetries with respect to procedural rights and responsibilities accorded to members (voting, ability to monitor, etc.), or profoundly asymmetric, which implies asymmetries with respect to substantive goals, as in the well-known Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. In the random sample, 21 percent of agreements are asymmetric. While to some scholars this may seem low, recall bilateral agreements dominate in the random sample just as they do in international law, and bilateral agreements which “trade apples for oranges” cannot be judged substantively asymmetric since economists tell us we cannot compare apples and oranges! Not surprisingly, human rights agreements are never asymmetric. Interestingly, almost a quarter of economic and almost half of all security agreements are asymmetric with respect to the procedural rights and responsibilities accorded to their members. For example, during the Bretton Woods negotiations, the US executive used its negotiating power to limit the maximum contribution to the International Monetary Fund to what Congress would be willing to authorize, thereby ensuring that no other state would have greater control, given weighted voting!</p>
<p>What about the Rational Design conjecture? The one profoundly asymmetric agreement and almost all mildly asymmetric agreements have superpower membership. Hence, the data provide initial support for the conjecture.</p>

<title>The Elusive Concept of the Incomplete Contract</title>
<p>Not only are COIL variables individually useful; they can also be combined to operationalize theoretically important but hard-to-measure concepts. Consider a cornerstone concept in the contracting literature: the incomplete contract.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0022002712448904">24</xref>
</sup> Although its origins are in economics, political scientists have found the concept quite valuable.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0022002712448904">25</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The contracting literature devotes considerable attention to why we observe incomplete contracts and why we observe particular forms of incompleteness and not others. In a world without transaction or information-processing costs, we would expect contracts to be complete: they would indicate the contracting parties’ obligations in all possible states of the world in all future periods. Various reasons have been suggested for why we do not observe such contracts. These include bounded rationality, which causes parties to a contract to not be able to enumerate all possible states of the world for the simple reason they cannot think of them all; decision costs, the costs of deciding what to do in each possible state of the world; and enumeration costs, the costs of describing states in sufficient detail to be verifiable to third-party contract enforcers.</p>
<p>Importantly, incomplete contracts give a role to courts to fill in their details. One testable conjecture in IR then is we should see an <italic>inverse relationship between the completeness of the contract and the inclusion of provisions delegating dispute resolution</italic>. At the international level, there is not a set of long-lived judicial institutions whose existence can be taken as exogenous to any particular decision to use them. Quite the contrary, simply to create and/or delegate to courts entails costs. Rational states will only pay those costs when courts are likely to be needed. Hence, we should expect an inverse relationship between incompleteness and the inclusion of dispute resolution <italic>provisions</italic>. Testing this conjecture requires a measure for completeness.</p>
<p>To capture the concept of completeness, five COIL variables seem particularly germane: the <italic>relative complexity of the cooperation problems</italic> the agreement addresses, the sheer <italic>length</italic> of the agreement, whether any <italic>appendices or annexes</italic> are included, the overall<italic> precision or ambiguity</italic> of agreement terms, and <italic>whether the agreement refers to existing international agreements.</italic> This last component regarding references has not been theorized. It could be argued references make a contract more complete as they may partially fill in incomplete terms (perhaps filling the role “precedent” plays in the domestic context);<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0022002712448904">26</xref>
</sup> conversely, references may add further incompleteness by engaging a wider set of issues, goals, or other complications, trade-offs, and possible subsumptions.</p>
<p>An example of the two endpoints featuring the first four components is illustrative. Suppose the cooperation problem the agreement is trying to address is very simple. Suppose also the agreement uses very precise language, is fifteen pages long, and has detailed appendices. Such an agreement seems quite complete. Conversely, suppose the cooperation problem the agreement is trying to address is very complex. Suppose also the agreement uses very vague language and is only three pages long and without appendices. Such an agreement seems quite incomplete.</p>
<p>The questions regarding <italic>pages, protocols/appendices, </italic>and <italic>references to other agreements</italic> are all very straightforward. The other components are operationalized as follows: with respect to <italic>relative complexity,</italic> there are three possibilities: relatively simple, average, and relatively complex. This variable refers to the amount of straightforwardness and/or the level of intricacy in terms of the nature of the cooperation problems the agreement is addressing as a whole. Obviously, all international cooperation is challenging so this scale is a relative one—even relatively simple agreements pose challenges. While this is one of the more subjective variables, familiarity with a variety of cooperative endeavors results in a sense of when an issue is particularly simple or complex. Straight coordination on pest control is relatively simple whereas scientific cooperation, like that which inspired the Antarctic Treaty, is average given potential resource issues. Problems that call for cartels or security alliances are relatively complex as are large-scale multilateral economic problems and complicated environmental standard control absent a clear scientific consensus.</p>
<p>When determining the degree of complexity several factors must be taken into account: the main issue area in which cooperation takes place, the number and type of underlying cooperation problems, the severity or relative weight of these cooperation problems, and whether cooperation is bilateral or multilateral. Consider disarmament agreements. Their purpose is to limit or ban certain types of weapons; hence, they will almost always be characterized by <italic>distribution problems</italic> given states usually have conflicting interests regarding the comprehensiveness of an agreement and which weapons to ban. There is often <italic>uncertainty about preferences</italic>; this problem is perhaps best illustrated by the mutual uncertainty and suspicion between the United States and the Soviet Union during the cold war. Disarmament agreements will also have to confront the underlying enforcement problem. It is worth noting that of all the disarmament agreements examined only one is coded as <italic>relatively simple</italic> (a UK and USSR agreement on the prevention of accidental nuclear war) while the remaining are coded as <italic>relatively complex</italic>. Multiple actors, other things equal, make cooperation more complex, and it is also important to note the multiple actor aspect within a state itself: “two-level problems” add complexity.</p>
<p>Examples from the sample may prove useful. Encouraging positive externalities via scientific cooperation is the goal of a “Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation in Earth Sciences and Environmental Studies,” in which the United States and the United Kingdom agree to share information regarding geographic and oceanographic research (UNTS 19699); this is a relatively simple problem. Another example of a simple cooperation problem is that between Argentina and Chile and their need to prevent frontier forest fires.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0022002712448904">27</xref>
</sup> This agreement addresses negative externalities by prescribing increased communication. The “OAU Convention governing the specific aspects of refugee problems in Africa” (UNTS 14691), concluded by the member states of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), is of average complexity. The agreement prescribes rules for the treatment of refugees in host countries. While seemingly a straightforward problem of coordinating on some common standard, the situation is compounded by fears that refugees might engage in provocative political activities from their host country, inducing tensions among otherwise peaceful interstate relations. Hence, some states are reluctant to accept refugees in the first place. The agreement thus covers a delicate issue, balancing humanitarian standards and political stability. Still, given the absence of a distribution problem and uncertainty about preferences or behavior, the agreement does not qualify as relatively complex.</p>
<p>A table listing agreements in each of the categories is on COIL’s website as well as an elaboration of the coding procedure. This variable was coded independently of the design provisions and was checked by a third coder for consistency across agreements. Discussions with experts also informed the coding.</p>
<p>
<italic>Precision</italic> is also a difficult variable to code, but as mentioned earlier, a third coder checked the consistency of that coding. It can take on four values from very vague to very precise. Precision is often reflected in clearly stated “shall/shall nots” with respect to the prescribed, proscribed, and/or authorized behaviors as well as in the amount of detail accorded to each behavior. The main question coders are trained to answer when coding this variable is, “How easy or difficult would it be to tell if an actor is in compliance with the agreement?” The more precise the agreement, the easier it is to say, “Yes, that is compliance,” or “No, that is not compliance.” In other words, how clearly is the line drawn between acceptable and unacceptable behavior under the agreement? I briefly discuss four agreements from the sample to give a sense of each of the categories.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0022002712448904">28</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The 1982 Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income (UNTS 25393) between Italy and Australia is <italic>very precise</italic>, clearly defining different kinds of taxes (with multiple articles devoted to detailed definitions) as well as criteria for determining residency and permanent establishments like businesses. Although power for setting taxes and so on is left to domestic law, jurisdiction is carefully laid out.</p>
<p>The 1983 Agreement for Cooperation relating to the Marine Environment (UNTS 22693) between Canada and Denmark can be described as <italic>somewhat precise</italic>. It quite clearly states the responsibilities of the Contracting Parties and clearly states what measures the Contracting Parties need to take in the event of environmental hazards. However, wording such as “subject to respective laws or any understanding with respect to confidentiality”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0022002712448904">29</xref>
</sup> makes it fall short of very precise.</p>
<p>Under the 1975 multilateral “Convention (No. 143) concerning Migrations in Abusive Conditions and the Promotion of Equality of Opportunity and Treatment of Migrant Workers” (UNTS 17426), states must declare and pursue a national policy designed to promote and guarantee equality of opportunity and treatment with respect to employment and occupation for migrant workers and their families. The agreement gives a lot of direction regarding what measures should be adopted in order to effectuate the agreement provisions, but it also uses some rather vague, sweeping phrases, like “respect human rights” and “adopt all necessary measures” and “equality of treatment” and hence is coded as <italic>somewhat vague</italic>.</p>
<p>The 1948 “Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide” (UNTS 1021) is <italic>very vague</italic> because the crime can be interpreted very loosely according to the agreement definition (there are no clear criteria as to whether political, social, and even gender groups are protected) and the important punishment mechanisms called for by the agreement in its title are not explained in any detail. For example, whether there is an obligation to prevent genocide by intervening militarily remains to this day an open question. A table featuring the numerical scales as well as summary statistics of these five components is available in the web appendix.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0022002712448904">30</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>To quantify the variation in <italic>dispute resolution</italic> provisions across international agreements, I distinguish four possible channels for the resolution of disputes: <italic>Informal</italic>—the dispute is to be settled through diplomacy, friendly negotiations, or other informal methods not involving any other actors. (Sometimes agreements suggest that this method be tried first; other methods are then outlined should informal methods fail.); <italic>Mediation</italic>, a nonbinding form of dispute resolution in which a neutral third party assists disputing parties in reaching a mutually agreeable solution. (Generally, mediators only transmit the disputants’ positions, but they can help reconcile different positions if all parties trust the mediator.); <italic>Arbitration</italic>, a stronger form of dispute resolution because third-party actors, often selected by the disputants, resolve the dispute. (An arbitration provision will usually specify how an arbitrator is to be chosen, and whether the arbitrator’s findings are binding on the parties.); and <italic>Adjudication</italic>, where a court steps in to make a ruling for the disputants. (As in arbitration, sometimes the agreement will specify how the judges are to be chosen.) Of course, many agreements provide for more than one method.</p>
<p>With respect to which entities are considered dispute resolution bodies, the agreement must mention how disagreements, disputes, or differences in interpretation are handled and that task must be delegated to a body. For this study, I code as delegation those provisions that call for the <italic>delegation of arbitration and/or adjudication.</italic> Mediation is excluded since mediators simply suggest resolutions while the outcome is left primarily to the agreement parties.</p>
<p>Before the expected inverse relationship between delegation and completeness can be explored, the dimensions of completeness must be combined into a variable. Specifically, what is needed is a measure that reduces the component variables—complexity, length, appendices/annexes, precision, and references—to a single number, reflecting an underlying concept of “completeness.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0022002712448904">31</xref>
</sup> Over forty years ago, Rudolph <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022002712448904">Rummel (1967</xref>) published an article in the <italic>JCR</italic> on factor analysis, which is as instructive for these empirical purposes as Schelling’s writings are for the theoretical arguments.</p>
<p>Factor analysis is used more frequently in psychology than in the social sciences, at least if one judges from leading econometrics textbooks.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0022002712448904">32</xref>
</sup> It therefore seems appropriate to provide a short introduction to factor analysis, drawing on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022002712448904">Rummel (1967</xref>), showing how it can be useful in the present context.</p>
<p>Factor analysis may serve many purposes; among others, Rummel (1968, 448-51) mentions uncovering primary dimensions of variation across groups, transforming data, or obtaining classifications/typologies. Here, the most relevant feature of factor analysis is it allows reducing a set of variables into one or more groups (factors). Suppose several distinct variables are related to the same underlying, unobserved concept. An example provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022002712448904">Rummel (1967</xref>, 446) is “economic development,” which finds expressions in observable variables such as income per capita, literacy rates, various measures of education, and urbanization rates. Factor analysis then identifies patterns of variation among these variables, reduces them to single factors, and these factors can be interpreted as reflecting underlying, latent concepts; this is what Rummel refers to as “R-factor analysis,”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0022002712448904">33</xref>
</sup> more commonly known as “exploratory factor analysis.” By reducing the set of observed variables into groups of variables, factor analysis provides a composite measure that reflects the underlying, theoretical latent construct.</p>
<p>For the present purpose, the goal is to identify patterns across agreements in the variation of variables thought to be related to completeness. The choice of these variables clearly is theory-driven, and therefore at the discretion of the researcher; this is not different from any alternative method. The construction of the underlying concept, however, is based on the data alone. Absent any strong theories on how to add and weight the various variables that supposedly measure completeness, using factor analysis to identify the latent variable seems preferable to any ad hoc construction of such an index.</p>
<p>To obtain such a reduced measure, several steps are undertaken. First, each of the five variables related to contract completeness are regressed on three of the issue area dummies and a constant. The residuals from these regressions net out any effects specific to issue area.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0022002712448904">34</xref>
</sup> Factorizing these residuals then amounts to finding those factors that best explain the common variance in these residuals. The single factors can be interpreted as providing one-dimensional summaries of the data. The factors are then rotated in order to ease interpretation and to obtain factor loadings that are most responsive to the manifest variables; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022002712448904">Table 3</xref> displays these rotated factor loadings.</p>

<p>The first two factors explain a large amount of the common variation among the five variables related to contract incompleteness, 45.9 percent and 35 percent, respectively. Each of the factors, however, captures a different dimension of contract incompleteness.</p>
<p>Based on the factor loadings, the first factor is formed primarily by the simplicity of the cooperation problem, the precision of the agreement text, and references to other agreements. The first factor thus can be said to reflect the overall <italic>difficulty</italic> of negotiating a solution to the problem/problems the agreement is trying to address. This difficulty cannot be directly measured; yet, difficult agreements are harder to formulate precisely, are more complex, and are related to other agreements or issues.</p>
<p>The positive factor loadings on the precision of an agreement and the simplicity of the cooperation problem were expected. The negative factor loading on the variable capturing references is interesting because it suggests cross-references add to the incompleteness of an agreement by engaging a wider set of goals and issues, thus complicating the agreement through additional contingencies and trade-offs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0022002712448904">35</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>While the first factor represents the <italic>difficulty</italic> of negotiating a solution, the second factor can be viewed as capturing the <italic>details</italic> accorded to the negotiated solution. Longer agreements as well as agreements that contain appendices are more complete. Both factor loadings are of the expected sign.</p>
<p>The variables measuring contract incompleteness are constructed from the first two factors, <italic>difficulty</italic> and <italic>detail</italic>, using a regression scoring method. This predicts the latent contract completeness of each agreement from its specific combination of the five constitutive variables. Toward this purpose, a linear combination of the five variables is formed, with weights according to the factor scores.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0022002712448904">36</xref>
</sup> Importantly, while distinct sets of variables are the most relevant for each factor, as was just discussed, for the construction of both <italic>difficulty</italic> and <italic>detail</italic> all five variables and their respective factor scores were used.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0022002712448904">37</xref>
</sup> For ease of comparison, for the following analyses <italic>difficulty</italic> and <italic>detail</italic> were rescaled such that each ranges from zero to one. The mean of the rescaled variables is .465 for <italic>difficulty</italic>, and .234 for <italic>detail</italic>. More complete contracts should score higher on both of these variables.</p>
<p>With these two newly constructed measures of contract completeness, we are set to test the relationship between the provisions for dispute resolutions and contract completeness/incompleteness. Given how <italic>difficulty</italic> and <italic>detail</italic> are scaled, we would expect to see an inverse relationship between these measures and the delegation of dispute resolution. For <italic>difficulty</italic>, this is indeed the case. Its correlation with delegated dispute resolution of −.498 is negative, large in size, and statistically significant with a <italic>p</italic> value of .000. For the second factor, the correlation coefficient of .027 is of the wrong sign, small in size, and statistically insignificant (with a <italic>p</italic> value of .751).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0022002712448904">38</xref>
</sup> <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022002712448904">Table 4</xref> shows results from three probit regressions, with delegated dispute resolution as the dependent variable. The upper panel of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022002712448904">Table 4</xref> includes only difficulty and three issue area dummies as regressors (the coefficients on the issue area dummies are omitted from the table for all three panels);<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0022002712448904">39</xref>

More interesting is the bottom panel of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022002712448904">Table 4</xref>: including both difficulty and detail in the regression, the coefficient on agreement difficulty remains large in size and statistically significant, while the coefficient on agreement detail remains small and statistically insignificant.</p>

<p>Hence, it appears that only the first dimension of contract completeness, <italic>difficulty</italic>, is relevant when looking at the relationship between completeness and the delegation of dispute resolution; the second dimension, <italic>detail</italic>, plays little role in the relationship between delegation and contract completeness. This, of course, is not to say that variables like agreement length and the presence of annexes are not helpful to capture the concept of contract completeness; in fact, additional research on the role of this dimension of contract completeness is most welcome.</p>
<p>The substantial and significant relationship between contract incompleteness, as captured by <italic>difficulty</italic>, and delegated dispute resolution calls attention to a pattern in international law that is consistent with the belief that international law matters: the more that is left out of the contract, and therefore, the more room for debates about the proper interpretation of the contents of a contract, the more a third party is needed to interpret the contract. It also could be argued that this is a harder test case than we would be able to find in the domestic setting because domestically there is a set of long-lived judicial institutions whose existence can be taken as exogenous to any particular decision to use them and the relationship is almost a tautology. Internationally, states have to make a <italic>separate design choice</italic> to create and/or delegate to a court to fill in the details of incomplete agreements. And, as mentioned, that delegation is costly when we think of the typical sovereign state wanting to retain as much control as possible. Thus, the fact that these design choices are systematically related calls attention to the rationality and efficiency of international law, given that states do not choose both completeness and delegation. Importantly, international contracts resemble domestic ones!</p>
<p>Drawing on previous work in the rational design literature and the literature on contract incompleteness (particularly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022002712448904">Hart and Moore 1999</xref>) inspires additional empirical tests of the newly obtained measures of contract incompleteness. The results indeed suggest <italic>difficulty</italic> and <italic>detail</italic> capture two different dimensions of the concept of contract incompleteness.</p>
<p>First, incompleteness is expected to increase in the number of participants as bargains are harder to achieve. Second, uncertainty about the state of the world should be associated with more incomplete contracts. If states are unsure about current circumstances, and even less so about future ones, it is both much more difficult and less advantageous to settle on specific, state-contingent terms. Hence, incompleteness is expected to increase in uncertainty about the state of the world.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0022002712448904">40</xref>
</sup> The data to test these hypotheses are directly available from COIL;<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0022002712448904">41</xref>
</sup> the number of participants is logged in order to capture that an increase from two to three participants should be more similar to an increase from twenty to thirty participants than to an increase from twenty to twenty-one. The dependent variables are the two measures for contract incompleteness, <italic>difficulty </italic>and<italic> detail</italic>, described earlier. Since the dependent variable is continuous, a linear regression is used; three of the four issue area dummies are included, and standard errors are calculated to be robust to heteroskedasticity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0022002712448904">42</xref>
</sup> The results, shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0022002712448904">Table 5</xref>, conform well to the theoretical expectations. Since both measures of contract completeness/incompleteness are scaled from zero to one, the coefficients are directly comparable. Contract incompleteness, as measured by <italic>difficulty, </italic>increases in the number of participants; yet, agreements with more participants tend to be more detailed. Uncertainty about the state of the world has the expected negative effect on both dimensions of contract completeness.</p>

<p>These results suggest that the measure of contract incompleteness as defined and constructed in this article seems to capture at least some relevant aspects of the underlying concept quite accurately, and further point to the purposeful design of international agreements.</p>
<p>Chiappori and Salanie (2002) point out that testing the incomplete contract theory articulated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022002712448904">Hart (1995</xref>) is a very demanding task since the kind of detailed information required is usually not present in the typical data sets used. COIL provides one of the first measures of an incomplete contract other than the mere number of pages, a popular measure among economists.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0022002712448904">43</xref>
</sup> In fact, and importantly, the dimension of completeness based on number of pages and the presence of an annex/appendix has little explanatory power in the analyses conducted earlier. Importantly, my data suggest measures based on the number of pages can be severely misleading. Judging from the theoretically expected relationship between contract completeness and delegated dispute resolution, one could almost argue length as a measure completely fails: the correlation between length alone and delegated dispute resolution is positive and statistically significant, with a correlation coefficient of .145 and a <italic>p</italic> value of .084,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0022002712448904">44</xref>
</sup> going against the conventional wisdom. The factor analysis is this article confirms this conclusion: completeness hinges to a much greater extent on whether the underlying problem is hard to solve and describe and how many issues/subissues the problem engages. The richness of the COIL data, and the use of factor analysis, allows us to overcome a common weakness of empirical tests of contract theories.<sup>

<title>Concluding Thoughts</title>
<p>Schelling’s argument just over fifty years ago that game theory was pitched at too abstract a level was accurate. Since then, however, many scholars have used the tools of game theory to study some of the institutional details of cooperative arrangements and have thereby answered Schelling’s call to action. International law, it turns out, is quite easily interpreted through game theory. In other words, the details of agreements can be fruitfully understood using a game-theoretic lens. Both Rational Design and COIL take cooperation as a starting point and study under what conditions this cooperation can be most successful.</p>
<p>When we examine the COIL through the game-theoretic lens of the underlying cooperation problems states are trying to resolve, we expect differences across international agreements and institutions. States shape agreements to solve the specific problems they face; design variations are largely the result of rational, purposive interactions. In fact, instead of an anarchic international environment, or one where the time horizon is the only independent variable, we observe an environment structured by international agreements as institutions. Instead of random variations among agreements or even automatic replication of the same agreement provisions over and over, we observe that the detailed provisions of international agreements are chosen in ways that increase the incidence and robustness of cooperation. Indeed, the COIL is nuanced and sophisticated and one of the most exciting frontiers for those interested in the application of game theory, and the COIL project offers an opportunity to empirically evaluate such theoretically driven conjectures. The COIL project also lends itself to another empirical advancement. Many important concepts in the social sciences, and in IR in particular, are difficult to measure directly, but might be captured by some latent construct—contract completeness/incompleteness, as discussed in this article, is one example. The COIL project provides the data, and factor analysis the method, to obtain theoretically driven measures of similarly elusive concepts: through its wealth of variables, literally hundreds of them, COIL covers most aspects of international agreements that are of relevance in the literature, and for a great many of these aspects records several theoretically related variables. The example of contract completeness/incompleteness illustrates how factor analysis exploits this abundance of data, and should be seen as an invitation to other scholars to be creative in constructing other theoretically driven and substantively important variables.</p>

<p>There is a complementary international cooperation research program that takes international law seriously and focuses on compliance. Those studying compliance can delve deeply into a few agreements or institutions and get a sense of how they affect politics and welfare on the ground. This research program is exemplified by the work of Beth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022002712448904">Simmons (2009</xref>) and relies less on game theory and more on extremely thorough and rigorous quantitative analyses.</p>

<p>Overall, the UNTS database contains approximately 158,000 agreements and subsequent actions, where an agreement may be an original agreement, a protocol, or a renegotiated contract. To date, there are nearly 4,000 registered original multilateral agreements, with over 3,000 accompanying subsequent actions. Bilateral agreements and their accompanying actions comprise the remainder of the set. Notable omissions from the UNTS database include agreements registered with various regional organizations such as the African Union and agreements negotiated among Middle Eastern states and African states, more generally. Finally, China and Russia tend to underreport their agreements as well. (I thank an anonymous referee for this last point.).</p>

<p>Rules 3 and 4 derive from Coordination, Reporting and Publication of International Agreements, United States Federal Code of Regulations, Volume 22, Part 181 (4-1-98 Edition); 22 C.F.R. 181. The purpose of that document is to implement the provisions of the Case-Zablocki Act. The Case-Zablocki Act calls for the full and timely disclosure to the US Congress of all concluded international agreements to which the United States is a party. The document identifies criteria for determining whether any undertaking between the US government (or an agency of the US government) and another state constitutes an international agreement within the meaning of the Act.</p>

<p>These statistics, which are very promising, underestimate the disagreements to some extent insofar as if coders disagreed on a question like “Is there a dispute resolution provision?” and the correct answer is yes, another set of questions were implicated regarding the details of the dispute resolution provision.  Hence among those questions, there may have been additional disagreements. Nonetheless, experienced coders do not disagree often on such questions that serve to open up another set of questions; rather, they tend to disagree on the more subtle design issues.</p>
