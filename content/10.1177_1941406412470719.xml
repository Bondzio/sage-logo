<p>Childhood obesity is predictive of adulthood obesity, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease risk. The purpose of this study was to examine BMI for age as an independent risk factor for elevated blood pressure (EBP) and pre-EBP in children, controlling for sex, race/ethnicity, and age. The secondary objective was to identify associations among BMI, BP, race/ethnicity, and sex. EBP was defined as having a BP <italic>≥</italic>95th percentile for age, gender, and height; measurements <italic>≥</italic>90th percentile were considered indicative of pre-EBP. The study sample included 166 fifth-grade students from 5 low-income elementary schools in northern California. It was found that 32% of students were either overweight (<italic>≥</italic>85th percentile BMI for age) or obese (<italic>≥</italic>95th percentile BMI for age), with significantly higher rates (55%) among Hispanic children (P &lt; .01). Also, 22% of students presented with pre-EBP/EBP. Obese students were more likely than normal-weight students to present with a systolic pre-EBP reading (P &lt; .05). Overweight and obese students were more likely than normal-weight students to present with a diastolic pre-EBP reading (P &lt; .05). BMI is independently predictive of EBP. Fitness testing with anthropometric measurements should incorporate BP screenings for students with a BMI <italic>≥</italic>85th percentile.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Childhood overweight and obesity rates have tripled nationally over the past 3 decades.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1941406412470719">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1941406412470719">2</xref></sup> The prevalence rates of overweight and obesity are distinctly higher in low-income and ethnic minority children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1941406412470719">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1941406412470719">4</xref></sup> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers children overweight or obese if they have a BMI for age equal to or greater than the 85th and 95th percentile, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1941406412470719">5</xref></sup> The recent reports from school health assessments revealed higher rates of childhood overweight and obesity in California schools compared with national rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1941406412470719">6</xref></sup> The 2008 Pediatric Nutrition Surveillance Survey identified the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity in Butte County as 47% for Latino, African American, and Native American low-income children and adolescents aged 9 to 11 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1941406412470719">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>High BMI in youth is associated with a number of comorbidities, including increased risk for hypertension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1941406412470719">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1941406412470719"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1941406412470719">10</xref></sup> The diagnostic criterion for childhood hypertension is an average blood pressure (BP) reading greater than or equal to the 95th percentile for sex, age, and height on at least 3 separate occasions. Prehypertension in children is defined as having an average BP reading greater than or equal to the 90th percentile for sex, age, and height on at least 3 separate occasions or BP readings greater than or equal to an absolute value of 120/80 mm Hg.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1941406412470719">11</xref></sup> Elevated BP (EBP) and pre-EBP consist of any measurements that have been taken but do not meet the necessary diagnostic criteria.</p>
<p>National survey data suggest that childhood EBP is on the rise after nearly 30 years of decline.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1941406412470719">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1941406412470719">13</xref></sup> Because of the unfortunate fact that the majority of youth with hypertension go undiagnosed, clinicians and organizations such as the National Institutes of Health, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, and the National High Blood Pressure Education Program recommend screening youth early.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1941406412470719">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1941406412470719"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1941406412470719"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1941406412470719">17</xref></sup> These recommendations stress the importance of identifying and controlling EBP at a young age to help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke later in life. However, BP measurements are not currently required for children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1941406412470719">18</xref></sup> When BP is recorded, evidence suggests that hypertension remains underdiagnosed and is often not addressed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1941406412470719">19</xref></sup> Implementing regular BP measurements in youth could alert school nurses and health professionals to address the modifiable risk factors that are associated with adult CVD risk.</p>
<p>The data from national surveys indicate that the increased rates of EBP vary across ethnic groups and sex.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1941406412470719">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1941406412470719">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1941406412470719">13</xref></sup> From 1988 to 2002, Din-Dzietham and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1941406412470719">13</xref></sup> reported a significant increase in EBP prevalence among Mexican American men and white women, whereas pre-EBP increased for blacks and Mexican Americans. Using data from 1988 to 2006, Ostchega and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1941406412470719">12</xref></sup> found that overweight men and obese men and women were significantly more likely to have pre-EBP/EBP after controlling for age, race/ethnicity, and BMI. A recent investigation of US adolescents revealed that almost half of the youth in the United States have at least 1 biological CVD risk factor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1941406412470719">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Two separate school-based health screenings were conducted from 2003 to 2005 in Houston area schools.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1941406412470719">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1941406412470719">21</xref></sup> In the first study, Sorof and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1941406412470719">20</xref></sup> reported a significant increase in the relative risk for hypertension among men with overweight BMI status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1941406412470719">20</xref></sup> The follow-up health screening reported that only BMI status was significantly associated with hypertension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1941406412470719">21</xref></sup> School-based screenings in California revealed high rates of EBP in overweight and obese Latino and African American youth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1941406412470719">22</xref></sup> Screenings conducted in close proximity to the geographical region of this investigation found higher rates of pre-EBP/EBP in fifth- through eighth-grade students.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1941406412470719">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1941406412470719">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Elementary schools in California have a unique opportunity to implement a screening measurement for EBP in youth. California schools are required to conduct and report FITNESSGRAM assessments for fifth-, seventh-, and ninth-grade students.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1941406412470719">25</xref></sup> The FITNESSGRAM assesses physical fitness and body composition (in the form of a BMI measurement). Findings from the Bogalusa Heart Study have illustrated that BMI measurements are effective in predicting metabolic risks, including EBP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1941406412470719">26</xref></sup> Based on the relationship between adiposity and BP, school assessments like the FITNESSGRAM that include a measure of body composition are used to identify youth at risk for EBP.</p>
<p>Obtaining a BP reading is less arduous and requires less equipment and personnel training than other measures of obesity comorbidities such as HbA1c, serum cholesterol, fasting glucose, and so on.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1941406412470719">27</xref></sup> Conducting the BP measurement concurrently with a BMI measurement is an inexpensive opportunity to screen children for risk of EBP. This is particularly advantageous for low-income, racially/ethnically diverse schools where rates are expected to be higher. Furthermore, multiple measurements throughout childhood and adolescence (fifth, seventh, and ninth grades) can provide longitudinal data for more comprehensive medical records.</p>
<p>The primary objective of this investigation was to use the FITNESSGRAM opportunity to assess overweight and obesity as an independent risk factor for EBP among fifth-grade students in 5 low-income schools in northern California. A secondary objective was to examine associations among BP, BMI, race/ethnicity, and sex.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1941406412470719">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Data were collected from a convenience sample of 166 fifth-grade students in 5 low-income schools for this cross-sectional health screening investigation. A school was considered low income if at least 50% of its students were eligible for free and reduced-price meals. Researchers distributed informational permissions slips, and participation was contingent on parental signature. Of the 247 fifth-grade students, 63% returned parent permission slips and were included in this study. The protocol for this study was approved by the Human Subjects Review Committee at California State University, Chico, California.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1941406412470719">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Data were obtained using a health screening document that consisted of the following self-reported information: teacher name, student identification number, sex, age, date of birth, and race/ethnicity (white, Asian, Hispanic, or other). Trained researchers assisted by a school nurse took height and weight measurements using a Seca 216 Accu-Hite medically approved stadiometer and scale. BMI was calculated using height measured to the nearest 0.5 inches and weight to the nearest 0.5 pounds. Date of birth was self-reported and verified by school nurses. Age- and sex-adjusted BMI percentiles were calculated using current CDC growth charts. Normal weight, overweight, and obesity were classified by CDC definitions as a BMI for age less than, equal to, or greater than the 85th percentile and 95th percentile, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1941406412470719">5</xref></sup> Underweight students were combined with normal-weight students because of the limited sample size in this category.</p>
<p>BP measurements were taken by trained researchers using an appropriately sized Omron automated BP cuff on the student’s dominant arm. Measurements took place after the participants had a 15-minute rest period to ensure capturing a resting heart rate. The diagnostic criteria from the national guidelines recommend several measurements at different times.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1941406412470719">11</xref></sup> In the present study, BP was measured a single time. If the initial BP measurement was elevated, a secondary confirming measurement was performed. To delineate our terminology from the terminology in the guidelines, all participants were categorized in the following manner: participants with a BP reading indicating hypertension risk (defined as systolic or diastolic readings greater than the 95th percentile for age, gender, and height) were identified as having EBP; a BP indicative of prehypertension risk (defined as systolic or diastolic readings between the 90th and 95th percentiles for age, gender, and height) was identified as pre-EBP; finally, any reading with an absolute value equal to or greater than 120/80 mm Hg or the 90th percentile for age, gender, and height was considered pre-EBP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1941406412470719">11</xref></sup> This approach is similar to the methods used by Din-Dzietham et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1941406412470719">13</xref></sup> and Ostchega et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1941406412470719">12</xref></sup> All measurements were supervised by a school nurse and the first author.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1941406412470719">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Data were analyzed using SPSS version 19, 2011 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Descriptive statistics consisted of means, percentages, and standard deviations. The independent variables in this study were BMI-for-age classification, sex, and race/ethnicity. The dependent variables in this study were systolic and diastolic BP (mm Hg), BMI classifications, and BP risk category classifications. Pearson χ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1941406412470719">2</xref></sup> tests were used to compare BMI classifications across race/ethnicity groups and sex. Analysis of variance was used to compare mean systolic and diastolic BP across BMI and race/ethnicity groups. An independent <italic>t</italic> test was used to compare mean systolic BP values between the sexes. Multiple logistic regression models were used to predict overall EBP risk. Statistical significance was set at α &lt; .05.</p>

<p>A comparison of mean systolic and diastolic BP readings (mm Hg) was conducted across BMI-for-age groups (normal weight, overweight, and obese). One-way ANOVA tests indicated a significant association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1941406412470719">Figure 1</xref>) between BMI-for-age groups and mean systolic (<italic>F</italic><sub>2,163</sub> = 8.49; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01) and diastolic BP (<italic>F</italic><sub>2,163</sub> = 5.80; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). Post hoc comparisons revealed that both normal-weight and overweight students had significantly lower systolic and diastolic BP readings than obese students. The independent <italic>t</italic> tests showed no significant differences in mean systolic (<italic>t</italic><sub>164</sub> = 0.81; <italic>P</italic> = .42) and mean diastolic (<italic>t</italic><sub>164</sub> = −0.60; <italic>P</italic> = .50) BP between sexes. The 1-way ANOVA test indicated no racial/ethnic differences in systolic or diastolic BP readings. However, at 109 mm Hg versus 106 mm Hg, Hispanic students presented with the highest (nonsignificant) mean systolic BP reading compared with their non-Hispanic peers, respectively.</p>

<p>Multiple logistic regression models were used to assess the strength of association between BMI for age and overall EBP risk (any systolic or diastolic readings greater than the 90th percentile for age, gender, and height or an absolute value equal to or greater than 120/80 mm Hg). Covariates included sex, age, and race/ethnicity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1941406412470719">Table 3</xref>). Obesity significantly predicted systolic EBP risk (odds ratio [OR] = 3.35; confidence interval [CI] = 1.03-10.92) and diastolic EBP risk (OR = 8.24; CI = 2.71-25.05). Overweight status significantly predicted diastolic EBP risk (OR = 3.96; CI = 1.24-12.60). The odds of having a BP reading ≥90th percentile were 8.16 times higher among obese students compared with normal-BMI category students (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). Furthermore, when BMI status was dichotomized (normal/overweight vs obese), the odds of having a BP reading ≥90th percentile were significantly higher among obese students compared with normal-weight/overweight students (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01; OR = 6.56; CI = 2.49-17.26). Age, sex, and race/ethnicity were not significant predictors of overall EBP risk.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The link between excess adiposity in youth and the clustering of CVD risk factors remains a growing public health concern. The results from this health screening indicate that 32% of these fifth-grade students were overweight or obese. The prevalence of overweight and obesity was highest among Hispanic students. The prevalence rates of childhood overweight and obesity in this study were similar to those reported in previous studies in the same region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1941406412470719">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1941406412470719">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1941406412470719">24</xref></sup> The rates found in this study were lower than those reported in the state Pediatric Nutrition Surveillance Survey. However, this discrepancy is likely a result of the difference in sampling methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1941406412470719">7</xref></sup> These findings are also consistent with local and national data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1941406412470719">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1941406412470719">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1941406412470719">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The prevalence of EBP after the initial screening resembled those reported in previous school health screenings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1941406412470719">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1941406412470719">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1941406412470719"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1941406412470719">22</xref></sup> Obese students had significantly higher systolic and diastolic BP readings than their overweight and normal-weight peers. The multiple logistic regression models revealed that an obese BMI was useful in predicting EBP risk after controlling for sex, age, and race/ethnicity. Although Hispanic students were disproportionately overweight and had higher (nonsignificant) BP values than other students, this race/ethnicity was not an independent risk factor for EBP. This finding is inconsistent with studies that included large sample sizes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1941406412470719">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1941406412470719">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1941406412470719">23</xref></sup> It is likely that significant differences would be identified among race/ethnic groups with a larger sample from the study population. The link between obesity and EBP demonstrated in this investigation is consistent with that found in other investigations and supports the usefulness of BMI as a screening tool for increased risk of EBP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1941406412470719">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1941406412470719"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1941406412470719"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1941406412470719">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>A recent report from the American Academy of Pediatrics evinced that at least 1 CVD risk factor was present in nearly half of the nations’ overweight children and in almost two-thirds of obese children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1941406412470719">9</xref></sup> Recommendations for regular early health screenings that include BP measurements have been made for children as young as preschool students; however, there are few mandatory, national, school-based health screenings that include BP measurements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1941406412470719">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1941406412470719">15</xref></sup> Fortunately, anthropometry is currently part of the mandated fitness measurements in California and Delaware. The FITNESSGRAM is currently being used by many school districts nationwide and, thus, could be used as a medium for screening for EBP risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1941406412470719">25</xref></sup> Early identification of CVD risk factors such as EBP is important in youth in order to implement lifestyle and behavior modifications. Hypertension does not have to be a “silent killer” if it is detected and controlled in childhood.</p>
<p>Limitations to the findings are the sample size and selection bias resulting from the required parental permission slip. The measurement of BP was not a clinical diagnosis and may contain 1-time artifacts. Additionally, BMI measurements do not directly assess adiposity. The strength of this study is its focus on low-income, ethnically diverse elementary school children. In conclusion, BMI was independently predictive of EBP after controlling for sex, age, and race/ethnicity in the current study. Using anthropometric measurements to screen for EBP risk would serve as a pragmatic tool for school health professionals. The health screening results presented in this report attest to the need for future research on the prevalence of overweight, obesity, and EBP in youth, particularly in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas.</p>
