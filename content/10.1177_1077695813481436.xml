<p>Few would dispute that new information and communication technology (ICT) is reshaping the pattern of global news consumption. According to Pew’s survey “Trends in News Consumption: 1991–2012” (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tinyurl.com/8r5v7rs">http://tinyurl.com/8r5v7rs</ext-link>), for example, searching for news online and from digital sources continues to grow. About one-half (46 percent) of Americans say they get news online three days a week or more, with about one-third (32 percent) going online for news every day.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Internet-based ICT is also reformatting news production. Online news outlets appear to become increasingly mainstream, supplanting the “traditional” media, particularly newspapers. This trend can be seen partially from the peer recognition of professional achievements in online journalism. In 2010, for instance, an investigative journalist at ProPublica and a cartoonist at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://SFGate.com">SFGate.com</ext-link>, the <italic>San Francisco Chronicle</italic>’s online portal, won Pulitzer Prizes for online-only editorial content for the first time in history. It is fair to say that such trends that journalism is experiencing today have been restructuring the curriculum in journalism education and training in higher education institutions. Although course titles vary among web, digital, interactive, multimedia, convergence, and the like, traditional journalism education units have embraced the change, and more than one hundred digital/multimedia journalism programs are offered across this country as of 2012 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mulinblog.com/multimedia-journalism-programs/">http://www.mulinblog.com/multimedia-journalism-programs/</ext-link>). <italic>The Handbook of Global Online Journalism</italic>, in this context, offers a timely option for students who want to keep themselves current with the online new media landscape, as well as for instructors who try to strike a fine balance between teaching theories and introducing cutting-edge practices concerning the gathering, production, dissemination, and consumption of news through Internet-based platforms globally.</p>
<p>This edited volume features a collection of twenty-five chapters from researchers and practitioners who examine a variety of aspects related to online journalism, including theories, politics, production, practices, contents, and global contexts. The first highlight of this book is the editors’ introduction that surveys the evolution of online journalism, relevant research, and theoretical strands. Borrowing ideas from the evolution theory, Siapera and Veglis use the extinction and mutation of dinosaurs as a metaphor to depict the development of online journalism and help readers better understand the interaction between the ICT-driven changes in media environment and the advance of the modality of journalism.</p>
<p>Trying to draw a holistic picture of the evolution of online journalism, the editors start by presenting “an instructive analogy with the current fate of some of the many species of journalism” (p. 2) and put forward “three evolutionary possibilities” (p. 4). For the first possibility, according to the editors, newspapers and print journalism in general seem to be fading out like dinosaurs if they do not adapt to the dramatic changes taking place in mass media. Meanwhile, the main “traits, values, or defining characteristics of journalism” (p. 3), such as public service, objectivity, autonomy, and journalistic ethics, need to be reinterpreted through online news production against sociopolitical, economic, and technological changes. Second, traditional journalism strives to survive by actively embracing new attributes of Internet-based communication to revamp the production of news for online platforms. The particular characteristics, such as multimediality, interactivity, user-generated content, and personalization (p. 4), although not seen in traditional news production, make online journalism fit naturally into the new media ecosystem. Then, mutation becomes possible as a higher level of evolution of online journalism. Particular changes that take place in the new media environment catalyze the distinctively new attributes of news production, such as “social media journalism,” “open source journalism” (p. 4), and “crowdsourcing” investigative journalism (p. 14), as discussed in separate chapters of the handbook.</p>
<p>In addition, the editors summarize three groups of the latest academic endeavors for a scholarly inquiry into online journalism, regarding in particular technology-oriented research, production, and news consumption. Furthermore, they categorize this research into three theoretical aspects: journalism sociology, grounded theory, and technology-related theory. Together these three theoretical aspects “have greatly enhanced our understanding of online journalism, its emergence and development” (p. 12).</p>
<p>Based on the overview, the editors structure the handbook into six sections. The first part covers theories. It includes four chapters on media convergence, professional values, new model of online newspapers, and the application of Bourdieu’s field theory to the analysis of online journalism. The second part of the handbook is organized around the political meaning of online journalism. Four chapters are devoted to discussions of whether online journalism can be a new communicative actor endowed with civic potentialities; what “news ought to be,” and how to realize this potential civic value of online journalism (p. 119); how radical forms of online journalism challenge the state and the hegemonic order associated with it (p. 136); and how different forms of online journalism hinge political processes and affect citizens in different ways.</p>
<p>The four chapters in part 3 concern the cross-media publishing and news production process, “transformation” of news work, and the business model for online journalism (p. 231). Narrowing down to more specific terrains in online news making, the authors in part 4 introduce crowdsourcing investigative journalism, media accountability, technology–journalism interaction at the production level, and how social media are shaping journalism. With regard to the content of online news, part 5 assesses the role of citizen witness in online coverage of crisis events, the needs for a proper “language” for Web journalism multimedia writing, and the personalization of online news. Along with an earlier chapter about Greece, the last section analyzes unique attributes of online journalism in Australia, Brazil, China, Germany, Nigeria, and the United Kingdom, furnishing opportunities for cross-country comparisons.</p>
<p>Bringing together up-to-date analyses on online journalism and their social-political meanings, the edited volume can help instructors and students develop an understanding of political, economic, cultural, social, and technological issues regarding the continually growing field with an international perspective. Although it does not include every aspect of the developments in online news production, for example, data-driven journalism, the handbook sheds light on future directions, where relevant discussions can be further developed against the advancement of ICT and the changing media environment in the globalized world.</p>
<p>Although not particularly intended for university courses, this edited volume is among the leading introductions and overviews of the subject fit for college teaching, thanks to the breadth of coverage by its chosen texts. Its sensible organization adds extra depth to its synthesized introduction of academic reflections available in this emerging field. Including both theoretical analyses and the latest empirical studies, this book is an ideal option for both undergraduate and graduate students interested in not only online news but also journalism studies, digital/social media, media sociology, and the political economy of online journalism. This book can be adopted for seminar-style courses as either a leading text or a supplement to other texts on Internet-based or computer-mediated communication. With many insights and intriguing thoughts, the handbook is also useful to scholars in journalism and communication searching for the theoretical meaning of the ever-changing journalistic profession.</p>
