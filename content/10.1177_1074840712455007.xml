<list-item><p>Marcia Van Riper, PhD, RN, FAAN, professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Nursing, and current president of the International Family Nursing Association, has been selected by the J. William Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board (FSB) to receive a 2012-2013 Fulbright Scholar Grant to Ireland. She will collaborate with faculty at the Catherine McAuley School of Nursing and Midwifery, University College Cork, Ireland, in teaching, research, and publishing. She will use this opportunity to conduct a mixed-methods, cross-cultural study designed to address existing gaps in knowledge concerning how cultural scripts (cultural norms, values, and practices) and a variety of family factors (i.e., family demands, family appraisal, family resources, family problem-solving communication, family coping, and family management styles) contribute to adaptation and resilience in families of individuals with Down syndrome. Initially, the study will be conducted with families of individuals with Down syndrome in Ireland and the United States (more than 550 parents from the United States have already participated in the study). Eventually, the study will include participants from a number of different countries (e.g., Brazil, Italy, Korea, Japan, Netherlands, Portugal, and Thailand). For more information, please contact Dr. Van Riper: <email>vanriper@email.unc.edu</email>.</p></list-item>
