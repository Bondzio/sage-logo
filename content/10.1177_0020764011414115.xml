<p>The question as to whether the differences in mental processes and mental disorders between the genders are innate or cultural is a very thorny one. At the risk of offending those feminists who confound ‘difference’ with ‘inequality’, it seems to me that the evidence of humanity’s nearest relatives suggests that is to some extent innate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020764011414115">Huber, 2007</xref>). A look at baboons through a feminist lens shows evidence of predatory sexual violence towards younger females by older males, perinatal disorders, and even eating disorders, while the younger males exist in gangs on the periphery of the group, with more chance of interacting with members of other baboon groups but also facing more risks and stress-inducing incidents from outside the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020764011414115">Swedell, 2006</xref>). Whether the causes are cultural or innate however, it is not seriously disputed that gender differences exist.</p>
<p>Traditional psychiatry was, of course, male-dominated. In the past 40 years or so, research into different aspects of women’s mental health has bloomed. This triggered off a reaction that, in the past decade, has produced a considerable number of studies specifically devoted to male humans. Both the books under review have, therefore, a strong but recent tradition behind them.</p>
<p>Turning to the women first, the <italic>Oxford Textbook of Women and Mental Health</italic>, part of the <italic>Oxford Textbooks in Psychiatry</italic> series, begins with a chapter on stigma, which clearly intends to describe the stigma felt by mentally ill women but rather seems to me to illustrate a paradox: the individual studied was actually patronized rather than stigmatized while ill, but was stigmatized for her over-aggressive reactions on recovery. This is the first of a group of chapters on fundamental aspects: gender-based violence, post-feminism, ethnicity (but, curiously enough, nothing on religion – I would have thought that the effects of the peculiarly patriarchal bias of all the Abrahamic religions were worth mentioning), lesbianism and women as carers. The second section of the book is on clinical aspects: anxiety disorders and depression, borderline personality disorders, perinatal, postnatal and puerperal disorders, substance abuse, eating disorders, and ‘special clinical topics’ (post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), self-harm and suicide). I am not sure why PTSD and self-harm are ‘special’ while postnatal or eating disorders are not, but the main thing is they are all in here. This is followed by a short section on learning disability, and a final section on legislation and policy, consisting of a single chapter by Dora Kohen focusing on the British legal and political situation at the time of writing. This last will, of course, be of little interest to readers in other countries and is already out of date: there has been an election in Britain since it was written and the new government clearly has quite different policies in mind. The rest of the book will be less easily dated and is more international in scope however, although still mainly focused on modern Western societies. A large proportion of women in the world do not live in the sort of societies in which this book would be relevant.</p>
<p>There is an excellent afterword by Mary Seeman covering recent scientific research. What I missed, however, was an introductory overview of the subject. In the absence of a general introduction it is sometimes difficult to see the wood for the trees. It was very unfortunate that Kohen, the book’s editor, died before it was published. It is possible that she would have been able to link the different sections of the book together more effectively, bringing out, for example, the distinctions between mental health promotion and mental disorder prevention, mentioned by John Cox in his foreword but not really touched on in the text. Nevertheless, this book can be warmly recommended as a valid and useful collection of interconnected chapters on an important medical and social topic.</p>
<p>Although men’s studies are a more recent phenomenon, the <italic>Counseling and Psychotherapy with Boys and Men</italic> series has already been going long enough for <italic>An International Psychology of Men</italic> to be number seven in the series, with another one already out and a further five promised – quite a little library on its own.</p>
<p>This volume kicks off, very promisingly, with a Masculine Competency Typology for Men who Migrate. Migration is an important topic. As with baboon troops, it is the unattached young human males who are most likely to drift off into other societies. The case study here, however, is of a Polish man from an affluent background coming legally to the USA with his wife and children. It is not clear how this would translate to the experiences of a teenage Mexican fence climber, a Bangladeshi contract labourer in Dubai, or a young Afghan stuck in a wasteland outside Calais hoping to scramble onto a lorry bound for England. On the other hand, I suppose, such people are less likely to get counselling or psychotherapy, whether they need it or not, and so do not need to be covered in the literature.</p>
<p>In her afterword to the <italic>Oxford Textbook of Women and Mental Health</italic>, Seeman mentions the fact that although women are more likely to seek psychological help than men are, mothers are more likely to seek psychological help for boys than for girls. She does not make it completely clear whether this is because boys are more likely to be mentally disturbed than girls, or whether, either for cultural or for innate reasons, boys express their disturbances in a more disruptive manner. Neither the chapter in this book on the ‘Role of Masculinity and Femininity in the Development … of Health Risk Behaviors’ nor that on ‘Promoting Positive Masculinity while Addressing Gender Role Conflict’ seems to shed much light on this either. Possibly some of the other volumes in the series such as <italic>Counseling Troubled Boys</italic> or <italic>Counseling Boys and Men with ADHD</italic> might provide more useful answers.</p>
<p>This volume calls itself ‘an international psychology’. To some extent it justifies this, with papers on cultures of violence in South Africa, homosexuality in India, and a ‘what I did on my summer holidays’ style essay on the experiences of a Fulbright scholar in Russia. There is an introductory essay here that goes a little way towards pulling these into context. This is not, however, a textbook on the topic; it is a disjointed collection of papers. This is, in fact, my main concern with books of this type. If any of these papers had been submitted to this journal as review articles, they would have gone through a complex, time-consuming and expensive peer-refereeing process. The journal would then come out and could reasonably be expected to be a disjointed collection of papers. I prefer papers to be peer reviewed and books, even when multi-authored, to have greater coherence than this. The <italic>Oxford Textbook of Women and Mental Health</italic> made a much better attempt to provide an organized survey of its subject.</p>
<p>There are 17 contributors and two editors to <italic>An International Psychology of Men</italic>, of whom only two are female, both of them joint authors. There were 56 contributors to the <italic>Oxford Textbook of Women and Mental Health</italic>, of whom, according to my calculations, 29, just over half, were male. I do not know if this has any significance.</p>
<p>I am glad to welcome both of these titles, although the <italic>Oxford Textbook of Women and Mental Health</italic> seems to me to be better as a book. Neither is perfect, but both make useful contributions to an important topic. They are a great improvement on the bad old days when gender-specific disorders were subsumed under ‘him’, with ‘her’ being relegated to the odd chapter on hysteria or, if you were lucky, post-natal depression. I hope, nevertheless, that they represent an interim stage on the road towards an individual-based rather than gender-based mental health provision.</p>
