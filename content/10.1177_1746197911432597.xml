<p>Social movement oriented citizenship (SMOC) centers on peaceful protest, proactive community involvement and participation in activities to support human rights and environmental protection. Research generally on SMOC is extremely limited; even more so is research that analyses the influence of school- and student-level, policy-relevant variables on SMOC. Using 1999 survey data on student civic knowledge, attitudes and behaviors, this study looks at this relationship in the context of Colombia. Controlling for background characteristics and student personal disposition, findings from regression analysis suggest that pedagogy and curriculum which encourage discussion, promote an open classroom climate, and implement a social movement-centered curriculum are positively and significantly related to the development in students of SMOC, while after school-related activities are not.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Just as all forms of civic participation are not the same, so too does civic education differ in its purposes and methods. In their seminal work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1746197911432597">Westheimer and Kahne (2004)</xref> ask ‘What kind of citizen?’ in relation to the type of citizen that civic education produces (or attempts to produce, at least). They suggest a continuum along which three types of citizens and civic education fall: first, there is the conception of citizenship as synonymous with being a good person or a good neighbor. The second conception of citizenship as more participatory; it includes, but goes beyond, voting to encompass participation in local politics and community affairs to make positive change. The third is what they call justice-oriented civic education; it entails being more critical of power structures, issues of resource distribution, human rights and social justice. In this conception, citizenship education should not simply teach students how systems of government and politics function, but it should also encourage students to question the origin of those systems and ask ‘Whose values and voices are reflected in those systems?’</p>
<p>With the typology identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1746197911432597">Westheimer and Kahne (2004)</xref> in mind, this research uses the case of Colombia to investigate the extent to which policy-relevant, school-level factors contribute to the development of students who exhibit characteristics of a variant of justice oriented citizenship-labeled here social movement oriented citizenship (SMOC). This citizenship orientation can be classified in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1746197911432597">Westheimer and Kahne’s (2004)</xref> typology as an extreme form of the social justice orientation. SMOC goes beyond justice-oriented citizenship in that it not only encourages students to question a system’s origins and whose voices are heard, but also to move to various forms of action. Specifically, this conception of citizenship centers on peaceful protest, proactive community involvement, participation in activities to support human rights, and support for protection of the environment.</p>
<p>In order to assess the effects school-related variables on SMOC, this research uses data from the 28-country study of students’ civic knowledge and attitudes carried out in 1999 by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (hereafter, IEA Cived dataset; more on this later). Of the 28 countries in the dataset, Colombia was chosen for analysis due to its high ranking on SMOC in comparison with other countries in the study (only Greece’ students exhibited a greater orientation towards social movement conceptions of citizenship). It is hypothesized, subsequently, that, if a connection exists between such school level factors as curriculum, pedagogy and extra-curricular activities and SMOC, the relationship will be evident in this country. This research, then, is an exploratory analysis of relationships between certain school-level factors and SMOC – an aspect of citizenship that has scarcely been explored previously.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1746197911432597">
<title>Previous research</title>
<p>Within the previous 15 years, citizenship education has received significant attention from researchers and theorists (Albowitz and Harnish, 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1746197911432597">Niemi and Jun, 1998</xref>). A preponderance of the attention on citizenship education has been devoted to conventional conceptions of democratic citizenship that center on voting and producing an informed citizenry (Albowitz and Harnish, 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1746197911432597">Hauser, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1746197911432597">Tenn, 2007</xref>). With regard to these conceptions, the model derived from the 1999 IEA Cived study by the principal researchers to predict student civic knowledge and likelihood of future voting found that both classroom level variables, such as pedagogy or having an open classroom climate, and after-school activities, such as participating in a school parliament, significantly and positively affect these student outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1746197911432597">Lehman and Torney-Purta, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Outside of conventional forms of citizenship, however, very little research exists. Only two recent papers investigate determinants of SMOC or SMOC-related variables. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1746197911432597">Pizmony-Levy (2007)</xref>, also using the IEA Cived dataset, investigates student- and country-level contributors to support for social movement citizenship across all 28 countries participating in the study. By employing hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), the study found that student support for conventional forms of citizenship, type of government, gender, attention to news and discussions about international news are the strongest predictors of support for social movement citizenship. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1746197911432597">Torney-Purta et al. (2008)</xref> analyze differences across countries in students’ knowledge related to SMOC using the same dataset and methodology (HLM). They find, in addition to an effect from intergovernmental discourse (i.e. dialogue between nations and international governing bodies), the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>Students with more knowledge of human rights, more frequent engagement with international topics, and more open class and school climates held stronger norms supporting social movement citizenship, had more positive attitudes toward immigrants’ rights and were more politically efficacious. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1746197911432597">Torney-Purta et al., 2008</xref>: 857)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In contrast to these studies, the present research investigates school-level factors without considering the effects of type of government. It is posited that both the classroom and extra-curricular activities provide opportunities for important and influential social and political development. Certainly, it is necessary to consider the effects of context and larger forces when interpreting the results of any study; here, however, the author believes that insufficient attention has been allocated to school-level, policy-relevant variables.</p>
<p>Previous research indicates that a further illumination of the relationship between school-level factors and student civic orientation is warranted. Many scholars have examined the effects of participatory and discussion-based pedagogy and school organization on student engagement and participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1746197911432597">Chilcoat and Ligon, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1746197911432597">Duncan-Andrade and Morrell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1746197911432597">Keisar and Tutela, 2007</xref>; Fernandez-Balboa, 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1746197911432597">Marri, 2005</xref>; Vibert et al., 2005). Each of these researchers employs qualitative research methods to examine the success of their particular initiatives, finding that, through open classroom climate, discussion and employing the ‘problem-posing’ method of instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1746197911432597">Freire, 1970</xref>), students were much more engaged in classroom activities generally, as well as school-level action that centered on issues of injustice and unfair treatment. In looking not at the case of one school or one particular teacher intervention, this replace seeks to investigate whether school-related variables exhibit significant effects on SMOC, broadly speaking.</p>
<p>At the level of theory, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1746197911432597">Anyon (2005)</xref> reviews the literature on how individuals come to be involved in politically contentious issues and asserts that people do not simply ‘become political’ and then decide to participate in social movement related activities, but rather that people first participate and then become more active in such activities. This would seem to call into question whether or not classroom-level teacher behavior and curricula are appropriate factors for analysis; yet, previous research at this level finds that citizenship education can serve as a socializing agent by encouraging young people to develop and practice civic skills, offering opportunities for open discussions about political and social issues, and providing training grounds for civic involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1746197911432597">Andolina, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1746197911432597">Comber, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1746197911432597">Gimbel et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, others have concluded that classroom environments that support the open discussion of political and social issues enhance the positive effects of civic education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1746197911432597">Campbell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1746197911432597">Niemi and Jun, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1746197911432597">Pasek et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1746197911432597">Torney-Purta, 2002</xref>). Thus, while the assertion by Anyon has not been tested, current research on educational programs suggests that classroom-level activity is an appropriate level for analysis with regard to SMOC.</p>
<p>Aside from classroom-related factors, the other school-related activity analyzed in this study is after school activities – an area of research that is generally off the map for researchers of the determinants of future civic activity (especially when conceptualized as separate/different from service learning). However, one study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1746197911432597">Conover and Searing (2000)</xref>, which focuses on how high schools contribute to the political socialization of students, finds that extra-curricular activities represent one element of four to significantly correlate with students’ sense and practice of citizenship.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1746197911432597">1</xref></sup> Conversely, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1746197911432597">Edwards (2009)</xref> looks at the effect of extra-curricular activities, among other school-level variables, on a conception of citizenship that centers on deliberation, but finds no significant relationship between student participation in such activity and increased civic engagement. Given that the results for this area of research are mixed, it is all the more important to explore this relationship in the context of Colombia.</p>

<sec id="section3-1746197911432597">
<title>Context of citizenship education in Colombia</title>
<p>In the face of decades of violence and sustained conflict ‘linked to years of confrontation between groups that have vied for power, control of illegal drug trafficking, and control of land’, the Colombian government has developed and implemented an ‘education-based preventative approach to violence and to the development of civic engagement’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1746197911432597">Patti and Espinosa, 2007</xref>: 111, 110). Although it is encouraging to note that the Ministry of Education (MoE), as of 2004, had formulated for all students minimum ‘citizenship competencies’ – understood as ‘the articulated combination of basic knowledge, along with cognitive, emotional, communicative, and integrative competencies that allow a citizen to act constructively in a democratic society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1746197911432597">Patti and Espinosa, 2007</xref>: 112) – the landscape of citizenship education in Colombia prior to 2004 did not include official, purposeful educational responses to counter the effects of violence and promote positive, engaged citizenship activity. While specific programs have been designed since 2004 to meet the citizenship standards delineated by the MoE- and which may thus contribute to current student citizenship orientation- the findings of this research (based on data gathered in 1999) can not be attributed to such governmental or programmatic interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1746197911432597">Chaux, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>There are, nevertheless a number of contextual factors from the period prior to 2004 that must be taken into account. One the one hand, the passage of the 1991 constitution, along with a history of social movements and efforts in the early 1990s at the decentralization of school governance, may encourage more active citizenship. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1746197911432597">Tibbetts and Torney-Purta (1999</xref>: 9) elaborate on these issues: ‘A new National Constitution was prepared in Colombia in 1991, raising new awareness of civic and political issues. [As well,] a variety of social movements have opened social participation to women, children and youth, afro-Colombians, and indigenous populations. [Lastly,] there has been considerable decentralization and new possibilities for citizens to defend their rights’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1746197911432597">2</xref></sup> At the same time, one must consider that political violence and conflict were widespread, and that these can discourage public displays of citizenship activity. This is particularly relevant here because, as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1746197911432597">Novelli (2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1746197911432597">2009</xref>), that political violence was often targeted at teachers, their unions, and even students and schools. Yet the effect of exposure to such violence and conflict may not actually suppress oppositional forms of public behavior. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1746197911432597">Chaux (2009)</xref>, writing on Colombia, notes that continued exposure to armed political violence increases the likelihood of developing aggressive behaviors. Though the present research does not investigate this complex series of contextual factors, it is important to take them into account when considering this study’s findings.</p>

<sec id="section4-1746197911432597">
<title>Conceptual framework</title>
<p>The conceptual framework guiding this research derives from previous research on citizenship education, the context in which that education takes place, and the personal disposition of students. More specifically, the framework understands students’ social movement conceptions of citizenship as impacted by both the effects of school-related variables and students’ personal disposition, which itself results from socialization forces (family, friends, community context) and is influenced by background characteristics (gender, immigration status, language spoken). Thus, as the diagram found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1746197911432597">Figure 1</xref> indicates, school-level factors are understood to influence both social movement orientation and personal disposition. Stated another way, personal disposition mediates the effects of school-related variables on SMOC.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<sec id="section6-1746197911432597">
<title>Dataset</title>
<p>The International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) is a consortium of research centers in about 60 countries. Prior to the 1990s it had only conducted large-scale studies of mathematics, science and literacy. In the 1990s, however, IEA turned its focus to assessing the knowledge, attitudes and behavior of young people as these three areas relate to civics. Subsequently, a two-phase study was conducted in which the first phase consisted of both case studies of civics education in each country as well as agreement around which content areas should appear in the test of civic knowledge.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1746197911432597">3</xref></sup> The second phase consisted of the development of a test of civic knowledge and a survey to accompany it that would assess beliefs and attitudes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1746197911432597">4</xref></sup> In the 28 countries that chose to participate, the test and survey instruments were given in 1999 – and only administered to students in civics, history and/or social studies classes. Approximately 90,000 14-year-old students participated. Both the schools and the individual classrooms tested within each school were randomly sampled, thus representing a cluster sampling approach.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1746197911432597">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>Within Colombia, the original IEA Cived sample consisted of 4,926 students. Because it was important to be able to draw connections between student perceptions of citizenship and school-related variables, the sample was reduced to include only those cases containing responses to all the questions of interest. The final analytic sample included 2,254 students – a reduction of 53%. Chi-squared analysis indicates that there are significant differences between the retained and dropped cases for each of the student characteristics included in this study – gender, immigration status and language spoken. However, in the final analytic sample there is a significant difference in composition neither with regard to gender nor with regard to Spanish primarily being the language spoken by students. In contrast, with regard to students borne outside of Colombia, within the final analytic sample, there are significantly fewer of them than students who were borne inside Colombia. These descriptive characteristics of the analytic sample, which <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1746197911432597">Table 1</xref> displays, should be kept in mind when interpreting the findings.</p>

<p>While the IEA Cived dataset is a wealth of information for student civic knowledge, skills and attitudes, it lacks the standard demographic characteristics of race, ethnicity and socio-economic status (SES). Though a proxy variable (number of books in the home) has been substituted by other researchers for SES, the present study does not include this variable because of concerns over its validity in the context of Colombia. Future research may include this measure. Here, what we observe is that the only statistically significant difference in the final analytic sample’s demographic characteristics pertains to country of birth: there are more Colombians than immigrants in the analytic sample. There are not significantly more females than males in the retained cases.</p>

<sec id="section8-1746197911432597">
<title>Variables</title>
<p>Variables were selected from the IEA Cived dataset and placed in six groups related to the conceptual framework in order to facilitate analysis. The first group contains student characteristics (gender, country of birth and spoken language – as discussed above). The second group pertains to student personal disposition and represents the extent to which students engage in the following behavior: discussing politics with friends or family, discussing politics with teachers, and reading the newspaper or watch the news on television. The third group relates to pedagogy and is comprised of student responses to eight questions about the extent to which their history or civics teacher promoted an open classroom climate characterized by discussion and the expression of student opinion on social and political issues. In relating to curriculum, the fourth group represents student responses to whether the instructor taught the students to understand people with different ideas, to cooperate in groups with other students, to contribute to solving problems in the community and to act to protect the environment. Group five corresponds with extra-curricular activities, including participation in a student council, youth organization, school newspaper or environmental organization. The final group serves as the outcome variable of interest – student social movement-oriented conceptions of citizenship – and is comprised of student responses to questions about the extent to which a ‘good citizen’ participates in the following behaviors: a peace protest against a law believed to be unjust, activities to benefit people in the community, activities promoting human rights and activities to protect the environment. Student background characteristics are dummy-coded (0/1); variables in groups two through five, which students initially answered on a four-point scale, have been transformed into standardized composite variables through factor analysis (mean = 0; standard deviation = 1). See the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1746197911432597">Appendix</xref> for more detail.</p>

<sec id="section9-1746197911432597">
<title>Analytic approach</title>
<p>This study employs multivariate ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis in order explore the relationships between school-level variables, personal dispositions, background characteristics and student conceptions of social movement-oriented citizenship. The effects of each group of variables on SMOC is approximated by adding one group at a time to the regression analysis – in a sequence that follows the theoretical framework presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1746197911432597">Figure 1</xref>. Model 1 includes student characteristics. Model 2 adds the mediating variables of personal disposition. This group is added second so that the general relationship of subsequent groups of variables between both the dependent variable (SMOC) and personal disposition can be assessed across models. Model 3 continues by adding the curriculum and pedagogy composites. Both composites are added simultaneously because of their relationship in practice: they tend to go hand in hand. Finally, model 4 adds the extra-curricular composite to the analysis.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1746197911432597">Table 2</xref> displays the results of the OLS regression. The constant represents the excluded student demographic categories – male, born outside of Colombia and speaking a language other than Spanish. Because all composites have been standardized, the coefficients can be interpreted as effect sizes – that is, a percentage change in the standard deviation (SD) of the dependent variables associated with a SD change in the independent variable.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>A first observation is that none of the models account for much of the variance between the observed and predicted values for the variables included (model 4, for example, only predicts 9.1% of the variance). Nevertheless, we can get an idea of which variables remain salient to the analysis by assessing the effect of variables across the nested models. In terms of student characteristics, there is not a significant difference between males and females regarding their conceptions of SMOC. Not only do significant differences exist and persist across models for country of birth and language spoken, but they are also moderately large. Adding personal disposition and school-related variables in models three and four only slightly decreases the effect size country of birth, while slightly increasing the effect of language spoken. Across the models, being born in Colombia and speaking Spanish positively contributes to the extent to which students hold social movement-oriented conceptions of citizenship. Students from other countries may not have the same nationalistic sentiments as do Colombian students, and may therefore not be interested in engaging in those behaviors that characterize SMOC.</p>
<p>Although all three composites for personal disposition – added in model 2 – are initially significant, after the inclusion of school-related variables in models 3 and 4, two of the personal disposition composites (talking about politics with friends or family and talking about politics with teachers) lose their significance. What remains significant, though not large in magnitude, is reading or watching the news. This is a common finding across studies on determinants of different forms of citizenship, especially for IEA Cived studies. Future research on citizenship education should unpack the origin and effects of this behavior.</p>
<p>Models three and four allow us to hone in on the central question of this research – namely, what is the relationship between school-level, policy relevant variables and SMOC, as mediated by personal disposition? In model three, we see that pedagogy and curriculum are statistically significant and (in the case of curriculum) contribute moderately (effect size = 0.252 for a one SD increase) to SMOC. At the same time, the inclusion of pedagogy and curriculum coincides with two of the three composites for personal disposition becoming non-significant. Furthermore, we see the largest jump in variance explained with the addition of pedagogy and curriculum. As such, what variance this model does explain is explained primarily by these two school-related composite variables. Model 4 adds extra-curricular variables, which are not statistically significant, do not coincide with a change in the relationship between personal disposition and SMOC, and do not explain any more of the variance in the model.</p>
<p>Overall, then, in terms of the primary focus of this article, what this research indicates is that, within the model specified here, the school-related, policy-relevant variables of curriculum and pedagogy contribute positively and significantly to SMOC. While these two composite variables do not have particularly large effect sizes, what the relationship indicates is that (1) the more open the classroom climate, the more students are encouraged and provided the opportunity to engage in discussion of political and social issues and (2) the more teachers emphasize understanding differences, cooperating in groups, contributing to solving problems in the community, and acting to protect the environment, then the more students define ‘good citizenship’ as involving participating in peaceful protests of unjust laws, activities to benefit the community, activities to promote human rights and activities to protect the environment. As such, the primary contribution of this research is to provide evidence about what – within the policy sphere – can be done to affect students’ orientation towards such conceptions of citizenship.</p>

<title>Discussion and conclusion</title>
<p>Owing to its high international ranking in terms of social movement oriented conceptions of citizenship held by students, this article has explored the case of Colombia to examine the relationship between school-level, policy relevant variables and such student-held citizenship conceptions. The central finding is that pedagogy and curriculum – or the extent to which teachers encourage discussion, promote an open classroom climate, and implement a social movement-centered curriculum – are positively and significantly related to the development in students of social movement oriented conceptions of citizenship. This finding is particularly noteworthy given the prevalence of political violence in the country, the lack of government control in many areas and the stifling effect that these contextual factors might be expected to have on SMOC behavior.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the present research, which centers on school- and student-level influencers of students’ beliefs, partially corroborates what previous research has found on social movement conceptions of citizenship. Specifically, this is so in that reading or watching the news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1746197911432597">Pizmony-Levy, 2007</xref>) and a more open classroom climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1746197911432597">Torney-Purta et al., 2008</xref>) contribute to students supporting social movement citizenship. However, what it does not find, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1746197911432597">Pizmony-Levy (2007)</xref> does find, is a significant gender effect. That is, it was not found that the curricular and pedagogical behaviors assessed in this research affect to a significantly greater degree either male or female students.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the implication of this study for policymakers, administrators and teachers is that purposeful attempts to adapt classroom climate, teaching methods and curricular content in the ways suggested by these findings can influence student citizenship conceptions such that they orient more toward social movements, or, put differently, toward activities aimed at the betterment of society and the environment generally. However, as noted in the above section on the context of citizenship education in Colombia, there is a range of factors not captured in the data on which this research is based. While the data for this study are at the level of the student and the school, this range of factors – including political violence (generally and against teachers, their unions, students and schools specifically), social movements and decentralization of school governance – may potentially be relevant and influential. Indeed, these issues, and subsequent reactions to them by teachers and students, could explain why the pedagogy and curriculum variables analyzed here have a significant effect without accounting for much of the overall variance. To account for these matters, future research should involve case studies which qualitatively explore students’ rationales for the effects found in this study while simultaneously considering macro-contextual factors. In addition, future research should investigate the success of the ‘citizenship competencies’ initiative since it was developed in 2004 by the Colombian MoE. This attempt to promote positive, engaged citizenship activity could reinforce SMOC, or it could shift the focus to other forms of engagement. The future research suggested here may illuminate important variables not present in the IEA Cived study and may add to our theoretical and practical understanding of the relationship between schools and how they can and do influence students’ citizenship orientation development in particular ways.</p>
