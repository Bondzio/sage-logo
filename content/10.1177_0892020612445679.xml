                <p>Student voice is a key component in constructing discourses of respect,
                    empowerment and citizenship in schools. It can help schools to become learning
                    communities, rather than knowledge factories, that serve the needs of the
                    majority of their members, the students, as successfully as possible and prepare
                    them for future lives in a wide variety of contexts. It can help to improve
                    pedagogical and organisational practice. This article takes the position that
                    students are expert observers of school life and teachers’ practices and
                    interrogates what they consider to be more and less successful approaches to
                    those. It draws on three studies of student voices that were carried out by the
                    author with colleagues between 2006 and 2011 in England and Lebanon in primary
                    and secondary schools.</p>

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>This article interrogates students’ voices in predominantly intercultural
                contexts on more and less successful approaches to teaching, learning and leadership
                in schools, including what relationships between teachers and students might
                construct cultures in schools and classrooms that facilitate learning. The article
                draws on three empirical studies of students’ perspectives on schooling
                carried out by the author and colleagues, one of which was based in four charity
                foundation primary schools in Beirut, Lebanon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0892020612445679">Nabhani et al., 2012</xref>) serving
                economically disadvantaged city communities. The second study was of Year 9
                (Y9, 13−14 year old) students of English in a state secondary
                school in England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0892020612445679">Cremin
                    et al., 2011</xref>) serving a mixed multi-cultural catchment area of
                private and social housing. The third was of Y9 Science students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0892020612445679">Tas and Busher,
                2011</xref>) in two state secondary schools in England, one serving a largely
                mono-cultural rural area and one an urban multi-cultural but largely economically
                disadvantaged area. The three studies varied in size, but none had fewer than 30
                participants and all used semi-structured interviews with students and teachers, as
                well as non-participant observation by researchers as the main data-collection
                instruments.</p>
            <p>Accessing students’ perspectives on education used to be encouraged by central
                government in England because it promoted personalised learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0892020612445679">DfES, 2008</xref>) and
                recognised students as clients of a school who had a right to be heard in the
                evaluation of schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0892020612445679">Troman et al., 2007</xref>). Accessing students’ voices
                encourages student engagement in learning by giving them a sense of ownership of the
                process and of the school institutions in which their work is located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0892020612445679">Riley and Rustique-Forrester,
                    2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0892020612445679">Potter,
                    2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0892020612445679">Sebba and
                    Robinson, 2011</xref>). Consequently, it helps to develop a more
                inclusive school environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0892020612445679">Demetriou and Wilson, 2010</xref>). It also
                helps teachers to reflect more critically on their practices to improve the quality
                of schooling, teaching and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0892020612445679">McIntyre et al., 2005</xref>). Interaction
                with others and iterative identity construction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0892020612445679">Giddens, 1991</xref>) are central
                theoretical constructs in people’s self-development, of which learning forms
                a part.</p>
            <p>Listening to students’ voices acknowledges the rights of students to influence
                the shaping of their own learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0892020612445679">Fielding, 2004</xref>) and the processes of
                their school organisation, democratising schooling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0892020612445679">Flutter and Rudduck, 2004</xref>). It
                recognises that students are citizens, not merely citizens in preparation, whose
                rights should be respected in the present as well as in the future. It forms part of
                the enactment of children’s rights under the UN Convention of the Rights of
                the Child (UNCRC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0892020612445679">Sebba and Robinson, 2011</xref>). Within
                the European Union, the development of citizenship by member states is recognised as
                crucial to the construction of society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0892020612445679">Osler and Starkey, 1999</xref>). However,
                there are some distinct national differences in understandings of citizenship, with
                an emphasis on ‘active citizenship’ in England, highlighting
                citizens’ duties and responsibilities rather than their rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0892020612445679">Ross, 2003</xref>) but on
                instrumental citizen rights (e.g. the right to travel, or to work) in
                France and Spain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0892020612445679">Edye,
                    2003</xref>).</p>
            <p>Further, the concept of student voice is itself problematic. Some views hold that it
                can only be articulated when teachers authorise it and usually in ways that curtail
                any critical discussion of prevailing conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0892020612445679">Ruddock, 2006</xref>). Other views assume
                that student voice is monolingual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0892020612445679">Robinson and Taylor, 2007</xref>), speaking
                only in the particular ways expected of subordinates by ruling elites
                (Spivak, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0892020612445679">Morton,
                    2002</xref>), in the case of schools, the teachers, denying the
                multi-faceted nature of student perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0892020612445679">Rubin and Silva, 2003</xref>).</p>
            <p>School processes often serve to disempower students. In England, it is difficult to
                promote a genuinely democratic dialogue in schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0892020612445679">Arnot and Reay 2007</xref>) because state
                schools try to optimise their own performance within the disciplinary framework of
                performative education policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0892020612445679">Troman et al., 2007</xref>). ‘The
                structures of secondary schooling offer, on the whole, less responsibility and
                autonomy than many young people are accustomed to taking out of school’
                    (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0892020612445679">Flutter and Rudduck,
                    2004</xref>, p.1). Further, student ‘consultation’, when it
                occurs, may be tokenistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0892020612445679">Byrom et al., 2007</xref>) because of the policy contexts of schooling,
                the fear of some senior staff of ‘losing control’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0892020612445679">Busher and Cremin,
                2012</xref>), and an unwillingness of teachers to recognise the legitimacy of
                different, including students’, perspectives on schooling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0892020612445679">Robinson and Taylor,
                2007</xref>) and the intersectionality of gender, social status, ethnicity
                and faith (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0892020612445679">Reay,
                    2006</xref>) in the construction of student perspectives: there is not
                one student voice to be heard but many, and they may differ from the
                (multiplicity of) teachers’ voices.</p>
            <p>However, involving students directly in school decision-making about issues of
                immediate relevance to their own lives, such as teaching, learning and school
                organisation, helps to develop their sense of citizenship by constructing respectful
                cultures in schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0892020612445679">Sebba and Robinson, 2011</xref>) and raises their general levels of
                motivation and productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0892020612445679">Potter, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0892020612445679">Clough and Holden, 2002</xref>) by giving
                them a sense of ownership of school processes, including what happens in lessons and
                classrooms. It helps students to perceive themselves as members of a community of
                learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0892020612445679">Rudduck and
                    McIntyre, 2007</xref>) who help to shape its practices rather than being
                workers in a knowledge factory. This helps teachers and schools to meet
                students’ educational needs more successfully, especially in schools serving
                economically and socially disadvantaged areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0892020612445679">Fielding, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0892020612445679">Mujis et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
            <p>None the less, in England in the early 21st century education lagged behind some
                other child services in terms of heeding what children had to say (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0892020612445679">Hancock and Mansfield,
                2002</xref>). For example, the agenda of school councils were often dominated
                by the agenda of senior staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0892020612445679">Fielding, 2004</xref>) or students were
                limited to discussing matters that senior staff considered appropriate to them, such
                as bullying policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0892020612445679">Busher
                    and Cremin, 2012</xref>).</p>
            <p>Students are experienced participant observers of teachers, teaching and schools
                    (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0892020612445679">Riley and
                    Rustique-Forrester, 2002</xref>). Many are able to articulate clearly
                what they consider to be effective and ineffective teaching and support for
                students, expressing views that chime closely with the literature on effective
                teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0892020612445679">Wragg et al.,
                    2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0892020612445679">Cooper et al.,
                    2000</xref>). Encouraging students to speak out about matters that
                concern them in school, whether in playgrounds, corridors, classrooms or lessons,
                helps teachers to see the school world through the eyes of the main actors in school
                and adapt their practices accordingly, albeit within the contexts of internal and
                external school policy discourses and teachers’ own value-laden perspectives
                of practice.</p>

                <p>Students in all three studies were asked about what they enjoyed about schooling
                    and indicated that they enjoyed similar aspects (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0892020612445679">Tables 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0892020612445679">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0892020612445679">3</xref>), such as being with their

                <p>Students liked those teachers who acknowledged their agency and constructed
                    respectful relationships with them as well as making learning exciting. Such
                    views offer important clues to school leaders whether at school, department or
                    classroom level, about what organisational cultures are likely to help students
                    to engage strongly with schooling.</p>
                <p>A closer investigation of students’ perspectives on successful
                    relationships with teachers showed considerable commonality with what is known
                    about collaborative relationships between leaders and followers that help to
                    create school development (Muijs et al., 2005; Stoll and Seashore Louis,
                    2007). Students had clear ideas about the quality of relationships with
                    teachers that helped them to learn, as is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0892020612445679">Tables 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0892020612445679">5</xref>. These included qualities of respect
                    and trust, care and concern, and maintaining order so that students could work
                    purposefully. The English students recognised that teachers needed to sustain a
                    school’s system (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0892020612445679">Table 4</xref>), indeed some welcomed
                    their gentle surveillance during recreation times, but preferred to work in a
                    relaxed atmosphere where they felt respected.</p>

                <p>Science students echoed these views (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0892020612445679">Table 5</xref>), claiming that
                    supportive relationships with teachers included being able to talk with their
                    teachers about their work when they needed to. They were grateful for teachers
                    and support staff who took an interest in them and their work, kept them safe
                    and controlled the classes so they could work. Science students also emphasised
                    the importance of teachers’ enthusiasm for their subject. Students in the
                    Lebanese schools (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0892020612445679">Table 1</xref>) also thought it important to have support from
                    teachers and clear explanations to help them with their work.</p>
                <p>Such views expressed by students resonate strongly with research on constructing
                    learning communities, whether amongst staff or with students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0892020612445679">Bolam et al., 2005</xref>;
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0892020612445679">Busher et al,
                    2007</xref>), and the importance of leaders working with other members of
                    such communities to create cultures of collaboration that further the purposes
                    of the community in its policy contexts. They also resonate positively with the
                    views expressed by Lebanese teachers on how they helped students to engage with
                    the curriculum (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0892020612445679">Table 6</xref>). The fictitious acronyms in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0892020612445679">Table 6</xref> indicate schools in the
                    Lebanese study. This suggests that the construction of purposeful learning
                    communities can take place by leaders at many levels in a school: whole school,
                    subject or key stage area, or classroom, whatever operational unit of a school
                    organisation is being considered. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0892020612445679">Wenger (1998</xref>) makes the
                    same point. But it does suggest that leadership and the projection of power to
                    enact, emblematise and sustain particular values is an important element in the
                    construction of organisational cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0892020612445679">Busher et al., 2007</xref>).</p>

                    successfully, not only to meet the performance targets of a school, but also to
                    help students develop a range of knowledge and skills that contribute to their

                    them. Important among the pedagogical strategies were practical work, learning
                    related to students everyday lives where possible, work that challenged

                <p>The academic leadership that students welcomed gave them clear explanations of
                    the work, support in understanding when they needed it and a clear structure to
                    their work. The classroom culture that students preferred was a collaborative
                    and trustful one where people could ‘have fun’ while working
                    purposefully. These views echo positively with Lebanese teachers’ claims
                    about how they helped students to engage with learning (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0892020612445679">Table 6</xref>) by
                    being enthusiastic about subject knowledge and energetically interested in
                    helping students to learn through a variety of different activities. They also
                    thought it important to give additional support to students who were struggling
                    to understand an aspect of their work, but their decisions to intervene were
                    based on careful formative assessment of students’ work and progress and
                    a sensitive monitoring of how different students responded to different
                    approaches to learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0892020612445679">Nabhani et al., 2012</xref>). Such

                    at all levels important insights into how to create with students purposeful and
                    successful school learning communities, students’ negative perspectives
                    of schooling and lessons offer teachers and school leaders severe warnings on
                    what needs to be eradicated if schools are to improve. Indeed, the aspects of
                    schooling which students in these studies disliked bear many resemblances to
                    those characteristics related to schools described as ‘stuck’

                    of schooling that students disliked reflected their disengagement from the
                    school system, e.g. dislike of certain subjects, annoyance with other
                    students’ anti-social behaviour, such as bullying or shouting, and

                    over them seemingly regardless of students’ rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0892020612445679">Sebba and Robinson,
                        2011</xref>) or of students’ perspectives
                    (voice). Although the English students seemed to accept the
                    disciplinary system in their school, some of them resented the ways it was
                    implemented to try to create docile bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0892020612445679">Foucault, 1977</xref>) by, amongst
                    other things, surveillance of student activity by security cameras, the
                    monitoring of the use of the school toilets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0892020612445679">Busher and Cremin, 2012</xref>) and
                    punishment that seemed pointless. In particular they resented teachers’
                    willingness to coerce students by projecting their authority in various ways,
                    such as that of verbal violence (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table11-0892020612445679">Table 11</xref>), a view with which
                    the Lebanese students concurred (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0892020612445679">Table 9</xref>). Whatever form this
                    coercion took, it seemed to lack respect for the students as people and
                    emphasised discipline and control as the main values the schools espoused to
                    meet their performative targets.</p>

                <p>Not surprisingly, students’ views of unsuccessful lessons (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table12-0892020612445679">Tables 12</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table13-0892020612445679">13</xref>) reflected
                    what they disliked about school: teachers who were perceived as incompetent,
                    either being unable to organise lessons effectively or to work with students
                    successfully, or to make the topic of a lesson intelligible to students. Lack of
                    variety of work during lessons, coupled with a lack of opportunity to take part
                    in discussions also led students to consider lessons unsuccessful.
                    Students’ learning is significantly improved through engagement in group
                    discussions that are focused on aspects of the curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0892020612445679">Bennett et al.,

                        made of them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0892020612445679">Troman et al., 2007</xref>). Capturing the multiplicity of
                        student voice, by school council, year group council, or in each classroom
                        may be difficult, as the Lebanese teachers testify (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0892020612445679">Table 6</xref>).
                        Doing so, however, results in enthusiastic and engaged students who enjoy
                        learning. This, itself, makes easier classroom and school management and
                        helps students and schools, even in economically and socially disadvantaged
                        areas, to gain a wide range of achievements.</p>

                <list-item>
                    <p>Second, student perspectives on schooling help teachers to reflect on their
                        own practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0892020612445679">McIntyre et al., 2005</xref>) and can help senior and middle
                        level leaders identify programmes of professional development that will help
                        staff and students to work together more collaboratively and
                        successfully.</p>

                <list-item>
                    <p>Third, student voices raise challenging questions about what are appropriate
                        cultures for schools, but seem to indicate particular cultures that closely
                        resemble those associated with improving schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0892020612445679">Hopkins, 2001</xref>;

                            Louis, 2007</xref>). This culture is founded on values of mutual
                        respect and collaboration between teachers and students, of the sort found
                        in Rights Respecting Schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0892020612445679">Sebba and Robinson, 2011</xref>),
                        and is central to students’ successful learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0892020612445679">Hopkins,
                        2001</xref>) and the development of their understandings of
                        citizenship for a democratic society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0892020612445679">Potter, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0892020612445679">Clough and Holden,

                <list-item>
                    <p>Fourth, and perhaps most challengingly to leaders in schools and classrooms,
                        recognition that students have a legitimate voice demands that students are
                        respected as people, not merely as units of output by which to measure
                        school performance. As participating members of a school community and the
                        various learning communities in it, students have part-ownership of it and a
                        respected and acknowledged part to play in negotiating its culture and
                        practices along with the teachers, support staff and other stakeholders in
                        it. This implies that staff have to work with students as fellow members of
                        these learning communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0892020612445679">Bolam et al., 2005</xref>) in
                        schools and classrooms despite the asymmetrical power relationships between
                        them. It leads to a positive view of democratic schooling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0892020612445679">Woods, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0892020612445679">Woods and Gronn,

                        serving purposeful collaborative communities whose members pursue the
                        construction of learning together.</p>
