<p>
<italic>127 Hours</italic> (2010) is a passionate and kinetic film that evokes questions about self-reflexivity, mind and nature, and the postmodern experience. This 94-minute film directed by Danny Boyle and starring James Franco,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0160597611433268">1</xref>
</sup> is concerned with perseverance and self-discovery, yet it is also a muse on the limitations of human agency and the potential for ecological identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160597611433268">Thomashow 1995</xref>). <italic>127 Hours</italic> tells the story of Aron Ralston, a fervent mountaineer and outdoorsman, who while canyoneering in the Horseshoe Canyon district of Canyonlands National Park, was ensnared by an 800-pound boulder at the bottom of a remote slot canyon. After enduring 5 days of isolation, starvation, dehydration, 40-degree temperatures, and confounding delusions, Ralston effectively liberated himself by amputating his right arm using the knife from a multipurpose tool.</p>
<p>Adapted by Simon Beaufoy from Ralston’s memoir, <italic>Between a Rock and a Hard Place </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160597611433268">2004</xref>), <italic>127 Hours</italic> utilizes innovative film techniques, such as split-screen and flash-forward editing, multiple-camera formats,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0160597611433268">2</xref>
</sup> and memory and fantasy sequences to depict Ralston’s experience in Blue John Canyon. Though Ralston’s entrapment was a technical problem, and involved 5 days of endless challenges, Boyle demonstrates his ingenuity as a filmmaker by transcending the mundane trivialities of Ralston’s experience, and composes a dynamic visual spectacle of one man’s imagination, fear, and eventual transcendence. Throughout the film, Boyle also elicits an attachment to place and physical sensation and invites the audience to suffer delusions, delirious pangs of dehydration, and the excruciating pain induced by fractured bones, ruptured muscles, and severed nerves.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0160597611433268">3</xref>
</sup> In this regard, the audience is often urged to reflect on their own determination in moments of severe despondency. Could I have amputated my arm? Would I have remained composed in light of the situation? Would I have exhausted my limited resources? <italic>127 Hours</italic> is a remarkable film, which expressively addresses affective, spiritual, and ecological concerns, with a rhythmic and hypnotic filmmaking style that portrays an unrelenting spirit.</p>
<sec id="section1-0160597611433268">
<title>Ecological Identity, Self-Reflexivity, and The Ecological Self</title>
<p>Underlining <italic>127 Hours</italic> is the concept of ecological identity work. Mitchell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160597611433268">Thomashow (1995</xref>) defines ecological identity work as the reflexive process of recognizing the self as ecologically embedded, constructed from interaction with human and nonhuman phenomena. In this definition, “nature becomes an object of identification” for the self, the result of a confluence of factors, including “perception of the ecosystem,” and the direct, embodied experience of environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160597611433268">Thomashow 1995</xref>:3). Thus, consciousness can be understood as emerging through an active yet intuitive participation with the surrounding human and nonhuman environments, while social action is the result of social and ecological situatedness.</p>
<p>In <italic>127 Hours</italic>, Ralston’s challenge was both a practical and personal struggle to overcome physical and spiritual paradoxes. Yet, Ralston’s emergent self-identity arose from his failed attempts to escape, memories and fantasies, ritual video journals,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0160597611433268">4</xref>
</sup> and ecological situatedness. These influences were located in the environmental context of the canyon, but they were also situated in Ralston’s sociological imagination. Though Ralston’s experiences in Blue John Canyon were bereft of human contact, he never ceased to be a social being. Instead, his selfhood was “continually negotiated through linguistic exchange” with nonhuman phenomena (the raven, insects, the boulder, the environmental conditions of the cave), technology (video camera, Camelback), and memories and fantasies, which acted as imaginative social feedback loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0160597611433268">Cerulo 1997</xref>:387). Ralston’s experiences can be understood as ecological identity work because he reflexively recognized and eventually accepted his self as embedded in the surrounding ecology. The concept of ecological identity work may also be useful as a communicative tool for bridging the epistemological and realist debate in contemporary environmental thought. For more than 30 years environmental theorists have argued over the “real” and “constructed” effects of environmental phenomena on social processes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0160597611433268">Dunlap 2010</xref>). Though empirical evaluations of the natural environment are integral to social and ecological interaction, they have overlooked the importance of reflexive, localized, and embodied perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0160597611433268">Macnaghten 2003</xref>). Ecological identity work offers an inclusive approach to environmental interaction that may engender a humanistic, yet ecologically situated “quality of mind” that permits humans to understand and appreciate the interconnectedness of natural and social systems. <italic>127 hours</italic> illustrates this marvelously in its portrayal of Ralston as an adventurer who finds humility and transcendence in the remote depths of Blue John Canyon. By reflexively and corporeally confronting his humanity, Ralston recognizes his common bond with social and natural systems, and thus detaches from the persistent illusion of human exceptionalism.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>
<italic>127 Hours</italic> is a willful meditation on one man’s unique wilderness expedition, yet it is also a reflection on the social and ecological embeddedness of human existence. Like other recent films (The Tree of Life 2011; Into the Wild 2008; Old Joy 2006), <italic>127 Hours</italic> asks profound questions about the role of ecology and spirituality in contemporary society, while also providing the audience with a remarkably entertaining cinematic experience. Moreover, director Danny Boyle and screenwriter Simon Beaufoy effectively outline a compelling environmental ethic that suggests an intimate connection between the reflexive nature of social systems and the adaptability of ecological systems. In <italic>127 Hours</italic>, Ralston’s survival was the result of technical preparedness and ecological identity work. But what enabled Ralston’s ultimate deliverance? Was his the will to live? Was it a desire to reunite with family? Was it an engagement with his ecological self? I recommend you watch this film and ponder these questions yourself.</p>

<p>Ralston’s video diary can be considered a method of “humaning.” “Humaning” is the process where an individual uses linguistic methods and social rituals to retain human identity in periods of extended isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160597611433268">Maturana and Varela 1987</xref>).  </p>
