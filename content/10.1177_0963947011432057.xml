<p><italic>A linguist deaf to the poetic function of language and a literary scholar indifferent to linguistic problems and unconversant with linguistic methods are equally flagrant anachronisms</italic>.</p>
<attrib>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963947011432057">Jakobson 1960</xref>: 377)</attrib>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus runs Roman Jakobson’s axiomatic statement from the 1958 Indiana Conference on Style. Jakobson’s statement was enshrined in the publicity that accompanied the launch of <italic>Language and Literature</italic> in 1992 and since the advent of the journal it still remains one of the ‘touchstone’ epigraphs for modern stylistics. Uncontroversially, Jakobson’s aphoristic parallel places stylistics at the interface between linguistic and literary studies, suggesting that it is the literary-linguistic method which best (and alone?) captures the nuanced subtlety of textual composition. Jakobson’s use of metaphor self-reflexively draws from the domain of language and communication and is couched in the frame of linguistic disorders. On the one hand, there is the hearing-impaired linguist, insensitive to the sophistication of poetic composition; on the other, the reticent literary critic, unable to converse with the linguistic method in all its rigour and explanatory potential. With all communicative faculties intact, the stylistician, hearing the ‘poetic function’ while simultaneously able to interact with ‘linguistic methods’, emerges to occupy the central space between the two disciplines. Quite what that central space has now become, and how, if at all, Jakobson’s core tenets have been transformed in current stylistic research, is the subject of the informal observations that follow.</p>

<title>Plus ça change …</title>
<p>I have enjoyed a long – I hesitate to say ‘career-length’ – association with <italic>Language and Literature</italic>. I was fortunate to have an article published in the first issue of the journal in 1992, and then, four years later, to become Assistant Editor at the onset of the journal’s fifth volume. In 2004, I was honoured to be appointed Editor, overseeing volumes 13 through to 18, followed in 2010 by a move into the altogether more tranquil hinterland that is the journal’s editorial board. Suffice it to say, it is hard not to feel a close personal relationship with this publication, although it is possible also to reflect more dispassionately on the longitudinal developments and changes that have taken place over the years.</p>
<p>One of the main external pressures during my tenureship as Editor was to do with the increasing demands put upon this, and many other journals, to acquire the strongest possible status in terms of recognised citation indices. The significance of the formal measurement of a journal’s impact also tended to resonate through the PALA membership. For instance, in the years leading up to this period, when discussing the journal with colleagues from around the world, I discovered that for many, while <italic>Language and Literature</italic> was the ‘go to’ research resource, the same journal was not a targeted outlet for publication. Alarmingly, in some quarters, the journal had been decreed ‘off limits’ by this or that faculty dean or pro-vice chancellor because it did not sit in one their cherished citation indices. An absurdity maybe, but a situation which, if it were to compromise submission rates, nonetheless needed to be addressed as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p>The point of the foregoing is not to sound self-serving: readers may refer to the journal’s home page for information on the current indexing status of <italic>Language and Literature</italic>. But what the application process (to one key indexing body in particular) did require was a trawl through all previous volumes of the journal, cross-checking each published article against the institutional location of its author(s), monitoring subscription levels over the years and assessing changes in overall publishing standards, in both the print and electronic forms of the journal. The process also required a more detailed examination of all submissions for a period of two years prior to the time of the application (2006–2007), with a breakdown of subject area and coverage, an inventory of the number of articles published set against the number rejected, and a record of the number of different countries, by authors’ academic institution, other than the UK, that featured in the published articles in the journal.</p>
<p>The required paper trail commenced in 2008, but along the way it offered up a valuable corollary in terms of the fascinating information that it gave about what we were all doing, and how and where we were doing it. What for me started as a mechanical number-crunching exercise soon began to unveil a tableau of the contemporary state of stylistics. Consider for instance <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0963947011432057">Figure 1</xref>, which tracks, according to stylistic theme, all of the publications in the journal between 2006 and 2007.</p>

</fig>
<p>First of all, there were three special issues in this period, signalled by ‘SI’ in the legend. These were Mick Short’s issue on pedagogical stylistics (15(3)), which describes and evaluates a web-based undergraduate course on language and style; Willie van Peer’s issue on foregrounding (16(2)), which comprises a selection of articles investigating the empirical basis of the theory; and Barbara Dancygier’s issue on blending (15(1)), which explores the intersections between stylistics and conceptual integration theory. With respect to individual submissions, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0963947011432057">Figure 1</xref> (although in no way intended as an exhaustive or statistically significant survey) throws up a very diverse range of research areas, though all of these, like the topics of the special issues, are still readily subsumed under a broadly conceived literary-linguistic remit. Of course, interdisciplinarity is in the very nature of stylistic analysis, whose linguistic dimension also works from the assumption that levels of language organisation are not discrete but are interdependent and mutually reinforcing. Nonetheless, it is still possible to delineate in broad strokes the main thrust or orientation of each individual submission, and to identify, if relevant, which particular level of language organisation (say grammar or metrical structure) is the principal focus of attention. Unsurprisingly, interest in aspects of narrative organisation remains at the fore, with a continued and particular focus on the modes of speech and thought representation in fiction. The use of corpora in and for stylistic analysis, and the use of stylistic methods in translation studies, also remain core areas of interest. And of course, given that this snapshot was taken in the wake of the so-called ‘cognitive turn’ in stylistics, it is no surprise that a number of the articles, alongside those in Barbara Dancygier’s special issue, address a range of cognitive stylistic themes.</p>
<p>Noticeably, two articles from the period (one on the rhetoric of advertising headlines and the other on the language of blues song lyrics) might be better brought under the umbrella of critical linguistics (or critical discourse analysis) insofar as methods familiar to stylistic analysis are brought to bear on ‘non-literary’ discourse. Both disciplines, stylistics and critical linguistics, have enjoyed a long and continuing tradition of intersection in this journal, even if the debate has at times been eye-watering in its vigour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963947011432057">Fairclough, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963947011432057">Widdowson, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963947011432057">1996</xref>). The analytic frameworks of linguistics, after all, serve both, while much of the work in the two areas is informed by ideas derived from critical, cultural and social theory. It is furthermore now a truism that ‘literary language’ (whatever that may be) should neither be separated analytically from other text-types, registers and genres, nor should it be examined in splendid isolation from the social and discursive practices that enshrine it. In a key programmatic article on the relationship between stylistics and critical discourse analysis, Michael Toolan acerbically notes that the relationship between the two disciplines is akin to that between apples and oranges: they are not rivals, they are just different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963947011432057">1997</xref>: 84). Moreover, Toolan quite rightly acknowledges the seminal contribution of Roger Fowler here, a scholar who, often within the space of a single chapter, was able to move with a discursive fluency between literary and non-literary discourse alike. In the early stages of the development of both disciplines, Fowler’s work was important in showing that, in the broader analysis of language and style, one form of discourse need not be sequestered off from another. Oranges are indeed not the only fruit.</p>
<p>There were also some surprises in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0963947011432057">Figure 1</xref>. The use of models from discourse analysis and linguistic pragmatics clearly continues to feature strongly in stylistic work that explores fictional dialogue in literature. Whereas one might have expected some waning of interest in this area in the wake of its fairly extensive coverage throughout the 1990s, the articles from this period reveal sustained attention to the stylistic properties of both dramatic and prose dialogue. Indeed, as a reflex of new research developments in pragmatics and discourse analysis, stylistics continues to offer fresh insights into the broader linguistic conformation of fictional dialogue: more recent representative articles from this journal, to cite just two, are Dan McIntyre’s productive multimodal analysis of discourse patterns in Ian McKellen’s <italic>Richard III</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963947011432057">McIntyre, 2008</xref>) and Alice Spitz’s use of current work in Conversation Analysis for her thorough examination of the central climactic scene of Ian McEwan’s <italic>Chesil Beach</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963947011432057">Spitz, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0963947011432057">Figure 1</xref> highlights one research area that often tends to slip under the radar. This is the intersection between sociolinguistics and stylistics, or more narrowly, the use in stylistic analysis of social, regional and ethnographic models of language variation. Whereas this venerable alliance seems not often to be articulated in surveys of the contemporary field of literary-linguistics, in the period discussed here, the journal published (to name just three such studies) an exploration of the relationship between language standardisation and creative writing, an account of the sexual politics of the personal pronoun in the 18th century, and an analysis of the grammatical markers of in-group identity in the television series <italic>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</italic>.</p>
<p>Whereas <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0963947011432057">Figure 1</xref> is, of course, no more than a snapshot of two volumes from the middle of the ‘noughties’, it nonetheless, and intriguingly, mirrors the patterns both in the early days of the journal as well as in more recent volumes. That first year of <italic>Language and Literature</italic>, 1992, saw the publication of two issues only, yet the coverage of this short first volume was clearly an index of the range of interest that would follow: those early articles comprised an analysis of drama dialogue; a workshop programme in pedagogical stylistics; a survey of regional dialect in fiction; a proposed poetics of science fiction; a corpus-style investigation into speech representation in British parliamentary reports; and a theoretical overview of deictic constructs in poetry.</p>
<p>And to the present day. Any impression that there has been a wholesale shift in focus in the intervening 20 years can be safely set aside because the articles in this anniversary issue, if drawing on significantly more sophisticated methods of analysis, nonetheless cover territory familiar to that of the journal’s first outing in 1992. Mick Short develops further his own seminal contribution to our understanding of speech and thought presentation, using corpus annotation tools and incorporating into the model other key forms of reported discourse. Joanna Gavins and Peter Stockwell sustain the contemporary cognitive poetic thrust of much modern stylistic work in their analysis of Simon Armitage’s poem, but without losing sight, crucially, of the central relevance of the text’s linguistic fabric. The fast-developing field of corpus linguistics underpins Michaela Mahlberg’s study of patterns in prose and is an excellent demonstration of the particular efficacy of the corpus stylistic technique in dealing with long and complex works of fiction. Emma Moore’s account of language variation among groups of schoolchildren not only reflects the perennial affinity with sociolinguistics touched upon earlier but also demonstrates that style, in the sense pinpointed by Ronald Carter in his Coda to this issue, can be as much a performative interactive practice as a frequency of textual patterning.</p>
<p>Looking back over the decades, it has indeed been a curious feature of stylistics that it has the capacity at once to remain interested in the same things while moving steadily forwards as new developments come on stream across the platform of influences, models and constructs that are available to its practitioners. Furthermore, the very catholicism of its analytic methods runs counter to any assumption that one model alone will answer all questions concerning the idea of ‘style’. Nor do the central precepts of stylistics become outmoded as the field develops: the path of contemporary stylistics is not littered with jettisoned models of analysis that, once past their sell-by date, have been replaced by whatever vogue-ish new-look theory happens to grace that season’s academic catalogue. That said, we need to heed Carter’s warnings in his Coda about the complacency that a kind of stylistic ‘family love-in’ might engender. The exploration of reading practices, as he rightly points out, remains a key challenge for contemporary stylistic research, although Swann and Allington’s special issue on reading as social practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963947011432057">2009</xref>) makes for, in my opinion, a significant first step on this journey. Whatever the precise nature of the challenges that face it, the cornerstone of the stylistic method is its facility for interrogating texts in genuinely new and insightful ways, and in ways not otherwise accommodated by a non-stylistic approach. And the test of a good stylistic analysis remains ever simple: it should either tell us something we didn’t know about a literary work we have read, or it should make us want to read one we haven’t.</p>
