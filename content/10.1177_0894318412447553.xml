            <p>The concept of altruism has been viewed or defined as a professional value of the nursing discipline. The author in this column begins a discussion of its philosophical origins as a normative bioethical concept with implications for the term’s current usage in practice and teaching-learning contexts. Alternative views, potential definitions, and meanings from a nursing theoretical perspective are explored.</p>

      <p>The term or concept of <italic>altruism</italic> has been popularized in professional nurse literature and in higher educational position statements as an outcome requirement for national baccalaureate and graduate program accreditation. It is viewed as an important professional value that students and members of the profession <italic>ought</italic> to exhibit as a characteristic of ethical behavior in professional nurse practice. What are the origins of the concept? From its empirical philosophical underpinnings, is the use of the term consistent with the goals of the discipline? Do the normative underpinnings of the term focus on a biomedical view of humans differently than from human science ontology where embedded ethical concepts guide the straight thinking practice of nurses? What are some possible alternative nurse paradigmatic views or concepts languaged from a nursing theoretical perspective that may be considered guides for what it means to practice with altruism in the discipline?</p>
      <sec id="section1-0894318412447553">
         <title>Altruism and Biomedical Ethics</title>
         <p>The etymology of the term <italic>altruism</italic> originates from the Latin and French languages and refers to the principle or practice of unselfish concern and devotion to the welfare of others. In the professional literature of nursing, <italic>altruism</italic> is viewed as a professional value. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894318412447553">American Association of Colleges of Nursing (2008)</xref> has defined the term as a concern for the well-being of others, including concern for clients, other nurses, and other healthcare providers. In the United States, baccalaureate and master’s degree educational programs of nursing in colleges and universities who desire national nursing accreditation, must demonstrate to the accrediting organization that the concept or principle of <italic>altruism</italic> as a professional behavior is a mandatory component of the curriculum structure. Position papers of the organization offer sample professional behaviors that are indicators of what are believed to be actions of <italic>altruism</italic>. As suggested in the document, students and graduates of these programs may demonstrate the performance of <italic>altruism</italic> through behavioral understanding of cultures, beliefs, and the perspectives of others, service as advocates for the clients, particularly the most vulnerable, taking risks on behalf of clients and colleagues, and mentoring other professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894318412447553">American Association of Colleges of Nursing, 2008</xref>).</p>
         <p>What does it mean to act with <italic>altruism</italic> and have concern for others? Within the normative paradigm, there is an implication that having concern for another implies a judgment of one’s professional values and whether or not <italic>a correction</italic> is needed in another’s life in order to promote the welfare of others. From this perspective, promoting the good implies that the nurse as a healthcare professional is expert and has special knowledge that is needed for the eradication of disease, an improvement of condition, a return to a previous state, or the maintenance of what is labeled as health. Risks are expected to be taken for what is deemed good for someone else from the nurse’s biomedical perspective. Historically, what has been deemed as promoting health and having concern for others typically involves medical interventions designed from a biomedical approach for the eradication of disease.</p>
         <p>With the focus on the empirical diagnosis of diseases and pathophysiological disease processes, the term health has been equated with biological functioning. Within this normative and positivistic paradigm with its focus on biological evidence for practice, the promotion of and maintenance of humans as biological, psychological, socio-cultural organisms with parts is emphasized. Evidence-based practice and the promotion of human well-being are equated with deviations from statistical normalcy, and professional nurse practice as scientific investigation within a macro-micro systems approach is emphasized and valued. Profile patterns of needs for populations and communities are handled as mass customization of healthcare services where cost containment processes and minimal safety initiatives are the priorities for professional healthcare education including the teaching-learning practices for professional nurse education. The emerging value priorities for what it means to be a nurse in professional practice for generations of nurses to come will be equated with this mechanistic, biomedical model. Current professional nurse education reflects this philosophy.</p>
         <p>From a biomedical view, <italic>altruism</italic> is exhibited when the professional nurse offers specialized knowledge for the welfare of those who have been labeled with or have potential for a medical diagnosis or disease process where some treatment or medical therapeutic intervention is indicated as necessary and an empirical evaluation of the treatment for effectiveness is required. Devotion to the welfare of those geographic communities and serving populations of people deemed as being constituents of certain vulnerable demographic groups is viewed as <italic>altruistic behavior</italic>. While serving and offering expertise for the benefit of others, the concept of altruism and the acceptance of others’ authenticity often collide.</p>

         <title>Altruism and Conflicts Surrounding Authenticity in Biomedical Ethics</title>
         <p>Those who write about <italic>altruism</italic> as devotion to the welfare of others in biomedical ethics often articulate issues surrounding questions of a person’s <italic>authenticity</italic> in describing their personal health experience. Within this philosophical realm and thinking, questions arise over whether a person’s experience of health is authentic, that is, parts of their real selves, or inauthentic, as parts of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447553">Giodano, 2011</xref>). Thus, consistent with this thinking, devotion to others may be determined by the answer to the question of whether or not the expert practitioner deems the person’s experience as being authentic or inauthentic. When there are judgments surrounding whether a person has authenticity, what it means to act for the good and welfare of others with <italic>altruism</italic> is blurred and potentially harmful.</p>
         <p>A research study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894318412447553">Hope, Tan, Stewart, and Fitzpatrick (2011)</xref> described the experiences of persons medically diagnosed with anorexia nervosa who illustrated their experiences as being specific actions, choices, and emotions that were separate from themselves and part of the disease. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447553">Giodano (2011)</xref> expressed concern with the biomedical implications of outlining the problem surrounding judging whether the experience of growing ever thinner is authentic or whether the experience of growing ever thinner is inauthentic; that is, not a part of the person, but a part of the disease process of anorexia nervosa. One need only to observe current healthcare practices with nurses and other healthcare professionals in acute institutional healthcare settings where questions routinely arise and judgments are leveled for whether or not persons who state they have discomfort are really uncomfortable or seeking help for other reasons as part of a disease trajectory. In this paradigm, devotion for the welfare of others is contextually equated with the special, expert knowledge of the practitioner over and above the words of those who are living the experience.</p>
         <p>The author ponders that the assumptions of this traditional public health and systems-oriented model of devotion to humanity may be inconsistent with the philosophical theoretical underpinnings that views nursing as a human science, the practice of which is a performing art. Alternatively, notions or concepts surrounding what it means to practice with devotion to others are defined differently from a humanbecoming ontological perspective or school of thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318412447553">Parse, 2010</xref>). Other nurse language concepts may be articulated to demonstrate devotion and concern for humankind and the ways nurse professionals view those who receive their professional nurse services. The author believes that other nurse discipline-specific theoretical perspectives and paradigmatic views should also be included in global educational and practice position statements as guides and indicators for the professional education and ethical straight-thinking practices of the novice nurse.</p>

         <title>Honoring Human Dignity and Altruism</title>
         <p>From a human science perspective, the relentless quest for empirical evidence does not honor humankind, but instead may appear to be self-serving as nurse professionals view themselves and their practice as information-giving for those who lack knowledge, lack authenticity, do not understand what they need or want, and are deemed as vulnerable populations who require experts who provide safety and protection.</p>
         <p>From a humanbecoming ethical perspective, to act for the welfare of others is embedded in the ontology of the humanuniverse paradigm through its assumptions, postulates, and principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318412447553">Parse, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894318412447553">2012</xref>). Concept inventing may be used as a technique to define and discuss ethical concepts with language consistent with the humanbecoming school of thought. Discipline-specific theoretical articulation of concepts is of vital importance for expanding knowledge of humanly lived experiences as phenomena of interest. As a member of the discipline, there ought to be a responsibility to articulate concern for others by honoring human dignity.</p>
         <p>Human dignity is a chosen virtue that is shown with respectful confirming-not confirming the genuine unfolding of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318412447553">Parse, 2010</xref>). In this view, there is no question of a person’s authenticity since persons are not defined by a disease process or a part of biological functioning. The concern for others is illuminated as the professional nurse chooses bearing witness-not bearing witness with persons’ chosen ways of being and patterns of relating. It is experiencing the familiar-unfamiliar with unfolding valued health patterning. The experience of living health and quality of life is unknown except to the person-community living it. The professional nurse is a stranger traversing with paths of unbounded possibilities and realms of understanding. It is with the mystery of being human that the nurse experiences the awe or unexplainable of human existence. Professional nurse practice is not reduced to the particulate, the pre-defined measures of medical prevention of disease, health promotion, and maintenance. Having concern for the welfare of others is not lived with the desire to label and correct what is deemed to be wrong, to reinforce what is deemed to be correct, or to create a pathway of wellness for someone else.</p>
         <p>Instead, the author views altruism as a personal, chosen commitment of human reverence. It is honoring human dignity without condition and incarnated with devotion as the unfolding priorities of others’ health and quality of life are humanly lived in community. It is this personal commitment of reverence with the unbounded experience of being human that the professional nurse is ever-transforming as a member of a healthcare discipline dedicated to the service of humankind.</p>
         <p>Consistent with the humanbecoming ethical views of honoring human dignity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318412447553">Parse, 2010</xref>), there are some implications for teaching-learning processes and notions surrounding the concept of altruism from this perspective that offer unique definitions and guidance for professional nurse practice. First, the author challenges professional nurse educators to consider nursing theoretical frameworks as guides for nurse practice, research, and education. Solely incorporating borrowed theories and positivistic philosophies centered on the understanding of normative, empirical knowledge as the basis for practice is inconsistent with the goals and purposes of a human science discipline. Honoring human dignity and the ethical tenets of humanbecoming could be centerpieces of a human science baccalaureate and master’s nurse education curriculum. Students would study the assumptions regarding the nature of human beings, humanuniverse existence, health, and nursing. The humanbecoming ontology would serve as the guiding pillars for the teaching-learning curriculum structure.</p>
         <p>Honoring human dignity with reverence is not an option or a demonstrated behavioral example of altruism. It is a personal commitment to an ontological philosophy of professional nurse practice incarnated with reverence and awe for what it means to be human. This chosen way of being may be known through interwoven patterns of relating in nurse-person, nurse-family, nurse-group, and nurse-community relationships. A nurse’s chosen ways of being do not happen in isolation. They are a humanuniverse cocreation of living the freedom of choosing pattern preferences with the ever-present mystery of the unfathomable emerging now. How a nurse chooses to be with others in situation cannot be known or predicted by prescribed teaching-learning outcomes and methodologies designed for pre-determined system outcomes. For the author, hopes and desires abound that the scholars of the discipline will continue the work of curriculum development that will inspire conceptualizations of altruism as honoring human dignity.</p>
