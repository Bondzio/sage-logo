<abstract>
<p>Monetary incentives are the most effective way of increasing response to postal questionnaires; however, mailing currency is prohibited in many countries. Hence, nonmonetary incentives, such as lottery scratch tickets and donation offers, have been used. The effectiveness of different types of nonmonetary incentives is unclear, however. Two randomized controlled studies and meta-analyses were conducted to investigate the effect of two types of nonmonetary incentives on response. In the first study, the authors found that participants who received an unconditional lottery scratch ticket at invitation were 24% more likely to take part, while in the second study, the authors found that unconditional lottery scratch tickets and donation offers had a similar effect on response. The meta-analyses show that unconditional lottery scratch tickets significantly increase the chance of response by 9%, conditional scratch tickets have no effect, and donation offers cause a nonsignificant 4% increase in the chance of response. Unconditional lottery scratch tickets provide a modest increase in the likelihood of response.</p>

<p>Unconditional monetary incentives have been found to be the most effective way of increasing response fractions to postal questionnaires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1525822X11424549">Edwards et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1525822X11424549">Edwards et al. 2009</xref>). Sending currency in the regular mail is prohibited in Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1525822X11424549">Australia Post 2009</xref>) and many other countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1525822X11424549">Royal Mail Group 2010</xref>); however, nonmonetary incentives, such as lottery scratch tickets and donation offers, have been used. A recent meta-analysis found that nonmonetary incentives increase the odds of response by 15% (95% confidence interval [CI]: [1.08, 1.22]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1525822X11424549">Edwards et al. 2009</xref>). However, as acknowledged by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1525822X11424549">Edwards et al. (2009)</xref>, there was substantial heterogeneity among the studies that investigated the effect of nonmonetary incentives, so it may not be appropriate to combine them. Combining these studies also makes it difficult to determine what specific kinds of nonmonetary incentives are effective.</p>
<p>The studies that have investigated the effect of lottery scratch tickets on response have generally had null findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1525822X11424549">Finsen and Storeheier 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1525822X11424549">Harris, Khoo, et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1525822X11424549">Kalantar and Talley 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1525822X11424549">Koloski et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1525822X11424549">Ward et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1525822X11424549">Wenemark et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1525822X11424549">Whiteman et al. 2003</xref>), with only one study showing a significant increase in the likelihood of response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1525822X11424549">Robertson et al. 2005</xref>). Several studies have shown a borderline, but nonsignificant, increase in response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1525822X11424549">Brennan et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1525822X11424549">Kalantar and Talley 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1525822X11424549">Ward et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1525822X11424549">Whiteman et al. 2003</xref>), which suggests that they may have had insufficient power to detect a significant difference. The published research about the effect of donation offers on response has shown mixed results, with some studies showing no effect or a decrease in response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1525822X11424549">Gattellari and Ward 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1525822X11424549">Gendall and Healey 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1525822X11424549">Hubbard and Little 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1525822X11424549">Skinner et al. 1984</xref>), and others showing an increase in response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1525822X11424549">Brennan et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1525822X11424549">Deehan et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1525822X11424549">Faria and Dickinson 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1525822X11424549">Furse and Stewart 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1525822X11424549">Gendall and Healey 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1525822X11424549">Robertson and Bellenger 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1525822X11424549">Warriner and Goyder 1996</xref>). Overall, there is limited research concerning the effectiveness of lottery scratch tickets and donation offers.</p>
<p>We conducted two studies to investigate the effect of different types of nonmonetary incentives on response fraction in the Western Australian Bowel Health Study (WABOHS), a case–control study of the genetic and environmental causes of colorectal cancer. The aims of the first study were to determine whether (1) lottery scratch tickets given at the time of invitation increase response fraction and (2) lottery scratch tickets given at the same times as the study instruments increase the likelihood that participants will complete and return them.</p>
<p>For the second study, we modified the incentive to be one of three: a lottery scratch ticket, a donation to The Cancer Council Western Australia, and a lottery scratch ticket plus a donation. We wanted to compare these incentives as it was hypothesized that a donation to a cancer organization might be more acceptable than a lottery ticket that could be perceived as having an association with gambling. We also wanted to determine whether the combination of a personal incentive (a lottery scratch ticket) and an altruistic incentive (a charitable donation) increased response more than either of these incentives alone. So, the aim of the second study was to (3) investigate if a donation offer, or both a donation offer and a lottery scratch ticket, increased response fraction more than a lottery scratch ticket alone.</p>
<p>We also performed a meta-analysis to determine whether lottery scratch tickets or donation offers increase response to postal questionnaires.</p>
<sec id="section1-1525822X11424549">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The two studies were part of a larger study, the WABOHS, the methodology of which has been described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1525822X11424549">Iacopetta et al. 2009</xref>). The WABOHS was a case–control study of colorectal cancer that took place between 2005 and 2007 in Western Australia. Cases studied involved individuals with colorectal cancer who were notified to the Western Australian Cancer Registry. Age- and sex-matched controls were selected randomly from the electoral roll of Western Australia. Registration on the electoral roll is compulsory in Australia, and it is considered virtually complete. Fifty-eight percent of eligible cases and 46% of eligible controls participated in the WABOHS.</p>
<p>Ethics approval for both substudies was obtained from the University of Western Australia Human Research Ethics Committee and the Confidentiality of Health Information Committee within the Western Australian Department of Health.</p>
<sec id="section2-1525822X11424549">
<title>Study 1</title>
<p>In February 2007, 308 controls (aged between 40 and 79) were randomly selected from the electoral roll and invited to participate in the WABOHS. The participants received an invitation letter, an information sheet about the study, a consent form, and a reply-paid envelope. Using block randomization, the controls were allocated into one of two groups at the time of invitation—Group B received a $2 lottery scratch ticket with their invitation; Group A did not. Nonresponders were sent a reminder letter 3 weeks after the initial invitation.</p>
<p>Participants who consented to take part in the WABOHS were then sent a study pack that consisted of two questionnaires and a DNA self-extraction kit. These participants were randomized further into three groups when sent their study packs, ignoring their initial allocation to Group A or B (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1525822X11424549">Figure 1</xref>
). Group 0 did not get a lottery scratch ticket, Group 1 received a $2 lottery scratch ticket, and Group 2 was promised a $2 lottery scratch ticket on return of their completed study pack. Nonresponders in all three groups were sent a reminder card after 3 weeks and a replacement study pack after 5 weeks. The consent forms of seven consenting participants were received several months after the first study had concluded—these participants were included in the overall consent and response fractions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1525822X11424549">Table 1</xref>
) but were not included in the second part of the study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1525822X11424549">Table 2</xref>

<title>Study 2</title>
<p>In June 2007, an additional 300 controls (aged between 40 and 79) were randomly selected from the electoral roll and invited to participate in the WABOHS. In this study, the participants were allocated (using block randomization) into one of the three groups at the time of invitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1525822X11424549">Figure 2</xref>
). Group X received a $2 lottery scratch ticket with their invitation, Group Y were told that $2 would be donated to The Cancer Council Western Australia if they returned their consent form (regardless of whether or not they agreed to take part in the WABOHS), and Group Z received both a $2 lottery scratch ticket and the donation offer. Nonresponders in all three groups were sent a reminder letter 3 weeks after the initial invitation. Consenting participants were sent a study pack to complete but did not receive any incentives at the second stage. Participants who did not return their study pack were sent a reminder card after 3 weeks and a replacement study pack after 5 weeks.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Consent fractions, response fractions, and risk ratios were generated using the statistical package Stata 10.0 (StataCorp., College Station, TX). Consent fraction refers to the percentage of all eligible invited participants who indicated on their returned consent form that they were willing to take part in the study. Response fraction refers to the percentage of all eligible invited participants who returned a completed study pack. Risk ratios were generated using a modified Poisson regression approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1525822X11424549">Zou 2004</xref>). Effect modification by age, sex, or invitation incentive group (Study 1b) was examined using postestimation Wald’s chi-square tests.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1525822X11424549">
<title>Meta-Analyses</title>
<p>A systematic search of Medline, PsychInfo, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Embase, Institute for Scientific Information (ISI), Web of Knowledge, Proquest 5000, and Scopus (to June 2010) was conducted to identify studies that had investigated the effect of scratch lottery tickets or donation offers on response. Only studies that compared the use of lottery scratch tickets or donation offers with a no monetary or nonmonetary incentive control group were considered. Only studies that involved postal surveys/questionnaires were included; studies that investigated the effect of these incentives on response to web-based questionnaires or telephone surveys were not considered. Studies from any populations were considered, as long as they were published in English in a peer-reviewed journal.</p>
<p>The following search strategy was used for lottery scratch ticket articles:<list list-type="order">

</list>The lottery scratch ticket search resulted in a total of 78 articles. Of these, 57 were not considered as they were not related to response to questionnaires. Of the remaining 21 articles, 13 were not included in the meta-analysis as they did not involve lottery scratch tickets or did not have a no-incentive control group. The donation offer search resulted in a total of 156 articles. Of these, 147 were not considered as they were not related to response to questionnaires. Of the remaining nine articles, two were not included in the meta-analysis as they did not involve donation offers or did not have a no-incentive control group. The recent Cochrane review concerning the use of incentives in mailed and online questionnaires was also searched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1525822X11424549">Edwards et al. 2009</xref>), resulting in one additional study for the lottery scratch ticket meta-analysis and two additional studies for the donation offer meta-analysis. A search of the reference lists of all the eligible articles did not find any additional studies. Three further studies were added to the donation offer meta-analysis during the review process of this article.</p>
<p>In total, 9 studies (including the present study) were included in the lottery scratch ticket meta-analysis, and 12 studies were included in the donation offer meta-analysis.

<p>If a study had more than one incentive group level, these levels were combined to produce a dichotomous result (i.e., incentive groups vs. no-incentive groups). The outcome was the proportion of returned questionnaires after all mailings. As incentives given unconditionally have been shown to have significantly greater effect on response than those given conditionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1525822X11424549">Edwards et al. 2009</xref>), studies that used conditional lottery scratch tickets were analyzed separately than those that used unconditional lottery scratch tickets.</p>

<p>Of the 308 controls invited in the first study, 4 were not contactable due to incorrect addresses. Group A (no incentive) had a mean age of 62.1 years (range = 40–79 years) and Group B (lottery scratch ticket) had a mean age of 62.5 years (range = 42–79 years). The proportion of females in each group was 38.4% and 37.9%, respectively. Of the eligible 304 controls, 181 (144 before the reminder letter and 37 after the reminder letter) consented to take part in the WABOHS (consent fraction = 59.5%), with 158 completing and returning their study pack (response fraction = 52.0%). The reminder letter increased the consent fraction from 47.4% to 59.5%.</p>
<p>Participants who received a lottery scratch ticket with their invitation (Group B) were 1.24 times (95% CI [1.00, 1.55]) more likely to take part in the study than participants who did not receive an incentive (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1525822X11424549">Table 1</xref>). Participants who received a lottery scratch ticket with their invitation were 1.31 times (95% CI [1.02, 1.66]) more likely to consent to take part in the study without needing a reminder than those who did not receive an incentive. There was no significant difference in consent fractions between the two groups following the reminder letter. There were no significant sex or age differences in terms of the effect of the incentive.</p>
<p>There were no significant differences in the likelihood of participants completing and returning their study pack between the three study pack incentive groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1525822X11424549">Table 2</xref>).

<p>Of the 300 controls invited in the second study, 4 were not contactable due to incorrect addresses. Group X (lottery scratch ticket only) had a mean age of 58.6 years (range = 40–79 years), Group Y (donation only) had a mean age of 59.7 years (range = 40–79 years), and Group Z (both incentives) had a mean age of 58.0 (range = 40–79 years). The proportion of females in each group was 38%, 44.4%, and 41.2%, respectively. Of the eligible 296 controls, 140 (108 before the reminder letter and 32 after the reminder letter) consented to take part in the WABOHS (consent fraction = 47.3%), with 126 completing and returning their study pack (response fraction = 42.6%). The reminder letter increased the consent fraction from 36.5% to 47.3%.</p>
<p>The highest response fraction was seen in Group Y (donation only); however, there were no significant differences in consent and response fractions between the three different incentive groups (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1525822X11424549">Table 3</xref>).

<p>A sensitivity analysis, in which each study was omitted from the meta-analysis one at a time, showed no notable impact of any study on the effect size.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of the first study and the meta-analysis suggest that lottery scratch tickets, when given unconditionally, provide a modest increase in response to mailed questionnaires. In the first study, participants who received a lottery scratch ticket with their invitation were 1.24 times more likely to take part in the study than participants who did not receive an incentive, although this increase just failed to reach statistical significance. The results of the meta-analysis show that, compared with a no-incentive control group, lottery scratch tickets given unconditionally increase the likelihood of a participant responding by 9%. The meta-analysis also suggests that lottery scratch tickets given conditionally do not appear to increase response, a finding that confirms incentives given unconditionally are more effective than those given conditionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1525822X11424549">Edwards et al. 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In our first study, lottery scratch tickets significantly increased the likelihood of participants consenting before the reminder letter. This finding is consistent with the results of other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1525822X11424549">Kalantar and Talley 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1525822X11424549">Robertson et al. 2005</xref>), suggesting that if researchers are not planning to follow up nonresponders, using a lottery scratch ticket may be an effective method to increase response. The increased response to the first mailing also reduces the costs and resources associated with the sending of reminders, which offsets the cost of the lottery scratch tickets to a certain extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1525822X11424549">Kalantar and Talley 1999</xref>). It is important to note, however, that follow-up contact has been shown to be a very effective method of increasing response fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1525822X11424549">Edwards et al. 2009</xref>), and the findings of this study—in which a reminder letter increased the response fraction from 47.4% to 59.5% in the first study and from 36.5% to 47.3% in the second study—support this.</p>
<p>The results of the first study also indicate that giving or promising a lottery scratch ticket with the study instruments does not significantly increase the likelihood that participants will complete and return them.</p>
<p>The results of the second study suggest that lottery scratch tickets and donation offers have a similar overall effect on consent and response fractions. This suggests that incentives that have an altruistic benefit (i.e., donation offers) have a similar effect to incentives that may lead to personal benefit (i.e., lottery scratch tickets). However, in the meta-analyses, we found that lottery scratch tickets may have a greater effect on response than donation offers. Lottery scratch tickets given unconditionally increase the likelihood of response by 9%, while donation offers increase the chance of response by 4%. The 4% increase was not statistically significant, and there was significant heterogeneity among the studies that have investigated the effect of donation offers on response, so the effect of donation offers on response remains unclear.</p>
<p>The fact that the two studies were both done within a larger study (the WABOHS) led to some limitations. The number of participants in both the first and the second studies, particularly in the final three groups in the first study, limited our ability to draw conclusions; however, the total sample size was constrained by the number of participants invited to take part in the WABOHS at that time. A no-incentive control group in the second study may have made the effect of different types of nonmonetary incentives more clear. The generalizability of the results of the two studies may be limited, as both were conducted with quite homogeneous samples in a health research setting. Likewise, all the studies in the lottery scratch tickets meta-analysis were conducted within a health or social research setting, so the results may not be generalizable to other research settings (e.g., market research).</p>
<p>Despite using several techniques that have been shown to increase response fraction—including personalized invitation letters, university sponsorship, supplying a reply-paid envelope, reminder letters, promising to supply the results of the study, and using a nonmonetary incentive, and reminders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1525822X11424549">Edwards et al. 2009</xref>)—the final response fraction among controls in the entire WABOHS was a modest 46%. Given that the nonmonetary incentives used in this study appear to result in only a small increase in the likelihood of response, it is important that the effect of other types of incentives on response is investigated. With response fractions in epidemiological studies declining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1525822X11424549">Morton et al. 2006</xref>), and considering that even small amounts of nonresponse bias can lead to inflation or attenuation of the true effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1525822X11424549">Harris, Levy, et al. 2008</xref>), increasing response is an important issue.</p>
