<p>In several trials,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078155212442560">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155212442560">2</xref></sup> bendamustine (TREANDA®) has demonstrated clinical activity in patients with relapsed rituximab-refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, including those refractory to other alkylating agents. Although bendamustine is infused at a dose of 120 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously over 60 min on days 1 and 2 every 3 weeks in both Japan and United States, it has been reported that there is a difference in the vascular pain between Japan trial and US trial. In the US trial, there were no reports of vascular pain,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078155212442560">1</xref></sup> meanwhile in the Japanese trial, no grade 2/3/4 vascular pain was observed, but grade1 vascular pain was noted in 29% over the course of the study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155212442560">2</xref></sup> However, according to the local side-effects in recent postmarketing reports,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078155212442560">3</xref></sup> the effects including infusion site pain (6%), catheter site pain (5%), extravasations, phlebitis, pruritus, irritation, pain and swelling have been reported. Therefore, it was suggested that precautions should be taken to avoid extravasation, including monitoring of the intravenous infusion site for redness, swelling, pain, infection, and necrosis both during and after the administration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078155212442560">3</xref></sup> According to the prescribing information from Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency in Japan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078155212442560">4</xref></sup> and Food and Drug Administration in United States,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078155212442560">5</xref></sup> the major difference of bendamustine administration process between Japan and United States is the volume of saline that dissolves bendamustine, because it is dissolved in saline 250 mL in Japan, and in saline 500 mL in United States. Therefore, there is a possibility that this major difference may be important to lead to the patients’ vascular pain.</p>
<p>We have treated three patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma, who were administered bendamustine and experienced vascular pains after the administration of the drug. Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.0) grade 3 vascular pain was noted in these three patients. These grade 3 vascular pains persisted for 7 days, and thereafter were relieved gradually. Bendamustine was not administered via peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) nor portacath, but given peripherally. When administering bendamustine of 120 mg/m<sup>2</sup> in 250 mL saline in Japanese patients, the half-life period of the drug is 0.47 ± 0.05 h, it was reported that the drug disappeared over about 5 h in the blood vessels after the administration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078155212442560">4</xref></sup> Therefore, bendamustine may directly injure the vessels within 5 h after the administration. Bendamustine, which was dissolved in saline 250 mL, was administered simultaneously to one patient in combination with saline 250 mL in order to relieve the vascular pain at day 1 with the patient’s informed consent (i.e., in this patient, we administered bendamustine in 500 mL saline in the passage). In this patient, although the vascular pain was improved from grade 3 to grade 2 by the administration of saline, the pain persisted until the next day.</p>
<p>Next, bendamustine, which was dissolved in saline 250 mL, and 5% glucose solution 250 mL were administered simultaneously to this patient at day 2 with the patient’s informed consent, immediately after the mixture of these in the venous catheter. It has been reported that bendamustine is hydrolyzed in 5% glucose solution at about 3 h after it is dissolved (Eisai Co., Ltd (Tokyo, Japan), personal communication). Therefore, bendamustine which is dissolved in 5% glucose solution still appears stable, when it is administered. In Japan and United States prescribing information of bendamustine,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078155212442560">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078155212442560">5</xref></sup> it is written that the drug for single-use vial contains bendamustine HCl as lyophilized powder, and should be dissolved only in sterile water with a bendamustine HCl concentration of 2.5 or 5 mg/mL, and should be immediately transferred into the infusion bag of 0.9% sodium chloride (normal saline). This process does not require 5% glucose solution. However, to decrease the administered bendamustine concentration in the patients more effectively, we have proposed the method that bendamustine, which is dissolved in saline 250 mL, and 5% glucose solution 250 mL are administered simultaneously to the patient. By the method, the pain was improved from grade 3 to grade 1. Similarly, by the administration of 5% glucose solution, the vascular pain was improved from grade 3 to grade 1 in other two patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1078155212442560">Table 1</xref>). However, the vascular pain was increased from grade 1 to grade 2 or 3 in one patient, but the vascular pains of other two patients persisted into the same grade (grade 1). Moreover, in these three patients who were administered bendamustine, there was no extravasation or necrosis with each bendamustine infusion.

<p>Vascular pain by injectable drugs was suggested to be due to pH, osmotic pressure, temperature, drip velocity and so on.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078155212442560">6</xref></sup> In this report, the number of cases is considerably small, therefore, further investigation may be needed to clarify the mechanism. However, this is the first report describing that the coadministration of 5% glucose solution may have a decrease in bendamustine-related vascular pain. Further investigations are needed to conduct the randomized study to compare the frequency and degree of vascular pain between the two arms: bendamustine in normal saline versus bendamustine in 2.5% glucose and 0.45% sodium chloride injection preparation.</p>
