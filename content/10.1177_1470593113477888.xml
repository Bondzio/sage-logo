These questions represent common concerns for new fields as they break away from the parent field. Academic work in emerging fields most often includes pushing the boundaries of the more established field and confined disciplines; the new field accordingly offers potential for novel and innovative theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1470593113477888">MacInnis and Folkes, 2010</xref>) or what Kuhn terms a paradigm shift (1970a). However, academic life is characterized by loss of job security for those who step out of the conventional inquiries and methodologies. These intellectuals face critiques and doubts concerning the value of their research that can be particularly problematic for junior scholars competing for research funding or facing tenure and promotion decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470593113477888">Berry and Parasuraman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1470593113477888">Lyytinen and King, 2004</xref>).</p><p>The legitimacy of the new field is not only or primarily linked to the intellectual correctness of scientific knowledge but rather to sociopolitical factors (Kuhn, 1970a). The history of science studies have repeatedly demonstrated how the acceptance of theories depends upon a network of forces that are mostly political (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1470593113477888">Latour, 1993</xref>). In <italic>The Pasteurization of France</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1470593113477888">Latour (1993)</xref> suggests that pasteurism flourished in France because of an alliance between Pasteurians and hygienists and the colonial interests of the state. In the United States, logical empiricism took hold of marketing thought due to the cold war politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1470593113477888">Tadajewski, 2006</xref>). While sociopolitical factors influencing the legitimacy of new scientific knowledge are noteworthy, these studies leave real-politic strategies for new academic communities to diffuse and translate their ideas uncharted.</p><p>This article proposes a series of practices that aid the emergence and acceptance of a new academic field. Borrowing from Abbott’s (1988) theory of professionalism, I highlight two types of legitimacy: cultural and social. For a new academic field to emerge, like occupational groups such as doctors and lawyers, it needs to achieve power and claim jurisdiction or expertise. Performing skilled acts and justifying them cognitively is not enough to claim jurisdiction. In order to claim legitimate control of the problem that it has constituted and defended against other academic fields, the scientific community must create a social structure that guarantees its efficacy before crucial audiences: other academic communities, the public at large and the legal system or state. Through a meta-narrative analysis of consumer research studies on brand communities, subcultures and microcultures, I identify modes of practices that allow academic communities to break through the boundaries of cultural and social legitimacy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1470593113477888">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1-1470593113477888" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Market practices of legitimization.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1470593113477888-fig1.tif"/></fig><p>To illustrate the legitimacy of an emerging field of academic work, I use the case of Consumer Culture Theory (CCT)—a subfield in consumer research addressing the sociocultural, experiential, symbolic and ideological aspects of consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470593113477888">Arnould and Thompson, 2005</xref>). The emergence of the subfield of CCT in consumer behavior can be linked to the influential wave of postmodernism in the humanities and the social sciences as well as the backlash against information processing and multiattribute models in consumer behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1470593113477888">Sheth et al., 1988</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1470593113477888">Tadajewski, 2006</xref> for a discussion of motivation research as an embryonic form of CCT research). Postmodern writings and movement in social sciences caused reevaluation and reconceptualization of how consumers experienced and lived in the world. In marketing, these new ideas influenced the way scholars thought and wrote about consumption and goods. Sid Levy’s (1959) article “Symbols for Sale” was a cornerstone where he questioned the notion of the economic and rational man buying things for their functional use. However, it was not until the 80s consumer researchers began exploring issues such as rituals and symbolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1470593113477888">Rook, 1985</xref>), experiential and fantasy behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470593113477888">Belk et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1470593113477888">Holbrook and Hirschman, 1982</xref>), the symbolism of goods (Mick 1986) and cultural issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1470593113477888">McCracken, 1986</xref>) in consumer behavior. In the following 30 years, CCT researchers explored consumer identity projects, marketplace cultures, the sociohistoric patterning of consumption and mass-mediated marketplace ideologies and consumers’ interpretive strategies with the goal of broadening the scope of consumer research (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470593113477888">Arnould and Thompson, 2005</xref> for a review). The epistemological and ontological divergence from the main consumer behavior field required a coalesced effort to build a recognized and reputational scholar work (Abbott, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470593113477888">1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1470593113477888">Whitley, 1984</xref>). It is these efforts of CCT researchers that will be used as an illustrious context to explore practices of legitimacy.</p><sec id="section1-1470593113477888"><title>Legitimacy as a cultural and social process</title><p>While legitimacy has been most commonly studied from an institutional theory perspective and linked the acceptance of organizational activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1470593113477888">DiMaggio and Powell, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1470593113477888">Meyer and Scott, 1983</xref>), legitimacy dynamics incorporate a broad array of social behavior including the acceptance of brands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1470593113477888">Kates, 2004</xref>), business and consumption practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1470593113477888">Deighton and Grayson, 1995</xref>; Humphreys, 2010a, 2010b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470593113477888">Kozinets, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1470593113477888">Sandikci and Ger, 2010</xref>) as well as taste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470593113477888">Bourdieu, 1984</xref>), cultural practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470593113477888">Alexander, 2006</xref>) and professions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470593113477888">Abbott, 1988</xref>). Therefore, a broad definition of legitimacy is appropriate here:<disp-quote><p>Legitimacy is a generalized perception or assumption that the actions of an entity are desirable, proper, or appropriate within some socially constructed system of norms, values, beliefs and definitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1470593113477888">Suchman, 1995</xref>: 574).</p></disp-quote></p><p>This definition underlies the cultural (norms, values and beliefs) as well as the social (socially constructed) nature of legitimacy. Indeed, this nuanced distinction has been central to works of many social theorists. In his theory of professionalism, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470593113477888">Abbott (1988</xref>) suggests that for professions to gain legitimacy not only do they need to claim jurisdiction within an area of work but they also need to create the social structures that allow efficacy before social audiences. Like Abbott, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470593113477888">Alexander (2006</xref>) in his theory of social performance underlies the importance of audiences. Drawing from dramaturgical theory, Alexander examines the conditions when social performances are perceived as successful. He suggests that performances are successful only insofar as they can “re-fuse” increasingly disentangled elements in the eyes of the audiences. In a fused performance, audiences identify with actors, and cultural scripts achieve verisimilitude through effective mise-en-scène. According to Alexander, the cultural meanings and scripts that are being enacted by actors and more importantly the ways in which audiences interpret these performances are key to legitimacy of social action. In Bourdieu’s (1984) theory, legitimacy is linked to what he terms symbolic capital (things such as prestige, honor and the right to be listened to). The taste and practices of the dominant groups gain legitimacy through a process in which subordinate groups accept the superiority of these cultural norms and values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470593113477888">Bourdieu and Wacquant, 1992</xref>).</p><p>While Bourdieu and Alexander note the significance of conversion of cultural capital to symbolic capital, what is valuable in Abbott’s theoretical discussion and therefore fitting for the purposes of this article is his treatment of professions and their area of work. Abbott’s research on systems of profession explores how professions gain symbolic capital and gain admittance in their social network. Abbott maintains that claiming jurisdiction as control over the knowledge and skill within a particular area of work is linked to cultural as well as social articulations. Diagnosis, treatment, inference and academic work provide the cultural machinery of jurisdiction. First, the would-be professions must culturally constitute, that is, diagnose the area of work (e.g., weight must be turned into the disease of obesity). He then suggests that, “the professions must defend those constitutions against competing constitutions of them by other would-be professions. Indeed, it is by competing in this way—via the cultural reconstitution of human problems—that an occupation identifies itself as a profession” (Abbott, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470593113477888">2010</xref>: 175). A profession must create “treatments” to resolve the problem and also an “inference” system that links diagnosis and treatment. In diagnosis, the central issue is the restriction of relevant information. Very much like the blind researcher and elephant parable, diagnosis is a by-product of the professional’s background and the kind of knowledge and treatment that is possible. In treatment, the important properties are, “the measurability of results, the specificity of treatment, the acceptability of the treatment to clients and of course, efficacy itself” (Abbott, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470593113477888">1988</xref>: 58). The ability of a profession or applied science to sustain its jurisdiction lies partly in the power and prestige of its academic knowledge. Academic knowledge legitimizes professional work by clarifying its foundations and tracing them to major cultural values. Intellectual correctness is not enough to claim jurisdiction. In order to claim legitimate control of the area, the would-be profession must convince the audiences of the value of its work. While the cultural control is linked to the work and is legitimated by formal knowledge rooted in fundamental values, social control arises from active claims put forth in the public, legal and workplace areas.</p><p>Abbott’s theory of professionalism and jurisdiction provides a useful foundation accounting for the cultural and social processes on the road to legitimacy. Missing from his portrayal, and what I discuss in the rest of the article, is a consideration of how members of the emerging academic community strategically deal with the cultural and social barriers to legitimization. I examine the market practices of consumer subcultures studied by CCT scholars to offer some insights as to how new academic communities can legitimize their work and identities.</p></sec><sec id="section2-1470593113477888"><title>Market practices of legitimacy</title><p>A growing body of research in consumer research explores market practices of fan and brand communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470593113477888">Kozinets, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1470593113477888">Muñiz and Schau, 2005</xref>), gay consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1470593113477888">Kates, 2002</xref>), immigrant consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1470593113477888">Oswald, 1999</xref>; Peñaloza, 1994; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1470593113477888">Üstüner and Holt, 2007</xref>) and counterculture market practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1470593113477888">Humphreys, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1470593113477888">2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82a-1470593113477888">Thompson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1470593113477888">Thompson and Coskuner-Balli, 2007</xref>). This stream of work has produced valuable insights into consumers’ dealings with stigma, barriers to identity construction and the dynamics between mainstream marketplace and marginalized consumer identities. This work can shed light on legitimacy of academic fields in two ways: first, as the new academic community faces barriers to publication, promotion and tenure, the market practices of legitimization have the potential not only to create a reflexive awareness but also to suggest new possibilities for both individual and collective actions to push the boundaries of academic legitimacy. Second, while institutional theory has typically emphasized the sociohistoric conditioning and conventionalized norms for the legitimacy of organizations, consumer studies bring forth the agentic abilities of individual actors in subverting meanings, transgressing norms and structures through mobilization of market resources. While this agentic focus does not deny the social structures and institutionalized arrangements that are grounded in networks of power relations, it nonetheless explores the creative possibilities through which social actors individually and collectively challenge social norms. Through a meta-analysis of consumer studies, I identify four modes of practices that can help emerging academic communities claim cultural and social legitimacy: (1) mobilizing cultural myths, (2) code switching, (3) creating market resources and (4) community building.</p><sec id="section3-1470593113477888"><title>Mobilizing cultural myths</title><p>Myth is a popular belief embodying the ideals and institutions of a society or a segment of society. Myths permeate consumer culture and are important resources for the creation of compelling brand stories and the construction of individual and national identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1470593113477888">Holt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1470593113477888">Slotkin, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82a-1470593113477888">Thompson, 2004</xref>). Mobilizing cultural myths refers to groups rearticulating the meanings of their consumption practices or (for academicians their work) vis-à-vis the dominant cultural myths and practices.</p><p>Realizing the stigmatic status of being a Trekkie, Star Trek fans reconstitute their consumption as sacred “legitimizing their utopian-sacred qualities against incursions of profane, negative, and stigmatic associations.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470593113477888">Kozinets, 2001</xref>: 75). In various meetings and online forums, fans associate Star Trek with social categories for respect of diversity, the universality of alienation and the formation of a future utopian society of free justice.</p><p>Humphreys’ (2010a, 2010b) study of the legitimization of casino gambling shows a similar articulation of meanings of a once stigmatized practice. Her historic analysis of the semantic codes shows how gambling transformed from an activity aligned with filth and poverty to one associated with entertainment, excitement and wealth. Her study highlights the role of cultural elites (stakeholders, journalists, celebrities and managers) in the articulation of cultural meanings and legitimization processes. Thompson’s (2004) analysis of natural health microculture discusses similar articulation processes, consumers’ understandings of their health and bodies and advertisers’ role in mythic construction of nature, science and technology. In the natural health microculture, advertisers employ the archetypical Edenic myth to emphasize the binary oppositions between medical science and natural health. Thompson and Coskuner-Balli’s (2007) work on community supported agriculture (CSA) presents how farmers and consumers collectively construct this practice as a way of creating connections, decommodification and creating an artisan culture vis-à-vis the globalized and deterritorialized food system. In a related study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1470593113477888">Press and Arnould (2011</xref>) suggest that although CSAs so far have aligned with organic and local food narratives, they have a potential to build greater legitimacy if they can mobilize the more mainstream American myth of pastoralism and its relation to suburban lifestyle.</p><p>These studies demonstrate the mobilization strategies through which a consumption practice becomes less stigmatic (Star Trek) and more legitimate (casino gambling, natural health microculture and CSA). In the case of CCT, myths were employed to legitimize new areas as well as new methodologies of research concerning consumer behavior. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1470593113477888">Holbrook and Hirschman (1982</xref>) invoked a romantic mythos to carve out a contrasting space to the dominant (rationalist and information processing) paradigm. By emphasizing the hedonic and symbolic aspects of consumption, these researchers opened the doors to a rich and yet unexplored domain in consumer research. While study of the emotional as well as symbolic and political aspects of consumption grew, in the years to follow the institutionalization and legitimacy of the work faced challenges in the main field. The adoption of postmodern and poststructuralist theories to explore and understand consumers’ experiences raised concerns of subjectivity, relativity and deconstruction as opposed to the prevailing norms of conducting scientific research: objectivity, validity and prediction. The forerunners of CCT research indeed worked within a positivistic mind-set where the scholars implemented <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1470593113477888">Lincoln and Guba’s (1985)</xref> criteria for assessing the “trustworthiness” of qualitative research to legitimize their work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1470593113477888">Shankar and Patterson, 2001</xref>). The following stage of interpretive research was highly influenced by critical relativism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5a-1470593113477888">Anderson, 1986</xref>), hermeneutics (Arnold and Fischer, 1994), critical theory (Murray and Ozanne, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1470593113477888">1991</xref>) and existential phenomenology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1470593113477888">Thompson et al., 1989</xref>). Going back to Abbott’s discussion of professionalism, CCT was able to claim distinction from other fields of consumer research by area of study (symbolic, cultural political and ideological aspects of consumption), however, the close lineage with postmodernity raised broader cultural legitimacy barriers when it came to treatment and inference.</p><p>Over the years, the CCT community adopted discursive strategies to mobilize cultural myths. One was to brand the work offering a more appropriate definition for this research tradition. In 2005, Arnould and Thompson published an invited article in the <italic>Journal of Consumer Research</italic> (JCR). This work was important for the CCT community for two reasons. First, it defined the boundaries of CCT work by claiming jurisdiction over areas of social, political and ideological issues in consumer research. In their discussion, Arnould and Thompson noted the three enduring misconceptualizations of CCT research that (1) consumer culture theorists study particular contexts, (2) the difference between CCT research and other research traditions is methodological and CCT research employs only qualitative research methods and (3) CCT research has no managerial relevance. These three issues correspond to Abbott’s framework for jurisdiction and by demythologizing them Arnould and Thompson indeed correct the misunderstandings concerning diagnosis, inferences, treatment and academic knowledge produced by CCT researchers.</p><p>Second, while the early cautions concerning masculinist ideology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1470593113477888">Hirschman, 1993</xref>) and calls for consumer relevant research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470593113477888">Belk, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470593113477888">1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470593113477888">Holbrook, 1987</xref>) were misconstrued as a renunciation of managerial implications, recent CCT community discussions highlight the relevance to a broader audience group including consumers, marketers, policy makers and academic audiences both within and outside marketing. Along these lines two main research initiatives involve forming an alliance between Service-Dominant Logic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1470593113477888">Vargo and Lusch, 2004</xref>) and CCT to study the cocreation of value and engaging in transformative consumer research in order to work on policy-related consumer issues. The increasing industry demand for anthropologically oriented market research has been also noted as a venue for spreading CCT research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470593113477888">Arnould and Thompson, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, claims of understanding key concepts in marketing such as branding, brand communities, social media marketing, management and retailing are highlighted in order to increase the legitimacy of the subfield in the eyes of the marketing community.</p></sec><sec id="section4-1470593113477888"><title>Code switching</title><p>Code switching refers to being able to employ different habitus in diverse social fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470593113477888">Bourdieu, 1984</xref>). It requires not only high social, cultural and at times economical capital but also a reflexive awareness of the desired modes of conduct in different social settings. Oswald’s (1999) work on Haitian consumers presents a performative model of how immigrants in the United States form hybrid identities by changing their cultural practices depending on the social context. She suggests that immigrant consumers switch codes between Haitian and American cultures as the social situation requires. For example, in addition to being bilingual they would celebrate two birthday parties, one American and one Haitian, and cook American and Haitian dishes. Through their consumption practices, these immigrants hold onto their Haitian identity and also an appropriate American identity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1470593113477888">Peñaloza (1994</xref>) documents a similar strategy among Mexican-American consumers. Besides resisting (favoring Mexican practices over American practices) and assimilation (adopting American practices while deserting Mexican practices), the immigrants also acculturate through adopting American practices while maintaining Mexican practices. Awareness of cultural codes and shifting between two cultures are also noted among Greenlander immigrants in Denmark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470593113477888">Askegaard et al., 2005</xref>). While not as seamlessly as in the cases of Haitian immigrants, Greenlander consumers in Denmark engage in an ongoing conciliation between the Greenlandic, Danish and transnational consumer cultures. Negotiating between these three institutionalizing forces, Greenlander immigrants adopt different consumption practices. Some idealize cultural origin (Greenland) in the immigrant environment and consume commodified “Greenlandic” goods such as food and national costume as hyperemblems of authentic culture. Other segments oscillate between Greenlandic and Danish culture with existential ambivalence and some pick the best of both worlds intertwining what they view favorable in two cultures. These studies suggest that code switching and acculturation are important and viable strategies for minority groups to succeed in their identity performances and ultimately to create hybrid identities. However, code switching and creating hybrid identities are not without barriers. There are competing ideologies that need to be negotiated that can provoke identity anxieties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470593113477888">Askegaard et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, when consumers lack cultural, social and economical capital like in the case of immigrant Turkish women, swapping between cultures might not be possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1470593113477888">Üstüner and Holt, 2007</xref>).</p><p>For academic communities, code switching most directly translates to being able to shift one’s academic habitus enabling to mobilize different theoretical approaches around a concept or context of study and also to write for different audiences. To illustrate, CCT scholars document sociocultural aspects of a consumption phenomenon and discuss strategic implications of the same consumer phenomenon in different publication outlets. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1470593113477888">Thompson and Arsel (2004)</xref> explore the hegemonic influence Starbucks exerts on the local coffee shops in their article published in JCR and administer strategic advice on how to deal with doppelganger brand image in their work published in the <italic>Journal of Marketing</italic> (JM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1470593113477888">Thompson et al., 2006</xref>). Likewise, in a series of academic articles based on an ethnographic study of The American Girl Place, John <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1470593113477888">Sherry and his colleagues (2009</xref>) investigate the cultural meanings of what they term “allomothering” as well as discuss retail implications of theme retailing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470593113477888">Borghini et al., 2009</xref>) and explicate sociocultural branding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1470593113477888">Diamond et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The way code switching can aid academic communities to attain cultural legitimacy and broaden their scope of jurisdiction is threefold. First, this strategy can indeed prevent hyperprofessionalism (a narrow intellectual focus; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470593113477888">Burawoy, 2004</xref>). Burawoy maintains that hyperprofessionalism can indeed hurt a field by cutting it from its sources of inspiration. The development of various subfields of sociology—professional, academic, public and policy—is dependent on the development of all. Along the same lines, for academic communities to ascend communicating the value of their work for policy and public as well as managerial and academic world is vital.</p><p>Second, code switching has the potential to exhilarate the diffusion of new ideas and approaches that the subfield offers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1470593113477888">Whitley (1984</xref>: 12) points out that most academic research is created for other academicians and the recognized value of an intellectual innovation lies in the fact that it can be used in other people’s research: “the degree of novelty is then restricted by the need to follow collective standards and be relevant to the work of colleagues. The critical point is that research is valued to the extent that it affects, influences, and is essential for others’ work to be successfully accomplished.” For newly emerging academic groups, the adoption and diffusion of the novel work becomes increasingly difficult because of the marginal number of researchers who are likely to use and cite this research. However, code switching allows for both novel ways of engaging with extant research and increases possible communication with scholars working in related areas.</p><p>Third, code switching can help address incommensurability issues across paradigms. Addressing the notion of incommensurability, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1470593113477888">Tadajewski (2008</xref>) revisits Kuhn’s incommensurability thesis. Tadajewski highlights that Kuhn’s thesis relies on a semantic incommensurability rather than a methodological comparison between paradigms. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1470593113477888">Kuhn (1970b</xref>) asserts that scientists who are lexically bilingual and furthermore who understand the historical context in which the different knowledge systems are embedded in can address the problems of incommensurability. While Kuhn adds that only the most able scientists can do this, he nonetheless maintains that it is possible for a scientist to move back and forth from one paradigm to the other.</p></sec><sec id="section5-1470593113477888"><title>Creating market resources</title><p>When the mainstream marketplace fails to offer products to emerging or marginalized communities, these groups take on entrepreneurial roles and create their own market resources. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1470593113477888">Muñiz and Schau (2005</xref>) document how the Apple Newton brand community continued to create resources for the members after Apple discontinued the product in 1998. Feeling persecuted and misunderstood and yet remain loyal to a product that failed in the market, Newton users took on modifying, repairing as well as promoting the product. Creativity and entrepreneurship also underlie the farmer practices in CSAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1470593113477888">Thompson and Coskuner-Balli, 2007</xref>). In these countervailing market systems, farmers learn alternative farming technologies to grow organic food, to experiment with new crops and to make their own compost. For the emerging consumer segment of at-home fathers, entrepreneurial practices are key to legitimize their untraditional gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470593113477888">Coskuner-Balli and Thompson, 2013</xref>). These men, who have taken on the primary caregiver role in their families, take on initiatives to create masculine diaper bags and parenting resources for men that otherwise lack these alternatives in the maternally oriented marketplace.</p><p>For emerging academic communities, the sustainability and growth of the community are linked to the availability of resources. As such, these communities need to create and legitimate alternative publication outlets, conferences, organizations and educational tools. For CCT, the main outlets for publication have been JCR and JM. For cultural research in marketing, the <italic>Journal of Consumer Culture</italic> (established in 2001), <italic>Marketing Theory</italic> (established in 2001) and <italic>Consumption, Markets and Culture </italic>(established in 1997) are among the burgeoning outlets that value and publish cultural and critical work. There have been also discussions in various conferences to initiate other outlets to help spread studies in the area. Although in the United States the institutional reward system that favors incrementalism over novel theories, top U.S. journals over international journals and books and methods and rituals over relevance creates a centrally planned economy through which scholarly work is ranked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1470593113477888">Gummeson, 2010</xref>), there is optimism regarding the long-term impact and diffusion of useful and relevant work through these new outlets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470593113477888">Firat, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Some other entrepreneurial strategies within the CCT community include creating online blogs<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1470593113477888">1</xref></sup> and turning to film and books in order to create alternative media of knowledge. Some additional entrepreneurial actions can include creating collective research projects such as the Consumer Behavior Odyssey. The Odyssey project brought almost two-dozen CCT researchers from numerous organizations together to study the meaning of possessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1470593113477888">Wallendorf et al., 1988</xref>). Collective collaboration on such projects has the potential to facilitate mentoring, transgress institutional boundaries and create formal platforms investing in social relations with other interested communities. Histories of other emerging fields such as services marketing (Berry and Parasuman, 1993) demonstrate the importance of educational sources, textbooks and cases for building a new academic field. Berry and Parasuman (1993) suggest that in the early days of the field, entrepreneurs who at times had to convince their dissertation committee to work on service-related issues, brought their industry experience to the academy and wrote textbooks and cases creating resources for the emerging community to teach services marketing at business schools were key in sustaining a supply for the growing need to understand the service economy. As a relatively new field, the CCT community has a very limited number of textbooks and cases that can be adopted in marketing classes. For example, there are a few CCT-oriented business cases available through <italic>Harvard Business Review</italic> (e.g., “Mountain Dew: Selecting New Creative,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1470593113477888">Holt, 2003</xref>; “Launching the New Mini by Douglas,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1470593113477888">Holt and Quelch, 2004</xref>; “Building Brand Community on the Harley-Davidson Posse Ride,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470593113477888">Fournier et al., 2000</xref>). However, now that these cultural researchers have moved to other institutions, the production and publication of CCT-oriented business cases will become scarcer. Creating more educational resources, particularly cases that can be taught at the graduate school level, might be a way to expand cultural legitimacy in business schools.</p></sec><sec id="section6-1470593113477888"><title>Community building</title><p>Community refers to a group of individuals marked by a shared consciousness, rituals and traditions and a sense of moral responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1470593113477888">Muñiz and O’Guinn, 2001</xref>). They help their members through creating a sense of belonging as well as offering a source of subcultural capital. They orient new members and offer social and psychological support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1470593113477888">Schau et al., 2009</xref>). The community members share and understand the symbols that have a collective meaning, which aid community members to view themselves, others and the world.</p><p>Community building is a recurring strategy for consumers who deviate from dominant social norms. Consumers mobilize virtual, liminal and geographic spaces to build communities, enhance their social relations and share their experiences. The members of the abandoned Apple Newton brand community, for example, attempt to overcome the shortcomings in the marketplace by creating their own solutions. On the Internet pages, devoted members continue to support an otherwise dead technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1470593113477888">Muñiz and Schau 2005</xref>). Kates’ (2002) study of gay consumers demonstrate how gay men chose to live and consume in gay neighborhoods. Kates notes that living in the “gay ghetto” frees these consumers from anxieties about being condemned or stigmatized by others enabling their everyday actions to be less self-conscious, less self-monitored and more spontaneous. In these territorialized communities, gay men learn the codes of performing their identities as distinct from the mainstream masculinities. For at-home fathers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470593113477888">Coskuner-Balli and Thompson, 2013</xref>), community building helps members cope with stigma on a day-to-day basis as well as learn how to become involved fathers in a maternally oriented marketplace. The at-home father community has initiated a Web site, yearly convention and local playgroups. In discussions at the Web site and convention, they resist traditional parenting roles, protest product communications that exclude fathers and share experiences and advice with other fathers. They employ communal strategies to attend public spaces such as theme parks and children’s playgrounds and create a homosocial support network that allows them to attend these public spaces without being stigmatized.</p><p>As with consumption communities, academic communities can be marked by a consciousness of kind, common rituals and traditions and a sense of moral responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1470593113477888">Muñiz and O’Guinn, 2001</xref>). The consciousness of kind for a group of academics means that they “identify themselves as belonging to the community, interact with each other and are familiar with each other’s work” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470593113477888">Cole, 1983</xref>: 130). They share a common language, common understanding and adaptation of a theory, a class of problems or methodology. They also share a moral responsibility, in this case a common agenda toward the establishment of a long-term entity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1470593113477888">Hambrick and Chen, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Some community building strategies adopted by the CCT community include branding the community by adopting a name and investing in new community structures such as an association, a yearly conference, CCT workshops and classes and new publication outlets. While in the first 25 years of research the community did not have a formal name, in 2005 Arnould and Thompson proposed a viable brand name for the community: Consumer Culture Theory. They also described the theoretical interests of the research community and defined the jurisdiction areas for CCT research to both out-group and in-group members. Arnould and Thompson suggested describing the boundaries, traditions and theories of the field to new doctoral students as well as addressing the misconceptions concerning CCT research were important motivations behind their article.</p><p>The CCT community also holds workshops both within and outside the United States, where interested students who otherwise lack market options are exposed to this research. Since its initiation at Odense University in 1992, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Bilkent University and University of Stirling have been offering doctoral seminars for cultural research in consumer behavior. When the existing structural systems create a paucity of CCT researchers in many academic institutions and limit the exposure of PhD students to academic work in this field, diffusion of new ideas have become possible in these liminal and countervailing market systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470593113477888">Kozinets, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1470593113477888">Thompson and Coskuner-Balli, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Another community building practice has been organizing annual gatherings. In 1995, a group of CCT scholars gathered together at Arizona State University–West to talk about new radical, philosophical and interpretive approaches to marketing and consumer research. This led to an annual event, taking place before Association of Consumer Research Conference, called Heretical Consumer Research for the following 20 years. In 2006, the community established the CCT conference as a separate and longer event that allows the community members across the world gather and share their ideas as well as enhances group solidarity among members.</p><p>One possible downside of community building is possible exclusive clustering with in-group members. One trend that can be observed already in the CCT community is, for example, clustering at academic institutions. Among the top research schools in the United States, some schools have a growing group of CCT researchers (e.g., University of Wisconsin–Madison, University of Arizona and University of South Carolina), while other institutions have none. This helps create a collegial environment at these institutions but does not necessarily help communicate the value of CCT work to broader audiences. At the social level, paradigmatic groups tend to socially cluster at conferences, dining and entertaining together. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470593113477888">Arnould and Thompson (2007</xref>) note that these activities hinder new group’s social capital building and therefore deter social legitimacy among outer groups. Indeed, in the early days of the community, such social capital played a vital role in the institutionalization of CCT work. In the early 1980s, Paul Andersen created connections in a reading group at Virginia Tech University that eventually led to his work in the philosophy of science and sparked the Anderson (critical relativism) and Hunt (positivism) debates in the mid-1980s. These debates were important for the discipline because they opened the door to alternative ways of knowing. Andersen also forged close friendships and working relationships with cultural gatekeepers such as Richard Lutz and Kent Monroe who were influential in publishing these ideas in mainstream journals<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1470593113477888">2</xref></sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section7-1470593113477888"><title>The ordering of academic legitimacy</title><p>In his work on professionalism, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470593113477888">Abbott (1988</xref>) documents the sequence of events in the process of professionalization. In the historical ordering of professions, social legitimization follows cultural legitimization, that is, associations and schools that are about in-group legitimacy typically precede domination of work sites that require legitimacy not only within the community members but among out-groups. By integrating Abbott’s theory of professionalism and consumer research studies on legitimacy, I propose a series of legitimization practices whereby emerging communities and individual academics can speed up the process and the sequence of progressing from cultural to social legitimacy.</p><p>In the early days of an academic community, scholars begin producing academic knowledge but their cultural jurisdiction is not clearly communicated to the outside audiences. Consequently, social legitimacy is also at its infancy: publication at journals, positions at academic institutions, promotion and tenure are yet to be achieved. In time, the academic community may convince audiences regarding the value of their work, begin publishing articles in academic journals and slowly translate cultural legitimacy into social legitimacy.</p><p>From its early days, CCT research has gained entry and interest from top journals in the field. A closer look at the percentage of articles published in JCR and JM actually suggests that the representation of the academic work by this community has remained relatively static over the past 30 years. Since its early days in the 1980s, the CCT community has published approximately 15% of the articles in JCR and 3.4% in JM with a period of lower rates from 1989 to the mid-1990s in JM (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1470593113477888">Appendix A</xref> for tables). The representation rate in JCR is, however, nowhere near matched in top research schools in the United States in terms of positions held by CCT-oriented professors. A simple look at the top 20 U.S. research schools shows that the number of CCT researchers is scarce if not nonexistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470593113477888">Arnould and Thompson, 2007</xref>), although the picture is quite different in Europe, which might explain the difference between representation in journals and research institutions. Furthermore, not all work or identities are equally accepted and legitimized. Ethnicity and gender dynamics build yet additional layer of barriers on top of an already marginalized identity position. Demographic profiling of CCT researchers in the top 20 U.S. research schools suggests that the CCT researchers at these top institutions are all Americans and majority are white and male.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1470593113477888">3</xref></sup> This trend is of course not unique to CCT scholars, others have noted that men publish more frequently than women; and Western-based scholars, especially U.S.-based academics, find access to publication outlets easier than “non-nationals” particularly “third-world” academics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470593113477888">Brown, 1998</xref>). As such, these scholars need additional level of reflexivity and individual adoption of the legitimization strategies not only to get recognition for their academic work but also for their own work and identities.</p><p>Academic communities who can claim jurisdiction as well as communicate the value of their work to a large group of constituents, that is, academic institutions, consumers, marketers and policy makers enjoy both cultural and social legitimacy. The history of marketing and consumer behavior indicates the recent ascendance of these fields. Marketing and marketing management as the broader field were offered in only 2.8% of American institutions in 1971, whereas this number reached 37.9% by 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470593113477888">Brint et al., 2010</xref>). Consumer behavior as a subfield of marketing has gained legitimacy within marketing over the past 50 years. With the shift in marketing from a pure managerial perspective to a more consumer perspective during the 1960s, scholarly work on theoretical understanding of consumer behavior has flourished in journals, books and conferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1470593113477888">MacInnis and Folkes, 2010</xref>). The early days of consumer behavior such as the CCT subfield were characterized with attempts to break free from the mainstream marketing field and attempts to legitimize by establishing new journals (JCR) and associations (the Association for Consumer Research) as well as continuous discussions about how to define the boundaries of the field (Belk, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470593113477888">1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470593113477888">Holbrook, 1987</xref>).</p><p>Consumer researchers have employed many of the practices identified here to gain more authority and recognition among social sciences. For the most part, the early discussions in the field addressed cultural legitimacy issues: the jurisdiction and treatment and inference of the academic field. What kind of knowledge does consumer research produce, is it scientific and relevant and how can we judge the output of research that is created by consumer research were some main ontological and epistemological questions discussed by consumer researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5a-1470593113477888">Anderson, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470593113477888">Calder and Tybout, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1470593113477888">Hunt, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470593113477888">Kassarjian, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1470593113477888">Wells, 1993</xref>). In these discussions, the logical empiricists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470593113477888">Calder and Tybout, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1470593113477888">Hunt, 1991</xref>) defended positivist evaluation mechanisms that relied on objective measures and an approach of falsification as enhancing the scientific status of consumer research, whereas critical relativists highlighted the social construction of the scientific status of fields and suggested marketing scholars to focus on the usefulness and relevance of theories to audiences at large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470593113477888">Anderson, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5a-1470593113477888">1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1470593113477888">Peter and Olson, 1983</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1470593113477888">Wells (1993</xref>) calls for discovery-oriented research called consumer research community to start with the “so what?” question before they engage in a research project and reach out to various stakeholders including businesses, government and other academic fields.</p><p>Cultural myths were mobilized to distinguish consumer behavior from other social fields. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470593113477888">Holbrook (1987</xref>) not only suggested an overarching (identity) myth for consumer research—the social science field that studies the acquisition, usage and disposal of products—but also drew attention to the possible contributed value of consumer research to psychology, sociology, economy, anthropology and humanities. In a more recent work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1470593113477888">MacInnis and Folkes (2010</xref>) build on this identity myth by first refuting the limited view of marketing that views the field as a profit maximization unit and highlighting the policy, social and consumer implications of consumer research. Second, the authors characterize consumer behavior as a multidisciplinary field that is open to other social disciplines and propose that this should stimulate novel ideas and advance the field.</p><p>The market practices identified here can help the field of consumer behavior push the boundaries of legitimacy even further. Scholars in consumer behavior frequently note the inverse borrowing between consumer research and other social sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1470593113477888">Sheth, 1992</xref>). Making our top journals more inviting to receiving submissions from other fields and making our journals more visible (e.g., JCR publicizes the articles published in the journal) are some strategies to break the insulation of the field. Yet, the journals might not be the only outlet to make the field more multidisciplinary. The inverse borrowing starts in the PhD programs as marketing students often take classes in other social sciences but not vice versa. Attracting students from other disciplines to take consumer research course work is a challenging but worthy task in the road to gaining broader social legitimacy. Through adopting code-switching strategies, the field can reach out to various audiences. This might at times require engagement with entrepreneurial strategies, where new courses, outlets for conferences, research platforms and courses as well as academic publications are needed. The code-switching strategies also have the potential to address problems of incommensurability and create new and multidisciplinary research communities around fields of knowledge (e.g., gender, sustainability, transformative consumer research and value cocreation) rather than methodological paradigms. In an historical outlook of the origins of logical empiricism, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1470593113477888">Tadajewski (2010</xref>), for example, highlights that logical empiricism and critical marketing studies are not diametrical opposites as traditionally assumed. He suggests that despite the methodological differences, the two paradigms seek social change. Tadajewski accordingly attempts to create a reflexive view on how we think of intellectual pluralism. Similar type of intellectual pluralism that extends the boundaries of scientific communities can also be encountered in books and special journal issues.</p></sec><sec id="section8-1470593113477888"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Institutional theory has most commonly linked legitimacy to institutional isomorphism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1470593113477888">Dimaggio and Powell, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1470593113477888">Meyer and Rowan, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1470593113477888">Meyer and Scott, 1983</xref>). In their seminal article, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1470593113477888">Dimaggio and Powell (1983</xref>: 153) discuss how mimicry and professionalism act as isomorphic forces. In many fields including academia, employees are drawn from the same universities based on similar criteria. Accordingly, these employees “view problems in a similar fashion, see the same policies, procedures and structures as normatively sanctioned and legitimated, and approach decision in much the same way.” This occupational socialization through school networks and conferences enhances these similarities. This professionalism then contributes to the structuration within the fields, the hierarchical ordering of knowledge and practice. Institutional theory further notes that in fields of high uncertainty, new entrants will seek to imitate the established practices within the field to bear the costs of legitimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1470593113477888">Meyer and Rowan, 1977</xref>).</p><p>Exploring the relationship between marginalized consumer communities and the mainstream market is complementary to this approach in two ways. First, the legitimization practices can potentially influence the structuration within the field. While structural/historical factors create boundary conditions in academic disciplines, it is the type of mobilization, code-switching, entrepreneurial and communal strategies that will shape the field. Mobilizing cultural myths can help academic communities to increase the range of their cultural jurisdiction and make known their treatments and inferences and academic knowledge to wider audiences. Creating market resources have the potential not only to push the market to provide fitting resources but also to create liminal social and material spaces and transform market relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470593113477888">Coskuner-Balli and Thompson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1470593113477888">Kozinets, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1470593113477888">Thompson and Coskuner-Balli, 2007</xref>). Code switching in writing can be compared to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1470593113477888">Haraway (1991</xref>: 177) calls the “pre-eminent technology of cyborgs.” Cyborg writing as Haraway suggests is a political project that has the potential to transgress boundaries, subvert central myths and create hybrids. Community building helps groups create and sustain an alternative identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470593113477888">Coskuner-Balli and Thompson, 2013</xref>). Strategies as branding the community or creating associations and conferences not only build solidarity but are also ways to transform an informal community into a legitimate subfield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1470593113477888">Hagstrom, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1470593113477888">Kuhn, 1970a</xref>).</p><p>Second, exploring the dealings of marginalized groups within the mainstream marketplace showcases the multifaceted nature of legitimacy. Scholars distinguish among different forms of legitimacy—regulative, normative, cultural as well as the historical nature of legitimacy (Humphreys, 2010b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1470593113477888">Scott, 1995</xref>). It is also important to note that these different forms of legitimacy do not occur homogenously or more importantly simultaneously everywhere. There are various local contexts (i.e., academic institutions, journals, industry and other social institutions) with their own and distinct myths and norms. For example, journals by nature may be more open to new ideas than universities. In his reflections regarding his editor term at JCR, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470593113477888">Deighton (2007)</xref> notes that the challenge journals end up facing is publishing the same thing over and over again rather than changing. Journals might accordingly be more driven by innovation and creativity than academic institutions. The emergence of other academic subfields such as services marketing suggests that need and legitimacy in the industry can precede academic legitimacy (Berry and Parasuraman, 1993). Isomorphism does not work the same way in these related but separate entities. The fragmentation of institutions can potentially have a liberatory effect like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470593113477888">Firat and Venkatesh (1995</xref>) suggest. However, while postmodernism creates fragmentation within the marketplace, fluidity is not necessarily an effortless and easy consequence, just as multiparadigm plurality does not necessarily indicate free speech and a neutral ground for the production of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1470593113477888">Parker and McHugh, 1991</xref>).</p><p>Accordingly, rather than thinking of postmodern libertarianism as freely adopting market resources in order to construct marketplace identities or refuting the possibility of doing so altogether, we should use the fragmentation concept to understand various contexts of identity negotiations and different forms of legitimacy. In this work, I have attempted to present how individual and collective practices of actors work to transform cultural norms within diverse social fields and push the boundaries of cultural and social legitimacy. Although I develop my arguments around CCT community’s legitimization practices in the United States, my hope is that this article will become a starting point for a reflexive conversation within academic communities concerning legitimization practices as they are forming and communicating their jurisdictions (i.e., distinctiveness, direction and boundaries) as well as treatments and inferences to wider audiences in different sociopolitical contexts.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="app1-1470593113477888"><title>Appendix A</title><p>CCT articles in the <italic>Journal of Consumer Research</italic> 1981–2010.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1470593113477888"/></p><fig id="fig2-1470593113477888" position="float"><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1470593113477888-fig2.tif"/></fig><p>CCT articles in the <italic>Journal of Marketing</italic>, 1981–2010.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1470593113477888"/></p><fig id="fig3-1470593113477888" position="float"><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1470593113477888-fig3.tif"/></fig></app></app-group><notes><title>Notes</title><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1-1470593113477888"><label>1.</label><p>While the Internet provides a valuable liminal space to challenge the dominant social meanings, so far it has not been widely used by CCT researchers.
