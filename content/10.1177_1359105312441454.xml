<p>In this historical text, Wendy Kline considers how key women’s health issues (including contraception, abortion and childbirth) were approached during the second wave of the feminist revolution. The first chapter, ‘Transforming knowledge’, deals with the ways in which second wave feminism came into health care in the 1970s, focusing on the seminal text <italic>Our Bodies, Ourselves</italic> and looking at how the original book came into being and developments in subsequent editions. Kline considers the book’s impact both in terms of the authors involved in its production, and for those people who acted on its advice and its ideas. This is an interesting start to the work as it shows how the ideas were constructed, interpreted and acted on, and adapted in subsequent editions. We get to this information through the use of personal correspondence and anecdote. It demonstrates just what a far-reaching impact this text had upon many women at the time. We learn about the Boston Women’s Health Book Collective (BWHBC) who were behind the writing of the original book and about the tensions when putting the text together. We see how these tensions partly reflect the diversity of the groups discussed within the text and how at times they led readers to write to the collective to complain about the advice that had been given regarding issues such as disability and abortion. We also see how these complaints were dealt with, shaping and changing the topic matter in subsequent editions. This strong and engaging opening chapter sets the tone for the remainder of the text.</p>
<p>Kline moves on to tackle a second political issue regarding women’s health from the 1970s – the pelvic instruction controversy. In this second chapter, we learn about the shift from overtly patriarchal and medicalized views of women’s health care to a women-centred and women-controlled approach. The links between the original BWHBC described in the first chapter and the new Women’s Community Health Center (WCHC) is detailed. The WCHC opened its doors not far from the headquarters of the BWHBC and began to work with them. The aims of the WCHC were simple: ‘our shared political base is the empowerment of women through self-help so that we can control our own health care, our bodies, and our lives’ (p. 42). We learn how, although the project eventually failed, the WCHC worked with a local medical school to set up a programme focusing on improving techniques used in pelvic examinations. The WCHC, while seeing this as a pressing issue, were unaware of its growing significance as a concern throughout gynaecological medicine. The BWHBC felt that the ‘Vaginal Politics’ (to use the term promoted by Ellen Frankfort) of the pelvic examination needed much closer attention. The focus became how to teach pelvic examinations in a way that managed the delicate nature of the interaction – particularly due to the large proportion of male gynaecologists at that time. The chapter describes the development of the programme and its eventual failure, providing documentary evidence and commentary along the way.</p>
<p>The third and fourth chapters continue in a similar vein, taking key topics in women’s health – abortion and contraceptive implants – and offering a recent historical analysis as to developments in both of these areas. We see how the women’s movements promoted changes in the ways in which these topics were approached. Here we also see, through the detailed narrative accounts provided by Klein, what factors both influenced and disrupted the work. For example, in Chapter 3, we hear personal accounts of abortion activism. In Chapter 4, the debate over the safety of birth control injections becomes the focus.</p>
<p>In the final chapter, Kline deals with the tricky issue of choice in childbirth and the increasing medicalization of what, in essence, is a natural process. This chapter begins by discussing an article from 1973 entitled ‘Childbirth made difficult’ in which one woman offers her critique of the disempowerment she felt over her own birthing experience through the over-medicalization of the experience and her lack of choice and control. Klein notes that the author of the piece, Joan Haggerty, aimed to get women to question their disempowerment and to reclaim childbirth ‘as a natural rather than a medical event’ (p. 127). She also documents the struggles in the women’s movement towards reclaiming ‘natural’ childbirth, noting the tensions between feminists as to what ‘natural’ entails (cf. Arms, 1975, <italic>Immaculate Deception</italic>). Kline continues to contextualize this debate, drawing on the anecdotes of a lay midwife working in the early 1970s and her attempts at constructing an advocacy group – Home Oriented Maternity Experience (HOME). She documents the experiences of the creator of this group, Fran Ventre, and her struggles with getting home births as a safe and viable option accepted in some quarters and her eventual turn to running a midwife-led birth centre. Interestingly, in the past few years in the UK, we have seen the same debates regarding the efficacy and safety of home births and birthing centres.</p>
<p>The coda from these five excellent chapters, each a case study in its own right, is presented as an epilogue in ‘Daughters of feminism’. This section focuses on the main ways in which the activism promoted in the classic text <italic>Our Bodies, Ourselves</italic> has changed the experiences of women today. Kline notes that obviously there are positive and empowering changes that have arisen because of the strength of second wave feminism. However, she also notes that for these ‘daughters of feminism’, there is a turn away from activism to ‘self-control’. In some ways this can be demonstrated through investigating the moral discourses and rhetoric of choice surrounding many key issues in women’s lives, for instance around motherhood and infant feeding. Kline argues that, although as feminists we have certain social ideals, the physicality of the female body must be given proper consideration. She notes, ‘rather than expand and enhance knowledge and power, and create a collective consciousness, it [the body] continues to restrict and contain women’ (p. 160). While I see this as a potentially pessimistic conclusion to this excellent text, I understand Kline’s reasoning that, although we may not be putting constraints on ourselves, others do on the basis of our female bodies.</p>
<p>This is a beautifully written book and one which does much to situate women’s health practices, research, and decision making within a socio-historical context. We are able to see the people behind the debates. I found it to be hugely informative and clear in its depictions of events. The book would be useful for those working within the fields of health and social psychology and wider social scientific audiences, as well as those involved in providing health care to women. A pleasure to read.</p>
