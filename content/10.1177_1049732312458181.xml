<abstract>
<p>Although the rate of hypertension (HTN) is no higher for Mexican-origin clients than for non-Hispanic Whites, their rate of blood pressure (BP) control is lower. To effectively assist clients with their BP, health care providers must first understand barriers and facilitators to BP control from the clients’ perspectives. The purpose of this study was to describe the experience of living with HTN for Mexican immigrants and Mexican Americans. A phenomenological method was appropriate to describe their lived experience. We conducted one-time interviews with 26 adults who self-identified as Mexican-origin. Some participants did not know what caused HTN and others believed in causes they could control. Many believed HTN was of short duration. Some participants forgot to take medication or were not able to afford it. Mexican-origin clients need more assistance with BP control, and need it in both English and Spanish.</p>

<body>
<p>Mexican immigrants and Mexican Americans are vulnerable and underserved populations. They suffer a greater burden of disease, such as diabetes and HTN, compared to non-Hispanic Whites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312458181">Smedley, Stith, &amp; Nelson, 2003</xref>). Although their rate of HTN is no higher than for Whites, their rate of blood pressure (BP) control once diagnosed is lower than Whites. Knowing that HTN is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke, it is imperative that health care providers do a better job assisting this population with their HTN management. Before interventions can be planned and implemented, we must first understand the challenges to controlling blood pressure in known hypertensive Mexican immigrants and Mexican Americans. In this article, we describe their knowledge of and experiences with a diagnosis of hypertension as they lived with and engaged in care for high blood pressure. Researchers might utilize these findings as they plan future intervention studies.</p>

<title>Background and Significance</title>
<sec id="section2-1049732312458181">
<title>Hispanics in Texas</title>
<p>Hispanics are the largest ethnic minority in Texas, accounting for 37.6 % of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312458181">Ennis, Rios-Vargas, &amp; Albert, 2011</xref>). Their numbers rose by 20.6% between 2000 and 2010. Among Hispanics, Mexicans are the largest group in Texas (31.6%), second only to California for the highest percentage of persons of Mexican origin in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312458181">Ennis et al., 2011</xref>). Mexican Americans self-identify as having Mexican immigrant ancestors, whereas Mexican immigrants are born in Mexico and migrate to the United States. We deliberately included both Spanish-speaking Mexican immigrants and English-speaking Mexican Americans to better understand their unique lived experience and identify any differences between the two groups. Genetically, the two groups are similar, but historically, socially, and financially they are different. Immigrants are newer arrivals who have had fewer opportunities for education, employment, and the benefits of employment such as health insurance (Ennis et al.). Mexican Americans are more likely to be employed, have health insurance, and speak English. This study was unique because we were searching for any differences between the two groups in their HTN experience.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1049732312458181">
<title>Hypertension in Hispanics</title>
<p>Heart disease is the first leading cause and stroke is the third leading cause of death in Hispanics over 65 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312458181">Aranda &amp; Vazquez, 2004</xref>). A prior diagnosis of HTN, level of systolic blood pressure, and severe obesity are the three factors independently associated with myocardial disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312458181">Dwyer, Asif, Ippolito, &amp; Gillespie, 2000</xref>). These three factors are found more often in Black and Hispanic patients compared to non-Hispanic Whites. The prevalence of HTN among Mexican Americans is lower than the general population, but it is on the rise. Age-adjusted rates of HTN in Hispanics have increased from 17.2% to 27.8% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312458181">Aranda, Calderon, &amp; Aranda, 2008</xref>). Although the prevalence of HTN among Hispanics might be lower than Whites, blood pressure control is lower among hypertensive Hispanics compared to hypertensive non-Hispanic Whites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312458181">Natarajan, Santa Ana, Liao, Lipsitz, &amp; McGee, 2009</xref>). Mexican American men and women are less likely than non-Hispanic Whites to have controlled blood pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312458181">Ostchega, Dillon, Hughes, Carroll, &amp; Yoon, 2007</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312458181">Ong, Cheung, Man, Lau, and Lam (2007)</xref>, 63.5% of Mexican Americans in their study were aware they had HTN, 48.3% were treated for the condition, but only 25.5% had controlled blood pressure. In a large cohort of Hispanic patients with coronary artery disease and HTN (<italic>n</italic> = 8,045), 72% had a systolic pressure above 140 and 50% had a diastolic pressure above 90, despite the presence of coronary disease and medical treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312458181">Cooper-DeHoff et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049732312458181">
<title>Barriers to Blood Pressure Control</title>
<p>Hispanics face a number of barriers to adequate blood pressure control, including language and limited health literacy, poor patient–physician communication, cultural differences, low socioeconomic status, and low rates of health insurance or access to regular medical care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312458181">Aranda et al., 2008</xref>). For example, Hispanics score higher on physician distrust compared to Whites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312458181">Armstrong, Ravenell, McMurphy, &amp; Putt, 2007</xref>). With HTN itself being asymptomatic, troublesome side effects of medications and the complexity of treatment regimens also contribute to lack of HTN control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312458181">Naik, Kallen, Walder, &amp; Street, 2008</xref>). Poor social support might also interfere with treatment persistence. Researchers found that marital support, measured by both the quality and quantity of contact between the spouses, was related to improved outcomes in mild hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312458181">Baker, Szalai, Paquette, &amp; Tobe, 2003</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1049732312458181">
<title>Culture, Disease, and Prevention</title>
<p>Folk beliefs among Hispanics about the causes of HTN, the course of illness, and appropriate HTN treatments vary from those of non-Hispanic Whites. In one study of 300 Hispanic immigrants, some believed that <italic>cólera</italic> (anger) and <italic>susto</italic> (fright) contributed to HTN, and some believed it was curable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312458181">Ailinger, 1988</xref>). In another study of 201 adult Latino clinic patients, causal beliefs for HTN included poor diet, lack of exercise, smoking, family problems, and emotions like guilt, anger, and envy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312458181">Rivera, 2001</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312458181">Siegel (1997)</xref>, the meaning-of-illness factors did not explain any of the variance in medication taking, indicating that other factors are stronger predictors of medication adherence. We wanted to be sensitive to cultural beliefs in health care while still looking for knowledge and habits that related specifically to HTN management.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1049732312458181">
<title>Interventions</title>
<p>Several researchers have tried to improve blood pressure control, sometimes also addressing salt intake, physical activity, and other health behaviors relevant to HTN. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312458181">Rocha-Goldberg et al. (2010)</xref> conducted a pilot intervention with Latinos in the eastern United States and saw a reduction in systolic BP and weight, with an increase in physical activity, but the sample size of 17 and lack of power analysis makes the results questionable. In another senior-center-based pilot trial, there was a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure, adherence improvement, and vegetable intake improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312458181">Fernandez, Scales, Pineiro, Schoenthaler, &amp; Ogedegbe, 2008</xref>). Unfortunately, this sample was mostly African American (84.6%), and senior centers serve only a portion of minority elders. Researchers conducting an intervention among hypertensive Mexican Americans along the United States/Mexico border region in Texas utilized community health workers to deliver an intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312458181">Balcazar, Byrd, Ortiz, Tondapu, &amp; Chavez, 2009</xref>). Although there were significant declines in salt and fat intake, there was no significant change in blood pressure, possibly because of the short duration of the intervention (9 weeks). Unfortunately, there are many areas of the country where there are no community health workers, and the resources needed to create such a program are financially prohibitive.</p>
<p>Researchers still lack a tested intervention to address BP control in community-dwelling Hispanic adults who receive care from primary providers. Utilizing senior centers and other community locations might be helpful but will ultimately be ineffective if not paired with adequate primary care. If health care providers can understand the client’s knowledge of HTN, as well as the barriers to and facilitators of medication adherence, they might be able to work more closely with the client to control blood pressure. Although researchers have somewhat described Hispanic’s explanatory models of HTN, they have used various Hispanic populations, not always Mexicans or Mexican immigrants. The concept of hypertension and its treatment in Mexican immigrants as a subset of Mexican-origin clients has not been specifically addressed in the literature.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1049732312458181">
<title>Theoretical Framework</title>
<p>We utilized the Health Promotion Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312458181">Pender, Murdaugh, &amp; Parsons, 2002</xref>) for this study. The major concepts in this Model are prior related behaviors, perceived barriers to action, interpersonal influences, and perceived self-efficacy. Health behaviors in HTN include taking BP medications and regularly visiting a health care provider. Perceived barriers might include lack of transportation or the cost of health care visits. Interpersonal influences include the presence of social support from family members and health care providers. Self-efficacy, as defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312458181">Bandura (1997)</xref>, is the judgment of a person’s own ability to organize and execute a particular course of action. In the case of HTN, the more confident people are in obtaining and taking BP medication, the more likely they are to adhere to their prescribed medication. Studies have shown that both dietary and exercise self-efficacy can be improved in hypertensive clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312458181">Burke et al., 2008</xref>), but medication adherence self-efficacy was not found in the literature. For this study, we sought to explore the perceived barriers to self-efficacy with buying and taking medications, clinic visits, and other self-care practices for HTN. The theoretical framework served as a source of interview questions to begin to explore the participants’ perspectives; it was not meant to limit discussion topics nor direct the participants’ ideas.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<p>We used phenomenology to study Mexican immigrants’ and Mexican Americans’ knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors about HTN. Our aim was a deeper understanding of the meaning of everyday experiences and their interpretations for Mexican-origin individuals living with HTN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312458181">van Manen, 1984</xref>). Because individuals participate in cultural, social, and historical contexts, their being-in-the-world is shaped by those contexts, even as those contexts are ever changing because of the individual’s impact on the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312458181">Grossmann, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312458181">Munhall, 2007</xref>). This constant process of shaping and being shaped is embodied in linguistic, social, and cultural patterns that provide meaning to human experience. We interviewed participants to explore their knowledge and behaviors about managing their HTN.</p>
<p>Our preconceptions and biases about HTN, Mexican culture, adherence to medication, and other treatments were set aside, as much as possible, to freely listen to the participants’ world views. We maintained a journal during data collection so we could reflect on any personal feelings about HTN and its management, while also reflecting on the thoughts and ideas of the participants. Before data collection began, we obtained institutional review board approval. We used verbal consent because the only way to link the participants to the study would have been through their signature on a consent form. Because some Mexican immigrants are undocumented, we wanted to remove any fear of being reported to the authorities. We gave each participant a $10 gift certificate on completion of the interview.</p>
<p>We used convenience sampling, with purposive sampling for equal numbers of immigrants (born in Mexico) and Mexican Americans (by self-report), and with purposive sampling by gender to include equal numbers of male and female participants. We recruited the sample from two primary care clinics, utilized by immigrants and Mexican Americans, respectively, to be sure that the participants had no contact with each other and to represent the widest possible experience with primary health care. Participants were recruited in this way to represent a similar level of acculturation, immigrant/Spanish-speaking and Mexican American/English-speaking, respectively. All had a diagnosis of hypertension for at least 1 year, were being medically treated for HTN, and were currently residing in north Texas.</p>
<p>We developed the interview questions based on the literature about Hispanic culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312458181">Andrews &amp; Boyle, 1995</xref>) and HTN management. For example, we asked what happened if high blood pressure was not treated, if lack of money was ever a problem with treatment, and if they ever experienced problems or difficulties with health care providers. We interviewed participants in the primary care clinic where they were recruited or in their home if they preferred. Interviews were conducted in each participant’s preferred language—English or Spanish. We audiotaped interviews and sent them to a trained research assistant for transcription in their original language (Spanish or English). The first author checked the transcription accuracy of every other interview. To maintain rigor in the interview and analysis process, we reflected themes and ideas back to participants to be sure we understood the meaning of responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312458181">Sandelowski &amp; Barroso, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>While continuing with data collection, we immersed ourselves in the research data to describe the phenomenon of HTN from the participants’ perspectives, beginning with the Mexican immigrant group and then moving to the Mexican American group to look for any and all similarities and differences between these two groups, given their different social and historical contexts. Analysis consisted of multiple readings of all interviews accompanied by sorting of identified themes, while reflecting on our journal notes and comparing our analysis with each other. We retained themes in the analysis if they were supported by several participants and if participants fully described the theme. Once themes were labeled and described, we refined themes in future interviews. Data collection continued until we reached saturation of themes.</p>
<p>The final sample was 26 participants, 13 Mexican immigrants and 13 Mexican Americans; all self-identified as Mexican or Mexican American. The average age of the entire sample was 55.0 years; 50% were male, and on average it had been 7.3 years since diagnosis. All immigrants were uninsured, whereas the Mexican Americans were insured (Medicaid or Medicare). As expected, all immigrants preferred to speak Spanish during the interview and most of the Mexican Americans preferred to speak English. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1049732312458181">Table 1</xref> for a demographic comparison between the two groups and the total sample. Half of the participants were immigrants who were undocumented. Because they did not have legal status, most did not qualify for financial assistance. If undocumented immigrants wanted primary care or hospitalization for nonemergency procedures, they often had to pay for all services in cash. The Mexican American participants had Medicare and/or Medicaid insurance. The difference in access to affordable health care is an important variable between Mexican immigrants and Mexican Americans in Texas, and most likely affected their decisions about HTN treatment.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>The major themes we found in the data were getting the diagnosis, causes of high blood pressure, untreated blood pressure, chronicity and severity, traditional healers, remembering, difficulties with treatment, <italic>ayuda</italic> (helps), and taking (testing) their BP. Both the Mexican immigrant and Mexican American groups mentioned these themes equally. Only two themes were unique to the immigrant group: cost of health care and discrimination. We describe each theme, with quotes from the participants.</p>
<sec id="section10-1049732312458181">
<title>Getting the Diagnosis: Fear, Anger, and Depression</title>
<p>Some Mexican-origin adults had immediate emotional responses to their initial diagnosis of HTN. They were scared, very upset, totally shocked, or surprised: “I was worried. I had problems with hearing it.” These participants feared the unknown aspects of the disease, what was going to happen next, or whether they were going to die. They had heard televised messages indicating that high blood pressure is a silent killer, or had known someone who had had a stroke or lost a kidney as a result of HTN. If the participant knew of a family member who had had a stroke, the fear was even more acute. Other participants were surprised because they had never had symptoms. One month they felt fine and the next month they were on medication. They could not tell that anything was wrong with their body so they felt betrayed by it. Some Mexican-origin adults were angry because they did not think they “deserved” to get this diagnosis: “I am in shape! I exercise; I could walk five to six miles straight without stopping. I have an older sister who doesn’t exercise one bit and she doesn’t have it. So it was like, ‘Why me?’” Participants felt there was no justice when HTN was diagnosed in someone who was doing what they thought was healthy, but had HTN anyway.</p>
<p>Participants described how this emotional response to the diagnosis led to depression in some cases: “I was depressed for a little while. It really, really made me down, because I hate to take medicine. It was hard for me to face it at the beginning.” Mothers were depressed because they felt they could not adequately care for their children, or were unsure if they would be alive to raise their children. This depression was associated with the unexpectedness of the diagnosis and the fear of long-term illness or death. Those who were depressed said it lasted about a month before they began to feel better. Their family members and friends helped them get over their depression by caring for them physically and encouraging them emotionally. In every case of (self-diagnosed) depression, the family was the most important source of support.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1049732312458181">
<title>Causes of High Blood Pressure</title>
<p>Some Mexican-origin adults did not know what caused HTN and others mentioned both personal and external causes. Personal or individual causes included being overweight, lack of exercise, salt or sugar in the diet, stress, and smoking. They considered these personal causes because they believed they could do something about them. External causes included genetics and environmental pollution, which were outside the control of the individual: “Everybody in my father’s family has it, and all his siblings have had high blood pressure.” “There is pollution that can cause [HTN].” No one attributed HTN to any Mexican cultural belief, such as <italic>susto</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1049732312458181">
<title>Untreated Blood Pressure</title>
<p>There were very divergent beliefs among these Mexican-origin adults about the possible results of untreated HTN. Some did not know if HTN had any effects at all: “I don’t really understand it. I don’t think anything bad will happen.” Other participants clearly stated the outcomes of stroke, heart disease, and death.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1049732312458181">
<title>Chronicity and Severity: Being in Control</title>
<p>Some participants believed that HTN would last the rest of their life, but most believed it was of shorter duration: “It goes away. I had it two years ago but now it is no big problem.” If they were in control of their habits and did everything right, such as stopped smoking, lost weight, or ate right, participants believed the blood pressure problem would go away: “The way I look at it, if I take the medicine and my pressure is normal, then I feel like I don’t have high blood pressure.” Some believed that whether or not the HTN lasted depended on the person, not on the disease: “I think it is something that can last a long time or it can go away. It depends on the person.” At the very least, many Mexican-origin adults vacillated between thinking this was a chronic condition and wanting to believe it was time limited. When they visited their primary provider and were told that their blood pressure was normal that day, many felt they no longer had the disease. When asked about the severity of the disease, participants discussed the severity of the psychological burden, not of the symptoms: “It gives me fear inside, like despair. We don’t have the money for this.” The financial burden for many participants was more troublesome than the disease itself. The lack of resources and the constant presence of HTN over time led to despair in some participants, which sometimes led to a decision to stop treatment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1049732312458181">
<title>Traditional Healers</title>
<p>Although researchers have described traditional Mexican <italic>curanderos</italic> (healers) and herbalists, none of the participants visited a traditional healer for HTN treatment. A few used herbal teas (e.g., lemongrass) and/or vitamin supplements from local stores. Some primary providers had warned participants to avoid any other nonprescribed treatments because of potential problems with the liver or kidneys. Both immigrants and Mexican Americans in this sample insisted on following doctor’s orders and did not mix prescribed drugs with herbs or other home remedies.</p>

<title>Remembering</title>
<p>Some Mexican-origin adults remembered to take their HTN medication every day but others admitted they forgot some days. Those who did remember had different strategies to remind themselves. One strategy was to place the medication in plain sight so they would see it. For example, if they took the medication at bedtime, they placed it on their bedside table. One woman placed it on the family altar:
<disp-quote>
<p>You know I am a religious person, and the altar has pictures of my family. I pray for them. I am Catholic. I have my medicine there, too, and that’s what I always look at and I remember to take my medicine.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Using a pill box that was filled weekly, setting the alarm on their cell phone, and writing times on a calendar were other ways they remembered to take medication. A related strategy for participants was to take the medication at the same time every day so it became part of their daily routine: “I brush my teeth, take my pill, and then go to bed.” A daily routine might include taking other medications for other conditions, such as diabetes, which also helped them remember to take their HTN medication: “The one for my heart, I have to have it, because if I don’t take it—my heart beats out of rhythm. So I just don’t forget to take any of them.” Synergy developed where participants remembered to take medication for one condition and then took others as well. Particularly for Mexican-origin elderly persons living with adult children and grandchildren, family members helped them go to the doctor, obtain their prescriptions, and reminded them to take their medications. Family support was a recurrent theme throughout their stories of HTN.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1049732312458181">
<title>Difficulties With Treatment</title>
<p>Mexican-origin adults encountered some barriers and difficulties as they managed their HTN at home. The biggest barrier was the cost of medication: “Well, sometimes I can’t buy it and I have to wait until my social security check comes so we can get my prescriptions. So sometimes I run out of the medicine.” Some medication was very costly for low-income people and, if they could not afford it, they did not buy it or take it. Another barrier was lack of transportation to either the pharmacy or the primary care clinic. Participants who did not drive or did not have a car relied on others to take them to the pharmacy or clinic. Waiting for a ride sometimes delayed their prescription refills or their clinic visits:
<disp-quote>
<p>Well, I have trouble getting [the medicine]. I have to call my daughters and see which one can take me, because I get them at [a pharmacy], and sometimes I do have trouble getting them because I don’t have enough money to get them and they [daughters] help me out with it. The [pharmacy] is far away and we do not drive. I have trouble going to the doctor, too, because I do not drive.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1049732312458181">
<title>Help or Assistance</title>
<p>Participants also had positive ways to manage their medications. For example, the $4-a-month generic medication plan at chain-store pharmacies was affordable, and some clinics serving low-income clients actively recommended those generic programs. Participants with Medicare insurance could get their medications through a mail order system, which was highly beneficial for this community without regular transportation: “A lot of people get their medicine by mail, and I need to go to the social worker to learn how to do this.” Ordering a 90-day supply of medications was helpful because they only had to fill prescriptions four times a year, although they also needed more money to buy the more costly 90-day supply.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1049732312458181">
<title>Taking Their Blood Pressure</title>
<p>Among all of the participants, only one man had a BP cuff at home, although he never used it. The other participants did not have the equipment, could not afford it, and did not know how to check their BP: “The insurance does not cover the equipment. Fifty dollars is expensive for the blood pressure cuff.” Participants asked the interviewer what a normal BP was and what the BP numbers meant, because they did not understand them, even though they were all known hypertensive patients receiving primary care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1049732312458181">
<title>Mexican Immigrants vs. Mexican Americans</title>
<p>In almost all conversations about HTN, Spanish-speaking Mexican immigrants and English-speaking Mexican Americans reported similar knowledge about blood pressure, and similar barriers to and facilitators of care. There were two themes that were more important for immigrants than for Mexican Americans: cost barriers and discrimination in health care.</p>
<sec id="section20-1049732312458181">
<title>Cost</title>
<p>None of the Mexican immigrants had health insurance, so they could receive only the care they could afford to pay for in cash. They had to save their money for an office visit, use the local hospital’s emergency department, or seek charity care at a local clinic. The charity clinic offered them a primary care visit and laboratory blood work, but there were no specialists and they had to pay for medications. When they needed elective surgery, they were usually advised to return to Mexico for access to care. The cost of health care for Mexican immigrants under these circumstances was a burden and a constant source of concern to them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1049732312458181">
<title>Discrimination</title>
<p>Mexican immigrants were complimentary of the care they received from physicians, nurse practitioners, and nurses. They noted that the receptionists at the clinics, pharmacies, or hospital emergency departments were not always compassionate. Spanish-speaking Mexican immigrants experienced rudeness and lack of attention when making appointments or filling prescriptions at some locations:
<disp-quote>
<p>Wednesday I could not arrive early, and the lady that they have there [receptionist], she tried to scold me. She told me they would see me that day, but the next time I was late they wouldn’t see me because I was wasting her time. I still had to wait for an hour [to see the doctor], even though she told me I was late. I think if someone is coming to see me, I am going to treat them with kindness. That day I felt bad, a little hurt.</p>
<p>The pharmacy over here, they are not nice to people who speak Spanish. All of my neighbors talk about it, how they are rude to Spanish-speaking people. One day they told me to return in an hour. When I returned, they made me wait another hour or more, and they had no explanation for why I had to wait. The woman behind the counter said, in a loud voice, “I don’t understand anything you are saying,” because I speak Spanish. They try to embarrass you so you do not return. I don’t go to that pharmacy anymore.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When Mexican immigrants perceived they were being treated rudely or unkindly they stopped going to that particular clinic, pharmacy, or health care provider. They would not risk public embarrassment or emotional hurt to get prescriptions filled or to see the provider. Although many Spanish-speaking immigrants had similar stories, none of the English-speaking Mexican Americans complained about the care they received.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="section23-1049732312458181">
<title>Primary Care</title>
<p>Health care providers need to know that when they communicate an initial diagnosis of HTN, Mexican-origin clients might have an immediate emotional reaction to the diagnosis such as surprise, shock, or dismay. At that moment, they do not comprehend the instructions about how to take a pill, lose weight, or exercise. The provider can request that a family member join the patient in the room when giving the diagnosis and treatment explanation as one way to plan for family support. Including a family member means at least one person in the family is able to reinforce instructions with the patient. If family is not available, then patient teaching about how to manage blood pressure could be done at a different patient visit, after the initial shock has worn off.</p>
<p>Participants did not distinguish between what causes HTN and what factors might make the blood pressure increase. For example, instead of saying that higher body weight might make the blood pressure go up, they claim that body weight caused the HTN. This finding is similar to results found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312458181">Kolb, Zarate-Abbott, Gillespie, Deliganis, and Norgan (2011)</xref>, where participants believed that stress both caused the disease and caused the blood pressure to rise. Providers need to emphasize the unknown cause of primary hypertension distinguished from the factors that make the blood pressure go up or down, such as weight loss or salt in the diet. They need to reinforce the negative consequences of untreated HTN. Some Mexican-origin clients thought that high blood pressure was not a serious problem, which led to a lack of motivation to remain on medication, check their blood pressure, or return for primary provider visits. If informed, avoiding negative consequences of HTN (such as a stroke) might motivate some to stay on medication.</p>
<p>Regarding the chronicity and severity of the disease, Mexican clients must be reminded that HTN is chronic and that treatment must continue for the remainder of their life. The finding that a normal blood pressure signifies the end of the disease for Hispanic clients is similar to the findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312458181">Kolb et al. (2011)</xref>, who reported that some Hispanics perceived HTN to last a short time. Although Mexican clients might be encouraged to lose weight, reduce sodium in the diet, or practice other preventive strategies, this can be explained in the context of helping to reduce blood pressure, not in terms of curing the problem. Of particular concern to health care providers are clients who admit they forget to take their medication and also have no particular strategy for remembering. Placing the medication in a visible location and developing a pattern or habit of taking it at a certain time of day are strategies that can be taught at health care visits, with written instructions for them to take home as reminders.</p>
<p>There was a lack of knowledge in this population about what the systolic and diastolic numbers meant, and the normal range for BP. The lack of a BP cuff at home was an unexpected finding, because they are obtainable at any pharmacy and digital cuffs are easy to read. Most participants believed the equipment was too expensive and/or did not know how to use a BP cuff. Researchers have found that the use of a BP cuff at home, with readings reported to the primary provider, can improve BP control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312458181">Pickering et al., 2008</xref>). This population needs an intervention that includes providing and regularly using a BP cuff at home.</p>
<p>Possibly the most unexpected finding was the perceived discrimination from receptionists at the front desks of clinics, pharmacies, and laboratories, but not from nurses or physicians. The personnel of first contact with Mexican-origin clients are extremely important in establishing a positive relationship that will grow and continue as care is given and received over time. Historically, researchers have studied the provider–patient relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312458181">Aranda et al., 2008</xref>), but little attention has been paid to ancillary personnel. A negative interaction with a receptionist might mean the client never returns for care, so pharmacists and primary care providers must train ancillary personnel in ways to build trust and maintain relationships with Mexican-origin clients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-1049732312458181">
<title>Health Policy</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312458181">Fox News (2011)</xref>, an increasing proportion of the U.S. population is without health insurance, primarily because of high unemployment. It is estimated that 8 million people will access free or charity clinics in the coming year, whereas financial donations to those same clinics are projected to decline by 20%. If health care reform is not able to significantly address this gap in care, then public and charity clinics will be needed more than ever. Because city and county policies on immigrant health and the uninsured vary by state and by areas within states, the specific policies that need to be addressed will vary. If health insurance plans paid for a BP cuff for everyone diagnosed with HTN, as they would pay for a glucometer for diabetics, more hypertensive adults would be checking their BP. Medical supplies at low or no cost might assist Mexican-origin adults with taking their BP.</p>
<p>For long-term change, health care providers must advocate for the uninsured, either through county/public health clinics, charity clinics, or health care reform. When comparing the two groups in this study—Mexican Americans vs. Mexican immigrants—it was not cultural beliefs or the use of traditional healers that made the difference in care, but care costs. Mexican Americans had health insurance that immigrants did not, and insurance has a direct impact on the number of immigrants who are able to be diagnosed and treated for HTN. English-speaking Mexican-origin participants perceived less discrimination than the Spanish-speaking participants, indicating a need to address health disparities by primary language.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-1049732312458181">
<title>Support for Theory Framework</title>
<p>The findings support the Theory of Health Promotion in this population. Prior related behavior with taking medications for other conditions supported the participants in taking additional medications for HTN. Also congruent with the theory, participants perceived barriers to taking HTN medication, filling prescriptions, and returning for provider visits. Some Mexican-origin adults reported facilitators for following medication regimens that included reminders and family support. There was low self-efficacy for some self-care issues such as finding affordable medication or using a BP cuff at home. This Theory would be useful in planning interventions by focusing attention on barriers, facilitators, and self-efficacy for HTN self-care in Hispanic-origin adults.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-1049732312458181">
<title>Future Research</title>
<p>Findings from this study can assist researchers in the design and testing of future interventions with Mexican-origin clients. Teaching materials need to be in Spanish for recent immigrants and for residents who still speak Spanish in the home. Most low-income clients also have lower literacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312458181">Board on Population Health, 2011</xref>), so printed materials must be written at a 5th-grade level or below. Interventions tested in other studies that used educational strategies alone have not shown strong results in BP improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312458181">Balcazar et al., 2009</xref>). The lengths of previous interventions (in weeks) have varied widely, indicating a need to determine the optimal dose of HTN interventions (Balcazar et al.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312458181">Rocha-Goldberg et al., 2010</xref>). Barriers to and facilitators of self-care at home and in primary care must be addressed in future interventions. For example, providing BP cuffs might provide an added incentive for taking HTN medications, thereby improving BP control. Finally, interventions to improve self-efficacy to control blood pressure might empower Mexican clients to collaborate with health care providers in reaching mutual goals.</p>
