One powerful strategy is to recruit and retain the most suitable patients for each clinical trial, with one operational definition of <italic>suitable</italic> being patients who will safely obtain therapeutic benefit from an investigational drug should the drug indeed be capable of conferring such benefit. Advances in diagnostic capabilities regarding respiratory diseases mean that the recruitment of appropriate patients is more easily facilitated, as long as suitable recruitment practices are implemented.</p><p>Devising a successful strategy for the execution of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma trials requires a multifaceted approach and an understanding of the factors that drive patient recruitment. However, little has been written about recruitment and the comparative success of recruitment strategies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2168479013488880">1</xref></sup> On a country level, these factors can include a complex mixture of the epidemiological characteristics of the disease, health care and regulatory landscapes, and treatment guidelines for each country and/or region. On a patient and site level, an understanding of the patient profile and behavioral patterns associated with the disease is needed. Also, anticipating challenges that the investigational product will impose on patients and study site staff is crucial to the trial’s success. </p><p>Asthma and COPD remain active areas of clinical research, with a large—and increasing—population of sufferers. The mortality attributed to COPD is expected to double over the next 3 decades, making it the third leading cause of death worldwide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2168479013488880">2</xref></sup> Currently, the disease is largely hidden, with 50% to 75% of sufferers being undiagnosed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2168479013488880">2</xref></sup> Thirty million patients in the US suffer from COPD, and only 6 million of them receive treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2168479013488880">2</xref></sup> Globally, it is estimated that as many as 300 million people of all ages and all ethnic backgrounds suffer from asthma.

In efforts to further understand the drivers in delivering a successful recruitment strategy, we conducted a proactive survey globally. The purpose of this global outreach survey initiative was to gain further insight into current medical practice and treatment guidelines, prescribing trends, patient profiles, and standard of care in COPD and asthma. Surveys were sent to countries, and data collection occurred over the course of 2 months (March through May 2012). Of the surveys sent, 55 responses were received. Australia and New Zealand’s responses were included in one survey, thus yielding 54 surveys total. In addition to this survey, data from a recent site survey sent to more than 5000 Quintiles-affiliated sites, along with data previously collected in study-specific site outreach activities, will be discussed here. These efforts have helped provide insight into critical factors to help drive country, site, and patient recruitment strategies. In this article, we focus on results found for treatment guidelines compliance, patient diagnosis and treatment, approved therapies, and patient profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2168479013488880">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1-2168479013488880" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Countries participating in Asthma and COPD global outreach survey, March through May 2012.

These guidelines provide global strategies for diagnosis, disease management and prevention, patient access, and the use of standard-of-care medications and therapies. </p><p>In the recent global outreach survey in which 54 countries were surveyed (Australia and New Zealand were grouped as one country for the purposes of this analysis), all countries except Turkey indicated that they follow GOLD guidelines. Treatment guidelines may vary for each country and region, but a total of 48 (89%) of these countries follow their national treatment guidelines for COPD, which are in alignment with the GOLD treatment guidelines for COPD. The same pattern was seen for asthma treatment: The same assessment revealed that 53 of the 54 countries follow the GINA guidelines, with the exception being Chile. Also, 50 of 54 (93%) countries follow their national treatment guidelines for asthma.</p><p>In a recent and ongoing site outreach exercise, approximately 5000 Quintiles-affiliated sites were surveyed globally across multiple therapeutic areas. Responses for COPD showed that using the functional classification of GOLD, the highest number of COPD patients are classified as GOLD stage 3 (32%) and stage 2 (30%), followed by GOLD stage 1 (23%) and stage 4 (18%). Responses for asthma showed that the highest numbers of GINA patients were classified as GINA stages 2 and 3 (both being 26%), followed by GINA stage 1 (21%) and stage 4 (17%)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-2168479013488880">i</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2168479013488880">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2168479013488880">3</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2-2168479013488880" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) functional stage distribution (in percentages) by region.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2168479013488880-fig2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig3-2168479013488880" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) stage distribution (in percentages) by region.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2168479013488880-fig3.tif"/></fig><p> Any site involved in a clinical trial would be expected to comply with protocol guidelines and requirements, including GINA/GOLD standards.

Similar to other diseases, COPD and asthma can be diagnosed and treated by different specialties globally, depending on the epidemiological characteristics of the disease, reimbursement policies, and other health care–related issues within a region. The survey document asks who diagnoses and treats COPD and asthma in the respondents’ countries, with the choices being pulmonologists; allergists; general practitioners (GPs)/family practitioners; ear, nose, and throat specialists; and “other.”</p><p>All 54 countries (Australia and New Zealand grouped into a single survey) participating in this assessment indicated that pulmonologists diagnose and treat COPD. Additionally, 11 countries noted that allergists diagnose COPD, with allergists in 9 of the 11 countries (82%) also treating COPD. A total of 33 countries noted that GPs/family practitioners diagnose COPD, with 28 of the 33 (85%) also treating COPD.</p><p>The results were similar for asthma, as 52 of 54 countries (97%) participating in this survey indicated that pulmonologists diagnose and treat asthma. However, unlike the case with COPD, allergists were more involved in diagnosing and treating asthma. A total of 40 countries noted that allergists treat and diagnose asthma. Additionally, a total of 28 countries noted that GPs/family practitioners both diagnose and treat asthma. In comparison, there was little or no indication of ear, nose, and throat specialist or “other” specialist involvement in COPD and asthma diagnosis and treatment.</p><p> Results from this survey suggest that treatment and diagnosis of COPD and asthma are most commonly carried out by pulmonologists. This is the common finding in study-specific Quintiles site outreach exercises as well. For COPD, the landscape activity showed that in 33 countries GPs diagnose COPD, and in 11 countries, allergists also diagnose COPD. Despite these findings, previous study-specific surveys suggest that allergists are still a significant presence in asthma treatment and can be involved, particularly when allergic asthmatic patients represent the subjects sought for the study: Therefore, allergists should continue to be targeted for asthma-related clinical trials. General and family practitioners are also involved to a lesser extent in asthma, as are other groups.</p><p>The selection of principal investigators (PIs) at qualified sites can be influenced by study phase, entry criteria, study design, and technical requirements, but overall, pulmonologists would be seen as the most likely PIs in terms of having technical experience and identifying suitable study patients.</p><p>Considering site attributes (eg, capabilities, equipment) is also important in a successful recruitment strategy. For example, those who design respiratory studies must consider spirometry requirements, whether evening visits are required for pulmonary function tests, use of electronic diaries and their qualities, and diagnostic testing capabilities. Other study requirements may limit site availability: Assessments required per protocol that may represent technical challenges include bronchoscopy, induced sputum sample collection, skin prick testing, and high-resolution computed tomography. For example, a recent COPD study-specific site survey conducted by Quintiles estimated that 70% of COPD patients classified as GOLD stage 1-3 would be able to produce an adequate sputum sample (&gt;3 mL) in response to nebulized hypertonic saline, based on investigator responses. However, most investigators do not perform sputum collection as part of routine clinical practice; 48% of responding investigators perform sputum collection as required by clinical trials; and 31% of responding investigators do not perform sputum collection at all. Despite this, the difficulties in the standardization of sputum techniques (both for induction and processing of samples and for their evaluation) would recommend a deeper approach in the selection of sites involved in those studies.</p><p>In another COPD study-specific site outreach exercise, 31% of investigators indicated experience with bronchoscopy in COPD patients. Similarly, if allergic asthmatic subjects are required, sites’ capabilities and experience with skin prick tests and/or immunoglobulin E measurements would have to be assessed, as not all sites have personnel who are used to performing allergen skin tests.</p></sec><sec id="section3-2168479013488880"><title>Approved Therapies</title><p>In terms of the nature of patient treatment, pharmacologic therapy is used to reduce symptoms, reduce frequency and severity of pulmonary exacerbations, and improve health status and exercise tolerance. Quintiles’ recent global outreach survey showed that the majority of countries use long-acting beta-2 agonists (LABAs) and short-acting beta-2 agonists (SABAs) as first-line approved therapies for COPD. Inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/LABA fixed-dose combination therapy (ICS/LABA FDC), long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), ICSs, short-acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMAs), oral corticosteroids (OCs), and roflumilast are used to a lesser degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-2168479013488880">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-2168479013488880">5</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4-2168479013488880" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Summary of all countries using first-line therapies for COPD.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2168479013488880-fig4.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig5-2168479013488880" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Summary of all countries using first-line therapies for asthma.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2168479013488880-fig5.tif"/></fig><p>For asthma, the majority of the countries surveyed used ICSs, SABAs, and ICS/LABA FDC as first-line approved therapies for asthma.

Focus falls mainly on limited aspects of this important topic, such as the importance of spirometry in prescreening and aspects of inclusion criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2168479013488880">4</xref></sup>; a focus on methods for minority populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2168479013488880">5</xref></sup>; and barriers to recruitment for physicians, such as time constraints, identifying eligible patients, trial design barriers, and lack of access to treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2168479013488880">6</xref></sup></p><p>Our COPD study-specific site outreach surveys have shown that the required values and stability for FEV<sub>1</sub> (forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration), reversibility definition, the level of symptoms, and their control as defined by quality of life scores or dyspnea scales are all important patient qualifiers to consider when recruiting patients for a COPD clinical trial. If, for inclusion, patients are required to have had a number of exacerbations in the last year, for example, this will reduce the number of COPD and asthma patients who are eligible for a study. Feasibility studies for COPD have highlighted that of those patients categorized as GOLD stages 1 through 3, 40% had 2 or more exacerbations per year, and 30% had 1 exacerbation per year. Therefore, depending on the study requirements, recruitment could be affected. Geographical considerations for asthma studies need to take into account whether there are variations in exacerbation rates.</p><p>Smoking is the primary cause of COPD, and patients are typically required to have a 10 pack-year history of smoking to be eligible for a trial. Previous Quintiles COPD study-specific site outreach assessments evaluated smoking prevalence in over 30 countries and established that it ranged from 19% (in India) to 50% (in Russia). Regionally, the highest prevalence of smoking was in Central and Eastern Europe. All countries showed a larger percentage of men smoking than women, and in all regions apart from Central and Eastern Europe, investigators reported that the majority of their COPD patients had discontinued smoking. Investigators have also estimated that 10% (global median) of asthma patients currently smoked or had a smoking history. However, investigators in Poland and the Ukraine reported higher levels of 25% and 20%, respectively.</p><p>Patient disease severity and current dose strength of ICS, for example, can be entry criteria that help define the target population (eg, mild, moderate, severe, moderate to severe) and recruitment potential. In some asthma study-specific site outreach assessments, investigators estimated that approximately 50% of their patients would be classified as “allergic,” while in some countries this was reported at levels higher than 65%.</p><p>Excluded comorbid conditions could also affect patient enrollment; the most frequently diagnosed conditions associated with COPD that are not respiratory related (ie, do not involve bronchitis, pneumonia, and esophageal obstruction) are hypertension and diabetes.</p><p>With regard to patient age range, one asthma study-specific site outreach activity estimated that sites sampled had 15% of their population in the range of 12 to 17 years of age, and 85% were 18 years or older. Some pediatric sites may be required if a higher proportion of younger patients are required. These aspects of study design, entry criteria, and patient qualifiers can have a significant effect on recruitment, the study population, and regional site selection.</p></sec><sec id="section5-2168479013488880"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Understanding COPD and asthma as respiratory diseases alone is not enough to drive site selection and a successful clinical trial recruitment strategy. Although disease incidence is often considered a key driver for recruitment, this is modified by other factors. This article has described the high compliance with treatment guidelines globally to diagnose, treat, and manage patients. With an understanding of these aspects, trial inclusion criteria can be assessed to help position the study successfully at sites. However, details about the therapy being offered in the trial and the patient qualifiers have to be considered to ensure that the appropriate patients will be available and incentivized to participate.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank J.
