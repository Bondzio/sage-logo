<abstract>
<p>We present the case of an infant with congenital heart disease which includes a partial atrioventricular canal defect with the absence of the atrial septum (common atrium) and an extremely uncommon course of the right-sided superior vena cava (SVC) including an intra-atrial segment coursing intramurally along the right posterolateral atrial wall, with an intracardiac orifice situated low within the right side of the atrium, close to the atrial orifice of the right hepatic veins. This feature of the anatomy was discovered intraoperatively at the time of surgical repair. Systemic venous anatomy also included interrupted inferior vena cava (IVC) with azygos continuation to a left-sided SVC draining directly into the left side of the atrium. The successful surgical procedure included tunneling of the left-sided SVC to the right side of the common atrium and atrial septation with a patch.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 25-month-old male child was admitted to our institution with the diagnosis of single atrium with pulmonary artery hypertension. At the age of 12 months, he had undergone a cardiac surgical exploration in his native country but, as a result of the complexity of the patient’s anatomy, no repair had been performed and he was subsequently referred to our institution. At the time of admission, he had moderate cyanosis and poor physical development. Echocardiographic evaluation showed mesocardia, indeterminate atrial situs with common atrium (no atrial septum) with partial atrioventricular (AV) canal defect. Right and left ventricles were of normal size and had satisfactory shortening. There were balanced left- and right-sided AV valve components with trivial left-sided component insufficiency. There were abnormalities of systemic venous return: interrupted inferior vena cava (IVC) with azygos return to a left-sided superior vena cava (SVC) which connected directly to the most leftward superior aspect of the atrium. Two widely separated groups of hepatic veins entered the atrium inferiorly on the right and left sides. There was a D-loop and a normal position of the great arteries. There was no pulmonary stenosis. Computerized tomographic (CT) scan of the heart confirmed the abnormalities of the systemic venous return and existence of right- and left-sided SVC veins.</p>
<p>Surgical repair was performed with normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass. During the operation, we were unable to cannulate the right-sided SVC through the atrial wall. A cannula was inserted directly into the right-sided SVC above the level of the atrium. After creating an incision in the right-sided wall of the atrium, the cardiac anatomy was inspected and confirmed. The right-sided SVC was found to have an intra-atrial segment coursing intramurally along the right posterolateral atrial wall with drainage to the right-sided inferior part of the common atrium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2150135111422084">Figure 1</xref>
), close to the orifices of the right-sided hepatic veins and the inferior right pulmonary vein. There were two hepatic vein orifices within the atrium, the other one being left-sided (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2150135111422084">Figure 1</xref>). We did not identify any orifice of the coronary sinus. The four pulmonary veins connected normally on the left side, related to the left-sided valve component of the partial AV canal defect.</p>

<p>Repair consisted of redirection of the left-sided SVC toward the right side of the common atrium with a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) baffle, and atrial septation with a patch, leaving all systemic veins (including the hepatic veins) draining on the right side and all pulmonary veins on the left side. The right and left AV valve orifices were separated, using the same patch that was used for the atrial septation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2150135111422084">Figure 2</xref>
).</p>

<p>The zone of apposition (“cleft”) of the left AV valve was closed with interrupted sutures. The postoperative course was uneventful. On postoperative echocardiographic evaluation, atrial septation was complete with no residual shunt between right and left atrium. Ventricular function was excellent and the left AV valve had trivial regurgitation. The patient was discharged 5 days after operation and returned to his country after 30 days.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The unusual intra-atrial course of the right-sided SVC was discovered at surgery. Retrospective analysis and reconstruction of the preoperative cardiac CT scan did, in fact, allow us to visualize this abnormal course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2150135111422084">Figure 3</xref>
). Although the exact anatomy of the right-sided atrial appendage was not definitively determined, as there were numerous adhesions as a result of the first operation, it seems very likely that the anatomic diagnosis is heterotaxy syndrome of the left isomerism type. As a matter of fact, interrupted IVC with azygos continuation to a left SVC, polysplenia, partial AV canal defect with common atrium, and median location of the liver are all consistent with this anatomic diagnosis. However, the unusual anatomy of the right-sided SVC and its low opening in the atrium has not been described, even in a large study of venoatrial connections in 183 cases of visceroatrial heterotaxy with congenital heart disease including 58 cases with left isomerism.<sup>

<p>Another possible explanation of this phenomenon is to consider the patient as having situs inversus of the atria (Richard Van Praagh, personal communication, April 4, 2008). The right-sided SVC is then the less dominant SVC, which usually opens into the coronary sinus. But, typically in the heterotaxy syndromes, the right-sided coronary sinus is unroofed. So the right-sided SVC opens low into the right-sided part of this inverted common atrium because of the unroofing of the coronary sinus. The ventricular and infundibuloarterial cardiac segments are normally aligned, so the cardiac segmental anatomy could be {A(i), D, S}, meaning a situs ambiguous with atria very probably basically in situs inversus, with noninverted D-loop ventricles and normally related great arteries. This would then be an instance of AV discordance with ventriculoarterial concordance,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135111422084">2</xref>
</sup> and the patient could be then considered to have an isolated atrial inversion. This is a very rare congenital malformation that can appear with some degree of heterotaxy, like our patient, with visceral situs solitus<sup>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first case described with intra-atrial course of a right-sided SVC, in association with a left-sided SVC and common atrium. Is this an isolated atrial inversion or a case of left isomerism? This remains a debate among cardiac morphologists. Clear identification of the anatomy of the atrial appendages would have helped us to decide, but nevertheless, the intra-atrial course of the right-sided SVC may represent an extremely unusual mode of incorporation of the primitive right sinus horn in the atrial tissue.</p>
