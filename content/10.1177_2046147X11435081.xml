<abstract>
<p>This article brings together two established fields of organizational study, organizational justice (OJ) and public relations (PR), in a search for potential benefits. The ‘fair process effect’ says that people tend to behave more cooperatively and prosocially when they perceive fairness in a situation, and less cooperatively when they perceive unfairness. Scholars have stressed the potential benefits of understanding perceptions of fairness in a range of contexts including policing, sport refereeing, management and teaching. Some have also challenged OJ scholars to use that field’s understanding of what people find to be fair to better help the victims of injustice.</p>
<p>The article reports that PR and OJ have developed bodies of knowledge that enhance organizations’ capacity to influence change for greater fairness, but both fields have been criticized because their knowledge has more often been applied to increasing the perception of fairness (resulting in greater stakeholder cooperation with organizations and their decisions), than to increasing fair outcomes for a range of stakeholders. The article also shows that PR could benefit in several ways from a deeper understanding of OJ, and that OJ could be very usefully integrated in tertiary PR and professional inservice courses. First, OJ may provide a meta-language and evidence basis for planning, framing and evaluating organizational communication and processes that would help PR focus on the frames and drivers of fairness. Second, PR, like OJ, needs a better understanding of power if it is to recognize subtle forms of domination and exercise influence that advances fairness for the most vulnerable. Third, OJ highlights the importance of independence in decision making if those affected by decisions are to trust decision makers and perceive decisions to be fair. Stakeholder mistrust limits PR agency and capacity to advance fairness, but independence would represent a profound shift from the existing paradigm of relations that PR practitioners have with organizations, as employees or consultants. The article introduces PR to OJ’s impressive body of empirical evidence from organizations, and sophisticated theories and models to frame and clarify concepts for advancing practice and scholarship of fairness. Although it may be tempting to apply the power of procedural and interactional justice effects to influence perceptions of fairness and reactions to privately determined decisions, the article cautions that stakeholders will best be served where PR ensures that multiple voices are heard and acted on in matters of distribution.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Perceptions of fairness have frequently been shown to lead to trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2046147X11435081">Lewicki et al., 2005</xref>) and a range of positive emotional, attitudinal and behavioural responses in organizations and elsewhere. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2046147X11435081">Bies (2005)</xref> says that people are hardwired to react negatively to injustice, and perceptions of unfairness have been shown to increase stress and diminish cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-2046147X11435081">Van den Bos, 2005</xref>). Because perceptions of fairness are central to satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-2046147X11435081">Van den Bos, 2005</xref>) and people’s evaluation of situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-2046147X11435081">Tyler and Blader, 2003</xref>), and public relations (PR) is often concerned with reputation and perceptions, PR practitioners have a prima facie interest in understanding the way people perceive fairness. With a better understanding of what people find to be fair and unfair, we may better understand perceptions and anticipate reactions to organizations and their decisions.</p>
<p>For more than four decades the organizational justice (OJ) field has been concerned with understanding what people perceive to be fair, as distinct from asserting fairness according to a normative set of principles or ethical rule system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2046147X11435081">Fortin, 2008</xref>). The mostly quantitative and largely experimental OJ field has produced a large body of literature describing and explaining what people find to be fair and unfair, and how they react in a range of conditions and circumstances:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Organizational justice is one of the most popular and promising fields in organizational behaviour. The explanatory power of the justice framework has been shown in numerous contexts, and fairness helps to explain a host of reactions that are of interest for organizations. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2046147X11435081">Fortin, 2008</xref>: 119)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2046147X11435081">Nel (2001)</xref> explored the development of a model of PR management based on OJ, and argued that commitment to long-term relationships is dependent on publics perceiving organizations as treating them fairly. But otherwise there has been little explicit and deliberate connection of the PR and OJ fields.</p>
<p>The article brings together two established fields of organizational study in a search for potential benefit and understanding. There are no templates for such analyses, and a single article is unable to provide an exhaustive examination of either the fields or the potential for benefit. The first part of the article reviews OJ largely from an instrumental organizational standpoint and finds that the enormous body of empirically derived OJ theory provides a predictive guide to behavioural reactions and likely consequences of organizational policy, intervention and communication. PR practitioners and theory might benefit from an understanding of OJ, especially the ways that a range of stakeholders may perceive fairness. But appearing fair is not the same as being fair. The second part of the article reflects on critical views of OJ and finds parallels with the scholarship of PR. A review of the recent OJ literature reveals questions about the contribution that OJ has made to organizations, and its failure to address the interests of a range of stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2046147X11435081">Fortin and Fellenz, 2008</xref>). Some argue that although OJ has deepened understanding of the perception of fairness, this understanding has not necessarily been used to make organizations more fair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2046147X11435081">Fortin and Fellenz, 2008</xref>). In particular, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2046147X11435081">Fortin and Felenz’s (2008)</xref> analysis of three dimensions of power in OJ provides valuable insights, and a framework for understanding the role of PR in helping organizations to achieve justice for a range of stakeholders and better organizational outcomes.</p>
<p>The third part of the article uses fairness, power and the psychology of self-interest to reflect on the role of PR and its potential to enhance fairness. It argues that if PR is to enhance fairness for a range of stakeholders it requires a superior understanding of power to achieve organizational influence and discharge it equitably; an attitude of, and systems for, reflection in practice; and authentic as well as perceived independence from both organization and stakeholders. Such a position accords with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2046147X11435081">Leventhal’s (1980)</xref> principles for procedural fairness and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2046147X11435081">Marsh’s (2010)</xref> precepts for reflective PR practice, but achieving independence requires a paradigm shift regarding PR’s position in relation to organizations for which it works. Ultimately the article argues that the current paradigm that positions PR practitioners as paid, biased representatives of organizational senior management could doom the profession indefinitely to stakeholder mistrust, and thus limits its potential contribution to real and perceived fairness.</p>

<title>Organizational justice – distribution, process and interaction considerations</title>
<p>OJ has the potential to contribute an evidence basis to PR communication that many have said PR lacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2046147X11435081">Macnamara, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-2046147X11435081">Simmons and Watson, 2005</xref>). This section describes OJ and suggests that the OJ literature provides an encyclopaedia of insights into people’s reactions and attitudes under different organizational, procedural and interactional conditions. OJ might thus be used by organizations as an instrument for predicting and managing reactions.</p>
<p>The OJ field tends to use the terms justice and fairness interchangeably (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2046147X11435081">Fortin, 2008</xref>) and focuses on studying what people perceive to be fair, rather than normative criteria. Normative justice is concerned with guiding and defining the right action; in the case of PR, normative models explain how it should be practised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2046147X11435081">Nel, 2001</xref>). In OJ, fairness is assumed to be subjective, at least in so far as the same decision or allocation can be perceived fair by some but not by others. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2046147X11435081">Finkel (2001)</xref> distinguished and developed a typology of ‘commonsense’ unfairness that focuses mostly on the perceived appropriateness and inappropriateness of rewards and punishment. Organizational justice theories about the way fairness is perceived differ in their emphasis on aspects of fairness such as cognitive processes, context, social engagement and blame (for a review of theories see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2046147X11435081">Blader and Tyler, 2005</xref>; or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2046147X11435081">Beugre, 2007</xref>), but generally include distributive, procedural and interactional dimensions of justice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2046147X11435081">Nel (2001)</xref> said that if PR is to contribute to justice then all three concepts of justice – distributive, procedural and interactional – need to be included in strategic decision processes.</p>
<sec id="section3-2046147X11435081">
<title>Distributive justice</title>
<p>Early OJ research focused on ways of judging fairness in allocation of resources and outcomes (distributive justice). Three principles that may guide decisions and distribution are an emphasis on equality (where all receive the same), equity (where distribution is based on effort or merit) and distribution based on need. The principle chosen can influence perception of fairness and consequent attitudes and reactions, so it is possible to strategically influence perceptions of, and reactions to, decisions, policy and resource allocation. Perceptions of fairness can also be influenced, without altering the allocation, by advancing frames that offer a particular interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-2046147X11435081">Oliveira and Murphy, 2009</xref>) of distribution principles:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Frames are offered by key stakeholders, such as union leaders and management. One example is that unions often promote equality as a basis for distribution, while management promotes merit-based allocations. In short, justice judgments may not only be changed through evaluating actions and events within a particular normative framework of justice, but may change through frames, ideologies, through influencing or replacing the normative framework itself. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2046147X11435081">Fortin and Fellenz, 2008</xref>: 416)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For PR practitioners an understanding of distributive justice (and related principles such as equity, equality, need, reward and punishment) may help them to become more sensitive to, and strategic in their interactions with, a range of stakeholder perspectives, and to recognize and participate in the framing of fairness. OJ provides a meta-language of fairness that can help PR to reflect on, anticipate and plan its interactions with stakeholders.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-2046147X11435081">
<title>Procedural justice</title>
<p>By the 1980s the focus of OJ research had shifted from distributive to procedural justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2046147X11435081">Colquitt et al., 2005</xref>) and other factors that influence perception of fairness. The ‘fair process effect’ says that people react more positively when they perceive that they have experienced fair treatment, and more negatively when they perceive they have experienced unfair treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-2046147X11435081">Van den Bos et al., 2005</xref>). The fair process effect is important to those with an interest in communication, cooperation and reputation because it highlights the influence of variables – separate from the decision itself – that can be controlled by decision makers. Importantly, ‘being treated fairly goes further than simply receiving a fair outcome. It is often how (in terms of process and interpersonal style) the outcome is received rather than what is received that seems to matter’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2046147X11435081">McColl-Kennedy and Sparks, 2003</xref>: 253).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2046147X11435081">Leventhal (1980)</xref> advanced rules for fairness in procedures used to allocate outcomes that include the need for consistency in implementation, absence of bias, accuracy in information used to inform decisions, the ability to appeal a decision and ethical standards such as the absence of corruption (adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2046147X11435081">Colquitt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2046147X11435081">Jordan et al., 2004</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2046147X11435081">Leventhal, 1980</xref>). These rules, and the research they led to, may provide a valuable framework for reflection on the way PR is practised. One consistent finding in procedural justice research is that allowing people an opinion about a decision enhances judgements of the fairness of the procedure (known as the ‘voice effect’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-2046147X11435081">Van den Bos et al., 1996</xref>). This mirrors a swathe of academic discussion around the organizational and social role of public relations – in the representation of public and private interests, the facilitation or management of voice, and the enhancement or detraction of democracy. Modernist PR literature has advocated that ideal, ethical, two-way symmetrical PR works to ensure that the voices of stakeholders and publics are heard and considered by the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2046147X11435081">Grunig et al., 2002</xref>). Distinct but related explorations into the importance of dialogue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2046147X11435081">Kent and Taylor, 2002</xref>) and relationship management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2046147X11435081">Ledingham, 2006</xref>) have kept symmetry, and cousin concepts such as balance and equality, close to the heart of theorizing about PR. PR theories have moved away from the long dominant symmetry paradigm, and it can be argued that other explorations have nudged at the periphery of perceptions and realities of justice and fairness. Postmodernists such as Holtzhausen have advocated for organizational activism and dissensus, which may place the boundary-spanning PR practitioner in a position of ‘choosing sides and speaking out in the case of what he or she views as an injustice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2046147X11435081">Holtzhausen, 2000</xref>: 108). PR as rhetoric sees the discipline as a ‘contest of multiple voices’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2046147X11435081">Heath, 2009</xref>: 21) and the field is benefitting from deeper and richer exploration in other disciplinary contexts such as anthropology, where PR practitioners are viewed as ‘culture workers’ crossing cultures ‘within and between organizations and communities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2046147X11435081">L’Etang, 2011</xref>:19) and social theory, through the works of Bourdieu, Goffman, Puttnam and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2046147X11435081">Ihlen et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Although PR practitioners might not use the language of ‘fairness’, they frequently exhibit awareness of its importance, for example when they recommend consultation in organizational processes, advise that management listen to stakeholder concerns or inform staff of organizational decisions before external publics.</p>
<p>Thousands of OJ studies over decades contribute an evidence basis for strategy selection that has yielded broadly applicable principles, and also many findings that are highly nuanced. For example OJ studies have also found that in some situations there is a ‘non-instrumental voice effect’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-2046147X11435081">Shapiro and Brett, 2005</xref>: 162), where having a voice, even knowing that nothing you say will influence a decision or outcome, will increase perception of fairness relative to not having a voice. Evidence of the non-instrumental voice effect illustrates that the expression of dissatisfaction or displeasure with a decision can have an intrinsic value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2046147X11435081">Nel, 2001</xref>), and also the potential for those who understand it to increase perceptions of fairness without cost, compromise or effort, beyond allowing people to get something off their chest.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-2046147X11435081">
<title>Interactional justice</title>
<p>Interactional justice has been described as ‘the quality of interpersonal treatment’ in justice that ‘distinguishes a procedure from its enactment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2046147X11435081">Cole, 2004</xref>: 261), including displays of courtesy and respect. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2046147X11435081">Bies and Moag’s (1986)</xref> seminal work on interactional justice argued that communication might be the reason for people feeling unfairly treated even when describing process and outcomes to be fair. Numerous studies have since shown that interactional justice helps us to understand behavioural and attitudinal reactions to decisions and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2046147X11435081">Bies, 2005</xref>), and that interpersonal treatment mediates reactions to negative decisions and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2046147X11435081">Colquitt et al., 2005</xref>). Perceptions of fairness are positively influenced by respectful interpersonal treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2046147X11435081">Buttner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-2046147X11435081">Tepper et al., 1998</xref>) including positive demeanour and explanations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2046147X11435081">Cole, 2004</xref>) and attentive and relaxed style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-2046147X11435081">Sitter, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-2046147X11435081">Simmons (2010)</xref> found that the tone and the content of communication can influence perception of both the fairness of the decision maker and the correctness of decisions. Studies in the application of interactional justice have shown that managers can be trained in interactional justice to produce positive outcomes for employees and organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2046147X11435081">Greenberg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-2046147X11435081">Skarlicki and Latham, 1997</xref>) and that justice is also important in written communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-2046147X11435081">Wenzel, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section6-2046147X11435081">
<title>More justice, or just more cooperation?</title>
<p>Scholars have stressed the potential benefits of understanding the way people form perceptions of fairness in a range of professional contexts including policing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2046147X11435081">Anderson and Giles, 2005</xref>), sport refereeing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-2046147X11435081">Simmons, 2010</xref>), management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-2046147X11435081">Skarlicki and Latham, 2005</xref>) and teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2046147X11435081">Gordon and Fay, 2010</xref>). With an understanding of the way those affected by decisions perceive fairness, professionals can manage decisions and communication in ways that enhance perceptions of fairness, which in turn improves cooperation and compliance. Where people willingly accept decisions and voluntarily adhere to rules, individual decision makers experience less stressful interactions, higher motivation to cooperate, and lower surveillance and prosecution costs, making organizations more effective and efficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-2046147X11435081">Wenzel and Jobling, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Studies show that when managers practice process fairness, their employees respond in ways that bolster the organisation’s bottom line both directly and indirectly. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2046147X11435081">Brockner, 2006</xref>: 123)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When discussing the contribution of OJ, scholars have tended to focus on the perspective of the professional or organization making decisions, rather than stakeholders affected by the decisions or the intrinsic value of treating people fairly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-2046147X11435081">Tankebe, 2009</xref>). Less frequently articulated is the suggestion that OJ research has been used to serve managers, more than it has been used to make organizations more fair.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>OJ research has been preoccupied with managing employee justice perceptions to counter negative attitudinal and behavioural reactions to managerial actions and organizational systems. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2046147X11435081">Fortin and Fellenz, 2008</xref>: 417)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2046147X11435081">Brockner (2006)</xref> gives an example of a paradox, involving two companies downsizing, that PR practitioners will understand. Company A spends much on tangible benefits for those laid off, such as large severance packages and continued health insurance, yet the company becomes embroiled in legal defence of unfair dismissal claims and suffers heavily from poor productivity and low morale among employees kept on. In contrast, Company B gives little severance pay and spends little on tangible benefits, but the company recovers quickly and performance is soon enhanced. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2046147X11435081">Brockner (2006)</xref> explains the different outcomes as the result of different approaches to communication and process. Managers at company A gave minimal information, awkwardly, and never explained the reasons for the layoffs or choice of who would stay. At company B senior managers repeatedly explained the strategy behind the layoffs, answered questions, and expressed care for the employees. In an important critique of the OJ field, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2046147X11435081">Fortin and Fellenz (2008)</xref> refer to paradoxes of this type as ‘hypocrisies of fairness’, and they have called for OJ to be more reflexive and accommodating of a range of interests.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We argue that both organizational justice research and the managerial practices it informs lack reflexivity. This manifests itself in two possible hypocrisies of fairness.</p>
<p>Managers may apply organizational justice knowledge but fail to increase the actual levels of fairness in employment relations. Researchers, on the other hand, may claim to promote fairness through their work while actually providing managers with tools that enable or even encourage them to feed the hypocrisy of fairness identified above. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2046147X11435081">Fortin and Fellenz, 2008</xref>: 415)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2046147X11435081">Fortin and Fellenz (2008)</xref> say that OJ has helped organizations to manage perceptions of the fairness of change processes and controversial human resource actions such as layoffs, but that OJ’s focus on stakeholders’ subjective perceptions of fairness, without consideration of the moral and other implications of its use, may help to perpetuate injustice in organizations rather than make them more fair. The ethicality of organizations A and B may be explored more fully elsewhere, but both OJ and PR would be enhanced by reflecting on and confronting such apparent hypocrisies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2046147X11435081">Fawkes (2010</xref>: 215) suggests that the dominant discourse in PR is ‘celebratory, defensive and lacking in self- criticism’. She has advanced the importance of addressing the ‘shadow’ of PR, making explicit and reflecting on the ethics of what is so often kept private, as well as that which the profession readily makes public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2046147X11435081">Fawkes, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The description of OJ as a field serving narrow interests resembles critical analyses of PR over the past two decades. Some have argued that PR is a necessary component and instrument of the dominant coalition in organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2046147X11435081">Grunig et al., 2002</xref>) and that PR makes a very effective contribution to ‘capitalism and powerful economic producers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2046147X11435081">Berger, 2005</xref>: 6). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2046147X11435081">L’Etang (1997</xref>: 34) said the outputs of PR may be viewed as ‘suspect’, ‘self-serving’ impressions that smooth relations ‘with stakeholders on behalf of certain interest groups’. Important here is that the two fields of practice and knowledge under study – OJ and PR – both have the capacity to influence behaviours and attitudes for a range of stakeholders, but are seen to have been appropriated by, and to entrench the interests of, those with the power and resources to pay. Both OJ and PR have developed skills and techniques that are frequently, perhaps routinely, employed to smooth and pacify relations with stakeholders, irrespective of the morality of distribution of resources and adversity. Harmony has been advanced as a moral purpose for PR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-2046147X11435081">Seib and Fitzpatrick, 1995</xref>), but harmony is inadequate as a higher order goal where playing fields are not level, and debates concerning the ethics and moral purpose of PR have moved on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2046147X11435081">Fawkes, 2010</xref>). Both OJ and PR have been criticized for lack of reflexivity and failing to address issues of power in theory and practice. So what of justice? What might OJ contribute to PR, or PR to OJ, that helps advance fairness? Some answers are suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2046147X11435081">Nel (2001)</xref>, and a theme common to the critiques of OJ and PR referred to above, power.</p>

<title>Acquiring and discharging influence reflexively</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2046147X11435081">Nel (2001</xref>: 34) focuses on strategic decision processes in organizations. He says that to contribute to justice, PR needs to ensure organizations provide distributive and procedural and interactional fairness. Without all three dimensions of fairness, strategic publics are unlikely to see the organization as ‘trustworthy and just’. Without trust, commitment to organization decisions and goals will be low. ‘In this whole process public relations must be seen as neutral, trustworthy and treating strategic publics with respect’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2046147X11435081">Nel, 2001</xref>: 34). But <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2046147X11435081">Nel’s (2001)</xref> model requires both internal organizational influence, and insight and mechanisms to advance the interests of external stakeholders, that are beyond the present norms for PR and their organizations. Further, as employee or consultant to organizations, PR may be unable to achieve the real or perceived neutrality required for stakeholder trust. For PR to acquire organizational influence and then use that influence to advance fairness for organizations and their stakeholders, there are several interrelated challenges. They are addressed here as the challenges of power, reflexivity and independence/trust.</p>
<sec id="section8-2046147X11435081">
<title>The challenge of power</title>
<p>An understanding of OJ, and critiques of OJ, may help PR to reflect on its place in the messiness of organizational life, and its contributions to fair outcomes for stakeholders. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2046147X11435081">Fortin and Fellenz (2008)</xref> argue the need to understand and engage with organizational power relations both in theory and practice. They stress the importance of developing awareness of invisible manifestations of the exercise of power and the transcendence of particular interests. Their calls for better understanding of power parallel some critical and postmodern views of PR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2046147X11435081">Berger, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2046147X11435081">L’Etang, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2046147X11435081">Motion and Weaver, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-2046147X11435081">Spicer, 1997</xref>). If PR is to influence strategic organizational decisions and advance justice in allocation of resources and stakeholder outcomes, PR may have to better account for power in its theory, while its practitioners need to ‘become more astute political players and engaged activists’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2046147X11435081">Berger, 2005</xref>: 6). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-2046147X11435081">Spicer (1997)</xref> suggested that PR professionals view organizations in terms of a political metaphor to help them understand how power and conflict operate in organizations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2046147X11435081">Fortin and Fellenz (2008)</xref> use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2046147X11435081">Lukes’s (2005)</xref> three dimensions of power to account for the concept of power as it applies to OJ. They explain three dimensions (‘responding’, ‘preventing’ and ‘shaping’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2046147X11435081">Fortin and Fellenz, 2008</xref>: 420) that are readily applied to the theory and routine practice of PR. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2046147X11435081">Fortin and Fellenz’s (2008)</xref> analysis and framework provides insights that help both fields to recognize and better understand both visible and invisible manifestations of power and its consequences.</p>
<p>The first dimension of power focuses on ‘observable conflict in decision-making’, where groups take part in ‘open discussion and struggle’ in their competition for power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2046147X11435081">Fortin and Fellenz, 2008</xref>: 419). The observability of the first dimension applies to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2046147X11435081">Holtzhausen and Voto’s (2002)</xref> postmodern views of PR involving positive dissensus and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-2046147X11435081">Moloney’s (2005)</xref> pluralist view of PR as the ‘mass-mediated “voice” or “shout” of organizations and groups, or sometimes of only one person, struggling for advantage in a competitive world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-2046147X11435081">Moloney, 2005</xref>: 552). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2046147X11435081">Fortin and Fellenz (2008)</xref> describe the more subtle ‘shaping’ of perceptions of justice and the need for organizations to ‘respond’ to employee expectations of distributive, procedural and informational injustice. PR is accustomed to practising communication with employees and managing impressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2046147X11435081">Goffman, 1959</xref>) that support the convenient assumption that ‘if people think they are being treated fairly, then they are treated fairly’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2046147X11435081">Fortin and Fellenz, 2008</xref>: 420). The idea that ‘if no concerns about justice are voiced, justice researchers and practitioners may assume there is no injustice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2046147X11435081">Fortin and Fellenz, 2008</xref>: 420) is familiar to observers of PR, and adds weight to the suggestion that it is the role of PR to actively represent less powerful voices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2046147X11435081">Holtzhausen and Voto, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2046147X11435081">Lukes’s (2005)</xref> second dimension of power is less overt, ‘it makes best sense to see some ways of averting both conflict and grievance through the securing of consent as a further dimension of power’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2046147X11435081">Lukes, 2005</xref>: 111). It includes agenda-setting strategies that highlight or exclude issues to be discussed, and the ability to control what is decided. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2046147X11435081">Fortin and Fellenz (2008</xref>: 422) describe ‘preventing’, where power differentials may prevent staff from responding negatively to procedures or outcomes they perceive to be unfair, or where ‘options and alternatives that reflect the needs of non-participants may be suppressed’. Agenda setting and framing strategies are the bread and butter of many PR practitioners as they position their organizations and manage issues into the most favourable frame for internal and external publics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2046147X11435081">Hallahan, 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-2046147X11435081">Simmons and Walsh (2010</xref>: 15) recently advanced the utility to PR of reflection on the ‘habits’ of ethical communicators. The habits include exploring the complexity of issues, presenting information with concern for distortion, preference for public over private motivations and actively encouraging the voicing of opposing viewpoints. For individual practitioners and the PR profession, the acquisition of such habits would require awareness, the breaking of old habits, the courage to provide unwelcome advice to clients and seniors, and skills in persuasion. OJ and principles such as voice provide a guide to what is important, but power-sharing and justice require commitment and determination.</p>
<p>The third dimension of power is tacit, discursive, and involves an unconscious interplay between society and human bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2046147X11435081">Lukes, 2005</xref>). Importantly, the third dimension of ‘power as domination’ is not recognized by the actors themselves and requires the imputation of interest by a third party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2046147X11435081">Lukes, 2005</xref>: 146). This dimension involves shaping the conception of issues and ‘influencing the wants of others’ with subtle strategies such as ‘creation of social myths and use of language and symbols’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2046147X11435081">Fortin and Fellenz, 2008</xref>: 420): again, these activities reflect the core work of PR in its use of persuasion and rhetoric to shape discourse and behaviours. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2046147X11435081">Fortin and Fellenz’s (2008</xref>: 423) parallel dimension of ‘shaping’ involves management’s subtle manipulation of employees’ conceptualization and understanding of fairness, and acting as potential ‘norm setters’, which also reflects the role of organizational PR as an active contributor to culture in organizations.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2046147X11435081">Lukes’s (2005)</xref> power model, and the organizational interpretation offered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2046147X11435081">Fortin and Fellenz (2008)</xref>, may provide PR with a framework needed to address calls for PR to engage with the theory and practice realities of organizational power. It provides a useful framework for raising practitioner awareness of various visible and invisible manifestations of power. Awareness, of course, does not necessarily equate to influence in decision making, but must surely raise the capacity for PR to influence the fairness of decisions and outcomes for different stakeholders in organizations. Scholars may play a role in the explication of abstract models, providing cases and developing strategies that help the profession to reflect on and advance the interests of a range of organizational stakeholders, and better deal with the many manifestations of power.</p>

<title>The challenge of reflexivity</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2046147X11435081">Nel’s (2001)</xref> contention that all three concepts of justice – distributive, procedural and interactional – need to be included if PR is to contribute to justice is based in a Rawlsian notion that where there is inequity the inequity should advantage the disenfranchised and vulnerable (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2046147X11435081">Nel, 2001</xref>). Important here is that PR helps an organization implement processes that lead to more equal allocation of resources and adversity. In this regard PR may have more to offer than it will receive from OJ. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2046147X11435081">Fortin and Fellenz (2008</xref>: 430) have criticized OJ research for its narrow focus on subjective judgements of justice with a ‘managerialist bias in formulating its research questions’. They say that managerial practices informed by OJ lack reflexivity and have called for research that combines the subjectivities of OJ research with normative conceptions of justice. PR has been dominated by a focus on organizational concerns, but calls to better reflect on and advocate for the concerns of a range of stakeholders are well established in the PR literature. Most recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2046147X11435081">Marsh (2010)</xref> has argued for and articulated a framework of ‘precepts’ for PR reflexivity that advance understanding of the interests of stakeholders and society.

<p>PR has developed proprietary and non-proprietary blueprints for reflective practice, including stakeholder voice and obtaining a view from the outside, that are constantly being trialled and adapted across the profession for a range of reasons and purposes. But the implementation is sporadic and more often motivated by organizational expediencies than justice for stakeholders. Textbook PR has often extolled mutuality and symmetry with stakeholders, but PR is entrenched in a paradigm of employment and consultancy that means it can never cast off its real and perceived bias towards organizational interests.</p>
<p>This bias presents an enduring problem for the profession that is often overlooked in discussion of PR’s aspirations and capacity to mediate effectively between organizations and stakeholders. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2046147X11435081">Nel (2001)</xref>, fairness, neutrality and trust in PR are interrelated. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2046147X11435081">Leventhal’s (1980)</xref> rule of impartiality for procedural fairness may help PR to better understand the way it is perceived by stakeholders. People are unlikely to trust that decisions affecting them are fair if they feel the entity making the decision has an interest in the decision. PR may find it difficult to advocate effectively for stakeholders without their trust, and almost impossible to achieve outcomes that are perceived to be fair.

<title>The challenge of independence and trust</title>
<p>In their review of the role of trust in the OJ literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2046147X11435081">Lewicki et al. (2005)</xref> report that there is a strong relationship between trust and justice, that fairness has frequently been shown to be an antecedent of trust, and also that trust is multidimensional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2046147X11435081">Lewicki et al., 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2046147X11435081">Kazoleas and Teven (2009</xref>: 23) examined measurement, methodology and conceptualization of trust and PR, and they distinguish between the often studied ‘dimensions of the perception of trust’ and the less studied ‘antecedents for the possibility of trust to exist’. They discuss antecedents of trust that include individual differences in recipients’ willingness to trust, such as the propensity for cynicism, organizational differences such as stability and responsiveness to stakeholders, and social-/cultural-level differences, where some groups are less trusting or engaged due to racial or other characteristics of the source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2046147X11435081">Kazoleas and Teven, 2009</xref>). Lind (2002) has argued at the interpersonal level that the judgments of fair treatment influence our willingness to trust authority figures, and that fair treatment includes perceptions of characteristics of the source.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2046147X11435081">Lewicki et al. (2005)</xref> show that most research on fairness as antecedent of trust has considered interactional aspects of fair treatment such as displays of caring, and aspects of procedural fairness that include voice, consistency and ethicality. The perception of impartiality is one of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2046147X11435081">Leventhal’s (1980)</xref> rules of procedural fairness, but it has been less studied. If perception of fairness and willingness to trust are related, and public relations is concerned with building trust among stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2046147X11435081">Kazoleas and Teven, 2009</xref>) then perceptions of impartiality (which is perceived as unfair) should be an important consideration for PR and organizations in their interactions with stakeholders:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Constituents would certainly be more likely to listen more attentively to an organization who they believe has their best interests at heart than to one who they think have ulterior motives. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2046147X11435081">Kazoleas and Teven, 2009</xref>:24)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>PR generally recognizes the relationship between neutrality and trust, and often takes great care to have its communication, such as news releases, presented to the public by a third, more neutral party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2046147X11435081">Linning, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-2046147X11435081">Moloney (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-2046147X11435081">Simmons and Walsh (2010)</xref> have argued that PR is disliked and stigmatized in many countries where it is practised in large part because of its advocacy of the special interests of those who pay them. ‘(A)s long as people hold a deep-seated preference for public motivations over private, public relations will not be liked’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-2046147X11435081">Simmons and Walsh, 2010</xref>: 18). PR is ‘popularly regarded as working in the interests of its clients’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-2046147X11435081">Weaver and Motion, 2002</xref>: 328), is often synonymous with spin, deception and incomplete truths, and ‘most people do not like it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-2046147X11435081">Moloney, 2006</xref>: 1). Journalists hold, and express, negative perceptions of PR professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-2046147X11435081">Spicer, 1993</xref>); practitioners are reluctant to refer to themselves as PR professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2046147X11435081">De Bussy and Wolf, 2009</xref>); and in scholarship it is accepted that PR lacks respect in the academy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2046147X11435081">Cheney and Christensen, 2001</xref>: 168). At many levels, PR has a PR problem.</p>
<p>Research into the psychology of self-interest suggests that people are right not to trust that they will get a fair or neutral outcome from PR people negotiating or communicating on behalf of an organization that is paying them. People tend consciously and unconsciously to justify and favour outcomes that will lead to their personal gain over equitable distributions. If PR feels that one outcome is more likely to help them keep an account or strengthen a beneficial relationship then that self-interest is likely to prejudice their efforts:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>fairness considerations may become subordinate to the inclination to enhance the self. In other words, when reacting to advantageous inequity under conditions of self-threat, the enjoyment that people may derive from adhering to fairness principles may give way to the more immediate positive self-affirmation that receiving a relatively good outcome entails. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2046147X11435081">Loseman et al., 2009</xref>: 19)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Where independence and impartiality are paramount, other institutions take great care to establish some distance and protocols that enhance independence and perception of independence. For example, parliaments set up separate judiciaries and sports use independent umpires with distinct uniforms and tribunals. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2046147X11435081">Bazerman et al. (1997)</xref> investigated independence in the financial auditing of clients, where the resources, expectations and imperatives for independence are extremely high. They reported that even with the best will, unconscious and unintended bias towards retaining accounts and maintaining good client relationships make independence impossible.</p>
<p>As argued, PR could benefit from real and perceived independence from organizations and organizational decision making to support its role advancing fairness, but this would require a radical rethink of its role and positioning. Certainly the modernist symmetry model advocates a ‘professional perspective of balancing private and public interests’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2046147X11435081">Grunig, 2001</xref>: 28) but the concepts of independence, impartiality and fairness require more than balance. They require an element of distance that is difficult to reconcile with the paid employee or consultant role, but that may be worth exploring as a factor in deliberations about organizational decision processes and planning for the PR profession.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>PR scholarship has always drawn on many disciplines. One well-established field that has previously featured minimally in the study and conceptualization of PR is OJ. This article has examined some of the potential contributions that OJ might make to PR. There is no guidebook for conducting analysis of this kind. The article reviews some important OJ concepts and provides subjective analysis and interpretation of their utility to PR scholarship and practice. Future studies might begin with important PR concepts and theories and then follow with analysis of their application to OJ.</p>
<p>The analysis has found that engagement with OJ may very well contribute to the scholarship and practice of PR, and also that OJ could learn from PR’s longstanding interest in stakeholders. The main contributions to PR are presented here as three recommendations.</p>
<p>First is that OJ may provide a meta-language for planning, framing and evaluating organizational processes that may help PR to better conceptualize, plan and reflect on activities and communication. In tertiary courses and inservicing, training in OJ can contribute to theory and practice of PR. For researchers, too, OJ may provide new frameworks and language that aids evaluation of PR at interpersonal, organizational and societal levels.</p>
<p>Second is that PR, like OJ, needs a better understanding of power if it is to participate effectively to influence important organizational decisions, either as a member of a dominant coalition or by some other means. OJ provides ample evidence and powerful reminders of the importance of enabling all stakeholders a voice. PR needs a better understanding of various manifestations of power, discussed here as ‘responding’, ‘preventing’ and ‘shaping’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2046147X11435081">Fortin and Fellenz, 2008</xref>) if its antennae are to recognize the potential for insidious and invisible forms of domination. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2046147X11435081">Lukes’s (2005)</xref> power model provides a very useful tool for probing the ways PR influences fairness. Researchers may have an important role to play in analysing, and sometimes imputing, the interests of organizations and their stakeholders, who may be blind to the dominance they experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2046147X11435081">Lukes, 2005</xref>). PR must be able to recognize domination if it is to use its influence to advance fairness for the benefit of many stakeholders, especially the most voiceless and vulnerable.</p>
<p>The third point highlighted by the analysis concerns the real and perceived positioning of PR in relation to those who pay the wages. PR may adopt a reflective attitude and systems for reflexivity, but its effectiveness is diminished if its decisions and mediation are not trusted. Although OJ may have much to learn from PR’s longstanding interest in stakeholder perspectives, OJ highlights the importance of independence in decision making, if those affected by decisions are to perceive the decision to be fair. Within the profession PR may discuss whom practitioners really serve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2046147X11435081">Berger, 2005</xref>), but from the outside PR is assumed to serve narrow interests. Research into the psychology of self-interest suggests that external stakeholder scepticism is justified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2046147X11435081">Bazerman et al., 1997</xref>), and that unless PR can somehow extricate itself from organizations to establish some authentic independence, PR is doomed to stakeholder mistrust indefinitely. Independence would represent a profound shift from the current, traditional paradigm of relations that PR practitioners have with organizations, as employees or consultants. But OJ tells us that the connection between neutrality, trust and fairness runs deep.</p>
<p>One of the most important findings is that the two fields are similar insofar as they appear to have capacity to influence improved outcomes for a range of stakeholders, but both OJ and PR have been criticized for having been appropriated by the powerful, and those with the capacity to pay. Scholars in both fields are questioning the balance of the interests served, articulating the tendency to focus on perceived fairness rather than real benefit for a range of stakeholders, and evaluating foundational assumptions and ways forward.</p>
<p>PR has a coherent global infrastructure for scholarship, and a much more coherent professional entity than OJ, which manifests as a dispersed but connected global network of academics and communities of academics, often associated with organizational behaviour and psychology. Given the organization of the two fields, any collaboration on the issues PR and OJ share in common is most likely to begin in scholarship. To any such collaboration OJ provides an impressive body of empirical evidence from organizations, and sophisticated theories and models to frame and clarify concepts for advancing practice and scholarship of fairness. Some of these theories and models have been discussed in this article. Although it may be tempting to apply the power of procedural and interactional justice effects to influence perceptions and reactions to privately determined decisions, stakeholders will best be served where PR ensures that multiple voices are heard and acted on in matters of distribution.</p>
