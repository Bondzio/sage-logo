<abstract>
<p>Attitudes towards research are significant indictors that connect practice to research and enhance nursing evidence-based practice. This correlational study was conducted to assess the attitudes of Jordanian nursing students towards nursing research. A self-administered questionnaire received from 612 senior nursing students at one of the largest universities in Amman, Jordan, was carried out. The results showed that nursing students had positive attitudes towards research. The majority of them believed that research has a role in developing the nursing profession, and that nurses must learn how to read and utilise research findings in practice. The majority also realised the value of research in improving quality of care, expressed the need to learn about nursing research, appreciated the necessity of research for the development of the nursing profession and had a willingness to conduct nursing research in clinical settings. Four attitude domains were identified, including research abilities, usefulness of research, personal interest in research and using research in clinical practice. The highest scores were observed on items related to ‘usefulness of research’ and the lowest were related to ‘research abilities’. Providing students with information and strengthening their research abilities might enhance their positive feelings and increase their involvement in research activities after graduation.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1744987110379782" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Creating interest in nursing research is a priority for nurse educators. Nursing research is interesting, exciting and essential to the growth of the nursing profession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1744987110379782">Restas, 2000</xref>). Therefore, understanding nursing research is expected to improve patient care and assist nurses to demonstrate themselves as valuable members of the health care team.</p>
<p>The course ‘Introduction to Nursing Research’ is a mandatory one in most nursing baccalaureate curricula. The aim of these courses is to encourage students’ enthusiasm about nursing research, to increase their desire to participate in data collection and to be prepared to implement research findings in practice. Equipped with a strong foundation in nursing research, students will be able to evaluate nursing research, assess the findings for application to clinical settings and be prepared to assist in conducting nursing research. These goals are consistent with the goals identified by professional nursing associations that recommend including teaching nursing research in nursing curricula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987110379782">American Nurses Association [ANA], 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744987110379782">International Council of Nurses [ICN], 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987110379782">Canadian Nurses Association, 2002</xref>). The education of nursing students is a key element in the improved utilisation of nursing research into clinical practice. Until recently, the general public has had little understanding of nursing research. Even among health professionals, there is little awareness that nurses conduct research. Nursing research is frequently viewed as part of medical research. Therefore, nursing researchers are not well recognised as independent researchers and, consequently, this may contribute to negative attitudes towards nursing research.</p>
<p>Nursing research courses are introduced at the undergraduate level in nearly every baccalaureate nursing program at the national, regional and international levels. The National League for Nurses has recommended that all baccalaureate programs include research content in their curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1744987110379782">NLN, 1992</xref>). This includes nursing practice, nursing education and nursing administration. There have been international studies in Europe and the United States that addressed nursing research from different perspectives. Some of these studies examined the students’ attitudes towards nursing research (Padilla and de Carvalho, 1993; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744987110379782">Morse et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744987110379782">Kajermo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987110379782">Bjorkstrom et al., 2003</xref>). However, the Jordanian literature has a dearth of studies that address research practice and utilisation. To our knowledge, no previous study in Jordan addresses attitudes of Jordanian nursing students towards nursing research. This study was conducted to fill that gap and to add to our knowledge and information about nursing education needs in relation to nursing research. This is particularly important at a time where efforts are being made through the recently established <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744987110379782">Jordanian Nursing Council (2008)</xref> to raise the standards of nursing practice and education in Jordan. The information from the study also contributes to the international agenda for promoting nursing research. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the attitudes of Jordanian nursing students towards the conduct and utilisation of nursing research. The specific aims were to:

</list></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1744987110379782"><title>Literature review</title>
<p>Research in nursing focuses on the study of the nursing profession and includes historical, ethical and policy issues. Goals for conducting research include the improvement of nursing care, credibility of the nursing profession, accountability for nursing practice and documentation of the cost effectiveness of nursing care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744987110379782">Nieswiadomy, 2008</xref>). Research has several benefits: knowledge generation, occasional cost savings (e.g. healthier workforce), better decision-making and the development of research skills of individuals and others. Investment in research is important in preparing the next generation of nurse leaders. This investment should start at the baccalaureate level and continue to the doctoral or postdoctoral levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744987110379782">Thorpe and Smutko, 1998</xref>; Blenskinsop, 2003).</p>
<p>Despite the many benefits of research, barriers exist to nurses’ involvement. Barriers include lack of knowledge of nursing research, negative attitudes towards nursing research, inadequate means of disseminating nursing research findings, lack of institutional support, lack of confidence in research ability and difficulty in transferring research to practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987110379782">Funk et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744987110379782">Kajermo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744987110379782">Parohoo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1744987110379782">Retsas, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744987110379782">Parahoo et al. (2000)</xref> discussed research utilisation and attitudes towards research in Northern Ireland and reported that the top barrier was that the nurses did not feel they had the authority to change patient care procedures. Previous studies identified several actions that may contribute to overcoming barriers of nursing research utilisation, such as providing resources, increasing release time for participation in research, continuing education on the research process and creating positions for nurse researchers in clinical settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744987110379782">Kajermo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1744987110379782">Retsas, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744987110379782">Mattila and Eriksson, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Research courses are now an accepted part of nursing curricula. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1744987110379782">Radjenovic and Chally (1998)</xref> indicated that 90% of baccalaureate programs accredited by the NLN had a formal research course. The goals of teaching research are to foster the development of cognitive and professional skills, with emphasis on critical thinking and analysis and utilisation of research findings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744987110379782">Harrison et al. (1991)</xref> questioned the effectiveness of a traditional research curriculum in preparing baccalaureate nursing students to be competent research consumers. Students frequently find it difficult to appreciate nursing research. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1744987110379782">Radjenovic and Chally (1998)</xref> concluded that baccalaureate students are not usually prepared to critique research studies skilfully and determine their potential use in professional practice.</p>
<p>Another issue that influences students’ involvement in nursing research is their attitude towards research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1744987110379782">Owens and Kelly, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744987110379782">Hitchcock and Murphy, 1999</xref>). Previous studies addressed that issue and found that a number of factors may contribute to positive attitudes among students, which include involvement in research activities, participating in data collecting and introducing research concepts in nursing education in earlier levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1744987110379782">Owens and Kelly, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744987110379782">Hitchcock and Murphy, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The literature emphasised the importance of understanding the nursing students’ attitudes towards research. The body of knowledge is growing in terms of understanding how students are educated in research and options available to improve students’ involvement in nursing research. The current study adds to our knowledge, and further emphasises a new perspective through examining this issue among the Arabian nursing students, which has never been reported on in the literature before. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine attitudes of Jordanian nursing students towards nursing research.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1744987110379782"><title>Design</title>
<p>The study utilised a descriptive design in which data were collected at one point of time and the relationship between attitudes and all other variables of the study described and examined. Data were collected using self-report questionnaire from senior nursing students in the largest public university in Jordan. An announcement was placed on the students’ advertisements board in the faculty of nursing. The announcement included information related to the purpose of the study, inclusion criteria, contact information, and directions on how to obtain and return the questionnaires. Those who expressed interest in participation were directed to the coordinator’s office at the university where a research assistant was available to provide them with a self-stamped envelope and the questionnaires. The participants were reminded that they could either send it to the mailing address or bring it back to the coordinator’s office. The package included two self-report questionnaires with a front page presenting the purpose of the study, its significance and a note confirming the anonymity and confidentiality of the study. The package presented to students was all in the Arabic language. A total of 900 packages were distributed and 612 were returned, giving a 68% response rate. Prior to data collection, the study was approved by the Scholarship and Research Committee at the faculty of nursing and the Deanship of the Academic Research at the university.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1744987110379782"><title>Sample and setting</title>
<p>A convenience sample of 612 senior nursing students filled out and returned the self-report questionnaire in addition to the demographic profile. The setting selected to recruit the sample aimed at enhancing the heterogeneity of the respondents as the students in this university come from different cultural, geographical, socio-economic and ethnic backgrounds. The inclusion criteria included: (1) being senior nursing students; (2) being registered in the semester when the data were collected; and (3) completing the nursing research course.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1744987110379782"><title>Measurements</title>
<p>Data were collected using an Arabic version of the self-report questionnaire. A translation and validation of the translation was carried out by linguistic professionals for the terminology and pilot testing using a sample of 15 nursing students conducted to check for understanding, clarity and time required for filling out the questionnaire. The instrument was guided by the conceptual framework of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987110379782">Funk et al. (1991)</xref> relating to barriers to research utilisation. Items also were developed utilising the literature reviewed relating to nursing research definitions, functions and nurses’ role in research. The scale consisted of 18 items. Students were asked to identify their attitudes towards nursing research on a Likert scale. Responses ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). The higher score indicates positive attitudes.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1744987110379782"><title>Reliability and validity of attitudes towards the nursing research scale</title>
<p>The development of the scale involved several steps. Firstly, the authors developed the scale utilising the conceptual framework of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987110379782">Funk et al. (1991)</xref> related to barriers to research utilisation. Then the scale was sent to four expert nurse researchers to review the items and the subscales. Then the investigators integrated all the returned comments and the modified version of the scale was sent back to the same expert nurse researchers. After receiving the final comments and integrating them, a pilot testing for the scale was carried out with 25 senior nursing students. Psychometric testing was conducted to test and assure the reliability of the scale. All other comments, such as length of the scale, intelligibility, clarity and level of language, were considered to form the final version of the scale (see the Appendix) that has been used in this study. The scale is formed of 18 items in which the participant is asked to express his attitude towards nursing research on a four-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree).</p>
<p>In this study, the computer program SPSS Windows (version 15) was used to conduct reliability testing and analysis. Reliability testing of the scale showed that the scale has fair to good reliability. The coefficient alphas for the four attitude subscales (research abilities, usefulness of nursing research, personal interest in research and using research in clinical practice), ranged from 0.63 (research abilities) to .76 (using research in clinical practice) with total scale Cronbach’s alpha of 0.74. The standard error of means (SEM) ranged from 2.51 (research abilities) to 2.61 (using research in clinical practice).</p>
<p>Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was also conducted for all the 18 items in the attitude scale to assure the factor component. The results showed that the four-factor model was the most interpretable and accounted for over 46% of the total variance. EFA also showed that the four higher-order factor models had eigenvalues of 4.2 and 1.1, while other factor models had eigenvalues of less than 0.90.</p>

<sec id="sec9-1744987110379782"><title>Demographic characteristics</title>
<p>The sample consisted of students of both genders, where 49% (<italic>n</italic> = 300) were females and 51% (<italic>n</italic> = 312) males. The students were all in their third or fourth year. Students’ ages ranged from 20 to 21 years and the average age was 20.5 years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1744987110379782"><title>Attitudes towards research</title>
<p>In general, the analysis showed that nursing students had positive attitudes towards nursing research. Students had an agreement rate of 75% (using nursing research in clinical practice) to 94% (usefulness of nursing research) in the four main domains of the attitude scale. The low agreement report on the usefulness of nursing research in clinical practice provokes attention to the lack of information related to the use and utilisation of nursing research in clinical areas among nursing students. Another explanation is that the curriculum does not expose nursing students to evidence-based practice that connects research to clinical practice of nursing. However, the descriptive analysis of each domain (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1744987110379782">Table 1</xref>) showed that domain one (research abilities) had the lowest median and mean scores. This indicates that nursing students are not confident in their abilities to conduct nursing research. About 50% of them (<italic>n</italic> = 306) had a score of 8–10 which indicates negative attitudes towards their abilities in nursing research. The other domains and the total score of the attitude scale showed positive attitudes with strongest positive attitude in domain two (usefulness of nursing research).

<p>Exploring the difference between male and female nursing students in relation to attitudes towards nursing research using the Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1744987110379782">Table 2</xref>), the results showed that there was a significant difference between male and females students only in domain three (personal interest in research) with a mean score for females higher than for male students. This indicates that female nursing students do have a higher interest in nursing research than male students. Although all other domains including the total score of the attitude scale showed no significant differences, female nursing students had higher mean score than male students, which indicates a general positive attitude towards nursing research among female nursing students.

<p>Among all the items, nursing students had very positive attitudes ( ≥90% agreement rate) in item 7 (conducting nursing research is necessary for the development of nursing profession) (<italic>n</italic> = 569, 93.0%), item 13 (nursing research improves patient care) (<italic>n</italic> = 558, 92.5%), item 4 (nurses must utilise research findings) (<italic>n</italic> = 565, 92.3%), item 5 (nursing faculties must conduct research in their specialty area) (<italic>n</italic> = 549, 90.0%), and item 8 (nursing research will contribute to the respect for nursing as a profession) (<italic>n</italic> = 548, 90.0%). However, the lowest positive reports of attitudes were observed in item 10 (I will use nursing research after graduation) with an agreement rate of 42.6% (<italic>n</italic> = 351), item 6 (nursing research is irrelevant to patient’s care) with an agreement rate of 43.7% (<italic>n</italic> = 344) and item 2 (it is very difficult to conduct nursing research in the practice area) with an agreement rate of 44.9% (<italic>n</italic> = 337). Students (<italic>n</italic> = 337, 55.1%) also expressed concern over the difficulty of conducting research in the clinical area with 43.6% (<italic>n</italic> = 267) believing that practicing nurses have little opportunity to conduct research. Slightly over half (<italic>n</italic> = 335, 54.8%) believe that it is difficult for nurses to identify researchable nursing problems. The majority (<italic>n</italic> = 442, 72.2%) reported that they understand research terminology and (<italic>n</italic> = 488, 79.8%) reported that they are confident in their ability to participate in research studies.</p>

<p>This study is one of the very few studies assessing nursing students’ attitudes towards nursing research conducted in Jordan and the Arab countries. The main purpose of the study was to explore the attitudes of nursing students towards nursing research. The results showed that students overall had a positive attitude towards nursing research. This positive view is consistent with other previous international studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987110379782">Hundley et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744987110379782">Parahoo, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1744987110379782">Wallin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1744987110379782">Mehrdad et al., 2007</xref>) that found a positive attitude towards nursing research. This correspondence indicates that nursing curricula that include courses in nursing research have a major contribution to positive attitudes towards nursing research. In addition, the mature understanding that these students have of the role of research in improving patient care and advancing the profession needs to be capitalised on so that when they become nurses, their attitudes continue to be positive. The finding is consistent with that of Padilla and de Carvalho (1993), who found that students believed that the scientific method is important to their professional development.</p>
<p>The results also highlighted areas of the research process that are identified as problematic for students starting from identifying researchable problems to the communication of the study results. Therefore, students should be introduced to aspects of the research process earlier in the educational program to capitalise on their awareness of the link between research and patient care. For example, in the first clinical course, students could be introduced to the concept of researchable problems with critical thinking exercises incorporated in which they identify such problems.</p>
<p>The finding that over half of the students (57%) indicated that they would be unlikely to use the research process after graduation is in contrast with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987110379782">Bjorkstrom et al.’s (2003)</xref> findings that 60% of students in their study had expectations of using research sometimes in the future work. In general, students had a more positive attitude about their feelings about research than about their ability to use and apply nursing research. The findings indicate that there might be an urgent need among nursing students to witness nursing evidence-based practice and more involvement in nursing research projects to improve their research skills. Moreover, providing nursing students with additional information and strengthening their research abilities requires modification in nursing curricula to emphasise evidence-based practice and improve nursing students’ research skills, which should be targeted in nursing core courses.</p>
<p>The results of this study also showed that students strongly believe in the usefulness of research and they also have high personal interest in research However, they do not believe strongly in their ability to conduct research. Therefore, instructors need, in their theory and clinical teaching of nursing core courses, to enhance students’ self-confidence in using nursing research in their practice.</p>
<p>Students frequently are unable to appreciate the value of nursing research to their career goals and its applicability to clinical practice. The review of the literature suggests that this is a common problem. Therefore, it is important to take the necessary steps to improve student attitudes towards research. Some of these include integrating research into the curriculum earlier and into all courses. Since the problem of students’ attitudes continues to challenge teachers, the suggested strategies are similar to those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1744987110379782">Spector and Bleeks (1980)</xref> about 30 years ago and yet confirmed by more recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744987110379782">Mattila and Eriksson, 2007</xref>). These strategies include consistency in courses in which students are required to read research papers in a specified area, using research findings in classroom and clinical settings, citing research papers in course bibliographies and creating a role model of researchers among faculty members.</p>
<p>Moreover, a number of studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744987110379782">Mattila and Eriksson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1744987110379782">Mehrdad et al., 2007</xref>) suggested that for nurses to implement research findings in practice, it is necessary that they have positive attitudes towards research, and need enough support and understanding. Nursing students, therefore, need to be well prepared with knowledge and attitudes towards nursing research in their transition from the studentship role into the professional nursing role. Faculty members need to pay attention to students’ perception of the relationship of research to the profession and the nurse’s role in research. Students are cognisant of the potential of research for improving care and believe both faculty members, as well as nurses in general, need to be involved in research. These students appreciate the value of research and the need for nurses to be taught research skills.</p>
<p>In this study, there was no difference between male and female nursing students in their general attitudes towards nursing research. However, in Jordan male nurses form about 40% of total number of nurses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744987110379782">JNC, 2003</xref>). The increased number of male nurses and the lower demand for the male nurse workforce caused an obvious increase in the number of unemployed male nurses. The result was a decision by the Jordan Nursing Council to increase the ratio of male to female nurses in higher education institutions from 30:70 to 50:50. However, in this study gender differences were observed in students’ belief of the usefulness of research, although both male and female nursing students had positive attitudes in all other domains.</p>
<p>Internationally, nurses are expected to take an active part in research and its utilisation. Jordan is considered a significant resource for the nursing workforce in the Arab world. Therefore, preparing nursing students is an important element in ensuring the quality of nursing care, recognition of nursing research and meeting international standards of research in practice. With the wide exchange that is taking place amongst nurses in different countries, it is necessary to expose students as early as possible to the concept of dialoguing and sharing experiences, particularly those presented through research studies. Thus, globalisation and internationalisation of nursing research will be further emphasised and communicated to nurses around the world.</p>
<p>One limitation of this study is that it uses a self-report questionnaire and a convenience sample. Therefore, interpretation and generalisation of the results has to be cautiously and carefully discussed. Another limitation of this study is that the sample was recruited from one university. Although this university is the largest and had students who came from different cultural, socioeconomic and demographic backgrounds, the results would be more informative if more than one university had been included. Another limitation is that the scale is using a four-point Likert scale, which limits the respondents’ choices and causes forced choice variation. This method was also used to recategorise the responses into agree versus disagree.</p>

<sec id="sec12-1744987110379782" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Based on the findings of this study, four research attitude domains were identified: (1) research abilities; (2) usefulness of research; (3) personal interest in research; and (4) using research in clinical practice. The highest scores were observed for items related to the ‘usefulness of research’ domain and the lowest for the ‘research abilities’ domain. The findings, in general, showed that, overall, Jordanian nursing students had a positive attitude towards nursing research.</p>
<p>The study has implications for nurses, health institutions and higher education institutions. Nursing curricula have to emphasise the clinical application of research findings and there should be a connection and collaboration in building a nursing research culture among academics and clinicians. Nursing students in this study reported the need to learn how to apply nursing research and this cannot be achieved without national co-operation between nursing organisations, higher education institutions and nursing faculties. In general, the results of this study recommend stressing the clinical application of research, introducing research concepts early in the nursing program and integrating components of the research process into all other courses.</p>
<p>Since there is limited information in Jordan about this issue, it is recommended that future research be conducted to assess nursing students’ utilisation of nursing research and to investigate proposed strategies that aim at enhancing nursing research development. It is also important to investigate the barriers that hinder utilisation of nursing research in nursing curricula. The positive attitudes of nursing students towards nursing research are optimistic for nursing research in Jordan. It is important to foster positive attitudes towards nursing research among nursing students who will assume the role of the registered nurses after graduation. The transition from studentship to a professional nursing role requires that nurses are well equipped with evidenced-based knowledge and practice that is mainly a product of nursing research. It is expected that with more positive attitudes, nursing research can grow and the quality of nursing care be improved.</p>
