<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> The current incidence and outcomes of meniscal injury have not been quantified in professional athletes.</p>
<p><bold>Purpose:</bold> To describe the incidence, risk, amount of time lost, and effect on performance for isolated meniscal injury in athletes from the National Basketball Association (NBA). Demographic factors predicting the risk of meniscal tears and the effect of injury in return to play were also investigated.</p>
<p><bold>Study Design:</bold> Descriptive epidemiology study.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> A centralized database was queried to identify meniscal injuries occurring in the NBA over 21 seasons. The frequency of injury, time lost, game exposures, and incidence, rate, and risk were calculated. The preinjury and postinjury player efficiency rating (PER) was used to identify changes in player performance.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> We identified 129 isolated meniscal tears in NBA athletes during a 21-season span. From this number, 77 (59.7%) involved the lateral meniscus and 52 (40.3%) the medial meniscus. Injuries occurred more frequently in games. The lateral meniscus had a statistically significant higher injury rate. Both left and right knees were equally affected. The number of days missed for lateral meniscal tears and medial meniscal tears was 43.8 ± 35.7 days and 40.9 ± 29.7 days, respectively, and was not statistically different. There was a significant inverse relationship between age and rate of lateral meniscal tears, with lateral meniscal tears more likely to occur up to age 30 years; beyond that medial meniscal tears were more common. Players with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 25 had a significantly increased risk of meniscal tears compared with players with a BMI less than 25, specifically with an increased risk of lateral meniscal tears. Twenty-five players (19.4%) did not return to play. For those who did, upon returning to competition, there was no statistical change in PER from their preinjury status, and the mean number of seasons completed was 4.1 ± 3.7 seasons.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The lateral meniscus is more frequently torn than the medial meniscus, but there was no difference in the amount of playing time lost. Both right and left knees were equally affected. There was an inverse relationship between age and the rate of lateral meniscal tears. Risk of tears was increased in players having a BMI greater than 25. Injury did not negatively affect playing performance.</p>

<body>
<p>Professional basketball is a highly competitive sport that places great physical stresses on the athlete’s knees. The actions of running, pivoting, cutting, and jumping place the menisci at risk of injury. Baker et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511428601">1</xref></sup> looking at the general population, determined the incidence of isolated meniscal injury resulting in meniscectomy as 61 per 100 000. Medial meniscal tears were also more common at all levels of basketball than lateral meniscal tears. Furthermore, they found that the right knee was injured predominantly more in basketball (at 80%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511428601">1</xref></sup> A study of US male high school basketball injuries from 2005 to 2007 found that the knee was the third most commonly injured body part, representing 10.6% of all injuries. Knee injuries were more likely to occur in competition than in practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546511428601">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>These patterns of knee and meniscal injury are borne out on the professional level. A 17-year surveillance study in the United States National Basketball Association (NBA) found that the knee was the fourth most common site of injury and resulted in the most time lost per injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511428601">6</xref></sup> Specific to this population, Starkey<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511428601">12</xref></sup> found that over a 10-year period, 59% of meniscal tears involved the lateral meniscus. The incidence of meniscal injury in NBA athletes was first examined by Krinsky et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511428601">10</xref></sup> who reported 22 (58%) lateral meniscal injuries and 16 (42%) medial meniscal injuries from 1983 to 1989. However, these data included only injuries from 19 of the 25 NBA teams at the time, thereby not providing a full incidence within the NBA. Furthermore, this study did not separate those tears that were isolated and those that were combined injury tears. Last, the effect that these isolated injuries had on athletic performance was not studied.</p>
<p>There are few reports in the literature focusing on the postoperative function of elite athletes. Hoshikawa et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546511428601">9</xref></sup> reported that although no athlete in their study gave up the sport after meniscectomy, elite athletes had poorer clinical and subjective evaluation results than recreational athletes.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to describe the incidence of isolated lateral and medial meniscal tears in the NBA. Additionally, the effect on the athlete’s playing status, number of days missed, and performance after injury will be evaluated. We will also identify demographic factors that relate to the incidence of meniscal tears.</p>
<sec id="section1-0363546511428601" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The National Basketball Athletic Trainers’ Association (NBATA) maintains a longitudinal database of all injuries and illnesses occurring to NBA players that (1) required physician referral and/or prescription medication, (2) resulted in a practice or game being missed, or (3) caused emergency care to be rendered. These records are based on a standardized, league-wide injury-reporting instrument that is completed by each team’s athletic trainer.</p>
<p>The primary information collected includes the player’s identification number, the specific injury, when and where the injury occurred, the date, activity at the time of injury, and injury mechanism. We also collected data regarding the number of practices and games missed and if surgery was required. The number of practices and number of games missed were summed to yield the number of days missed per episode. Player demographic information (permanent identification code, position, height, weight, age, number of years of playing experience, and number of games and minutes played) was recorded annually.</p>
<sec id="section2-0363546511428601">
<title>Player Efficiency Rating</title>
<p>Players were analyzed the season before injury and the first full season (&gt;75% of games played) after meniscal injury by comparing changes in the player efficiency rating (PER).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511428601">8</xref></sup> Calculated by summing positive performance metrics (eg, points, rebounds, and steals) and subtracting negative measures (eg, turnovers and fouls), the PER is an objective and standardized method of assessing a player’s performance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511428601">3</xref></sup> The PER allows for comparisons of player performance across different seasons. The league average PER is adjusted each year to a value of 15. To minimize the effect of team or playing time variables, the PER is adjusted to a per-minute basis and allocations are made for team pace and playing style to represent a player’s overall team contribution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511428601">8</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546511428601">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Frequencies, descriptive statistics, risk, clinical incidence, and game-related incidence rates were calculated using Microsoft Excel 2010 (Microsoft Inc, Redmond, Washington). <italic>t</italic> tests and linear and binary logistic regression analyses were conducted using SPSS version 17 (SPSS Inc, an IBM Company, Chicago, Illinois). Because of the relatively low number of cases, game-related injury rates were calculated using 10 000 athlete exposures (AE) (1 player appearing in 1 game equals 1 AE) and 100 000 game minutes played; player risk was calculated per 100 player seasons. Because of the lack of a consistent and reliable method of calculating practice and preseason game exposures, incidence rates for participation in these activities were not calculated. The overall frequencies and percentage of meniscal tears for both practices and games were computed.</p>
<p>The .05 α level was used to identify statistical differences. Differences in the number of days missed were analyzed using independent samples <italic>t</italic> test, and differences in the PER via paired samples <italic>t</italic> test. To identify differences in game-related injury rates and risk, injury rate ratios (IRR), relative risk ratios, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We queried the injury database to recall the records of athletes who sustained a meniscal tear during the 21 seasons between 1988-1989 and 2009-2010 (excluding the strike-shortened 1998-1999 season). This study followed 1797 individual athletes who accounted for 8273 athlete-seasons (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546511428601">Table 1</xref>). During our study, 89.8% of the teams were compliant with data reporting.</p>

<p>Of the 22 946 reports submitted, 17 429 (76.0%) were athletic related. Knee (tibiofemoral joint) injuries accounted for 1671 (9.6%) athletic-related conditions. We identified 147 meniscal tears, representing 8.8% of all knee injuries and 0.8% of all athletic injuries reported. Meniscal injuries were incurred by 128 players; 111 (86.7%) had a single incident, 15 (11.7%) sustained 2 tears, and 2 (1.6%) players suffered 3 meniscal tears (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546511428601">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>The lateral meniscus was involved in 87 (59.2%) cases and the medial meniscus in 60 (40.8%) cases. Isolated meniscal injuries occurred in 129 (87.8%) of the cases, and in 18 (12.2%) instances, the tear occurred concurrently with a ligamentous injury, such as anterior cruciate ligament rupture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546511428601">Figure 1</xref>). Of the 129 cases, there were 77 isolated lateral meniscal tears and 52 isolated medial meniscal tears, representing an incidence of 59.7% and 40.3%, respectively.</p>

<p>Injuries to the lateral meniscus resulted in 4033 (59.7%) days missed (cumulative for all players involved), of which 3194 days missed were a result of isolated lateral meniscal tears (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546511428601">Figure 2</xref>). Injuries to the medial meniscus caused 2723 (40.3%) days missed, of which 2087 days missed were a result of isolated medial meniscal tears (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546511428601">Figure 2</xref>). On average, a player with an isolated medial meniscal injury missed 40.9 ± 29.7 days of games and practices. Similarly, a player with an isolated lateral meniscal injury missed 43.8 ± 35.7 game and practice days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546511428601">Figure 2</xref>). The time missed between the 2 injuries was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05). The data included both players who had surgery and those who had nonsurgical treatment. Because of privacy issues and the inherent limitations of the database, the exact number of players who had surgery versus no surgery could not be determined. The total number of actual chronological days missed was not recorded, just the number of game and practice days. Because of the confounding influence on the mechanism of injury and recovery time course associated with concurrent ligamentous injury, further statistical calculations considered only isolated meniscal injuries.</p>

<title>Demographic Influences</title>
<p>Linear regression of injured players identified a significant inverse relationship between age and rate of lateral meniscal tears (slope = −0.505; 95% CI, −0.089 to −0.10; y = 2.148 − 0.50<italic>x; t</italic><sub>21</sub> = −2.619; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05; <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.255) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546511428601">Figure 3</xref>). Lateral meniscal tears are prevalent up to the age of 30 years. Beyond this age, injuries to the medial meniscus become more prevalent. Based on the total player population (injured and uninjured), logistic regression identified 2 parameters that showed a positive correlation for meniscal tear: age (<italic>B</italic> = .38; <italic>X</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> = 5.7; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05; OR, 1.038; 95% CI, 1.007-1.071) and height (<italic>B</italic> = .095; <italic>X</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> = 9.5; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05; OR, 1.100; 95% CI, 1.035-1.168). The parameters that did not show a positive correlation for meniscal tear were position, weight, number of years of playing experience, and number of games and minutes played.</p>

<p>Individuals who had a body mass index (BMI) greater than 25.0 had a statistically significant higher risk of injury (2.18 per 100 athlete-seasons) than those athletes who had a BMI of less than 25.0 (IRR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.3; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05).

<title>Return to Play and Player Efficiency</title>
<p>Two players (1.4%) were injured during the preseason and never appeared in a regulation NBA game, 23 (18.0%) did not return to play, and 103 (80.5%) returned to compete in at least 1 NBA season following the injury. Upon returning to competition, the mean number of seasons completed was 4.1 ± 3.7 (note: 21 players [16.4% of all injured players and 20.4% of players returning to competition] were still active at the start of the 2010-2011 season). There was no statistically significant difference between the preinjury PER (14.1 ± 4.6) and the postinjury PER (13.4 ± 4.4).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of our study are consistent with the previous study on incidence of meniscal tears in the NBA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511428601">10</xref></sup> Isolated meniscal injuries occurred in 129 (87.8%) of the 147 total cases of meniscal tears. Of the total 129 cases of isolated tears, we found that 59.7% were isolated lateral meniscal tears (a total of 77 cases) and that 40.3% were isolated medial meniscal tears (a total of 52 cases). Tears occurred more frequently during game competition than practice. Injuries to the lateral meniscus had a statistically significant higher game-related injury rate than the medial meniscus.</p>
<p>Our results challenge the widely held belief that medial meniscal tears are more common.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511428601">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511428601">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511428601">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511428601">11</xref></sup> Our results suggest that this is only partially true. We identified a significant inverse relationship between age and rate of lateral meniscal tears. Lateral meniscal tears were more common in the NBA athlete at age 30 or younger. After the age of 30, medial meniscal tears were found to be more prevalent in the professional basketball player.</p>
<p>Body mass index was a statistically significant predictor of meniscal injury risk. Athletes who had a BMI greater than 25.0 had a higher risk of injury than those having a lower BMI. Furthermore, with a BMI greater than 25.0, athletes were at significantly increased risk of lateral meniscal tears than medial meniscal tears. It should be pointed out that traditional BMI calculations in an elite NBA athlete may be skewed when considering whether the player is “overweight” or “obese.” Because of the relative taller height of the average NBA athlete, BMI cutoffs for overweight and obese in the general population may not be accurate in this setting. The numbers reported in this study are irrespective of these health distinctions and are still accurate when considering the risk of isolated meniscal tears.</p>
<p>In contradistinction to Baker et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511428601">1</xref></sup> who found that basketball players in the general population had an exceptionally high meniscal injury rate of 80% in the right knee, the professional players in this study had isolated meniscal injuries that were more even, with 53.5% of the isolated meniscal injuries occurring on the right side and 46.5% occurring on the left. This evenness is likely due to the professional nature of the players, where both the left knee and right knee are optimally conditioned, whereas in the general population, as Baker et al surmised, favoring of a dominant knee is more likely. It was also interesting to note that isolated lateral meniscal tears occurred with more frequency on the right knee whereas isolated medial meniscal tears occurred with more frequency on the left knee (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0363546511428601">Table 6</xref>).</p>
<p>The amount of time lost between medial and lateral meniscal injury was significantly different. On average, athletes with isolated lateral meniscal injuries who had surgery missed 43.8 ± 35.7 days of games and practices while those with isolated medial meniscal tears who had surgery missed 40.9 ± 29.7 days of games and practices. Athletes who returned to play after sustaining an isolated tear were able to return to the league for 4.1 ± 3.7 seasons. Furthermore, upon returning to competition the athletes’ level of performance did not appear to suffer as there was no statistically significant difference between the preinjury PER (14.1) and the postinjury PER (13.4). The chronologic total days missed was not looked at for several reasons. First, these data were not collected by the NBATA database. The only data available were the number of practices and games missed, as reported by the trainers. Second, to calculate the chronologic total days missed would bias and further confuse the data, as injuries that occurred at the end of the season and had affected the player into the subsequent season would be mixed in with injuries that occurred during the season. This is certainly a limitation of even the number reported in this article of practice and game days missed above.</p>
<p>Our study did not use the typical orthopaedic knee outcome measures; rather, the focus was on the player’s sport-specific outcomes as determined by use of playing statistics and the PER. The assumption was that the standard outcome scores would not be sensitive to predict statistical performance outcomes in the elite athlete. The PER does not account for certain player properties such as leadership, durability, player position, or defensive prowess and is not validated for knee pathology. Also, the ability to return to play not only is dependent on the knee injury studied here but is more likely to be multifactorial. Several reasons, including salary cap, age, other concurrent injuries, and newly acquired players, may contribute to a player not returning to league play. Furthermore, the PER is not a validated outcome measure for injuries or surgeries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511428601">5</xref></sup> It should be cautioned that the results reported here are potentially biased toward this subset of players and may apply only to players at this elite level of play.</p>
<p>Last, whether a player’s meniscal tear was treated surgically or nonsurgically was not differentiated in this study. Furthermore, when the player did have surgery, the type of meniscal surgery performed was not differentiated as well. This information was not available in the database. Certainly, surgery versus no surgery and the type of meniscal surgery performed, that is, repair versus debridement, will affect the days or games missed. How the type of surgery affects a player’s PER is also not known. These factors must be taken into consideration when looking at the number of days missed and the significance of the PER in this study.</p>
<p>The strength of the study is the large number of player injuries analyzed over a long period of time. Twenty-one seasons represents a significant portion of the NBA’s existence and gives strength to the epidemiological portion of this article and certainly bolsters the associations made here.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the epidemiology of isolated meniscal tears and subsequent player performance were investigated in this study. Isolated meniscal tears represented 0.7% of all athletic injuries in the NBA over the past 21 seasons. Lateral meniscal tears were found to be more common than medial meniscal tears, but only up to age 30 years. After 30 years of age, this relationship is reversed. The risk of lateral meniscal tears gradually decreased as the player aged. Body mass index also had a negative effect on the risk of isolated meniscal injury, particularly on the lateral meniscus. The number of days missed was not significant between isolated lateral and medial meniscal tears. Finally, the player’s performance, as measured by the PER, was not affected after the player returned to competition. This was true for both medial and lateral meniscal tears.</p>
