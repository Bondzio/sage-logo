<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dysfunctional voiding (DV) refers to involuntary intermittent contractions of the striated muscle of the external urethral sphincter or pelvic floor during voiding in neurologically normal individuals, resulting in intermittent or fluctuating uroflow rates. This is a unique entity reflecting detrusor–sphincter dyssynergy and should not be confused with the general term voiding dysfunction, which is used to describe any abnormality involving bladder filling or emptying: the diagnosis of DV requires repeat uroflow measurements with curves demonstrating a staccato or interrupted pattern (unless verified by invasive urodynamic investigation).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922813492376">1</xref></sup> Although the classic presenting symptoms include daytime wetness secondary to urge incontinence, DV can present with any constellation of symptoms, including frequency, infrequency, stress incontinence, incomplete voiding, and increased rates of urinary tract infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922813492376">2</xref></sup> This is an extremely common clinical problem that represents approximately 40% of general pediatric urology visits and causes significant distress to parents and caregivers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922813492376">3</xref></sup> Despite the prevalence of the disorder, understanding of the underlying pathology is relatively sparse.</p>
<p>Currently, DV is thought to have a multifactorial etiology involving learned behavior, maturational delay, and the perpetuation of infantile patterns (as well as possible underlying anatomical factors).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922813492376">4</xref></sup> Although all of these aspects likely factor into voiding difficulties, they do not account for the possibility of an underlying, intrinsic psychological component. Thus, we suggest that the innate, unlearned aspects of personality known as temperament should be examined. Young children’s temperament is commonly broken down into 3 dimensions: surgency/extroversion, negative affect, and effortful control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922813492376">5</xref></sup> Surgency/extroversion is the aspect of personality that reflects high positive affect. It is characterized as being high in activity and impulsivity, low in shyness, and generally high in levels of happiness. Negative affect reflects the opposite: it is the aspect of personality that represents a child’s irritability and anger. This dimension includes levels of fear, frustration, sadness, and difficulties in soothability. Finally, effortful control reflects a child’s ability to self-restrain. This dimension is characterized by the ability to focus attention, avoid distractions, and derive pleasure from low-intensity activities. These dimensions are thought to represent the interactions between children’s impulses and their efforts to control them, therefore temperament would seem vital to the development and later eradication of DV.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study is to identify whether temperament among DV patients is different than among non-DV patients. If a difference in association is found between temperament and DV patients versus non-DV patients, there might be early interventions that are appropriate to address prior to the symptomatic presentation of DV. If no difference is found, temperament might still predict success with various types of treatment for the condition. We hypothesize that children with behavioral issues are more likely to experience DV. Therefore, we expect DV to be associated with lower surgency, higher negative affectivity, and lower effortful control. The extent to which results vary based on demographic characteristics will also be explored.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0009922813492376" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This study used a case–control model with participants drawn from the patient population of a single New Jersey private practice pediatric urology office. Written informed consent from caregivers was obtained prior to the initiation of any study procedures.</p>
<sec id="section3-0009922813492376">
<title>Participant Population</title>
<p>For the disease group, patients with ages ranging from 4 to 7 years who were originally presented to the practice with symptoms of incontinence, frequency, or urgency were considered. All potential participants had undergone history and physical examination, urine analysis, and uroflow with surface patch electromylography monitoring of pelvic floor activity, and had demonstrated a staccato pattern with poor pelvic floor muscle relaxation. All patients had also undergone renal and bladder ultrasounds to assess for residual urine as part of their diagnostic evaluation. Any patient found to have an alternative etiology to their symptoms (such as urinary tract infection, hydronephrosis, constipation, or anatomical or neurological abnormality), and all patients who were found to have continuous incontinence were excluded as not having pure DV. The caregivers of eligible patients were then approached and asked to complete a 15-minute questionnaire with regard to their child’s behaviors. All caregivers approached for this study agreed to participate.</p>
<p>For the control group, caregivers of patients aged 4 through 7 years were approached and solicited to fill out the same questionnaires while awaiting their child’s appointments at the same pediatric office. The only exclusion criterion for the control group was that the child must never have been diagnosed with DV. These patients had all undergone examination appropriate to their urologic dysfunction and equivalent to that of the control group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0009922813492376">
<title>Assessing Temperament</title>
<p>Caregivers were asked to fill out a survey assessing demographics, and temperament for their child. The demographic portion collected information on the children’s ages (in months) and gender. No other identifying information was collected.</p>
<p>Developed by Rothbart et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922813492376">6</xref></sup> the long form of the Children’s Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ) was designed to assess 15 primary temperament characteristics in children aged 3 through 7 years, and to use these characteristics to assess temperament across the 3 broader dimensions of surgency, negative affect, and effortful control. Adequate psychometric properties, including reliability and validity, have been established for the long form of this scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922813492376">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922813492376">7</xref></sup> However, the full CBQ involves 195 questions and takes approximately 1 hour to administer.</p>
<p>Thus, in order to increase participation rates, we opted to instead use the very short form of the CBQ. Also developed by Rothbart, this instrument consists of 36 questions and only takes approximately 15 minutes to administer, yet still maintains appropriate fit to the 3-dimensional model (12 questions per subscale) and demonstrates good internal consistency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922813492376">8</xref></sup> Using the very short form CBQ, caregivers were asked to score their children on 36 items such as “seems always in a big hurry to get from one place to another” and “when drawing or coloring in a book, shows strong concentration.” Each item was scored on a scale from 1 to 7 with 1 being <italic>extremely untrue</italic> and 7 being <italic>extremely true</italic>. Participants were only identified by subject number, age, and gender.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0009922813492376">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Data were analyzed using SPSS Statistics Version 18. Statistical significance was defined as <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05. Descriptive statistics were generated for demographic data. CBQ subscale scores were then calculated for surgency, negative affect, and effortful control, and unpaired <italic>t</italic> tests were used to compare children who exhibited DV versus those who did not on these aspects of temperament. The subscale scores were then stratified across gender and unpaired <italic>t</italic> testing was again used to compare responses between DV and non-DV subjects.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Dysfunctional voiding is an extremely common problem for the pediatric urologist and general pediatrician and as such deserves significant attention. In this study, we examined the association between temperament and DV as a possible behavioral component to the currently accepted mutlifactorial etiology. Although previous researchers have explored the relationship between neuropsychiatric disorders and DV,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922813492376">9</xref></sup> as well as the relationship between psychological problems and general voiding dysfunction,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922813492376">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922813492376">11</xref></sup> to our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the link between the dimensions of temperament and DV. Whereas our original intent was to examine surgency, negative affect, and effortful control within the entire pediatric population, our findings indicate that gender is an important factor that influences the aspects of temperament as they relate to DV. This finding in itself is not surprising: Gender differences are not uncommon in urological disorders, and rates of urinary incontinence differ between females and males in general.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922813492376">12</xref></sup> Thus, it is reasonable that gender differences influence how personality aspects affect DV. However, the actual associations were unexpected: Whereas the male participants generated a result in line with our hypothesis, the female population actually presented in a way that was unexpected.</p>
<p>For the male participants, the only dimension that generated a relevant finding was that of effortful control. This finding puts DV in line with many other problem behaviors associated with poor effortful control, including impulsivity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922813492376">13</xref></sup> and other forms of chronic behavioral maladjustment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922813492376">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922813492376">15</xref></sup> Given the established relationship between DV and behavior maladjustment, the relationship between effortful control and DV is a logical extension of past research. This finding is also consistent with the clinical rationale that supports common treatment regimens for DV. For example, biofeedback and pelvic muscle physical therapy are popular and effective means for eliminating DV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922813492376">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922813492376">17</xref></sup> While undergoing these trainings, a child learns to better control his or her urinary muscles, compensating for his or her innately low effortful control. The findings that DV and surgency or negative affect were unrelated in males were less expected as these dimensions have also been correlated to behavior maladjustment. This lack of findings may be because of the process of DV itself: As an activity that revolves around the proper coordination of muscular movements, voiding may rely more on effortful control than surgency and negative affect (which would have a larger impact on interpersonal interactions).</p>
<p>For the female participants, the findings were much more puzzling. The only dimension to show a meaningful finding was surgency, and it was found that surgency was positively correlated with DV. This finding is surprising because surgency is generally considered to be a positive trait: Children with high surgency are found to be more active in group play and more socially outgoing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922813492376">17</xref></sup> As such, it seems counterintuitive that such a trait would be associated with a maladaptive behavior such as DV. In addition, whereas in males effortful control was an integral (and expected) factor, in females this was not the case: Effortful control was not significantly higher in the non-DV group than the DV group.</p>
<p>One possible explanation to our findings is in the nature of surgency itself and its subsequent impact on females. Although surgency is associated with positive social skills, it is likewise associated with an increased risk of emotional dysregulation and subsequent externalizing behavior problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922813492376">18</xref></sup> Furthermore, poor emotional regulation has been found to be a stronger predictor of externalizing behavior problems in girls, whereas boys’ problems have been better predicted by inattention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922813492376">19</xref></sup> Thus it is possible that DV represents a manifestation of such an externalized problem, and consequently shares the same temperament associations.</p>
<sec id="section10-0009922813492376">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>There are several limitations associated with this study. First, total sample size was small and analysis based on gender stratification required applying our metrics to even smaller subpopulations. Second, as data were collected in a private practice office in the Northeast, there is the possibility that our findings apply only to a specific population subset and do not generally apply to the entire pediatric urology population. We also did not assess for the possibility of comorbid neuropsychiatric disorders (such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder), and these findings could have influenced our outcomes. Third, our data collection procedure also has limitations. Although the very short form CBQ has been used as a research tool and found valid in prior studies, it still carries the inherent possibility of self-report bias. Our data relied on the observations of caregivers, and thus is subject to the possibility of inaccurate recall and the desire to respond in a favorable (or unfavorable) manner. As each child had only one caregiver completing the questionnaire, it is also possible that our findings were skewed by the child–caregiver interpersonal relationship and do not represent the child’s true global temperament. Finally, a case–control research design was employed and participants were not drawn from a random sample.</p>

<title>Implications for Clinical Practice</title>
<p>Despite the aforementioned limitations, this study makes important contributions to both the understanding of and potential treatment strategies for DV. In males, our findings support the current treatment regimen of muscle training and physical therapy. These techniques are useful in that they develop an external locus for effortful control to counteract the innately low internal sense of effortful control, and thus should be effective. The same, however, may not hold true for females. For the female with DV, there appears to be a significant emotional aspect associated with the physical dysfunction. DV therapy for female children should address this finding and may be more successful if it involves psychological intervention to address emotional concerns, in addition to the physical therapy.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study provides preliminary evidence of a relationship between temperament and DV in a pediatric urology population that may vary based on gender. Whereas in males low effortful control is associated with DV, in females high surgency was the only aspect of temperament linked with this common pediatric urological concern. These findings, although unexpected, fit with findings for general externalizing behavior. Given the multifactorial etiology of DV and the likely behavioral component, it therefore seems reasonable that the impact of temperament reflects other behavioral problems. Further research is needed to replicate and extend these findings.</p>
