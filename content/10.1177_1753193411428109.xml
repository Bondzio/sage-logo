<body>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>There are several methods reported for repairing the dorsum of the hand, with the primary goals to restore good functioning hand movement and to minimize ugly scars, both on the dorsum of the hand and the donor sites. We report our new flap technique, which utilizes a turnover adipofascial flap based on both the radial artery perforator and the posterior interosseous perforator to reconstruct the dorsum of the hand.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411428109">Koshima et al. (1995)</xref> noted that there are several radial artery perforators within 10 cm proximal to the radial styloid process. In the posterior aspect of the forearm, there are also several perforators from the posterior interosseous artery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193411428109">Figure 1A</xref>). Doppler audiometry is able to detect several perforators arising from the radial artery and posterior interosseous artery within 10 cm proximal to the radial styloid process. An adipofascial flap can be raised based on these perforators and turned over to cover a skin defect area on the dorsum of the hand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193411428109">Figure 1B</xref>). With this technique, an S-shaped skin incision is made and the adipofascial flap is raised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193411428109">Figure 1C</xref>). The flap is then turned over, passed through the subcutaneous tunnel over the wrist, and used to cover the dorsal hand skin defect. The fascial side becomes superficial and the adipose tissues come into direct contact with the exposed extensor tendons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193411428109">Figure 1D</xref>). Split thickness skin grafts, harvested from the left thigh, are then placed on the flap and gauze is applied gently without tie-over fixation, after which the skin incision for the flap donor site is sutured.</p>

<p>We used this technique in a 36-year-old male suffering from a deep dermal burn on the left dorsum of his hand as the result of a 6600-volt electric shock during power line construction work. We performed simple debridement and split thickness skin grafting, but the graft necrosed, presumably because of the lack of vascularized tissue on the extensor tendons. To cover the exposed extensor tendons with tissue with good blood supply, we planned to use this adipofascial turnover perforator flap. Before the second operation, a Doppler audiometry detected two points with good pulsation. One of these (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193411428109">Figure 1B</xref>; pr) was 0.5 cm proximal to the radial styloid process with a pulsating sound weaker than the other and we presumed it to be the radial artery-based perforator. The other point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193411428109">Figure 1B</xref>; pp) was located in the middle of the posterior aspect of the forearm about 1 cm proximal to the wrist. The latter had a stronger pulsating sound and was considered to be the posterior interosseous artery-based perforator. Both perforators were included within the flap. This time, the skin grafting took for 100%, which proved that the adipofascial turnover flap was alive. Fifteen days after the operation, active motion of the hand was started. There was a partial necrosis on the edge of the donor site, which healed within 2 weeks. One year after the flap transfer, the range of motion of each finger is full, with minimal scarring and no sensory disturbance on the left forearm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193411428109">Figure 2</xref>). The patient returned to work as an electrical engineer.</p>

<p>Since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411428109">Koshima et al. (1995)</xref> reported similar flaps based on the radial artery perforator alone, radial artery perforator flaps have been gradually adopted for reconstructing defects of the hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193411428109">Al Hoqail, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411428109">Ignatiadis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411428109">Koshima et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193411428109">Medalie, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193411428109">Saint-Cyr et al., 2010</xref>). However, there is no definite description about the safe territory of the radial artery perforator-based flap. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193411428109">Al Hoqail (2009)</xref> reported a flap of dimensions 5 ×20 cm<sup>2</sup> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193411428109">Saint-Cyr et al. (2010)</xref> reported that the entire distal two-thirds of the forearm could be safely raised based upon cadaver dye injection studies. The present flap, based on both the radial artery perforators and the posterior interosseous artery perforators, should receive a more stable blood supply, be better vascularized and hence more reliable. Preoperative Doppler audiometry detected a stronger sound for the posterior interosseous artery perforator in our case, indicating that this perforator may be more reliable than the radial artery perforator alone. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411428109">Koshima et al. (1995)</xref> noted, in cases without a radial artery perforator, the posterior interosseous artery perforator alone may supply the flap. The fact that the simple skin grafting performed in the first operation necrosed but the one on the adipofascial flap in the second operation took 100% suggests that this flap was well vascularized and effective in reconstructing the thin tissue with good blood supply, allowing the patient to return to work as an electrical engineer.</p>
<p>Compared to other flap techniques, the present technique has advantages – it is easy to perform, avoids long-term immobilization and donor site skin grafting, saves operative time, and avoids microsurgery.</p>
