<p>Though the Reverend Edler Garnet Hawkins was the first black professor at Princeton Theological Seminary, a critical figure within American Presbyterianism and the ecumenical movement of the church, little is written about him. This article attempts to change that by giving voice to his public proclamation as expressed through some of his sermons, lectures, and addresses. It highlights four major motifs embedded in his proclamation and concludes with some reflections on the relevance of his thought for contemporary times.</p>

<p><italic>In honor of the great cloud of black witnesses, (un)known, who have walked the historical halls of PTS</italic></p></disp-quote>
<p>Hanging quietly on the wall of the first floor of the Princeton Theological Seminary Luce Library is a colorful painting of the Reverend Edler Garnet Hawkins. He looks regal yet he is silent, though he proclaimed words of great profundity during his ministry. His body is framed literally with an aesthetic border. One artistic depiction of this man, however, does not encapsulate the totality of his life. He is hanging, not from a southern tree, nor swinging, but silent and still as countless strangers pass by daily. This article is an attempt to help Edler Hawkins’s voice emerge from the silence of a colorful canvas in order to hear the present resonance of his practical wisdom.</p>
<p>Reverend Hawkins was an “ordained servant of the church”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0040573612453160">1</xref></sup> who served until his death on December 18, 1977. He was pastor of St. Augustine Presbyterian Church in Bronx, New York, for 31 years. He was elected in 1964 as the first black Moderator of the United Presbyterian Church in the USA. He was involved in the ecumenical movement, eventually serving on the Central Committee of the World Council of Churches, and he ended his ministry teaching on the faculty of Princeton Theological Seminary as Professor of Practical Theology and Coordinator of the Black Studies program from 1971–77. At Princeton he was the first African American professor to be hired.</p>
<p>Hawkins was a trailblazing renaissance man who placed a high emphasis on the ministry of the Christian church, but his influence was felt far beyond the confines of the walls of a congregation or a theological educational institution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0040573612453160">2</xref></sup> He was regarded “as a pastor par excellence, a pastor’s pastor, first among equals, without a peer, the standard by which others are measured.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0040573612453160">3</xref></sup> Yet Hawkins exemplified the best of the black church tradition that wedded a pastoral or priestly ministry with a prophetic one.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0040573612453160">4</xref></sup> He was a prophetic pastor and pastorally prophetic. In particular, he fought the good fight against racism and for social change during the civil rights movement within and without the church. One example of his work was the Council on Church and Race, which he founded. Through it and other venues, he, along with others, struggled for racial justice. In fact, some say that Hawkins, though filling many roles, served “pre-eminently as prophet for racial justice and reconciliation.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0040573612453160">5</xref></sup> His colleagues described him as resourceful, wise, sensitive, tenacious, faithful, humble, insightful, warm, passionate, and a person of dignity and integrity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0040573612453160">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many things can be said of this twentieth-century sage of the church, but I am interested in Hawkins as homiletician, particularly the content of his public proclamation. As Professor of Practical Theology, Hawkins taught courses in preaching and church administration, though his pedagogical portfolio was not limited to these as he also taught a class called “Literature of Liberation,” which focused on various art forms expressed by African Americans.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0040573612453160">7</xref></sup> His preaching courses included “Preaching in the Urban Crisis,” which dealt with issues such as race and poverty. As a minister, he was necessarily interdisciplinary in his approach. In all of his classes Hawkins brought to bear his wealth of ministerial experience and knowledge from his roles as pastor, prophet, professor, and preacher. The last title is not frequently associated with Hawkins, though he “earned the title of effective communicator” and “master of words.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0040573612453160">8</xref></sup> The label of “preacher” will be the focus of this article as a way to let his voice be heard afresh in the academy and church.</p>
<p>In particular, I will explore the public proclamation of Edler Hawkins<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0040573612453160">9</xref></sup> through some of his sermons, lectures, and addresses, particularly highlighting four major motifs of his spoken word. I will conclude with some brief reflections on how the proclamation of Hawkins is relevant for today. To hear Hawkins in his own words is to hear one speak the truth in love at a historical time that was full of hate and human divisions. It will become clear that his sagely voice of the past still has present-day resonance in the church, academy, and world.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0040573612453160"><title>The Embrace of (the Black) Experience</title>
<p>As the “Memorial Minute of the Faculty of Princeton Theological Seminary” notes, Hawkins was an “eloquent and persuasive Christian interpreter of the Black experience in this country.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0040573612453160">10</xref></sup> It comes as no surprise that he interrogated the black experience in the United States because he himself was black. He lived and worked out of his own skin, out of his own contextual particularity and experience. For Hawkins it was “the simple fact of the blackness of skin that colored and defined, <italic>without limiting</italic>, the issues that were the substance of his life and ministry.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0040573612453160">11</xref></sup> Hawkins’s race “colored” his life and proclamation because he had to deal with what W.E.B. Dubois referred to as “the problem of the twentieth century”: “the problem of the color line.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0040573612453160">12</xref></sup> The line was drawn in the sand of the United States during his life, thus much of his ministry demonstrates his attempt to cross the borders of that line and even to erase it. He was a border-crosser, as revealed in his proclamation, yet because of who he was in the United States as a black male, he asserted boldly, even in his inaugural lecture when he joined the Princeton Seminary faculty, that it was impossible to write a history of the people of God in America if the experience of black people was not included in that history.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0040573612453160">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>What Hawkins attempted to do in his ministry, even at Princeton, is implied in the title of his inaugural lecture, “To Gwen with Love,” which was dedicated to Gwendolyn Brooks, the 1950 Pulitzer Prize-winning black poet. Hawkins aimed to bring the black experience, even the artistic expressions of African Americans, including the “literature of liberation” like Brooks’s work, into the milieu of human history, American history, and theological education. He was influenced by the Harlem Renaissance and worked at introducing the aesthetic genius of that period into the seminary classroom.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0040573612453160">14</xref></sup> In his addresses and sermons one would not be surprised to hear references to other blacks or the black experience. For instance, he spoke of an enslaved Frederick Douglass and the critical physical fight with his master that served as a turning point in his situation as a slave.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0040573612453160">15</xref></sup> In a 1972 lecture, Hawkins reasserted the importance of making the black experience a real “presence” by integrating it into theological discourse and history. He declared that there is no authentic theological speculation without the black experience and affirmed that the black experience can nourish both blacks and whites.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0040573612453160">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hawkins embraced his own cultural experience of blackness and spoke out of that experience unashamedly and unapologetically. It was almost as if to speak the truth in love he had first to be truthful about his own identity and location in the world. But what he wanted so deeply was for the black experience in the United States to be a vital and critical part of the ongoing conversation in theological education and the church. He drew on his own black experience to do effective proclamatory ministry in the church and world. Hawkins once said, “Classical scholars may shudder, but in order for theology to be alive and vibrant it must be related to what people are experiencing.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0040573612453160">17</xref></sup> Thus, for him, the human experience is an essential component in theological exploration. In his proclamation as theology, it is clearly evident that the human experience, and the black experience in particular, is in the foreground. It is at the fore because in the context of his day African Americans were held back because of their race. In his proclamation Hawkins did not avoid this truth, and any truth about human suffering on any level, because his “religiousness thrust him into the world within which the faithful are gathered.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0040573612453160">18</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0040573612453160"><title>The Truth about Suffering</title>
<p>Hawkins affirmed the human experience of all people and the value of experience for theological thought, but in his proclamation he also told the truth about it in relation to black people and other marginalized groups. As a preacher he was not known to be a “spellbinder,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0040573612453160">19</xref></sup> but he was a truth teller. In his May 20, 1963 address to the 175th General Assembly of the United Presbyterian Church, USA, titled “This Is the Mood and This Is the Time,” Hawkins spoke the truth about the “concern of race in our church and in our society.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0040573612453160">20</xref></sup> He spoke forthrightly about the plight of racism in the United States and even compared the fire James Baldwin talked about in his literary work with a torch’s fire that will be lit to destroy African Americans. He said of this torch,<disp-quote>
<p>It will be lit … by those who do not comprehend the nature of our times, nor the course of history, but who in their bitter prejudice will destroy everything in the American dream rather than give up an unmerited privileged position in a society that must relate to each other … in simple and equal human terms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0040573612453160">21</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The challenge that Hawkins put forth did not and does not acquit the church from its implicit or explicit complicity in the horror of racism. He critiqued the church for what he saw as a lack of courage and proclaimed,<disp-quote>
<p>We know that the church has not risen to this present moment but we hope that we can help people to see the difference between an institution that has lacked the courage of its true witness—the difference between this and a great faith that sits in judgment upon the institution and calls upon it to discover that courage that is the real measure of its faith.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0040573612453160">22</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>He stated that the issue of race relations needs to become a part of the “conscience of the church, rather than something into which we have siphoned our resolutions with neither the money nor the staff to get them off the paper.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0040573612453160">23</xref></sup> Making these concerns of race visible and putting its “money where its mouth is” would be a sign of the church’s “integrity and its intent.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0040573612453160">24</xref></sup> As a result of this proclamation, the United Presbyterian Church approved a resolution to create a Commission on Religion and Race and pledged a significant amount of money, $500,000, toward the cause.</p>
<p>Hawkins painted the picture transparently for those in the assembly audience. He told the truth about the church’s apparent apathy toward issues of racial justice. Moreover, he not only called for an awareness and support of racial justice in the church that reveals itself by including people of color; he called for the sharing of power and leadership in the church’s institutions, including educational venues. He proclaimed that the church<disp-quote>
<p>cannot continue to be truly an integrated church that moves only in one direction without ever or almost ever providing the opportunities for a Negro to lead an integrated fellowship, except when we know it will be but for a time. And we talk about an integrated school, here again the image of minority members on these school faculties, as a challenge and a stimulation to minority youth everywhere, must not be left out …<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0040573612453160">25</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>He went on to call for “equal employment opportunities” in the clauses of each ecclesial contract as a concrete way that the church can respond to the “present mood” of the country and make “the kingdoms of this world something like the kingdom of God.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0040573612453160">26</xref></sup> Hawkins deeply yearned for the concretization of the kingdom of God as it is in heaven to manifest on earth. He was not afraid to speak truth to power even as he referred to a “conscienceless power” meeting a “powerless conscience.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0040573612453160">27</xref></sup> He did not limit his prophetic critique to the ecclesiastical realm but raised the issue of power in the government, education, industry, and other sectors of society.</p>
<p>Hawkins was concerned about those who suffer and he recognized that the struggle for justice would entail suffering. In a Princeton lecture, “Theological Contributions to Equality,” Hawkins pointed to how the early history of the United States was marked with hypocrisy in that when the first African slaves were brought to Jamestown, Virginia, in 1619, the rhetoric of freedom and democracy was interlocked with black inequality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0040573612453160">28</xref></sup> Human suffering is fertilized in the soil of “the land of the free.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0040573612453160">29</xref></sup> This ironic reality is evident when one speaks of “the other side of the tracks” as Hawkins did. He noted that the unjust events of racial discrimination in Birmingham, Alabama, are not the only “personification of evil” in the United States. He described the “inhumanities” of Morgan Park in the following way:<disp-quote>
<p>the other side of the tracks of human dignity; an ink blot of black poverty that breeds ever greater crimes in the filthy cradle of the gutter; a black shanty town up North where the whites look down their noses and shut their ears to the blues that are crying up and down the middle of that one-way street of misery. This was the black Babylon into which kids were born who became the victims of a society that scorned them and turned them down.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0040573612453160">30</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This Babylonian “ink blot of black poverty” is what motivated Hawkins to wrestle against the powers and principalities of a racist apartheid system that had become a “repressive police state.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0040573612453160">31</xref></sup> Because of the suffering of the black poor on the other side of the tracks of human existence, he said that there is “little place for either a politics or religion of happiness and joy.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0040573612453160">32</xref></sup> Human suffering should not make anyone smile, especially in a “climate of unrest and protest.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0040573612453160">33</xref></sup> Structures and systems were faltering and failing due to the fires of injustice. Local school systems were collapsing in the urban areas of New York with one million children out of school, according to Hawkins’s statistics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0040573612453160">34</xref></sup> As he told the truth about the suffering of blacks, he attempted to demonstrate how the struggle of one people was linked to the struggle of all people.</p>
<p>But this struggle, he proclaimed, most likely leads to suffering on behalf of those suffering. Hawkins stated that there is a “price tag” for following Christ and one may have to suffer for doing right. He opposed a “cross-less geniality that calls itself Christian.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0040573612453160">35</xref></sup> Hawkins urged the church not to be silent in speech or action because “this kind of silence is terror to the hearts”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0040573612453160">36</xref></sup> of blacks. In his mind, the church may have to bear a cross, to suffer with regard to the concerns of race as a way of being obedient to God. African Americans themselves also realized that the freedom sought was so necessary that “they must suffer and, yes, even perhaps die.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0040573612453160">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>Suffering was inevitable in the struggle for justice and Hawkins preached that even dreams could be blurred and dreamers slain. In one sermon, “The Dreamer,” Hawkins took the story of Joseph and parallels it with Martin Luther King, Jr., and other slain leaders. He noted that when the dreamer came to Memphis, he was slain by those who said, as was said of Joseph, “we shall see what will become of his dreams.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0040573612453160">38</xref></sup> Hawkins was truth-telling in this sermon about the inevitability of suffering while struggling for justice. What kept Hawkins in the struggle was his faith, a faith<disp-quote>
<p>that somehow this suffering will be woven into a final plan that will give us no regrets at all, even as those who have suffered have felt themselves to be in the hands of one who is utterly good and whose purposes may be delayed by men but whose purposes will not be defeated, and that all of their dreams will come true, even as the American dream for whose cause some are in jail tonight.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0040573612453160">39</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Though Hawkins was truthful about the suffering involved in struggling for a just cause, this did not prevent him from serving the least of these, the sufferers. He did not just acknowledge the occurrence of suffering, but encouraged outreach to those who are suffering as a sign of faithfulness. It is not surprising that Hawkins was engaged in an urban ministry that helped people in relation to housing, education, and employment. As Geddes Hanson writes, “For him social concerns were [the] warp and woof of the theological concerns.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0040573612453160">40</xref></sup> Hawkins was wary of theologies disconnected from mission in the world. The sight of suffering caused him to serve and to call others to loving service as well. His theology led his practice, which expressed his theology. In a 1974 ordination service sermon, Hawkins proclaimed that there is no “real theology of the gospel which does not include and reach the voices that rise out of our hungry, oppressed and depressed communities.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0040573612453160">41</xref></sup> His proclamation unveiled his life-calling of working toward justice on behalf of the marginalized of which he included himself. One colleague of Hawkins wrote this about him:<disp-quote>
<p>The characterization of his message as windows opening to the world appeared to be rather widespread, as he often used commentary on social, political and economic issues as illustrative material to illumine biblical truth … That he invariably focused upon the disinherited and the oppressed should come as no surprise. Inescapably, he was born into it … Because he counted himself as “one of the least,” his sermon material constantly reflected the pain of the poor and the oppressive power of the privileged.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0040573612453160">42</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Hawkins never avoided the plight of the suffering in the world. He named the places of suffering and called others to struggle for justice, inevitably leading to their own suffering. He told the truth in his public proclamation. In addition, despite the agony and tragedy of the black experience of suffering in the United States, Hawkins also proclaimed a word of reconciliation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0040573612453160"><title>The Possibility of Reconciliation</title>
<p>Reconciliation may be Hawkins’s most prominent theme. When Princeton colleagues remembered him as a person, they said the following:<disp-quote>
<p>Perhaps because he was so sure [of] who he was, he was able to mix his life meaningfully with so many other lives very different from his own. His quiet and humane intervention in the lives of Asians, Africans, Europeans and white American men and women certified to many of them the reality of forgiveness and the possibility of reconciliation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0040573612453160">43</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Hawkins was known to build “bridges of understanding” and even when those bridges were threatened to be burned he was a “balm in Gilead.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0040573612453160">44</xref></sup> Hawkins was a bridge over the troubled waters of racial discrimination. In his eulogy for Hawkins, James Hasting Nichols reminded the seminary congregation that Hawkins was “always pastor and counselor … to black and white.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0040573612453160">45</xref></sup> In 1953, Hawkins added the first Hispanic to his staff at St. Augustine Presbyterian Church, revealing how that congregation was intentionally becoming a multilingual and multicultural congregation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0040573612453160">46</xref></sup> Furthermore, Michael Livingston stated that Hawkins “had a genius for bringing people together from different parts of the world or the theological spectrum or from different sides of the debate in the congregational meeting or the plenary session of an ecumenical council.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0040573612453160">47</xref></sup> Hawkins’s genius allowed him to synthesize the supposedly disparate worlds of a Bronx congregation and the halls of the World Council of Churches in Geneva, Switzerland, to such an extent that “he became the reconciling link between distant addresses housing common human concerns.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0040573612453160">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hawkins, as a person, was a link and bridge between different worlds. He spoke out of his personhood. He could not help but move in the trajectory of reconciliation because that was who he was as an individual. Near the end of his life and while in the hospital, he received a letter from someone accusing him of being a communist. Hawkins responded gracefully and said,<disp-quote>
<p>My own spirit is one that moves more in the direction of reconciliation as perhaps one of the most important elements in our faith, after some of the elements of love and justice and integrity in life have been dealt with, which makes me have some questions about the wisdom of trying to document evidence about people who might be communist, especially when for some, like myself, there is little reason to believe this … Every kind regard and hoping you will find it helpful …<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0040573612453160">49</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>He said it himself—his spirit is one of reconciliation. In that spirit he ministered to people. Hawkins stood in the gap as a mediating figure at Princeton Seminary, for as Nichols also remarked, “It was Edler Hawkins, more than anyone else, who shook the faith of some of us on the faculty that a 19th century Scottish parson was the only viable form of ministry, while on the other hand he restrained some of our more impatient students from burning the place down.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0040573612453160">50</xref></sup> Hawkins was a truth-teller who moved in the direction of reconciliation. He realized that working toward reconciliation would be difficult; however, he believed that the gospel called for the building of a beloved human community. He was led in life by his own theology.</p>
<p>Hawkins defined the gospel as the “proclamation of a God who is bound to his people by ties of love” and who wills that this same love bind together those whom God has created.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0040573612453160">51</xref></sup> The love of God is foundational to his conception of and desire for reconciliation. In another sermon Hawkins proclaimed, “God loved the world and gave his son on the cross to set us free to serve him in that love, and to build the beloved community.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0040573612453160">52</xref></sup> God’s love propels any human action of love that fosters the building of a beloved community. God’s love is a challenge and call to humanity. When Hawkins described the love of God in a sermon at St. Augustine Presbyterian Church, he preached that it is a<disp-quote>
<p>love that unites all races and nations and creeds in a single brotherhood in which they are authentically one. This is the fellowship to which we are called, in which all the divisions of mankind are broken through and destroyed, and this is the fellowship that becomes the center of reconciliation around which all the elements of the universe must gather to be made one in God.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0040573612453160">53</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The desire for oneness and unity in and because of the love of God are key themes in Hawkins’s proclamation.</p>
<p>These themes also come through what he espoused about the sacrament of communion. In his sermon, “Known in the Breaking of Bread,” based on Luke 24, he stressed that we are called to integrity in communion and that oneness is the goal toward which we press though it is not yet realized. He preached about oneness in diversity and leaves the listeners with the challenge that “maybe one day theology will catch up with the goals of oneness that represent the reality of the communion table.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0040573612453160">54</xref></sup> This oneness is none other than reconciliation between human beings and between humanity and God. What the table represents—oneness, unity, reconciliation, love—grounds what Hawkins proclaimed about human interaction.</p>
<p>He preached that human beings are bound to one another “in the bundle of life in love, to God.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0040573612453160">55</xref></sup> In God and signified at the communion table, there is no black or white, bond or free, male or female. Hawkins proclaimed frequently and prayerfully “that we all might be one” and become “what God wants us to be as a community.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0040573612453160">56</xref></sup> He struggled against human divisions through his proclamation and envisioned a wider horizon of humanity. He opposed matching hate with hate even in the midst of what he called the “terror of this time.” Moreover, he declared that a “one world” idea is cheap if one does not go behind the “iron curtains of our day” and fellowship with those on the other side of the curtain.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0040573612453160">57</xref></sup> Reconciliation was not just a concept rooted in the love of God but is directly linked to mutual relationships of love between human beings.</p>
<p>As mentioned, Hawkins would draw upon black cultural sources to make his case. In his inaugural lecture he used James Baldwin to support his call for reconciliation by quoting “nobody knows my name … but if you do not know my name you do not know your own.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0040573612453160">58</xref></sup> Hawkins believed in the inescapable interconnected web of humanity. Thus, without the practical realization of this reality, there could be no reconciliation. He said that there is no<disp-quote>
<p>resolution of the problem of race until reconciliation includes the right of the black community to bring its blackness, its own authentic identity, into every human condition; to bring its light, not only because it is its light, but also because no final definition of what America is can be made without some portion of that light.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0040573612453160">59</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Hawkins wanted everyone’s light to shine, especially those who were disenfranchised. His inclusive perspective carried over into the halls of academia where his problem was “overcoming resistance to the truth that ministerial formation in the twentieth century is inadequate to the degree that it fails to infuse matters of theological concern with the input of nonwhite scholars from their unique perspectives.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0040573612453160">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hawkins sought reconciliation but was not parochial. “As with Martin Luther King, he saw the local struggle of justice as part of a world struggle.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0040573612453160">61</xref></sup> He had a grand “vision of a new church, a new world, and a new humanity which he craved that we should share.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0040573612453160">62</xref></sup> His understanding of reconciliation was bigger than a black and white issue, though he fought hard in this country against racism and worked for resolutions; his conception of reconciliation truly incorporated the entire world and his entire life. The possibility of reconciliation was real yet “in important ways he parted company with those who regarded reconciliation as an expediency rather than the restoration of wholeness and the gift of healing.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0040573612453160">63</xref></sup> His former colleagues stated further,<disp-quote>
<p>He was quick to recognize the fraudulent use of reconciliation as a device for affecting an accommodation that left the former unjust arrangements and relationships very much intact and the condition of injustice essentially unchanged. The powerful are still very much in control and the poor are still defenseless against the forces of oppression. In short, Edler practiced a form of reconciliation that he likened to liberation. This form reflected more of the prophetic task and tradition than the more conventional approach of reducing friction and effecting a “peaceful” adjustment between unequal parties.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0040573612453160">64</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Hawkins wanted reconciliation but not the kind that was unjust. He worked for the concretization of reconciliation that would revolutionize the systems and structures that kept the poor poor and the marginalized on the margins. The terror of his time was frightening but he appeared to not be deterred because there was an obvious sense of hope blooming in his soul through his proclamation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0040573612453160"><title>The Presence of Hope</title>
<p>Despite the vicissitudes of American life, Hawkins voiced a confident hope grounded in his Christian faith just like his black ancestors. He said that the deep faith of the black community signified in the resurrection declared that victory would surely come.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0040573612453160">65</xref></sup> Hawkins undoubtedly “lived in that joy-filled confusion of tenses which is the privilege of those with faith in a remembered future.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0040573612453160">66</xref></sup> Though he recognized the future that stirred his faith, he did not neglect the present realities of racial discrimination. That topic was a recurring theme in his preaching due to the context of his day, but he did not “permit it to drive him to despair or defeat.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0040573612453160">67</xref></sup> Hawkins believed in a “prevailing” that was consistent with a biblical perspective on hope. Drawing on one of Gwendolyn Brooks’s poems, he proclaimed that there will be a “blooming in [the] whirlwind” of the United States, particularly as it relates to race.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0040573612453160">68</xref></sup> He is so confident of the eventual blooming that he also struggled against what he viewed as “the worst poverty: the poverty of those who have given up their hope to be a part of the American dream.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0040573612453160">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>The hope he articulated is in opposition to psycho-emotional and physical poverty. Hawkins’s hope is grounded in the soil of the earth; therefore, it is not escapist. He wanted humanity to be one while never forgetting the least of these and the common good. When he spoke of “the mood” of his day, he told the listening denomination that “Our hope is that the church will … lift both our policy and our practice to levels of human dignity that will involve all of God’s children.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0040573612453160">70</xref></sup> Hawkins never gave up on God or the Church, despite its failing courage in that day. He continued to hope for a new humanity and spiritual maturity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0040573612453160">71</xref></sup> He was “the dreamer” about whom he proclaimed as he preached that “no present moment was the final moment.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0040573612453160">72</xref></sup> He urged listeners to see beyond the present to the possibility of hope in the future. Even in his 1944 message to 150 young men out of his congregation who were drafted to the armed forces, he says “good causes can never be ultimately defeated, even though sometimes along the way they seem to be.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0040573612453160">73</xref></sup> Hawkins embodied hopeful proclamation to those whom he encountered.</p>
<p>One of his former parishioners writes this about him: Hawkins<disp-quote>
<p>was the consummate pastor who fashioned his calling after the black church tradition of social protest and tireless advocacy for those oppressed by race, poverty, and powerlessness. And in that same tradition he instilled in us a hope born of struggle and suffering and a sure victory of freedom and dignity which is attested in the literary and artistic expressions of our black heritage.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0040573612453160">74</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In his own words, Hawkins would say that we are always “bouncing back in hope.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0040573612453160">75</xref></sup> His proclamation embraced the human experience and told the truth about human suffering while it also articulated the possibility of reconciliation and the presence of hope in the world.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0040573612453160"><title>The Echoes of Hawkins’s Voice Today</title>
<p>These motifs of the past proclamation of Hawkins resonate in the present. There is much more that can be said about Edler Hawkins, but in conclusion I will suggest four themes that represent the echoes of Hawkins’s voice that reverberate down the corridors of church history. These four reverberating themes will also reveal how the voice of Hawkins is critical and relevant for our day and is in need of further exploration.</p>
<p>The first theme may be called <italic>the echoing voice of and for the marginalized.</italic> Hawkins embraced his own black experience and attempted to bring that experience into the larger conversation of the Church and the theological academy. He argued for the inclusion of marginalized voices in education and in ecclesial leadership, for without those dispossessed voices the Church and its institutions would not be what God wanted them to be. This is what I have attempted to do by helping Hawkins’s black voice be heard today in order to validate and value his contribution and to bring it to life out of the deathly silence of a Luce Library wall portrait. But it is not just Hawkins’s black experience and voice that should be heard. There are countless other people of color whose intellectual, ecclesial, and social contributions to Princeton Seminary and the world should be highlighted and studied. Their voices matter, too.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0040573612453160">76</xref></sup> The cultural production of the marginalized in the world, like the Harlem Renaissance aesthetic expressions, can serve as a wonderful epistemological resource, fodder, for theological education. In addition, Hawkins was known by many of a certain generation, but even those who are “gone, forgot, unfamed … untaught, unknown, unnamed”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0040573612453160">77</xref></sup> have something to teach us, if we have ears to hear their “haunting echo”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0040573612453160">78</xref></sup> of wisdom. Even the so-called “unlettered” can bestow pearls of insight about God, the Church, and the world.</p>
<p>The second reverberating theme is <italic>the echoing voice of suffering.</italic> In his accent on the human experience of the marginalized, particularly African Americans, Hawkins is not only implicitly suggesting the importance of cultural context for theological exploration and ministry but he is suggesting that the Church must take human suffering seriously. A cross-less Christianity is not Christian at all. Theological and biblical reflection should incorporate the reality of suffering because this is part of the divine and human condition. There is much need in the world and holistic ministry exemplified by Hawkins attempts to meet that need in meaningful ways through loving service. The “little deaths”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0040573612453160">79</xref></sup> of life are all around, calling us to Christian responsibility in the private and public realms. The proliferation of the prosperity gospel might suggest that everything is sweet like “candy,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0040573612453160">80</xref></sup> but as Hawkins and the prophets of old unveiled, much of our human existence is sour and rotten. Tragedy does strike humanity, calling us to expose the truth about suffering and to minister in word and deed to those suffering under the weight of the world.</p>
<p>The third reverberating theme is <italic>the echoing voice of the reality of racism and the need for reconciliation</italic>. Though speaking in a different era, what Hawkins said about race and racism resonates with contemporary life. The conversation about race in the United States is ongoing and the election of the first black president only raised race to a higher consciousness in this country. There is still racism and racial discrimination within and without the church, though it may express itself in a different manner from earlier years. Scholars continue to theorize on race in various disciplines, even theology, trying to make sense of the social construction that is race.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0040573612453160">81</xref></sup> Even though race is socially constructed, it shapes society and its structures and is interlocked with issues of class and gender.</p>
<p>Hawkins also helps one recognize how racism is linked to power. Although he had a spirit of reconciliation it was not without a call to revolutionize the oppressive systems of the world that separate the haves and the have-nots. Hawkins embodied truth-telling on the path toward reconciliation. He was courageous enough to tell the truth first because he knew that there can be no peace until there is justice for all, especially “the least of these.” The theological world recognizes the changing demographics of the Church and world but the verdict is still out about how the powers that be will deal with this change. I can only say, with the mediating, border-crossing Hawkins, “maybe one day theology will catch up with the goals of oneness that represent the reality of the communion table.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0040573612453160">82</xref></sup></p>
<p>The fourth reverberating theme is <italic>the echoing voice of hope.</italic> “Maybe one day” signals that Hawkins had hope for a different reality with regard to race relations. He did not drown in despair despite the domestic terror of his day. He embodied a posture of hope in his life and ministry. Struggle was inevitable but hope was interminable. He possessed a “simple faith”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0040573612453160">83</xref></sup> that expressed his hopefulness and trust in God. Hawkins reminds us that the “light shines in the darkness and the darkness did not overcome it” (John 1:5). Hope may be a “tiny sprout growing up in cracked concrete,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0040573612453160">84</xref></sup> but it is growing nonetheless. As Hawkins proclaimed, we are “bouncing back in hope.” The church is called to be the embodiment of christic hope. Hawkins was a practical theologian of hope and his hope was nurtured in a spiritual tradition that declared, “Nobody knows the trouble I see,” but concluded with “Glory, hallelujah!” His “simple faith” points us to a “hope that does not disappoint” (Rom 5:5) even as we experience hard times or face an uncertain future.</p>
<p>The past proclamation of Edler Hawkins finds resonance in the present. His distinct voice is both a challenge to and opportunity for the church to learn from the pulpit of a twentieth-century pastor-prophet. If we listen closely, Hawkins still speaks today in the echoes of our existence. These echoes are long-lasting, for when my father, who once worked for the American Bible Society in New York City, first learned that my current home was the house that Hawkins built, he yelled in excitement and surprise, “Edler Hawkins!” I realize now that he had heard Hawkins’s voice. My hope is that Hawkins will not be remembered as a silent portrait; rather, through this article, his voice will reverberate in the reader’s heart to such an extent that one will no longer say “Edler Hawkins?” but “Edler Hawkins!”</p>
