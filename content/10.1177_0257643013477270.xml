<p>In a mere 139 pages, T.K. Venkatasubramanian’s <italic>Music as History in Tamilnadu</italic> crisscrosses some radically broad academic terrain. The book brings Indic musicology into dialogue with Indian social history; it commingles sociological, historical and philosophical approaches to understanding music as a human phenomenon; and it is littered throughout with the ruminations of classic European writers on music, history and music history (Max Weber, Otto Spengler, Claude Levi-Strauss and Karl Marx all make appearances). The text veers from detailed considerations of musical manuscripts to theoretical topics (‘Mathematical Nature of Tonal Intervals in Indian Music’, Chapter 11), treatments of the works of individual composers (‘Maratta Tanjore in the Lyrics of Thyagaraja’, Chapter 7) and biographies of Indic musicologists (‘Dr V Raghavan: the Scholar Critic’, Appendix II). Some chapter titles are so sweeping they deserve book-length studies of their own (Chapter 10, ‘The Role of Performing Arts in India’s Freedom Struggle with Special Reference to Drama and Music’, lasts a mere six pages). That said, <italic>Music as History in Tamilnadu</italic> succeeds for the wealth of its details. The book contains one of the more thorough examinations of indigenous sources (in Tamil, Telugu and Kannada) on pre-eighteenth century music in South India, and for that reason alone it will be useful for scholars researching South Indian music. If some readers find the author’s developmentalist and comparative tone off-putting (he compares ancient Tamil music with the Greeks, and Chola music with the medieval Europeans), Anglo-American scholars would do well to consult the book for the arch of its historical narrative. Venkatasubramanian presents a view on Tamil music history that, though common today among connoisseurs and musicologists in the Tamil country, remains largely neglected by Anglo-American ethnomusicologists. The question of how to think about this narrative in relation to the musical past and cultural politics of the present in Tamil Nadu should be among the most pressing issues for ethnomusicologists of South India today; Venkatasubramanian’s book forces the issue, while providing a road map of themes and sources useful for the endeavour.</p>
<p>Let us start with the author’s blistering array of citations of musical manuscripts. In the book’s Preface alone, Venkatasubramanian considers numerous sources typically unmentioned in writings on South Indian music: the encyclopedia of King Somesvara III of Kalyan (1132 <sc>AD</sc>), Jaya-senapati’s treatise <italic>Nrittaratnavali</italic> (1253–54), Chatura Kallinatha’s commentary on the <italic>Sangita Ratnakara</italic> (1446–65) and the Tiruvaduturai Mutt Palm leaf manuscript (1742 <sc>AD</sc>) are a few examples. In some cases, the author tells us where to find a manuscript, as if he hopes we will go out and do so ourselves: one group of <italic>Sankirtanas</italic> in Telugu on Lord Venkatesvara of Tirupati, he says, are ‘engraved on copper plates lying there in the temple’ (p. xiii); the <italic>Sangita Chudamani</italic>, written by Somesvara’s son Jagadegamalla Pratapachakravarti, is ‘available in the Bikaner archives’ (p. xii). Elsewhere, the book provides a list of published works by Indian authors on the famed composer Thyagaraja (p. 71) and a list of Thyagaraja’s compositions (p. 72), followed by a ‘List of Ragas’ by ‘King Sahaji (<sc>AD</sc> 1710)’ (from a manuscript in the Thajai Serfji Mannar Saraswati Mahal Library, Tanjore, catalogue number provided). This list-making concludes with a list of ragas from Thyagaraja that includes the ‘Number of <italic>Krithis</italic> in Each <italic>Raga</italic>’ (pp. 73–75).</p>
<p>The book contains far more of interest to scholars of South Indian music than its vast consideration of musical treatises and its copious lists. In fact, the book contains several discussions of important musical genres and music theoretical topics that are typically left out of studies of South Indian music. Amongst these are the Saivite <italic>Tevaram</italic> hymns, on which more musicological attention needs to fall, and the older ‘melodic’ system of <italic>panns</italic> (p. x), a topic of importance to other Tamil musicologists though barely considered by Western scholars of South Indian music. One of the best chapters, ‘The Legitimacy of Order: Music as Ideology in Ancient and Medieval Tamilakam’ (Chapter 3), suggests that music plays an important role in generating ‘the conception of the king as a faithful servant of god…in the complex economic and social functions of the south Indian temple’ (p. 35), and it is in its opening up of Tamil music to the study of religion, state and society that the book provides a window onto a more nuanced and broadly relevant Indic musicology. As the book progresses, Venkatasubramanian extends his music history to include a brief treatment of the development of Tamil drama, from <italic>terukkuttu</italic> (street theatre) and the <italic>Isai Natya Natakam</italic> (music and dance dramas) of the eighteenth century to the music dramas of Sankara Doss Swamikal (1867–1922).</p>
<p>Amidst all the details, however, it is easy to lose sight of the forest for the trees. This is despite Venkatasubramanian’s attempts to rope Tamil music into larger discussions on ‘Music as an Index of Civilization’ (Chapter 8). To my mind, it is actually the author’s engagement with broader philosophical ideas that weighs the book down, not his compendiums of ragas and manuscripts. In the obviously Weberian ‘Rational and Social Foundations of Music and Dance of Early Tamils’ (Chapter 2), we are told obvious statements (‘To Max Weber, the emergence of Western harmonic music “constitutes an interesting historical problem”’, p. 13) and problematic ones (‘The “relative autonomy” of art and art-history is a Marxist category’, p. 13). Spengler shows up to comment on Tamil folk music; Marx and Weber discuss ‘taste’ in a discussion of ritual music. It is in such moments that Venkatasubramanian would have done well to consult contemporary ethnomusicological literature on Tamil music and anthropological writings on Tamil religiosity (such as those by Arjun Appadurai and Carol Breckenridge), which have much more nuanced things to say about Tamil ritual music than Marx and Weber. Meanwhile, some potentially fascinating topics are grazed over too superficially. Chapter 6, ‘Cultural Production in a pre-Colonial South Indian Town: Tanjore under Nayakas and Marattas’ could have been an excellent ethnohistorical study of music in Tanjore during this period, a meeting of urban ethnomusicology and Indic historical musicology; yet at a mere eight pages long, the chapter does little more than consider the artistic patronage of the Maratta rulers of Tanjore, while providing a list of the ‘shift’ in the ‘science and practice of Karnatak music’ (p. 79) that Venkatasubranian sees as having occurred at that time.</p>
<p>Still, the book’s historical narrative deserves better recognition from Anglo-American ethnomusicologists. Venkatasubramanian situates the birth of South Indian music well before the famous ‘Trinity’ of composers who formulated the Telugu-based ‘Carnatic’ tradition in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Which is to say, instead of founding South Indian music on the <italic>kritis</italic> that define Carnatic tradition, he reaches back to the <italic>sangam</italic> era (third century BC to third century <sc>AD</sc>) and its literature (the <italic>Tolkappiyam</italic> and <italic>Silappatikaram</italic>) to place the beginnings of Tamil song in the <italic>panars</italic> (‘wandering minstrels’, p. 16), Tamil dance in <italic>Velan Veriyatal</italic> (‘rites, rituals, tometic notions and myths’, p. 19), and instrumental music in the harp called <italic>Yazh</italic> (a ‘boat-shaped’ lute, p. 23). He then proceeds diachronically, through the Vaishnavite and Saivite hymns of the Bhakti period, through the Cholas and onwards into the Vijayanagara era, though he stops before the twentieth century. Thus the author makes a strong case for ‘an autonomous history’ of Tamil music. He gives Annamacharya (1408–1503) and Thyagaraja (1767–1847) their due, but they appear as the culmination of Tamil musical tradition, not as innovators who arose <italic>sui generis</italic>. It is hard to disagree with Venkatasubramanian on this point.</p>
<p>The book concludes with a consideration of the life and work of Dr. V. Raghavan, the well known author and Secretary of the Music Academy of Madras, an organization with which he was ‘almost synonymous’ (p. 137) from the 1940s to the 1970s. Venkatasubramanian considers not just Raghavan’s written <italic>oeuvre</italic> but his role in the musical politics of his day, including his ‘condemning the anti-Nautch activities’ (p. 136). Surely the author sees a bit of himself in Raghavan for his commitments to modernity and tradition; Raghavan ‘had the passion to conserve tradition, to examine and determine the correct <italic>lakshana</italic>s of the <italic>raga</italic>s which constituted the wealth of Indian music, to discuss and clarify the <italic>Sastra</italic> and the theory of Indian music and to trace the path of fundamental concepts from Bharata to Sarangadeva and the view of the Karnatak school of Ramamatya, Venkatamakin, Tulaj and others’ (p, 137). The difference between Raghavan and Venkatasubramanian is in the content of their narratives, not the form. In <italic>Music as History in Tamilnadu</italic>, T.K. Venkatasubramian provides what for some ethnomusicologists will seem an overly traditional music history, steeped in old texts and a diachronic history that avoids reference to contemporary ethnomusicology. Yet it is precisely the author’s opening up of South Indian musical texts beyond their theory to an ethnomusicological (or if you wish, ethnohistorical) reading of ‘music as history’ in the Tamil country that paves the way for a more detailed history of Tamil music over the <italic>longue durée</italic>, which waits to be written.</p>
