<abstract>
<p>The overrepresentation of felony-related incidents is a distinctive and interesting feature of eldercide. The current study examines the relationship between macro-level elderly-specific lifestyle and routine daily activity measures and felony-related eldercide in 195 American cities. Results from a negative binomial log-rate model indicate that the percentages of older adults living alone and with disability and the robbery rate (a proxy for exposure to felony-related eldercide) were positively associated with rates of felony-related eldercide. The relationship between the percentage of older adults not working and felony-related eldercide rates was also statistically significant but in an unexpected negative direction.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Despite high fear of crime among older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1088767912438713">Smith &amp; Torstensson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1088767912438713">Weinrath &amp; Gartrell, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1088767912438713">Yin, 1980</xref>), previous studies have consistently shown that older adults’ risk of homicide victimization is much less compared to younger groups (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1088767912438713">Bachman &amp; Meloy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1088767912438713">Copeland, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1088767912438713">Fox &amp; Levin, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1088767912438713">Nelsen &amp; Huff-Corzine, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1088767912438713">Riedel, Zahn, &amp; Mock, 1985</xref>). Using 1976 to 1985 Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR) data, Fox and Levin found that the rate of homicide against people aged 65 and more was less than half of the rate against younger people, and more recent figures show a similar picture: In 2005, there were 1.73 homicides per 100,000 population among those aged 65 and older compared to 5.40 per 100,000 population among those 64 and younger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1088767912438713">Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2005</xref>). Eldercides are relatively rare events, constituting in 2005 only 4.3% of all homicides in which victim’s age was recorded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1088767912438713">Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2005</xref>). However, they are likely to become more frequent in absolute terms, and represent a greater share of all homicides, as aging baby boomers create a much larger population of older adults in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1088767912438713">Collins &amp; Presnell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1088767912438713">Krienert &amp; Walsh, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1088767912438713">Weaver, Martin, &amp; Petee, 2004</xref>). The proportion of persons aged 65 and older is projected to grow from the current (2005) 12% to about 20% in 2025 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1088767912438713">U.S. Census Bureau, 2005</xref>). The result will likely be increasing prominence of eldercide, and police responses to this emerging social problem will require better understanding of this crime’s correlates.</p>
<p>Previous researchers have pointed out that a distinctive and interesting feature of homicide against older adults is the overrepresentation of felony-related incidents. In the younger population, a large proportion of homicide occurs in the context of arguments or fights between family members, intimates, or friends. In contrast, older adults are more often killed during the course of a felony, such as robbery, burglary, theft, and rape, than in an argument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1088767912438713">Copeland, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1088767912438713">Fox &amp; Levin, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1088767912438713">Kennedy &amp; Silverman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1088767912438713">Maxfield, 1989</xref>). Based on lifestyle/exposure and routine activities perspectives, previous scholars have explained that conditions of failing health, inactivity, and social isolation might decrease older adults’ risk of conflict homicide by reducing the frequency and intensity of arguments with others. However, those same lifestyle and routine activities specific to older adults may increase the risk of felony-related homicides by decreasing guardianship, and hence, increasing target attractiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1088767912438713">Fox &amp; Levin, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1088767912438713">Kennedy &amp; Silverman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1088767912438713">Nelsen &amp; Huff-Corzine, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1088767912438713">Weaver et al., 2004</xref>). Using city-level aggregated data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1088767912438713">Fox and Swatt’s (2007)</xref> imputed SHR, the current article examines the association between macro-level elderly lifestyle and routine activity measures and felony-related eldercide rates. Furthermore, to check the specificity of results for felony-related eldercide, we apply the same model to data on rates of argument-related eldercide.</p>

<sec id="section2-1088767912438713">
<title>Lifestyle/Exposure and Routine Activities Perspectives</title>
<p>Traditional theories of crime mainly focus on offenders’ criminality or criminal disposition—why certain individuals are more prone than others to commit crime—as a cause of crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1088767912438713">Clarke &amp; Felson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1088767912438713">Eck &amp; Weisburd, 1995</xref>). Lifestyle/exposure and routine activities perspectives instead focus on victims’ lifestyles or routine daily activities and how these provide opportunities for different kinds of crime victimization to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1088767912438713">Cohen &amp; Felson, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1088767912438713">Hindelang, Gottfredson, &amp; Garofalo, 1978</xref>). According to Hindelang et al.’s lifestyle/exposure perspective, an individual’s demographic and socioeconomic status (e.g., age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, and income) influence his or her lifestyle and everyday routine activities, in turn increasing his or her exposure to high-risk situations potentially leading to crime victimization. Similarly, the lifestyle/exposure perspective suggests that aggregate lifestyle characteristics of sociodemographic groups lead to different victimization rates among these groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1088767912438713">Hindelang et al., 1978</xref>).</p>
<p>The routine activities perspective argues that the necessary conditions for criminal victimization to occur are the presence of an offender inclined and able to carry out the offense, a suitable target for the offense, and a lack of guardians against the offense. In practice, this approach has focused more on the latter two elements, while simply assuming a constant flow of motivated and capable offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1088767912438713">Cohen &amp; Felson, 1979</xref>). Offenders assess the suitability of targets based on factors such as value, accessibility, and ease of establishing physical control. Guardianship primarily stems from informal protection of potential crime targets by citizens, including the target and his or her family members, intimates, housemates, friends, and neighbors, rather than formal protection by the police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1088767912438713">Cohen &amp; Felson, 1979</xref>). The routine activities perspective argues that structural change in people’s everyday activities and lifestyles can “influence crime rates by affecting the convergence in space and time” of those key components of criminal victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1088767912438713">Cohen &amp; Felson, 1979</xref>, p. 589). For example, this approach argues that increasing activities away from home (e.g., increased female labor force participation, school attendance, out-of-town travel, and leisure activities) and the growing popularity of expensive portable goods were responsible for the increase in burglary rates that most industrialized countries experienced during the post–World War II era. As households were more often unguarded, with more attractive objects to steal, more became suitable targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1088767912438713">Felson &amp; Clarke, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Lifestyle and routine activity perspectives are compatible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1088767912438713">Garofalo, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1088767912438713">Maxfield, 1987</xref>) and both suggest that lifestyles or routine activities specific to a particular group can explain the criminal victimization pattern of its members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1088767912438713">Cohen &amp; Felson, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1088767912438713">Hindelang et al., 1978</xref>). Certainly, older adults in the United States are diverse in health, physical activity, and lifestyle characteristics, but the inevitable changes associated with aging make older adults’ lifestyle and daily activities distinct from those of younger groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1088767912438713">Nelsen &amp; Huff-Corzine, 1998</xref>). In the next section, we explore elderly homicide victimization patterns and the role of the elderly population’s characteristic lifestyles and routine daily activities.</p>
<sec id="section3-1088767912438713">
<title>Lifestyle and Routine Activities Perspectives, and Homicide Against Older Adults</title>
<p>As noted previously, studies consistently show much lower overall homicide victimization rates among older adults than among younger persons (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1088767912438713">Abrams, Leon, Tardiff, Marzuk, &amp; Sutherland, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1088767912438713">Fox &amp; Levin, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1088767912438713">Nelsen &amp; Huff-Corzine, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1088767912438713">Riedel et al., 1985</xref>). Also, by examining homicide victimization rates disaggregated by different circumstances, previous studies found that although arguments with family members, intimates, or friends represent the most common circumstance surrounding homicides against younger victims, this is not the case for elderly victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1088767912438713">Ahmed &amp; Menzies, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1088767912438713">Fox &amp; Levin, 1991</xref>). According to lifestyle/exposure and routine activities perspectives, the different lifestyle and routine daily activities associated with aging contribute to lower overall homicide victimization, especially in the argument context.</p>
<p>The natural aging process means that older adults are more likely than younger people to suffer from various physical and cognitive impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1088767912438713">Nelsen &amp; Huff-Corzine, 1998</xref>). In 2000, 42% of the population aged 65 and older suffered from physical, mental, sensory, self-care, or go-outside-home disability that interfered with daily activities, compared to only 16% of the population younger than 65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1088767912438713">U.S. Census Bureau, 2005</xref>). Studies have also found that older adults with disabilities avoid activities outside of their homes and become socially isolated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1088767912438713">Hawkley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1088767912438713">Hawthorne, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1088767912438713">Stoller, 1984</xref>). In addition to failing physical and mental health, older adults’ tendency to live alone worsens social isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1088767912438713">Nelsen &amp; Huff-Corzine, 1998</xref>). In 2000, 30% of persons aged 65 and more lived alone, whereas only 8% of persons younger than 65 did (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1088767912438713">U.S. Census Bureau, 2005</xref>). Substantial fear of crime among older adults further contributes to social isolation. Despite older Americans’ lower overall victimization rate, fear of crime is a greater concern for older adults (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1088767912438713">Smith &amp; Torstensson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1088767912438713">Weinrath &amp; Gartrell, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1088767912438713">Yin, 1980</xref>). As a precautionary strategy against criminal victimization, many older adults avoid leaving home unless absolutely necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1088767912438713">Miethe, Stafford, &amp; Sloane, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1088767912438713">Payne &amp; Gainey, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>This kind of social isolation and inactivity can have many negative effects on older adults’ quality of life. In fact, some studies have shown that social isolation and home confinement may affect, as well as be affected by, health (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1088767912438713">Cornwell &amp; Waite, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1088767912438713">Tomaka, Thompson, &amp; Palacios, 2006</xref>). However, socially isolated and inactive lifestyles may be beneficial in one respect by decreasing the risk of argument-related eldercide. Older adults’ involvement in violent quarrels is already much lower than is the case for their younger counterparts because their intimates, friends, and associates are likely to be older and less volatile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1088767912438713">Fox &amp; Levin, 1991</xref>). By reducing interaction with others, especially strangers in public places (e.g., streets, sporting events, bars), social isolation and inactivity among older adults further reduces exposure to arguments and fights that are classic precursors to homicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1088767912438713">Fox &amp; Levin, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1088767912438713">Kennedy &amp; Silverman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1088767912438713">Nelsen &amp; Huff-Corzine, 1998</xref>). As a consequence, the proportion of elderly homicides that are argument related is smaller than that of homicides with younger adult victims.</p>
<p>In a lifestyle characterized by impairment, inactivity, and social isolation, the main homicide risk stems from being targeted by a stranger as a felony victim in one’s own home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1088767912438713">Abrams et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1088767912438713">Copeland, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1088767912438713">Kennedy &amp; Silverman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1088767912438713">Nelsen &amp; Huff-Corzine, 1998</xref>). Frail and socially isolated older adults are poorly guarded by themselves and others and, thus, will be perceived as attractive and easy targets by potential felony, especially robbery, offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1088767912438713">Fox &amp; Levin, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1088767912438713">Kennedy &amp; Silverman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1088767912438713">Nelsen &amp; Huff-Corzine, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1088767912438713">Weaver et al., 2004</xref>). Elderly victims are also more obedient during the course of crime incidents. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1088767912438713">Klaus (2005)</xref> estimated from 1993-2002 National Crime Victimization Survey data that only about half of elderly victims of violent attacks resist their offenders, compared to more than 70% of younger attack victims. A general belief that older people are wealthier and own more material goods will also contribute to their attractiveness as targets of theft-related felonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1088767912438713">Nelsen &amp; Huff-Corzine, 1998</xref>). Inactive and home-confined older adults living in low daytime occupancy areas are especially at risk for felony-related homicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1088767912438713">Nelsen &amp; Huff-Corzine, 1998</xref>). Elderly residents in such areas lack informal protection by neighbors and will thus be perceived by property offenders as easy marks. Moreover, offenders prowling low daytime occupancy areas might not expect the presence of elderly residents in targeted homes. When unexpected encounters occur, offenders’ general perception of older adults’ weakness makes them more likely to attack (and kill) older residents instead of fleeing the scene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1088767912438713">Conklin, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1088767912438713">Nelsen &amp; Huff-Corzine, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Older persons’ poor health condition, impairment, and/or lack of resiliency may also contribute to a higher likelihood that a felony incident becomes a homicide. Older adults are more likely than younger people to die from injuries incurred in crime victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1088767912438713">Abrams et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1088767912438713">Chu &amp; Kraus, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1088767912438713">Faggiani &amp; Owens, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1088767912438713">Hirschel &amp; Rubin, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1088767912438713">Kennedy &amp; Silverman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1088767912438713">Nelsen &amp; Huff-Corzine, 1998</xref>). Chu and Kraus’s analysis of National Incident-Based Reporting System data found that even after controlling for firearm use and other factors that may influence injury severity, persons aged 65 and older are more likely than younger victims to die during any sort of assaultive attack. Furthermore, a lethal outcome for elderly victims is much more likely during felony-related than during argument-related assaults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1088767912438713">Chu &amp; Kraus, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Previous Studies on Felony-Related Eldercide</title>
<p>Consistent with the argument of lifestyle/exposure and routine activity perspectives, descriptive studies have found that the proportion of homicides that are felony related increases for older (especially those older than 65) victims. According to Fox and Levin, in 1976-1985, SHR data the proportion of felony-related homicide was 21.8% for victims aged less than 50 years but increased to 34.4% for victims aged 50 to 64 years and 55.5% for victims aged 65 and older. Among felony-related eldercides, the most common circumstance was robbery, followed by other felony, burglary, and rape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1088767912438713">Fox &amp; Levin, 1991</xref>). Focusing on U.S. metropolitan areas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1088767912438713">Maxfield (1989)</xref> also found that older adults are disproportionately victimized in instrumental homicides, mostly involving theft-related offenses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1088767912438713">Bachman and Meloy (2008)</xref> found similar results to Fox and Levin, and Maxfield, in a longer span (1976-2004) of SHR data, indicating the consistency of these attributes of eldercide over time. The older adults’ tendency to be victimized in felony-related homicides also has been shown in various U.S. localities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1088767912438713">Collins &amp; Presnell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1088767912438713">Copeland, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1088767912438713">Keil &amp; Vito, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1088767912438713">Nelsen &amp; Huff-Corzine, 1998</xref>) and in Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1088767912438713">Ahmed &amp; Menzies, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1088767912438713">Kennedy &amp; Silverman, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>A few studies have used multivariate analyses to explore the homicide victimization patterns of older adults. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1088767912438713">Kennedy and Silverman’s (1990)</xref> analysis of incident-level Canadian homicide data showed that the odds that a homicide is theft related are higher for elderly than for younger victims, even after controlling for the age of offender, victim–offender relationship, location of the incident, gender of the victim, and method of attack. Using homicide data from Kentucky between 1976 and 1986, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1088767912438713">Keil and Vito (1991)</xref> examined the relationship between victim’s age and seriousness of homicide. One seriousness measure was presence of a concurrent felony offense. Keil and Vito found that an elderly victim’s homicide was more likely to be felony related than a younger victim’s, controlling for other incident characteristics, including victim–offender relationship and racial combination.</p>
<p>Nelsen and Huff-Corzine also examined the influence of victim’s age on type of homicide (theft-related, conflict, and unknown circumstance) in incident-level homicide data from Chicago between 1965 and 1981. As in the analyses by Kennedy and Silverman and by Keil and Vito, Nelsen and Huff-Corzine also included other incident characteristics such as victim’s sex, victim–offender relationship, weapon type, and location of the homicide incident. Their multinomial logistic regression results indicated that the risk that a homicide was theft related rather than argument related increased with victim’s age. Kennedy and Silverman and Nelsen and Huff-Corzine explained the older adults’ tendency for homicides to be theft related as stemming from the fact that elderly people’s lifestyle and routine daily activities are more often characterized by inactivity and social isolation than are younger people’s. However, these models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1088767912438713">Keil &amp; Vito, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1088767912438713">Kennedy &amp; Silverman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1088767912438713">Nelsen &amp; Huff-Corzine, 1998</xref>) of eldercide patterns did not include any direct measures of lifestyle and routine activities (e.g., living arrangement, employment and marital status, presence or absence of disability), so this explanation could not be explicitly tested.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1088767912438713">Weaver et al.’s (2004)</xref> study explored the association between a macro-level measure of the elderly population’s lifestyle/routine daily activities (the percentage of older adults living alone) and county-level eldercide rates. Weaver et al. found that the percentage of older adults living alone did not have the significant association with eldercide rates that would be expected by lifestyle/routine activities perspectives. The absence of such an effect of the percentage of older adults living alone may be due to the use of a combined eldercide measure as the dependent variable, rather than one in which eldercide rates were disaggregated by circumstance. As discussed earlier, the social isolation inherent in living alone is expected to decrease exposure to argument-related eldercide but increase exposure to felony-related eldercide. The combined eldercide measure may, therefore, show no association with the isolation measure.</p>

<title>Current Study</title>
<p>Even though the homicide victimization rate among older adults is much lower than that among nonelderly persons, continuing elderly population growth will almost certainly increase the absolute number of elderly homicide victimizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1088767912438713">Collins &amp; Presnell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1088767912438713">Krienert &amp; Walsh, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1088767912438713">Weaver et al., 2004</xref>). Also, the various descriptive and multivariate studies discussed earlier indicate that the circumstance of elderly victimizations is more likely to be felony related than is the case for younger persons’ victimizations. This suggests that more research attention be directed toward understanding felony-related eldercide.</p>
<p>Lifestyle/exposure and routine activities perspectives suggest that older adults whose lifestyle and routine activities are characterized by physical and cognitive impairment, inactivity, and social isolation face increased risk of felony-related homicide victimization. Although this and related issues have been studied by researchers, there is still room for substantive extensions to the existing empirical literature. Most previous studies on felony-related eldercide are descriptive, and although the few incident-level multivariate studies that examined victim’s age and risk of felony-related homicides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1088767912438713">Keil &amp; Vito, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1088767912438713">Kennedy &amp; Silverman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1088767912438713">Nelsen &amp; Huff-Corzine, 1998</xref>) explained findings of the older adults’ tendency toward felony-related homicide victimization by their isolated lifestyles and inactivity, those analyses did not include direct measures of lifestyles or routine activities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1088767912438713">Weaver et al.’s (2004)</xref> macro-level work not only used a more direct measure of the older adults’ lifestyle and routine activities (the proportion of older adults living alone); it also used the total eldercide rates as the dependent variable and, therefore, did not specifically explore felony-related eldercide.</p>
<p>The current study explores the relationship between a more comprehensive list of macro-level elderly impairment, inactivity, and social isolation measures and felony-related eldercide in relatively large U.S. cities. We adopt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1088767912438713">Weaver et al.’s (2004)</xref> interest in macro-level eldercide rates and lifestyle and routine activity measures, while also following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1088767912438713">Kennedy and Silverman (1990)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1088767912438713">Keil and Vito (1991)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1088767912438713">Nelsen and Huff-Corzine’s (1998)</xref> focus on felony-related eldercide. Following the emphasis of lifestyle and routine activity perspectives on crime-specific relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1088767912438713">Clarke &amp; Felson, 2008</xref>), we investigate the specificity of independent variables’ associations with felony-related eldercide by applying the same model to data on argument-related eldercide rates.</p>

<title>Data and Methods</title>
<sec id="section7-1088767912438713">
<title>Data</title>
<p>We used a subset of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1088767912438713">Fox and Swatt’s (2007)</xref> imputed SHR file to obtain data on circumstance-specific elderly homicide victimization. Like other official data, the regular SHR data are subject to item-missing (when some requested information— demographic characteristics of victim and offender, victim–offender relationship, circumstance, and so on—is missing in a recorded homicide incident) and unit-missing (when some homicides are not reported by police agencies and are therefore unrecorded) problems. Discarding item-missing incidents or ignoring unit-missing incidents would waste potential information and, because in crime research data are highly unlikely to be missing completely at random, potentially bias results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1088767912438713">Riedel &amp; Regoeczi, 2004</xref>). Fox and Swatt created an SHR file containing data from 1976 to 2007 that attempts to address these problems. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1088767912438713">Fox and Swatt (2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1088767912438713">2009</xref>) address item missingness with a Bayesian Imputation Posterior multiple imputation method, using data from SHR variables that were not or only infrequently missing as independent variables in a log-linear model to predict values for the SHR variables that tend to be missing. Multiple draws from the resulting posterior distribution give multiple imputations for a particular missing value (used to create multiple imputed data sets). Unit missing data were addressed by a weighting routine that utilized information from both the <italic>Uniform Crime Report</italic> (UCR) and National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) to impute the number of homicides for each unit (agency). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1088767912438713">Fox and Swatt (2009)</xref> present additional information on these imputation procedures and provide a validity check that suggests that these data provide a useful solution to missing SHR data.</p>
<p>The data set provides five imputed data sets. Using the 2000-2005 portion of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1088767912438713">Fox and Swatt’s (2007)</xref> data sets,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1088767912438713">1</xref></sup> we calculated the number of felony- and argument-related eldercides for each city in each of the five imputed data sets. In Fox and Swatt’s imputed data, “felony” includes rape, robbery, burglary, larceny, auto theft, arson, prostitution, other sex offense, narcotics laws, gambling, other felony, and abortion. “Argument” included lover’s triangle, killed by babysitter, brawl under alcohol or alcohol, argument over money, and other arguments (M. Swatt, personal communication, July 26, 2011). Of course, abortion and killed by babysitter are not relevant to eldercide. Also, no eldercide incidents were associated with gambling in the 2000-2005 data.</p>
<p>The resulting five city-level eldercide data sets were then linked to 2000 Census and 2000 Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics data to obtain measures of the independent variables. To ensure comparability of data from these sources, analysis was restricted to city jurisdictions with populations 100,000 or more in 2000. The final sample consisted of 195 cities with an average population of 337,056, a minimum population of 100,316, and a maximum population of 8,008,278; the complete list of cities can be provided upon request.</p>

<sec id="section8-1088767912438713">
<title>Negative Binomial Regression</title>
<p>Due to the rare nature of eldercide, especially when disaggregated by crime circumstances, we maintained our dependent variable as a count variable. Count variables are ill-suited for OLS (ordinary least square) regression and are typically examined using count-specific techniques such as Poisson or negative binomial regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1088767912438713">Osgood, 2000</xref>). Preliminary analysis via likelihood ratio tests comparing equivalent Poisson and negative binomial regression models indicated that the eldercide count data were overdispersed. Overdispersion (excess variance) violates a key assumption of Poisson regression, and in such cases, the negative binomial regression model, with an additional parameter to account for overdispersion, is typically preferred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1088767912438713">Osgood, 2000</xref>). All models use the natural log of city noninstitutionalized population 65 and older as the offset or exposure variable, thereby controlling for population at risk and permitting interpretation of the negative binomial regression as a log-rate model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1088767912438713">Osgood, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, we constructed five city-level data sets originating from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1088767912438713">Fox and Swatt’s (2007)</xref> five imputed incident-level SHR files. Negative binomial regression results from the five data sets were combined in SAS PROC MIANALYZE. Reported estimates reflect averages across the five data sets, and estimated standard errors include variability across the five data sets (from the multiple imputation process) as well as the usual uncertainty in parameter estimates.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1088767912438713">
<title>Dependent Variables</title>
<p>Dependent variables for the current analysis are counts of felony- and argument-related homicides against the population aged 65 and older. As discussed earlier, we aggregated the 2000-2005 portion of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1088767912438713">Fox and Swatt’s (2007)</xref> imputed SHR data to obtain city-level counts of eldercide for different circumstances. Note that this means that negative binomial regression coefficients refer to 5-year rather than 1-year eldercide rates.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1088767912438713">
<title>Independent Variables</title>
<p>Macro-level indicators of elderly lifestyle/exposure or routine daily activities characterized by impairment, inactivity, and social isolation were each city’s percentages of older adults living alone, with disability, and not working. The percentages of older adults living alone, with disability, and not employed were based on the number of persons aged 65 and older living alone (in households); the number of noninstitutionalized persons aged 65 and older with physical, sensory, and/or mental disabilities; and the number of persons 65 and older who are not employed, respectively. Each figure was divided by the total noninstitutionalized population aged 65 and older and multiplied by 100. Cities with high percentages of older adults living alone, with disability, and not working will have high levels of social isolation, impairment, and inactivity among older adults, creating greater opportunity for felony-related eldercide. On the other hand, high levels of inactivity and social isolation should decrease argument-related eldercide by limiting older adults’ interaction with others, thereby limiting their overall exposure to situations at risk for arguments that could lead to violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1088767912438713">Nelsen &amp; Huff-Corzine, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1088767912438713">Weaver et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to impairment, inactivity, and social isolation measures, we also included two opportunity variables specific to felony-related eldercide: daytime nonoccupancy and robbery rate. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1088767912438713">Nelsen and Huff-Corzine (1998)</xref>, areas with high daytime nonoccupancy create high-risk situations for felony-related eldercide, especially in the context of offenders surprising robbery and burglary victims. The 2000 Census does not provide a comprehensive daytime occupancy measure. However, we were able to construct one as follows. For family households, we found the number of family households in which both husband and wife worked. For nonfamily households,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1088767912438713">2</xref></sup> a daytime nonoccupancy total was estimated as the number of nonfamily households times the proportion of the population that is working (either in the armed forces or employed in the civilian labor force). Then an overall daytime nonoccupancy rate was calculated by dividing the number of family and (estimated) nonfamily households unoccupied during the daytime by the total number of households, times 100. We expect that daytime nonoccupancy is positively associated with felony-related eldercide rates but has no association with argument-related eldercide rates.</p>
<p>Following Weaver et al., the current analysis also included robbery rate (for all ages) per 100,000 population as a proxy for exposure to the possibility of felony-related eldercide. Robbery is the main circumstance surrounding felony-related eldercide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1088767912438713">Copeland, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1088767912438713">Nelsen &amp; Huff-Corzine, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1088767912438713">Weaver et al., 2004</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1088767912438713">3</xref></sup> Studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1088767912438713">Conklin, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1088767912438713">Gregory &amp; McCabe, 1998</xref>) also have found a higher robbery victimization rate among older adults than among younger age groups. We expect that the overall robbery rate has a positive association with felony-related eldercide but no association with argument-related eldercide.</p>
<p>To assess the likely offender pool unique to felony-related eldercide, we explored the typical eldercide offender’s age. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1088767912438713">Fox and Swatt’s (2007)</xref> missing data imputation gave offender’s age in intervals (younger than 18, aged between 18 and 24, 25 and 34, 35 and 49, and aged 50 and older) rather than precise figures. In our sample of 195 cities, the largest share (29%) of felony-related eldercide was committed by offenders aged 35 to 49, followed by those between the ages of 18 and 24 (26%) and those between 25 and 34 (25%). Offenders from the youngest (younger than 18) and oldest (50 and older) groups committed much smaller proportions of felony-related eldercide (7% and 13%, respectively). Adjusting these proportions for the age group sizes, the 18 to 24 age group had the highest eldercide offending rate (1.87 per 100,000), followed by those younger than 18 (1.48 per 100,000 when using the 15- to 17-year-old population size), aged between 25 and 34 (1.24 per 100,000), aged between 35 and 49 (1.08 per 100,000), and aged 50 and older (0.47 per 100,000). We, therefore, included the proportion of a city’s population aged 18 to 24 as a measure of the likely offender pool. We expect that this measure of likely offender pool is positively associated with felony-related, but not argument-related, eldercide rates. Unlike for felony-related homicides, the 50 and older age group had the largest share (34%) of offenders for argument-related eldercide. Because argument-related homicide does not involve the same sort of target selection as felony-related homicide, most conflict-related homicides are committed by intimates, friends, and associates who are close in age to the victim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1088767912438713">Fox &amp; Levin, 1991</xref>). Finally, we included logged total (all ages) city population as a control variable. Information needed to calculate all independent variables except for the robbery rate was taken from the 2000 Census. Data for robbery rate was derived from 2000 <italic>Uniform Crime Reports</italic>.

<title>Results</title>
<p>Before discussing the negative binomial regression results, we first describe our data on different types of homicide by victim’s age.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1088767912438713">Table 1</xref> indicates the average frequency and percentage of felony-related, argument-related, and other homicide by age group in the five imputed data sets. (We included “other” homicides in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1088767912438713">Table 1</xref>, but the “other” category involves very heterogeneous circumstances such as gang killing, youth gang killing, sniper attacks, institutional killing, other, and suspected felony.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1088767912438713">4</xref></sup> This gives the “other” category less theoretical interest, and we do not present multivariate models for it.) The figures support the consensus that older adults are less likely than younger age groups to be homicide victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1088767912438713">Fox &amp; Levin, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1088767912438713">Nelsen &amp; Huff-Corzine, 1998</xref>).

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1088767912438713">Table 2</xref> shows results of negative binomial log-rate models for felony- and argument-related eldercide. Variance inflation factor scores for all independent variables were less than 4 and indicated no substantial multicollinearity problems among the independent variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1088767912438713">Menard, 1995</xref>) for all models in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1088767912438713">Table 2</xref>.</p>
<p>The first two columns of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1088767912438713">Table 2</xref> give results for felony-related eldercide. Among social isolation and inactivity measures, percentages of older adults living alone and with disability were significantly and, as expected, positively associated with felony-related eldercide rates, net of other factors in the model. In the log-rate model, e<sup>b</sup> is the multiplicative effect<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1088767912438713">6</xref></sup> on the expected rate. As the percentage of older adults living alone increased by 5, the expected rate of felony-related eldercide increased almost 20%.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1088767912438713">7</xref></sup> The expected rate of felony-related eldercide increased 64% for each additional 5% of older adults with disability. The association between older adults not employed and felony-related eldercide was also statistically significant but in the unexpected negative direction. A 1 percentage point increase in older adults not working was associated with a 10.3% reduction in the expected rate of felony-related eldercide.</p>
<p>Robbery rates were significantly and positively associated with felony-related eldercide rates, supporting the view that frequent robbery incidents create high risk for felony-related homicide among older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1088767912438713">Nelsen &amp; Huff-Corzine, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1088767912438713">Weaver et al., 2004</xref>). The expected rate of felony-related eldercide increased 3.4% with an increase of 30 per 100,000 in the robbery rate. Daytime nonoccupancy, the likely offender pool, and logged total population were not significantly associated with felony-related eldercide rates.</p>
<p>To check the specificity of the associations between felony-related eldercide and social isolation and inactivity variables, we applied the same model to argument-related eldercide. Following previous researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1088767912438713">Fox &amp; Levin, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1088767912438713">Kennedy &amp; Silverman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1088767912438713">Nelsen &amp; Huff-Corzine, 1998</xref>), we expected social isolation and inactivity measures (percentages of older adults living alone, with disability, and not working) to have negative associations with argument-related eldercide. Other variables specific to felony-related eldercide opportunity (daytime nonoccupancy, likely offender pool, and robbery rate) were expected to have no association with argument-related eldercide. The latter two columns of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1088767912438713">Table 2</xref> show results for argument-related eldercide. Unlike the findings for felony-related eldercide, the relationship between percentage of older adults living alone and argument-related eldercide rates was not statistically significant. The significance of the percentage of older adults living alone is therefore unique to felony-related eldercide.</p>
<p>For other variables, results (statistical significance and direction) were similar for argument- and felony-related eldercide. As with felony-related eldercide, the percentage of older adults with disability had a significant and positive relationship with argument-related eldercide. This result was unexpected, as we hypothesized that social isolation and inactivity indicated by high percentage of older adults with disability should decrease argument-related eldercide by reducing exposure to confrontations with others. The percentage of older adults not employed was significantly and negatively associated with both types of eldercide. Although it was expected to influence only felony-related eldercide, robbery rate was also significantly and positively related to argument-related eldercide. These results are consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1088767912438713">Weaver et al.’s (2004)</xref> finding of a statistically significant association between robbery rate and total eldercide. Note too that the sizes of those variables’ effects were similar for felony- and argument-related eldercide rates. As expected, daytime nonoccupancy and likely offender pool, both theoretically specific to felony-related eldercide, were not significantly related to argument-related eldercide. As those two variables were also unrelated to felony-related eldercide rates, percentage of older adults living alone is the only one of these variables associated specifically with felony-related eldercide.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>The current study explored the relationship between city-level measures of elderly social isolation and inactivity and felony-related eldercide rates. Based on lifestyle and routine activity perspectives, previous researchers posited that socially isolated and inactive lifestyles make the older adults as a group vulnerable to felony-related homicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1088767912438713">Fox &amp; Levin, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1088767912438713">Kennedy &amp; Silverman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1088767912438713">Nelsen &amp; Huff-Corzine, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1088767912438713">Weaver et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, we expected social isolation and inactivity measures (percentages of older adults living alone, with disability, and not working) to be positively related to felony-related eldercide rates. Negative binomial log-rate model results indicated that two measures of social isolation and inactivity, the percentage of older adults living alone and with disability, were significantly related to felony-related eldercide in the expected positive direction.</p>
<p>The significance of the percentage of older adults living alone was specific to felony-related eldercide. This, along with the nonsignificant effect of that variable on <italic>overall</italic> eldercide in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1088767912438713">Weaver et al. (2004)</xref>, shows the importance of disaggregating eldercides by circumstance. On the other hand, the percentage of older adults with disability was positively related to both felony- and argument-related eldercide rates. This result might be explained by the likely need for daily activity assistance among the impaired elderly population. Although in some cases this assistance would be given by an elderly spouse or sibling, children or many hired caregivers would be younger and potentially volatile. The difficulty and stress of caring for a disabled elderly person might lead to arguments involving violence. This reasoning suggests that it is at least plausible that a greater percentage of impairment in the elderly population could increase argument-related eldercide by increasing interaction with a younger population of caregivers. At the same time, home confinement, frailness, and lack of resiliency from injury leaves the population of older adults with disability at increased risk of felony-related eldercide.</p>
<p>The percentage of older adults not working was significantly associated with felony-related eldercide, but in the unexpected negative direction, so that a greater percentage of older adults working is associated with more felony-related eldercide. The same sort of relationship was also apparent for argument-related eldercide. One possible explanation for this is that the working older adults are at high risk of workplace violence and homicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1088767912438713">Loomis, Richardson, Wolf, Runyan, &amp; Butts, 1997</xref>). Although overall homicide victimization is consistently lower for older adults, figures from Loomis et al. indicated that the workplace homicide victimization rate for older adults is much higher than that for younger age groups. Also, those working older adults who commute and return from work late at night may be at additional risk of violent victimization. Further disaggregating eldercides by location (i.e., eldercide at home vs. eldercide at work or other public places) would be valuable for understanding such situational variation. The difference in type of opportunity (exposure) implicit in this distinction suggests that the percentage of older adults not employed should be positively associated with home eldercide but negatively with workplace eldercide (or eldercide at other locations outside the home). This may be a difficult project for future research, as currently SHR does not report the location of homicides, and local data or nonnationally representative NIBRS (National Incidence-Based Reporting System, which excludes many large cities) are unlikely to provide enough observations to reasonably disaggregate eldercides by location without pooling data from very long time spans.</p>
<p>In addition to the elderly lifestyle and routine activity measures, we also included other variables specific to felony-related eldercide. Among those measures, daytime nonoccupancy and likely offender pool did not have statistically significant associations with felony-related eldercide rates. Robbery rate was significantly and positively associated with felony-related eldercide; this was expected, given that robbery-related eldercide is the main component of felony-related eldercide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1088767912438713">Copeland, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1088767912438713">Nelsen &amp; Huff-Corzine, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1088767912438713">Weaver et al., 2004</xref>) and is consistent with the argument that robbery incidents are a key element of older adults’ exposure to felony-related homicide. However, robbery rate was also significantly and positively related to argument-related eldercide rates, so it is interesting that this association was not specific to the felony circumstance. This suggests that robbery is an indicator of general violence in the city as well as a measure of exposure to felony-related eldercide. These findings are consistent with the significant effect of robbery rate on total eldercide in Weaver et al. With the percentages of older adults with disability and not working and robbery rates all associated with both felony- and argument-related eldercides (and, within each variable, in the same direction), we expect that structural change in those factors will be accompanied by similar changes in rates of both types of eldercide. On the other hand, changes in the proportion of older adults living alone will likely influence felony-related eldercide rates only.</p>
<p>Although the current study profitably extended previous work on eldercide by exploring macro-level relationships with elderly lifestyle and routine activity measures, it is important to also note its shortcomings. First, felony- and argument-related eldercides might not be as conceptually distinct as we treat them here. It is plausible that a substantial number of felony-related eldercides could also involve arguments and anger. This potential overlap could have contributed to the similarity of results for felony- and argument-related eldercide. Also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1088767912438713">Fox and Swatt’s (2007)</xref> imputation method excluded “suspected felony” incidents from the felony-related homicide category; including such incidents with felony-related eldercides could make the felony- and argument-related measures more disparate and lead to more different patterns of results for felony-related and argument-related eldercide. Although two of the three social isolation measures were positively associated with felony-related eldercide, the social isolation measures used here (each city’s percentages of older adults living alone, with disability, and not working) might not fully capture city-level differences in the social networks of older adults. It would be desirable if more direct measures of social isolation, such as average time that older adults spend with family and friends or percentages of older adults who are involved with churches or other organizations, were available at the city level.</p>
<p>Further analyses of incident-level data are of great importance also, as macro-level studies do not permit conclusions about individual lifestyle and activity’s relationship with individual risk of eldercide. However, there are substantial challenges for such future work. Along with the familiar difficulty of obtaining data on an appropriate comparison group of nonvictims, existing incident-level eldercide data have significant limitations. As SHR only reports lethal outcomes, it cannot be used to study the lethality of different crime situations. NIBRS does report on lethal and nonlethal incidents, offense circumstances, and victim’s age but does not include any measures of the victim’s lifestyle and routine activities, such as living arrangement, presence of disability, or employment status. Although it would be desirable for NIBRS to include such information, NIBRS data collection is already burdensome for law enforcement and it seems unlikely that agencies will be asked to supply additional information on each incident. Still, despite these challenges, the incorporation of additional direct measures of lifestyle and routine activities such as frequency and duration of activities outside the home, level of home confinement, and precautionary practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1088767912438713">Miethe et al., 1990</xref>) offers great potential for increasing our understanding of eldercide.</p>
<p>If further individual-level research found that older adults living alone, impaired or working, in fact face greater risk of felony-related homicide victimization, various interventions to increase guardianship over those high-risk groups could be considered. Educational programs to encourage effective precautionary behaviors (e.g., securing their homes) among older adults living alone and/or with impairment might decrease their attractiveness as targets of potential felony offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1088767912438713">Chu &amp; Kraus, 2004</xref>). Increased formal protection by police, including more collaborative relationships between police and local senior citizen groups, may also help check felony-related eldercide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1088767912438713">Bachman &amp; Meloy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1088767912438713">Faggiani &amp; Owens, 1999</xref>). In implementing such guardianship-oriented measures, care must be taken not to simultaneously increase the social interactions with crime-prone populations that may lead to argument-related eldercide. To reduce workplace exposure to felony-related eldercide, elderly workers could be encouraged to avoid high-exposure occupations such as taxi cab driver, grocery store clerk, and security guard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1088767912438713">Kraus, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1088767912438713">Loomis et al, 1997</xref>). Elderly workers’ employers should take exposure and guardianship into account when making work assignments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1088767912438713">Chu &amp; Kraus, 2004</xref>). More generally, it may be a useful preventive strategy for cities to offer free fitness or self-defense classes for older adults.</p>
<p>In addition to such interventions related to lifestyle and daily activities, Chu and Kraus also suggest swift emergency response to elderly violent crime victims as a secondary prevention measure. As discussed earlier, older adults are more likely than younger persons to die from injuries sustained during the course of violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1088767912438713">Abrams et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1088767912438713">Chu &amp; Kraus, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1088767912438713">Faggiani &amp; Owens, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1088767912438713">Hirschel &amp; Rubin, 1982</xref>). Of course, the effectiveness of this secondary intervention effort may be questionable for those older adults who are living alone.</p>
<p>Future research should continue investigating the correlates of eldercide. The relative infrequency of eldercide has led previous age-specific homicide research to mainly focus on homicide victimization of juveniles or younger adults. However, as America’s elderly population continues to grow, we expect that, in absolute terms at least, there will be more homicide victimization of older adults, and we hope that additional innovative studies of eldercide will provide tools for responding to that increased victimization.</p>
