<abstract>
<p>This study investigated the effects of 5-fluorouracil in a slow-release biodegradable gelatin system on tendon healing. Gelatin blocks prepared in a size of 10 × 20 × 1 mm were loaded with 10, 20, and 30 mg of 5–fluorouracil, and 30 adult white Leghorn chickens were used. The tendons to the third and fourth toes were severed and repaired. The extremities were casted for three weeks. After sacrifice, the tendons were examined histologically and biomechanically for adhesion formation. The 10 mg-loaded gelatin group showed a decrease in adhesion formation when compared with the operative control group; the 20 and 30 mg groups showed signs of severe inflammation. Low doses of 5-fluorouracil applied via a slow-release gelatin system reduced adhesion formation in flexor tendon healing.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Despite substantial efforts to prevent them, adhesions may occur after tendon repair, which can lead to functional impairment and delayed healing. Accordingly, attention has been turned to approaches and treatments that may decrease the extrinsic healing mechanism without impairing the internal one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412458646">Branford et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193412458646">2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193412458646">Gelberman et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193412458646">1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193412458646">1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753193412458646">Khan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1753193412458646">Peterson et al., 1990</xref>). Many studies have focused on the use of topically applied pharmacological agents that block the extrinsic mechanism of tendon healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193412458646">Kapetanos, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753193412458646">Lundborg, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753193412458646">Lyras et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753193412458646">Peacock, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1753193412458646">Schneider, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1753193412458646">Tan et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Several studies have shown that 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), an antineoplastic agent, blocks the fibro-osseous fibroblast proliferation associated with the extrinsic healing mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412458646">Akali et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193412458646">Fitzpatrick, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193412458646">Khan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753193412458646">Moran et al., 2000</xref>). Although the exact mechanism of action of 5-FU remains unknown, its effects have inspired studies in which the agent was applied after tendon repair in an attempt to limit adhesion formation. Promising results have emerged from several studies in which repair was augmented with a single shot application of 5-FU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412458646">Akali et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193412458646">Khan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753193412458646">Moran et al., 2000</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1753193412458646">Zhao et al. (2009)</xref> demonstrated that 5-FU does not offer a major benefit over early postoperative motion protocols alone in the treatment of flexor tendon injuries. Various applications and systems have been designed to prolong the therapeutic level of drugs in order to achieve a sustained drug release rate over an extended period of time. Hydrogel or gelatin have been used as implantable carriers to enable drug release into the surrounding tissue. In this study, we applied 5-FU via a slow-releasing gelatin system and investigated its effects on tendon healing in a hen model.</p>

<title>Gelatin block preparation</title>
<p>Gelatin blocks loaded with 5-FU were designed and prepared in the Department of Drug Technology, Faculty of Pharmaceutics. Gelatin of 80 Bloom strength was obtained from Rama Industries Limited (Mumbai, India) and 5-FU was obtained from Biosyn Arzneimittel GmbH (Fellbach, Germany). All other chemicals were analytical grade in quality. To generate control blocks without drugs, gelatin was dispersed in a bath of purified water, and 1 ml of 25% glycerin was added drop-wise to cross-link the gelatin. A 1.5 ml aliquot of the mixture was poured into a 20 × 10 × 1-mm mould (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412458646">Figure 1</xref>) and allowed to stand for 12 h at 4 °C to complete cross-linking. Solidified blocks were taken out of the moulds, plunged into a 50 mM aqueous glycine solution for 1 h at 37 °C, and washed three times. To introduce 5-FU into the blocks, 5-FU solutions were incorporated into gelatin dispersions at 10 mg/1.5 ml, 20 mg/1.5 ml, and 30 mg/1.5 ml before cross-linking.</p>

<title>Drug release from gelatin blocks</title>
<p>The confirm drug release, gelatin blocks were immersed in 20 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) at 37 °C on an orbital shaker. Gelatin blocks without 5-FU were used as controls. At specified intervals, 1 ml aliquots were withdrawn, diluted with PBS, and analysed spectrophotometrically at 265 nm. Release studies demonstrated that the cross-linked gel matrix delayed the drug release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193412458646">Figure 2</xref>). Steady-state release was established after 6 h, suggesting that the gelatin blocks function as continuous delivery vehicles.</p>

<title>Animal study groups</title>
<p>The hen model (described below) was selected for its similarity to the anatomy of the human flexor tendon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753193412458646">Karabagli et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753193412458646">Strick et al., 2005</xref>). Approval from the Ethical Committee of National Research based on the Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals was obtained. The experimental study was conducted using 36 adult white leghorn chickens weighing 2–2.5 kg apiece. The total number of toes used was 72. The experiment was designed using six groups. The third and fourth digits of the right lower limb from each hen were selected for repair. Group 1 (<italic>n</italic> = 12 toes) was the sham group, which included digits from the un-operated, right limbs. Group 2 (<italic>n</italic> = 12 toes) had tendon repairs only. Group 3 (<italic>n</italic> = 12 toes) had tendon repairs wrapped with gelatin blocks with no 5-FU as controls. Group 4 (<italic>n</italic> = 12 toes) had tendon repairs wrapped with 10 mg 5-FU gelatin blocks. Group 5 (<italic>n</italic> = 12 toes) had tendon repairs wrapped with 20 mg 5-FU. Group 6 (<italic>n</italic> = 12 toes) had tendon repairs wrapped with 30 mg 5-FU.</p>

<title>Surgical procedure</title>
<p>Anaesthesia was induced with 30 mg/kg ketamine plus 1 mg/kg diazepam and an additional digital block administration was provided via injection of 1 ml of 2% prilocaine. Under tourniquet and after skin preparation, a rectangular skin flap was elevated through a plantar approach between the proximal and distal creases of the right third and fourth digits including the tendon sheath, and the primary profundus flexor tendon was severed completely with a No. 11 scalpel. The modified Kessler technique was used, and tendon core repair was done using 5-0 atraumatic monofilament polypropylene sutures. The epitenon was repaired with atraumatic 6-0 monofilament polypropylene sutures. The gelatin block was placed under the repaired or explored zone between the tendon and the fibrosseous aspect of the digit and afterwards it was wrapped around it. Finally, the elevated rectangular plantar flap was replaced over the gelatin block and held with continuous over-and-over 4-0 polypropylene sutures. The limb was dressed and a plaster was applied to immobilize the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints. At the third postoperative week, animals were sacrificed using a high dose sodium thiopental injection. The casts were removed. Specimens from the third digit were used for biomechanical testing. Specimens from the fourth digit were used for histopathological examination.</p>

<title>Histological examination</title>
<p>Specimens were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections were cut at 5-μm thickness and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Labelled tissue was evaluated by a pathologist with a light microscope (Axiostar Plus Carl Zeiss Inc, Jena, Germany) according to the adhesion formation scale described by Tang et al.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1753193412458646">1994</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1753193412458646">1996</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753193412458646">Table 1</xref>). Grade 1 was assigned to specimens in which the synovial space was entirely preserved with minimal synovial hyperplasia. Grade 2 was assigned to specimens in which the synovial space was partially preserved with a higher rate of synovial hyperplasia, fibrosis, and local adhesion. Grade 3 was assigned to specimens in which the synovial space was obliterated, and fibrosis and adhesions were observed generally in all areas.</p>

<p>Specimens were fixed in 20% glutaraldehyde, sectioned at 60 μm thickness, and stained with uranyl acetate and zinc acetate.

<title>Biomechanical angular rotation tests</title>
<p>The third digits were kept hydrated in a 0.09% NaCl solution. The biomechanical angular rotation test was done using a custom made device previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412458646">Bhavsar et al., 2010</xref>). The limb was fixed to an apparatus connected to the device with two K-wires from both metacarpal and interphalangeal levels to leave the distal phalangeal (DIP) joint free in motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753193412458646">Figure 3</xref>). Another 20 cm K-wire was introduced in the intramedullary canal of the distal phalanx to be used as a motion indicator. A square at the top was used to measure the angle of rotation of the DIP joint. Afterwards, the tip of the indicator was set at 90° and a mass of 118 g was applied to the free edge of the flexor profundus tendon with an axial power of 1.2 N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753193412458646">Figure 3</xref>). As a result the indicator was displaced with the tendon excursion. All motions were recorded in terms of angular degrees (°).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study was designed to investigate the effects of prolonged administration of increasing dosages of 5-FU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193412458646">Gelberman et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753193412458646">Liu et al, 1995</xref>). Hydrogels or gelatins have been used as implantable carriers to enable a slow release of drugs into surrounding tissue. Many studies have reported successful use of such systems for <italic>in-vivo</italic> local applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412458646">Baroli, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193412458646">Fukui et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753193412458646">Kurita et al., 2011</xref>). Once the system is present in the tissue environment, swelling occurs owing to the aqueous content and hydrolization of the system and it releases the drug in a slow fashion to the surroundings. The carrier itself starts to disintegrate slowly and vanishes by the end of the total drug release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193412458646">Hoare and Kohane, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The cross-linked gelatin matrix delays drug release, and steady-state release was established 6 h after the initial decay, thereby providing continuous drug delivery. The gelatin blocks were mouldable, which allowed the blocks to be securely wrapped around the repair zone of the flexor tendon easily and prevented the possibility of migration away from the operative zone. Moreover, the system provided a widespread application of the drug. Because of the pliable and soft physical properties of the gelatin block, no interference with tendon motion or healing was observed after surgical application.</p>
<p>During inspection of the surgery site, no signs of adhesion were observed beyond the intentional zone of injury in the operated limbs. Histological analysis of sections from the 10 mg 5-FU-treated group revealed a homogenous healing of the tendons with minimal obliteration of the synovial space surrounding the tendon core. Conversely, in the 20 mg and 30 mg 5-FU-treated groups, scar formation was obvious. Similar to the histological analysis, electron microscopy showed uniform orientation of collagen fibrils at the cell membrane of the fibroblasts in the 10 mg 5-FU application group, whereas in high doses, such as 20 mg and 30 mg, the effects were reversed to a more hypertrophic state with fibril orientations resembling that of scar formation.</p>
<p>Different methods have been described to evaluate the excursion of healing tendons. The biomechanical angular rotation test is done with a simple custom made device, which can be readily used to assess the functional outcome of repaired tendons. The anatomical characteristics of the hen toe allow the secondary flexor profundus tendon to be used as it simulates Zone II of the Verdan in human flexor anatomy. As the hen toe consists of four phalanxes and three interphalengeal joints, the degree of angular rotation of the distal interphalangeal joint correlates with the excursion distance of the secondary flexor profundus tendon to which it is attached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412458646">Bhavsar et al., 2010</xref>). Data from the tested limbs showed a promising degree of excursion and angular rotation in the 10 mg 5-FU-treated group, which correlated well with the adhesion formation scores. The overall statistical results showed that the 10 mg dose application group was similar to the non-surgical group. In contrast, the 20 mg and 30 mg dose groups had the worst results with respect to fibrosis, adhesion formation, and excursion.</p>
<p>One limitation of the study is the early assessment at only three weeks. Adhesions develop even after that period, so the exact effects of the 5-FU-loaded gelatin system on adhesions at later stages is unknown. In addition, postoperative motion was not allowed, as all specimens were immediately collected after sacrificing and removing the cast. The other limitation was in not using a specific test to evaluate the tensile strength of the healed flexor tendons after surgery. The use of such a test would demonstrate the effect of the slow-releasing system on the endogenous tendon healing process.</p>
<p>Low doses of 5-FU applied by a slow releasing system prevented the formation of adhesions, whereas higher doses increased adhesion formation. The gelatin block system merits more study as a possible method for future clinical application of pharmacological agents after tendon repair surgery.</p>
