<abstract>
<p>Bioactive and degradable porous bioceramics play an important role in many clinical situations. Porosity is essential to the performance of a material that is proposed to be used as an implantable osseous scaffold. Scaffolds provide a three dimensional support and template to osseous integration and vascularization. Combining the porosity of a scaffold with the ability of the scaffold material to deliver therapeutic ions to the site of implantation goes some way towards developing an ideal bone graft. A series of strontium-doped zinc silicate (Ca-Sr-Na-Zn-Si) glass ceramics scaffoldswere developed, whose porosity was measured to be between 93% and 96%, which is advantageous in terms of osseous integration and vascularization. The levels of Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Sr<sup>2+</sup> detected as a result of degradation of the crystalline phases were found to be 1.4–600 parts per million (ppm) and 0–583 ppm, respectively. The levels detected correlate well with the levels of Sr<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup>ions typically associated with clinical benefits, including antibacterial efficacy, osteoblastic differentiation and impaired osteoclastic resorption.</p>

<p>Loss of bone tissue as a result of injury or disease necessitates the use of bone grafts to improve patient’s quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328211413621">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328211413621">2</xref></sup> At present, the repair of large or critical size defects through unaided bone regeneration is difficult.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328211413621">2</xref></sup> Autograft is considered the gold standard<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328211413621">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328211413621">3</xref></sup> graft material to facilitate regeneration and repair of larger defects; however autograft tissue has inherent drawbacks, such as limited volumes, limited supply and donor site morbidity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328211413621">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328211413621">4</xref></sup> Allograft bone is an alternative to autograft but also comes with its complicating factors: although it does provide an osteoconductive framework for regeneration it is considered weakly osteoinductive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328211413621">5</xref></sup> and carries a risk of disease transmission.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328211413621">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328211413621">6</xref></sup> Consequently, there is an increasing demand for synthetic bone-graft substitutes that do not damage healthy tissue, require a second operative site or pose a viral or bacterial threat to patients and, in addition, overcome the problem of an inadequate supply of material.<sup>1,2,4–7</sup> Bioactive ceramics currently used in clinical applications are available in bulk and particulate forms with dense and porous structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328211413621">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328211413621"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328211413621"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328211413621"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328211413621">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The ideal bone void filler should provide a three-dimensional (3D) matrix to support osteoblasts and precursor cell attachment, migration and proliferation; interact actively with cells and tissues; stimulate repair and regeneration;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328211413621">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328211413621">14</xref></sup> produce non-toxic degradation products;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328211413621">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328211413621">16</xref></sup> and bond to the host bone, creating a stable interface without the formation of scar/fibrous tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328211413621">17</xref></sup> Another factor that should be considered in the definition of the ideal bone graft is the antibacterial efficacy of the bone graft or its degradation products. The use of implants is associated with an increased risk of bacterial infection, often leading to implant failure and revision surgery in which <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> combined account for two out of three biomaterial-associated infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328211413621">18</xref></sup> A bone graft that reduces or eliminates the occurrence of wound infection would prove very advantageous. Three-dimensional scaffolds should have an internal structure that is highly porous and thus permissive for osseous invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328211413621">19</xref></sup>, allowing proper vascularization and a flow of nutrients and waste products through the scaffold,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328211413621">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328211413621">19</xref></sup> and should provide structural support for the newly formed bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328211413621">15</xref></sup> The porous structure should be highly interconnected, with pore sizes in the range of 100–500 µm<sup>2,15,20</sup> and with a porosity higher than 90%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328211413621">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some studies have demonstrated that direct interaction with the intrinsic chemistry of the graft material may be responsible for osteoinduction through the dissolution and release of specific key ions that act directly on local cells to upregulate gene expression or influence cell differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328211413621">21</xref></sup> A number of studies suggest that various materials by their chemical make-up promote osteoinduction when placed in simulated physiological conditions. It had been demonstrated that Bioglass® glass ceramic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885328211413621">22</xref></sup> can stimulate cell cycling and subsequently enhance osteoblast turnover; however, studies relating to the antibacterial efficacies of Bioglass® mainly concern oral bacteria namely <italic>Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans</italic> and <italic>Actinomyces viscosus</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885328211413621">23</xref></sup> and not those found at the site of orthopaedic implantation. Other systems, namely hydroxyapatite (HA) and β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) have induced antibacterial efficacy by incorporating ions such as silver, zinc and copper or by the addition of antibiotics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885328211413621">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885328211413621">25</xref></sup> The use of HA and β-TCP in porous forms is currently limited by their mechanical properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328211413621">26</xref></sup>, and their limited osteoinductive properties have also been documented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328211413621">19</xref></sup> Efforts have been made to improve the antibacterial properties of biocompatible wollastonite by the incorporation of ions such as silver<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885328211413621">27</xref></sup>, and although wollastonite does have some osteoinductive properties, its mechanical properties and particular low fracture toughness limit its clinical applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885328211413621">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>What can clearly be seen from the above examples is a pressing need to design a system that inherently possesses all the qualities of an ideal bone graft. Recently a series of strontium-doped zinc silicate glasses were developed.<sup>7,29–32</sup> Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Sr<sup>2+</sup>, have been shown, in the case of Zn<sup>2+</sup>, to stimulate fracture healing by enhancing osteoblast differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0885328211413621">33</xref></sup>, increasing osteoblast DNA content<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0885328211413621">34</xref></sup> and inhibiting osteoclastic bone resorption in vitro.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0885328211413621">35</xref></sup> Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion release from biomaterials has also been shown to be an effective antibacterial agent, killing many bacterial strains commonly associated with infection post-orthopaedic surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885328211413621">29</xref></sup> Synergistically, Sr<sup>2+</sup> has been shown to have a dual mode of action, increasing bone formation and enhancing osteoblast activity and differentiation while inhibiting osteoclast production and proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0885328211413621">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0885328211413621">37</xref></sup>, and is currently in use as an osteoporosis treatment in the form of strontium ranelate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0885328211413621">38</xref></sup> These strontium-doped zinc silicate glasses have been shown to release controlled amounts of therapeutic Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Sr<sup>2+</sup> ions when placed in normal and extreme physiological conditions. The levels of synergistic ion release from these materials correlates well with the levels of Sr<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup>ions typically associated with clinical benefits (osteoblastic differentiation and impaired osteoclastic resorption).<sup>7,29,35,39</sup> The glass system mentioned has recently been studied in relation to phase transformations during thermal treatments up to the first crystallization temperature (T<sub>p1</sub>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0885328211413621">40</xref></sup> The study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0885328211413621">40</xref></sup> enabled the authors to better understand the composition–structure relationships of the material during heat treatment, establishing the crystalline phases formed. This information provides a mechanism to control the bioactivity and mechanical properties of the strontium-doped zinc silicate glass ceramic.</p>
<p>The aim of this study is to investigate the structure and degradation of 3D scaffolds based on strontium-doped zinc silicate glass ceramics, which have been crystallized and characterized at T<sub>p1</sub>.</p>

<p>Five glass formulations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0885328211413621">Table 1</xref>) were synthesized. Glasses were prepared by weighing out the appropriate amounts of analytical grade reagents (Sigma Aldrich, Wicklow, Ireland) – silicon dioxide, zinc oxide, calcium carbonate, strontium carbonate and sodium carbonate– into a plastic container. Each formulation was thoroughly mixed in the closed container for 30 min. Compositions were then fired (1480°C for 1 h) in platinum crucibles and the glass melts shock quenched into water. The resulting frit was dried in an oven at 120°C for 1 day.

<sec id="sec4-0885328211413621"><title>Attrition milling</title>
<p>The dried frit was ground in an attrition mill (Netzsch, Lebenschauerschmierung, Germany) using isopropanol and zirconia beads. The frit was processed in 15 g batches, which were placed in a ceramic crucible, zirconia beads with a diameter ranging 2–4 mm were placed in the crucible, and isopropanol was added to the level of the beads. The frit was milled by means of two shaft-mounted blades rotating at a speed of 1500 rpm for 1 h. The resulting ground powder was placed in a sieve and washed with isopropanol in order to separate it from the Zirconia beads and to capture any glass particles attached to the beads. The resulting slurry was placed in a round bottomed flask, dried in a water bath at 100°C and stored in a dessicator for subsequent use.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0885328211413621"><title>Particle size</title>
<p>A Malvern MS 2000 LF particle size analyser, with the ability to detect particles in the range of 0.02–2000 µm, equipped with a Hydro 2000 wet dispersion module, was used to determine the particle size distribution using the ISO13320-1 protocol (fixed wavelength λ = 0.63, result accuracy ± 1%). The glass was prepared for particle size analysis by the following means. The attrition milled glass powder (0.5 g) was placed into a 40 ml beaker and 30 ml 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, which acts as a dispersant, was added, as the Malvern MS 2000 LF uses a wet technique. The beaker was placed on a magnetic stirrer and stirred for a minimum of 1 min to ensure that the powder and dispersant formed a suspension. Following a debubbling step, 20 ml of the suspension was taken, by means of a pipette, from between the middle of the vortex and edge of the glass at half the depth of the liquid. The suspension was placed in the MS2000 sample tank and ultrasonic vibrations applied for 2 min.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0885328211413621"><title>Scaffold fabrication</title>
<p>The slurry for the impregnation of the polyurethane foam was prepared using the following method: polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) (87–89% hydrolyzed, average molecular weight 13,000–23,000) was dissolved in water, the ratio being 0.01 mol/l. BT glass powder was then added to 100 ml PVA–water solution up to concentration of 40 wt%. Each procedure was carried out under vigorous stirring using a magnetic stirrer for 1 h. The polyurethane foams, cut to shape (5 × 5 mm), were immersed in the above prepared slurry for 15 min. The foams were manually retrieved from the suspension as quickly as possible, and the extra slurry was completely squeezed out. The samples (called green bodies) were then placed on a smooth surface and dried at ambient temperature for at least 12 h. Post-forming heat treatments for the burnout of the polymer template structure were programmed, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328211413621">Figure 1</xref>. The burning condition of the polymer template was identical for all samples. The polyurethane foam showed both thermoplastic and thermoset characteristics and when heated partial decomposition occurs resulting in vaporization and the formation of a melt, which occurs at approximately 260°C. All foams were subsequently heated to their respective T<sub>p1</sub> values and held for 2 h. The identification of glass transition temperatures (T<sub>g</sub>) and first the crystallization temperatures (T<sub>p1</sub>) for each glass was previously determined.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0885328211413621">40</xref></sup> The first crystallization temperatures identified will be used for the purposes of scaffold creation and can be located in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0885328211413621">Figure 1</xref>.

<sec id="sec7-0885328211413621"><title>X-ray diffraction</title>
<p>X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed using a Philips X’pert MPD Pro 3040/60 XRD unit (Philips, Netherlands). Zero background nickel-coated sample holders were used for analysis of the attrition milled glass particles with Cu kα radiation (at 40 kV and 35 mA). Diffractograms were collected in the range 5° &lt; θ &lt; 80°, at a scan step size 0.0083° and a step time of 10 s. Where significant crystalline activity occurred above the glass transition temperature the phases present were identified using Joint Committee for Powder Diffraction Studies (JCPDS) standard diffraction patterns using X’pert Highscore Plus software (PANalytical) and graphed using Origin Lab 8 version 8.1.</p>

<sec id="sec8-0885328211413621"><title>X-ray tomography</title>
<p>X-ray micro-tomography is a non-destructive analysis technique used to visualize and characterize objects in three dimensions. The technique works by acquiring a series of X-ray projection images at a known number of angular positions through 360°. Variation in the contrast of each projection image relates to how the X-rays are attenuated as they penetrate the sample. X-ray attenuation increases proportionally to the electron density and thickness of the sample material, thus resulting in a darker projection image. Specialized mathematical calculations known as `reconstruction algorithms' are used to create a 3D image from the X-ray projections. Visualization software then allows numerous analysis options from creating sections through the 3D image to quantification of size, internal porosity, surface area or segmentation based on differences in density. The X-ray tomography examination of three samples of BT113 glass ceramic scaffold was carried out using a phoenix|x-ray Nanotom (General Electric Company) with a tungsten transmission target and a 2 megapixel high contrast flat panel digital detector. The maximum accelerating voltage used was 50 kV. On thousand, four hundred and forty projections in 360° views were obtained. A voxel resolution of 10 µm was employed to obtain a 3D image of the glass ceramic foam. Analysis of reconstructed 3D datasets was carried out using Volume Graphics VGStudioMax Software.</p>

<p>In order to simulate normal and extreme environments TRIS-HCl buffer and citric acid buffer solutions were prepared to have a pH of 7.4 ± 0.1 and 3.0 ± 0.2, respectively, at a temperature of 37°C ± 1°C, according to ISO 10993-14.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0885328211413621">41</xref></sup> Each glass ceramic foam was immersed in 10 ml TRIS buffer (sample size = 5 for each designate) and citric acid buffer (sample size = 5 for each designate) and maintained at 37°C in a thermally controlled oven. Specimens were stored for 1, 7 and 30 days. After each storage period, specimens were removed via filtration and filtrates retained for ionic content analysis. The Sr<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> content of each filtrate was analysed using a SpectrAA 220 Fast Sequential, using flame atomic absorption spectroscopy in an acetylene-air flame. Zn and Sr hollow cathode lamps were used at wavelengths 213.9 nm and 460.7 nm, respectively. In order to eliminate interferences when measuring strontium levels 0.5 g KCl was added to each filtrate.</p>
<p>Results are expressed as mean of the mean of triplicate determinations. Analysis of the results was carried out using Students’s t-test, and then one way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test for multiple comparison between different groups. Each experiment was performed in triplicate and analysed using Graphpad prism 5 software (Graphpad software Inc.), with a significance level of p &lt; 0.05.</p>

The levels of detection subsequently drop on day 7 and 30, where no significant difference between the two lower levels is noted.

It is apparent that BT111 has a much lower level of Sr<sup>2+</sup> detection in comparison with the other glass ceramics at pH 7.4. There are no significant differences for the three time periods within the BT111 grouping, where the highest level of Sr<sup>2+</sup> detected was noted to occur at day 30, with 17.5 ppm. Interestingly, at day 7, no strontium divalent ion was detected. The Sr<sup>2+</sup> detection levels for BT112 are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0885328211413621">Figure 7(C)</xref>, where the highest level of detection was seen following 30 days of incubation, with 398 ppm of Sr<sup>2+</sup> detected.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0885328211413621">Figure 8</xref> demonstrates significant differences between glass ceramics at equivalent time lines. The glass ceramics are grouped by time lines and ion of interest.

However, at days 7 and 30, significant differences have been noted. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0885328211413621">Figure 8(B)</xref>, which shows the level of Zn<sup>2+</sup> detected at pH 7.4, shows that at each time point statistically significant differences are noted between the glass ceramics.

Although <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0885328211413621">Figure 8</xref> makes obvious the level of ion detected for each glass ceramic and how they compare with one another, it is very difficult to perform a detailed analysis of the presented information. In order to compare each glass ceramic with its peers under equivalent conditions, it is necessary not only to establish the crystalline species involved, but to also determine the percentage of each crystalline phase and the individual elements within that phase. Additional analysis including XRD and scanning electron microscopy work on each glass ceramic would be required in order to determine this information, as such little comment can be made on the results thus found.</p>

<sec id="sec17-0885328211413621" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to fabricate a fully integrated porous Sr-doped zinc-silicate glass ceramic scaffold, whose structure was permissive for osseous integration and to investigate the ion release level with respect to the divalent ions of zinc and strontium. It is clear from the results that a fully porous material, in which the porosity is 93–96%, has been created, hence providing a suitable scaffold to enhance bone ingrowth, and to allow adequate vascularization. We have synthesized four materials that are designed to release zinc: BT110, BT111, BT113 and BT114. Each glass ceramic, as outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885328211413621">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0885328211413621">Table 3</xref>, comprises a unique grouping of crystalline species. At pH 3, all four glass ceramics show a similar release profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328211413621">Figure 4</xref>). In all cases the level of Zn<sup>2+</sup> detected at day 30 appears to have reduced from the levels observed at day 7, when some differences, namely those observed in BT111 and BT113 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328211413621">Figure 4(B)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328211413621">C</xref>), respectively), are statistically significant. Similar anomalous results have been previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0885328211413621">43</xref></sup>, where it was suggested that the metal ions released from the material may be complexed with the citric acid used in the manufacture of the incubating solution. However, this phenomenon was not seen at day 7.</p>
<p>A possible explanation for this is that a competing complexing process may be taking place in the solution as a result of another metal ion, released by the degrading glass ceramic (silicon, calcium, strontium or sodium) being complexed by the citric acid in preference to the Zn<sup>2+</sup>, once the initial ion(s) were no longer available or less attracted to the citric acid, Zn<sup>2+</sup> was complexed up to the 30 day point. In order to determine whether a chelating effect on the Zn<sup>2+</sup> or other ions released by the glass ceramic has occurred, further investigation is required. At pH 7.4, two distinct detection profiles are apparent. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0885328211413621">Figure 5(A)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0885328211413621">5(C)</xref> (BT110 and BT113) show that day 7 levels of Zn<sup>2+</sup> detected are lower than that detected at day 1. The level of Zn<sup>2+</sup> detected plateaus at day 30. The reason for the fall in Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels at day 7 is not fully understood and has not been observed in the literature.</p>
<p>In glass ceramics BT111 and BT114 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0885328211413621">Figure 5(B)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0885328211413621">5(C)</xref>, respectively), the level of Zn<sup>2+</sup> detected appears to increase over time as expected. All five materials (BT110, BT111, BT112, BT113 and BT114) are designed to release strontium. Again, the crystalline phase(s) determined for each glass ceramic are outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885328211413621">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0885328211413621">Table 3</xref>. At pH 3 it appears that each glass ceramic has its own unique Sr<sup>2+</sup> release profile apart from BT111 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0885328211413621">Figure 6(A)</xref>) and BT113 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0885328211413621">Figure 6(D)</xref>), whose release profiles are similar. What glass ceramics BT110, BT111, BT113 and BT114 do have in common is the level of Sr<sup>2+</sup> detected at day 7, which is lower than that at day 1. In some cases (BT110, BT11 1 and BT 113; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0885328211413621">Figure 6(A)</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0885328211413621">6(B)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0885328211413621">6(D)</xref>, respectively), the level of Sr<sup>2+</sup> is found to have increased at day 30, while in BT114, the level was found to have further decreased. Again, the mechanism is not fully understood but may be similar to that as outlined in the Zn<sup>2+</sup> release previously discussed. Where the level of Sr<sup>2+</sup> detected subsequently decreases at day 30, this may indicate that the level of Sr<sup>2+</sup> released may not be greater that the level of Sr<sup>2+</sup> chelated by the citric acid.</p>
<p>Of interest is the detection of Sr<sup>2+</sup> for BT111, whose crystalline content did not show a strontium-rich phase. Similar results have been reported in other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0885328211413621">43</xref></sup> The presence of an ion, the source of which was not found in the glass ceramic by XRD, was explained by the presence of residual glass. Our study shows that BT111 is a fully crystalline material; therefore an alternative explanation is required. One such explanation may be the identification of the crystalline phase itself. The identification of crystal phases is challenging where multiple phases occur together and their Bragg diffraction lines overlap and, in particular, where residual stresses in a glass ceramic can impose significant changes to the lattice parameters. Although this work has used JCPDS standards, strontium and calcium ions have similar ionic sizes and identical charges and can form solid solution crystal phases readily.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0885328211413621">40</xref></sup> In such cases, it is possible that an unknown percentage of calcium silicate (Ca<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>) identified in BT111 may actually comprise a strontium component.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0885328211413621">Figure 6(C)</xref> shows the detection profile of BT112 at pH 3. The level of Sr<sup>2+</sup> detected here seems to increase over time, with an extremely significant difference between day 30 and the other two time points. As to why the level of Sr<sup>2+</sup> detected does not decrease as was observed in the other glass ceramics, one possibility is that the level of strontium divalent ion released may be greater than any competing reaction to complex with the ion. At pH 7 we observed a similar pattern to Sr<sup>2+</sup> detection in all glass ceramics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0885328211413621">Figure 7</xref>). In all cases there is a decline in the level of Sr<sup>2+</sup> detected from 1 to 7 days, with a subsequent increase at day 30. The glass ceramics do differ in the significant differences, where calculated, between the time points. A number of glass ceramics show the maximum level of detection at day 1, namely BT110 and BT113 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0885328211413621">Figure 7(A)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0885328211413621">D</xref>), respectively) whereas BT110, BT112 and BT114 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0885328211413621">Figure 7(A)</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0885328211413621">7(C)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0885328211413621">7(E)</xref>) show the highest level of Sr<sup>2+</sup> detected occurring at day 30 for pH 7.4. The dissolution mechanism for many glass ceramics has been shown to be an initial attack on a residual glass phase, followed by degradation of the crystalline material.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0885328211413621">44</xref></sup> However, as we can see from the XRD analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885328211413621">Figure 2</xref>, the glass ceramics appear to be fully crystalline with no residual glassy phase.</p>
<p>In considering the durability of glass ceramics, the materials must be viewed as multiphased composition-dependant systems, where each phase has individual corrosion characteristics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0885328211413621">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0885328211413621">46</xref></sup> We are particularly interested in the degradation products Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Sr<sup>2+</sup> and whether the levels released are within identified therapeutic ranges. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328211413621">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0885328211413621">5</xref> demonstrate the range of Zn<sup>2+</sup> detected from the zinc containing glass ceramics, where the levels were found to be in the range of 1.4 to 600 ppm.

<sec id="sec18-0885328211413621"><title>Limitations of the study and future analysis</title>
<p>The identification of crystal phases is challenging, especially where multiple phases occur together and their Bragg diffraction lines overlap and, in particular, where residual stresses in a glass ceramic can impose significant changes to the lattice parameters. Although this work has used JCPDS standards, strontium and calcium ions have similar ionic sizes and identical charges and can form solid solution crystal phases readily. As such an examination of solid solution substitutions would be of additional benefit.</p>
<p>Currently, the level of ions released from a glass ceramic cannot be traced to any single crystalline phase, where more than one phase exists containing the ion of interest. In order to quantitatively determine the level of ion release from a particular phase and to compare each glass ceramic with its peers under equivalent conditions, not only is it necessary to establish the crystalline species involved, but to also determine the percentage of each crystalline phase and the individual elements within that phase.</p>
<p>The use of citric acid as a buffer in the pH 3 solution is a limitation in this study. Citric acid has the ability to complex with metal ions such as those found in the glass ceramics synthesized here. This chelating may lead to lower than expected Sr<sup>2+</sup> levels in solution. Evaluation of alternate media at pH 3 may be valuable.</p>

<sec id="sec19-0885328211413621" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The objective of this work was to fabricate fully integrated porous Sr-doped zinc-silicate glass ceramic scaffolds based on glasses BT110-BT114, whose structure was permissive for osseous integration, and to investigate the ion release profile with respect to the divalent ions of zinc and strontium. The X-ray diffraction patterns generated indicate all glasses were successfully converted to fully crystalline fully porous glass ceramics, where the porosity was found to be 93–96%, thus providing a suitable scaffold to enhance bone ingrowth and to permit adequate vascularization. Ion release results pertaining to Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Sr<sup>2+</sup> following incubation in pH levels mimicking extreme and normal physiological conditions indicate that the glass ceramics fabricated have potential as therapeutic bone grafts. A stronger degradation was observed using pH 3 citric acid buffered solution compared to the normal physiological pH, 7.4. Release of such elements at appropriate levels from bone grafts may be advantageous with respect to augmenting bone turnover and antibacterial efficacy. On the basis of these results, further investigation is warranted in order to assess the level of antibacterial efficacy and cytotoxicity demonstrated by the glass ceramics.</p>
