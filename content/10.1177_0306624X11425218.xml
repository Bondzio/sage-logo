<abstract>
<p>The systemic model of crime has received considerable empirical attention from criminologists; yet, an often-neglected component of the theoretical framework is the role of social institutions as a source of both formal and informal social control. Accordingly, the current study builds on recent research that considers the importance of institutional strength for the reduction of criminal behavior; in particular, the authors assess the impact of social–structural characteristics on the treatment program integrity (i.e., institutional efficacy) of 38 halfway house programs in Ohio. The authors’ results indicate that communities suffering from concentrated resource deprivation have a more difficult time creating and maintaining strong institutions of public social control. The implications for criminological theory and correctional policy are discussed.</p>

<p>Over the last several decades, an increasing amount of empirical support for macro-level theories of crime has led scholars to reaffirm criminal behavior as a “social fact” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306624X11425218">Durkheim, 1938</xref>) that cannot be understood devoid of context. Such a conclusion is consistent with a return to the line of theorizing emphasized by the “Chicago School” of sociology and serves notice to structural skeptics who all but dismissed context-specific theories of crime as theoretically and empirically bankrupt in the 1970s (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306624X11425218">Bursik, 1988</xref>). Indeed, the banishment of macro-level thought to the theoretical cellar was short lived, with more than 200 empirical studies exploring the ecological correlates of crime in the 1980s and 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0306624X11425218">Pratt &amp; Cullen, 2005</xref>). Perhaps more importantly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0306624X11425218">Weisburd and Piquero’s (2008)</xref> review of 169 articles published in <italic>Criminology</italic> from 1968 to 2008 suggested that macro-level theories (e.g., social disorganization) have fared considerably well (as compared with other theories) in terms of the explained variance of criminal activity. One of the more notable contributions to this resurgence of macro-level criminology was the reformulation of traditional social-disorganization principles into the systemic model of crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306624X11425218">Bursik &amp; Grasmick, 1993b</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0306624X11425218">Hunter, 1985</xref>). This framework built on previous research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0306624X11425218">Sampson &amp; Groves, 1989</xref>) in an effort to more clearly specify the causal mechanisms at work in the relationship between structural characteristics and criminal behavior. Research in the systemic control tradition has confirmed that the major tenets of the model provide a viable explanation for both offending and victimization at the macro level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0306624X11425218">Sampson, Raudenbush, &amp; Earls, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0306624X11425218">Velez, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>An often-neglected component of the systemic model’s framework, however, is the role of local institutions in advancing the regulatory capacity of a given area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0306624X11425218">Peterson, Krivo, &amp; Harris, 2000</xref>). Even more problematic is the related failure of existing research to explicitly consider the <italic>strength</italic> of these local institutions. For example, most research rooted in the systemic model tradition thus far has focused on social networks and interpersonal ties among residents as a proxy for social control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306624X11425218">Bellair &amp; Browning, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0306624X11425218">Sampson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0306624X11425218">Warner &amp; Rountree, 1997</xref>), yet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0306624X11425218">LaFree (1998)</xref> argued that local institutions can inhibit crime by reducing individual motivations to commit crime, by supplying effective controls to curb criminal behavior, and by providing individuals with protection against the criminal behavior of others. Thus, by ignoring the importance of the strength of local institutions in promoting informal and formal control, the current body of literature has overlooked an important component of the systemic model.</p>
<p>This problem is then exacerbated when considering the generalizability of the model in explaining criminal behavior. To be sure, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306624X11425218">Bursik and Grasmick (1993b)</xref> argued that the systemic model should be applicable to a wide range of criminological outcomes—including juvenile and adult offending and responses to disorder such as fear of crime (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0306624X11425218">Taylor, 1997</xref>). Currently, little research exists that examines the applicability of the systemic model to the prediction of criminal reoffending (compare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0306624X11425218">Clear, Rose, Waring, &amp; Scully, 2003</xref>). This omission is important because it is likely that the strength of institutions such as correctional treatment programs plays a particularly prominent role in the reduction of recidivism and corresponding successful offender reintegration (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0306624X11425218">Cullen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0306624X11425218">Pratt, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Accordingly, the current study incorporates measures of correctional treatment program strength to examine the relationship between social–structural characteristics and the efficacy of local institutions charged with the task of offender reintegration. More specifically, we build on and expand recent research documenting the linkages between structural context and correctional treatment program effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0306624X11425218">Wright, Pratt, Lowenkamp, &amp; Latessa, 2012</xref>). We do so by investigating the relationship between indicators of macro-level resource deprivation and measures of treatment integrity on a sample of halfway house (HWH) programs in Ohio as measured by the Correctional Program Assessment Inventory (CPAI). The CPAI is a theoretically informed and empirically verified tool used to assess how well treatment programs adhere to “what works” in offender rehabilitation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0306624X11425218">Lowenkamp, Latessa, &amp; Smith, 2006</xref>), and it therefore serves as a proxy for the institutional efficacy of HWH programs. Thus, the broader aim of our study is to provide one of the first empirical assessments of institutional strength as it pertains to offender reentry within a systemic model of community control.</p>

<title>The Systemic Model of Crime</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0306624X11425218">Shaw and McKay (1942)</xref> extended earlier work (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0306624X11425218">Park &amp; Burgess, 1925</xref>) on ecological differentiation to the study of juvenile delinquency. Their research in Chicago revealed that high rates of delinquency were endemic to particular areas that were characterized by social disorganization, which they defined as “the extent to which a community structure is effective in articulating and realizing the common values of its residents and solving common problems” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0306624X11425218">Simcha-Fagan &amp; Schwartz, 1986</xref>, p. 670; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306624X11425218">Bursik, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0306624X11425218">Kornhauser, 1978</xref>). They reasoned that this rupture in community cohesion was caused by three factors: poverty, racial heterogeneity, and residential mobility. Although Shaw and McKay were relatively clear on these causes of social disorganization, they were comparatively less precise as to how social disorganization, in turn, would lead to criminal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306624X11425218">Bursik, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306624X11425218">Bursik and Grasmick (1993b)</xref> intended to more clearly specify the control interpretation of the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0306624X11425218">Shaw and McKay (1942)</xref> with the introduction of the systemic model of crime. In doing so, they noted that the instability and heterogeneity of local communities affected three levels of social control: private, parochial, and public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0306624X11425218">Hunter, 1985</xref>). Each of these types of mutually reinforcing controls would be necessary for a community to effectively police its members and to suppress crime (e.g., a neighborhood could have strong private and parochial control networks yet still exhibit a high rate of crime). The model predicted that economically disadvantaged communities would have a particularly difficult time exercising each type of control due to the problem of disrupted social networks.</p>
<p><italic>Private control</italic> is perhaps the most well-known and frequently studied type of control and concerns the intimate informal primary social groups that exist within an area. These primary relational networks are able to achieve social control through the allocation or threatened withdrawal of social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0306624X11425218">Hunter, 1985</xref>) and are less able to do so in economically disadvantaged areas (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0306624X11425218">Pratt, Turner, &amp; Piquero, 2004</xref>). <italic>Parochial control</italic>, however, represents “the supervisory capacities of a local community” and “residential participation in local institutions, such as churches, voluntary organizations, and schools” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0306624X11425218">Bursik &amp; Grasmick, 1998</xref>, p. 115; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306624X11425218">Lowenkamp, Cullen, &amp; Pratt, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0306624X11425218">Sampson &amp; Groves, 1989</xref>). As such, structural characteristics play an important role in the level of parochial control that is present within an area, where disadvantaged neighborhoods will have a difficult time attracting and maintaining strong social institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0306624X11425218">Kornhauser, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0306624X11425218">Peterson et al., 2000</xref>). Finally, <italic>public control</italic> reflects the ability of a community to “secure public and private goods and services that are allocated by groups and agencies located outside of the neighborhood” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0306624X11425218">Bursik &amp; Grasmick, 1998</xref>, p. 118). The ability of disadvantaged communities to effectively secure strong institutions of public control is also severely limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306624X11425218">Bursik &amp; Grasmick, 1993a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0306624X11425218">Peterson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0306624X11425218">Taub, Surgeon, Lindholm, Otti, &amp; Bridges, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0306624X11425218">Velez, 2001</xref>), and this lack of institutional efficacy is particularly pronounced for Black communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0306624X11425218">Bursik &amp; Grasmick, 1998</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-0306624X11425218">
<title>Institutional Strength</title>
<p>The systemic model of crime thus provides a conceptual framework for understanding the importance of local institutions—something that has always been attached, in some way, to theories focused on crime in disadvantaged communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306624X11425218">Bursik &amp; Grasmick, 1993a</xref>). To date, however, research in the systemic tradition has failed to consider the quality and strength of those institutions. Accordingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0306624X11425218">Triplett, Gainey, and Sun (2003)</xref> expanded the systemic model by providing a conceptualization of institutional strength that included the dimensions of stability, the presence of resources, a clear delineation of roles and statuses, and interconnectedness among institutions. To that end, the same traditional social-disorganization factors (poverty, racial/ethnic heterogeneity, residential mobility) that are predicted to determine the <italic>presence</italic> of institutions are also expected to influence the strength of those institutions. Thus, not only are disadvantaged communities handicapped in their ability to secure institutions overall but they are also, especially, lacking in the capacity to attract and to retain high-quality institutions. Not surprisingly, weak institutions are limited in their ability to exert informal and formal social control, and, as a result, the disadvantaged communities that they are located within are often characterized by high rates of crime.</p>
<p>The recognition that institutions play a key role in controlling criminal behavior has spawned a small and somewhat contradictory body of research. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0306624X11425218">Peterson et al. (2000)</xref> noted that local institutions had only limited effects on violence, but that certain types of institutions (e.g., recreation centers) helped counter the effects of resource deprivation in extremely disadvantaged areas. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0306624X11425218">Morenoff, Sampson, and Raudenbush (2001)</xref> determined that local organizations and voluntary associations were important for the prediction of homicide only insofar as they promoted collective efficacy, concluding that “organizations and voluntary associations turned out to be relatively unimportant, suggesting that perhaps criminological theory has overstated the benefits to be derived from local forms of institutional organization (p. 553).” In addition, research that has conceptualized institutions and organizations as a dimension of social capital has also produced murky conclusions (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0306624X11425218">Hipp &amp; Yates, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0306624X11425218">Messner, Baumer, &amp; Rosenfeld, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Although these studies have gotten us off to a great start, a major limitation to this body of work is that institutions and organizations are indicated by counts (e.g., the number of libraries, recreation centers, etc. located within a particular ecological unit). As such, the mere presence of an institution in a disadvantaged area is taken to mean that it is of sufficient quality to make a difference—an assumption that is not supported by the empirical literature. Simply put, the existing literature on the importance of institutions for the control of criminal behavior fails to properly account for variations in institutional <italic>strength</italic>. This omission becomes particularly problematic for studies examining the impact of ecological characteristics on the successful reintegration of ex-offenders.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0306624X11425218">
<title>The Ecology of Recidivism</title>
<p>Recent research suggests that structural conditions such as concentrated disadvantage are particularly problematic for those offenders who are attempting to reintegrate back into the society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0306624X11425218">Hannon &amp; DeFina, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0306624X11425218">Reisig, Bales, Hay, &amp; Wang, 2007</xref>)—especially for those offenders who may have never been truly integrated in the first place. It should come as no surprise, then, that studies are beginning to uncover the deleterious effects of ecological disadvantage on offender recidivism. For example, in a study of 4,630 former inmates living in Multnomah County, Oregon, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0306624X11425218">Kubrin and Stewart (2006)</xref> found that socioeconomic context significantly predicted recidivism. More specifically, those who lived in disadvantaged areas were more likely to be rearrested within a 12-month period. Furthermore, the authors found that living in affluent neighborhoods served as a protective function in reducing recidivism. These findings were bolstered by a study of 49,420 ex-offenders in Florida by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0306624X11425218">Mears, Wang, Hay, and Bales (2008)</xref>, who also found ecological factors to significantly affect recidivism in the form of violent offending. This line of research coincides with postrelease correctional programming that takes into consideration <italic>where</italic> offenders return to in addition to their individual risks and needs (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11425218">Clement, Schwarzfeld, &amp; Thompson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0306624X11425218">Piquero, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Significant advancements have thus been made in applying macro-level criminological theory to the study of offender recidivism. Nevertheless, this line of research pays little attention to the mechanisms involved in the relationships between structural characteristics and reoffending, where little thought seems to be given to the role that institutions (and particularly strong institutions) may play in successful offender reintegration. Ex-offenders return to society with a bevy of risks and needs that cannot be attended to solely through the limited resources that they, or even their family members, are likely to possess (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0306624X11425218">Pratt, 2009</xref>). The systemic model of institutional control, therefore, provides a theoretical framework for a more comprehensive understanding of the challenges facing offender reintegration.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0306624X11425218">
<title>Current Focus</title>
<p>The current study builds on previous research by combining the emerging body of work on the importance of institutional strength for the control of criminal behavior with the expanding literature on the ecology of offender reentry. In particular, we expand on recent work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0306624X11425218">Wright and colleagues (2012)</xref> that identified ecological context as an important predictor of HWH treatment program success in Ohio (i.e., the difference in recidivism rates of program participants as compared with a matched control group). This research was important in establishing that structural characteristics (e.g., concentrated disadvantage) influenced effectiveness primarily by affecting the <italic>quality</italic> of the HWH programs, yet it was unable to document the mechanisms present for this indirect relationship. Stated differently, we currently do not know <italic>how</italic> ecological context affects treatment program quality—either theoretically or empirically—and the current work seeks to fill this gap to advance a more complete framework for understanding offender reintegration that is grounded in criminological theory. To do so, we assess the systemic model of crime by incorporating direct measures of institutional strength (the CPAI) into our analyses. The systemic model of institutional control predicts that the ability of an institution to promote and exert informal and formal control of ex-offenders is contingent on institutional quality. In considering the HWH as an institution that houses offenders on release from prison, the current analyses effectively join the macro-level criminological literature (specifically, the systemic model) with efforts to understand successful offender reentry. These programs have already been assessed in terms of their ability to reduce recidivism, with programs scoring higher on the CPAI producing higher treatment effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0306624X11425218">Lowenkamp et al., 2006</xref>). The task, then, is to determine the broader ecological foundations of the institutional efficacy of these programs.</p>
<p>Analyzing HWHs in this context is particularly useful because they serve as a mediator between structural characteristics and both the parochial and the public forms of social control which, consequently, influence levels of recidivism. At the parochial level, to the extent that the HWH represents a community-based institution designed to assist in offender reentry, it will require the participation and support of the surrounding community—directly through community investment and collaboration with HWH services as well as indirectly through the overall level of community support for the mission of offender reintegration. At the public level, the HWH represents a source of social control in two ways. First, the degree to which private, nonprofit organizations (e.g., the Salvation Army) are willing to establish and invest in a HWH within a community is likely influenced by the perceived success of that program based on structural characteristics. Second, the degree to which the state (e.g., Department of Corrections) is willing to invest in, and to contract out to, a HWH program is likely also influenced by the structural characteristics of that area.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0306624X11425218">1</xref></sup> Thus, the HWH provides a perfect opportunity to assess the importance of institutional strength for effective reintegration in the context of the systemic model of crime.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0306624X11425218" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Data for the current analyses were obtained from two major sources. Data for the CPAI scores for the HWHs were collected as part of a larger project completed for the State of Ohio in 2002 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0306624X11425218">Lowenkamp, 2004</xref>, for a more detailed discussion on data collection). Individuals trained in the application of the CPAI conducted site visits to all Community Corrections Act–funded programs in the State of Ohio that provided residential services to state parolees through a HWH. These researchers tallied scores for each program based on a survey and interview with the program director as well as a review of relevant program materials (e.g., assessment instruments used, offender performance evaluation forms used). Some items on the CPAI were not scored given that the site visits were relatively brief and did not involve extensive monitoring of programs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0306624X11425218">2</xref></sup> To be included in the sample, the program had to be in operation during fiscal year 1999. These data, therefore, represent the specific program characteristics of 38 HWH programs in Ohio operated by 34 different service providers.</p>
<p>Data for the ecological social–structural characteristics were obtained using county-level information from the 1990 and 2000 U.S. decennial censuses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0306624X11425218">3</xref></sup> The items included, for example, measures accounting for traditional concentrated disadvantage variables (e.g., percentage of families below the poverty level) as well as items representing concentrated affluence (e.g., percentage of the population with a college degree or higher). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306624X11425218">Bursik (1986)</xref> observed that structural processes can only be appreciated as they unfold over time, and that the original formulation of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0306624X11425218">Shaw and McKay (1942)</xref> recognized that structural dynamics do not represent static relationships. A true test of the impact of structural characteristics on treatment program integrity would therefore take into consideration change within a county’s composition over time. The current analysis thus uses change scores to account for the dynamics of structural alterations within counties. Residual-change scores were computed by regressing the level of a variable at time <italic>t</italic> on its level at time <italic>t</italic> – 10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0306624X11425218">Bohrnstedt, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306624X11425218">Bursik, 1986</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0306624X11425218">Wright et al., 2012</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0306624X11425218">4</xref></sup> Some clustering of the 38 programs occurred within counties and, therefore, the structural indicators were obtained for 14 distinct counties.</p>

<title>Dependent Variable</title>
<p>The CPAI is an instrument created by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306624X11425218">Gendreau and Andrews (1994)</xref> that assesses correctional programs in six primary areas: program implementation and leadership, offender assessment and classification, characteristics of the program, characteristics of the staff, evaluation and quality control, and miscellaneous items such as amount of community and/or financial support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306624X11425218">Latessa &amp; Holsinger, 1998</xref>). The instrument allows for a standardized, objective way of assessing the quality of existing programs as well as their effectiveness in terms of reducing recidivism. An emerging body of research suggests that there is indeed large variation in correctional program quality—with most programs scoring on the low end of the CPAI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306624X11425218">Latessa &amp; Holsinger, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0306624X11425218">Matthews, Hubbard, &amp; Latessa, 2001</xref>), and that program integrity, as measured by the CPAI, is correlated with increased program effectiveness (i.e., reduced recidivism; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0306624X11425218">Lowenkamp et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The CPAI is predicated on the broader principles of effective correctional intervention. Gendreau and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0306624X11425218">Gendreau, Smith, &amp; French, 2006</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0306624X11425218">Gendreau, 1996</xref>) detailed seven important principles based largely on the tenets of social learning theory which, if followed, are likely to lead to reductions in recidivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0306624X11425218">Gendreau et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0306624X11425218">Listwan, Jonson, Cullen, &amp; Latessa, 2008</xref>). The CPAI is therefore rooted in a strongly supported criminological theory (i.e., social learning; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0306624X11425218">Pratt et al., 2010</xref>). More importantly, the CPAI contains items that are directly relevant to the dimensions of institutional strength as identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0306624X11425218">Triplett et al. (2003)</xref>. For example, one item measures program change as “no noticeable changes in program components in the last 2 years that jeopardize smooth functioning of the program,” which meshes closely with the institutional strength characteristic of “stability.”</p>
<p>Each of the six sections of the CPAI contains anywhere from 6 to 22 items, which are given a value of “1” if the programs have demonstrated that they meet the specified criteria and “0” if they have not. The items are summed and divided by the total number of items in each section. A program can therefore receive a score anywhere from 0% to 100% on each section as well as on the overall tool. Within the current data, the overall CPAI measure was normally distributed with a mean of 50.54. This poor performance of the HWH programs on the CPAI is consistent with previous research suggesting that current treatment programs, in general, tend to suffer from a lack of program integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306624X11425218">Latessa &amp; Holsinger, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0306624X11425218">Matthews et al., 2001</xref>), yet a sizable amount of variation existed among the HWHs in the sample in terms of treatment integrity (<italic>SD</italic> = 13.25).</p>

<title>Structural Correlates</title>
<p>Several indicators of theoretically relevant structural characteristics were drawn from the census data to be used in the current analysis. All residual-change score scales were created by calculating a factor regression score that weighted each variable by its factor loading. First, our measure of <italic>concentrated disadvantage</italic> is similar to one used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0306624X11425218">Morenoff and colleagues (2001)</xref>. It consists of the percentage of families below the poverty line, percentage of families receiving public assistance, percentage of female-headed households with children, and percent Black.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0306624X11425218">5</xref></sup> The residual-change scores of these variables were highly interrelated and loaded on a single factor using principal components analysis (eigenvalue of 2.44; all loadings above .60). The construct explained 61% of the variance and also had high reliability (α = .78). Following previous works, we measured <italic>concentrated affluence</italic> as the percentage of adults with a college education, the percentage of families with incomes higher than US$50,000, and the percentage of the civilian labor force employed in professional or managerial occupations. The residual-change scores of these variables strongly represented a single construct (eigenvalue of 2.32; all loadings above .80), explained 77% of the variance, and produced a highly reliable scale (α = .85).</p>
<p>We also constructed a scale representing <italic>concentrated immigration</italic> that follows previous works by including variables measuring percentage Latino and percentage foreign-born (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0306624X11425218">Sampson, Morenoff, &amp; Earls, 1999</xref>). Two important qualifications must, however, be stated about this measure. First, a relatively small percentage of the counties in Ohio are made up of either Latino or foreign-born residents. The national average in 1990 was around 9% Latino and 8% foreign-born whereas the percentages in Ohio were 1% and 3%, respectively. Second, the ethnic makeup of foreign-born in Ohio is drastically different than the national breakdown. Whereas more than half of the U.S. foreign-born population was from Latin America in 1990, most of the foreign-born population in Ohio was from Europe and Asia. Both residual-change scores of these variables loaded on the same construct (eigenvalue of 1.86; both loadings above .95), explained 93% of the variance, and produced a strong reliability scale (α = .86).</p>
<p>Finally, we constructed a <italic>residential stability</italic> scale from the traditional indicators of percentage of occupied housing units that are owner occupied and the percentage of residents 5 years and older who lived in the same house 5 years earlier. The residual-change scores of the two variables failed to produce a strong common factor (eigenvalue of 1.11; both loadings above .70) and explained only 55% of the variance. The two indicators produced a poor reliability scale measuring residential stability within the 14 counties (α = .19). As such, it appears that a change in one of the indicators did not necessarily lead to a corresponding change in the other, and only the individual residual-change scores for residential stability were used in the analyses.</p>

<title>Analytic Strategy</title>
<p>The primary focus of the current analysis is to determine the extent to which structural characteristics affect treatment program integrity (i.e., the strength of a program as measured by the CPAI). To determine if significant relationships exist, weighted bivariate correlation matrices (weighted by program size to give emphasis to HWHs that served more offenders) were constructed that included each of the independent structural change correlates as well as the four indices described above. In addition, weighted least squares (WLS) regression models were estimated that included the strongest correlates (as established in the bivariate analyses) to establish the unique impact of each structural characteristic while holding the remaining ecological factors constant. Robust standard errors were calculated given that several programs were located within the same county. Finally, as a supplemental analysis to examine just <italic>how</italic> structural characteristics affect institutional integrity, we examined the weighted bivariate correlations between the strongest predictor from the WLS models and the individual sections and items of the CPAI.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0306624X11425218">Table 1</xref> presents the weighted bivariate correlations between the structural residual-change score measures and the CPAI. All of the disadvantage indicators were significantly and negatively correlated with correctional treatment program quality. Counties that were becoming increasingly disadvantaged were associated with worse treatment programs, and the strongest relationship was between the overall disadvantage index and CPAI. These results suggest that it is the accumulation of <italic>concentrated</italic> disadvantage that is most damaging toward developing and retaining strong social institutions like HWHs. Turning to the affluence indicators, the change in the percentage of families who identified as affluent produced the strongest relationship with CPAI in any of the bivariate analyses (<italic>r</italic> = .47). The overall change in the affluence index and the change in the percentage of residents who held professional positions were both associated with stronger treatment programs as measured by the CPAI. All of the immigration change indicators were significantly related to program integrity, and this relationship mirrored that of the affluence indicators and CPAI: Areas that had a larger increase in percentage of residents who identified as Latino or foreign-born were associated with better treatment programs. Finally, an increase in the percentage of housing units that were owner occupied was related to stronger HWH institutions.</p>

<title>Multivariate Analyses</title>
<p>The strongest structural change correlates of institutional strength (as established in the weighted bivariate analyses) were entered into WLS regression models predicting the CPAI scores for the HWHs. The first two models presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0306624X11425218">Table 2</xref> included the five strongest structural change variables.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0306624X11425218">6</xref></sup> No individual structural change indicator was empirically important for the prediction of institutional efficacy when included in the multivariate model; yet, given the emphasis placed on concentration effects in the macro-level criminological literature, separate models were estimated to determine the unique impact of each change index. As can be seen in Model 3, a different picture emerged compared with the analyses that included only the individual variables. Both the change in disadvantage (β = –.415, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and change in immigration indices (β = .355, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) exhibited moderate predictive effects. An inspection of case diagnostics (e.g., Cook’s <italic>D</italic>, leverage scores) revealed a single influential case—The Cincinnati Volunteers of America McMahon Hall HWH had a particularly weak CPAI score coupled with a strong weight within the data set, and the program was also located in a county that experienced little change overall on the structural indicators. Removal of this case substantially strengthened the predictive power of the change in immigration and change in disadvantage indices (Model 4). These additional models thus reaffirm the necessity of considering the unique impact of the concentration of disadvantage on the quality of institutions within an area.</p>

<p>A more detailed examination of the relationship between the change in concentrated disadvantage index and the individual sections and elements of the CPAI allows for a better understanding of just how structural characteristics affect institutional strength. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0306624X11425218">Table 3</xref>, the change in disadvantage variable was significantly correlated with five of the six areas of the CPAI. In particular, reasonably strong relationships were observed between disadvantage and both the client preservice assessment and program characteristics sections. Each of these areas measures the extent to which programs adhere to the specific <italic>treatment</italic> components of effective interventions (e.g., criminogenic needs are determined, cognitive-behavioral training is used), and it is evident that areas marked by increasing disadvantage may be unable to create and maintain HWH programs that exhibit the more advanced evidence-based components of successful rehabilitation.</p>

Included in this section are items measuring program stability, funding, and support from the community. It is possible that stable (yet ineffective) programs exist in disadvantaged areas that are continually funded based on their perceived necessity for those communities. Of the variables in the section, the item measuring community support produced the strongest relationship (<italic>r</italic> = .54), and it is reasonable to assume that HWH programs in disadvantaged communities are valued institutions that do not create the “not in my back yard” (“NIMBY”) effect that placement in a more affluent community might produce.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0306624X11425218">7</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0306624X11425218">Table 3</xref> also presents the five strongest negative individual correlates of disadvantage and reaffirms the overall picture of resource deficiency in disadvantaged areas.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Recent work on the ecological context of offender recidivism suggests that the location to which an ex-offender returns is an important predictor of successful reintegration. Thus far, however, few studies exist that identify the specific mechanisms at work in the relationship between structural indicators and the likelihood of recidivism. The systemic model of crime provides a potential framework for understanding this relationship by describing the connection between structural indicators and the strength of social institutions—with correctional program treatment integrity being one example of the institutional efficacy of organizations designed to promote successful reentry. Given the strong relationship between program quality and a program’s treatment effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0306624X11425218">Lowenkamp et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0306624X11425218">Wright et al., 2012</xref>), the current study sought to determine the importance of ecological context for the strength of HWH programs as measured by the CPAI. To that end, the work presented here leads to three conclusions.</p>
<p>First, and in the most general sense, ecological context “matters” substantially for the strength and quality of correctional treatment programs. Such a finding is consistent with the systemic model of institutional control as set forth by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0306624X11425218">Triplett et al. (2003)</xref>. It appears that strong correctional treatment programs are less likely to be located in increasingly disadvantaged counties—precisely the areas that would benefit most from their presence. This robust finding was supported in both bivariate and multivariate analyses and persisted on the removal of influential cases. It is important to acknowledge, however, that our results may reflect reciprocal causation between structural characteristics and institutional efficacy, and that ineffective HWH programs and their corresponding high recidivism rates may contribute to further social disorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0306624X11425218">Hipp, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0306624X11425218">Rose &amp; Clear, 1998</xref>). The temporal ordering of our data suggests that this is not the case, but we are unable to refute claims that less desirable HWH programs may be deliberately placed in areas that are powerless to defend against their presence, an assertion made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0306624X11425218">Shilton and Lindsay (2003)</xref>.</p>
<p>Future research would do well to determine the extent to which this assumption provides a viable alternative explanation for the findings here. We do, however, have several reasons to believe that this is not necessarily the case. Given that a HWH represents a transitional environment designed to be “halfway home,” it only makes sense that it be centrally located in an area with which the bulk of offenders are familiar. Research does suggest that a disproportionate amount of offenders return to specific and often disadvantaged areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0306624X11425218">Clear, 2007</xref>), and it is, therefore, plausible that HWHs would be located in these disadvantaged communities independent of the desire or ability for surrounding residents to resist them. Conversely, we may see fewer HWHs in affluent communities because there is no immediate need for them rather than due to the ability of those communities to resist their placement. In addition, a review of the distribution of our 38 HWHs reveals that there is indeed variation in the structural contexts in which they are located—particularly when considering the <italic>changing</italic> nature of these contexts. Finally, the notion that disadvantaged communities cannot organize and are powerless to defend against unwanted influences seems to be an overly simplistic understanding of the social dynamics operating within poor communities (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0306624X11425218">Small, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, the policy implications of the current study take the form of criminal justice–specific and general social policy initiatives. We acknowledge the wide variation across states in current usage of HWH programs, but a promising approach would be for correctional officials to reward (and renew) HWH contracts to agencies that demonstrate adherence to the principles of effective intervention and program integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0306624X11425218">Cullen, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0306624X11425218">Wright, 2010</xref>). In addition, it is likely that the quality of job placement centers and temporary housing setups is suspect in disadvantaged areas. A promising alternative would be to focus efforts on creating reentry centers—“one stop shops” for the needs (e.g., housing, substance abuse treatment) of ex-offenders—within the most disadvantaged of areas. Providing all of the required aftercare services in one place sets up ex-offenders to succeed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0306624X11425218">Byrne &amp; Taxman, 2005</xref>), yet it must also be recognized that there is a considerable degree of overlap between ex-offenders and those already attended to by service sectors outside of the criminal justice system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0306624X11425218">Travis, 2005</xref>). To that end, the burden on these often resource-deprived agencies might be reduced a bit when they are located within an integrated system.</p>
<p>It is not our intention to argue that macro-level theories of reoffending should replace or take precedence over the well-established literature on the micro-level causes of recidivism. Indeed, the models of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306624X11425218">Bursik and Grasmick (1993b)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0306624X11425218">Triplett and colleagues (2003)</xref> allowed for important processes at various levels of aggregation. Yet, a key benefit of the application of macro-level criminological theory for the study of offender rehabilitation and recidivism is that a rich history of general policy implications has already been set forth. The similar structures at work for both the explanation of offending and reoffending suggest that attention to these policy proposals will reduce recidivism as an added bonus in addition to the suppression of initial criminal behavior. Policies aimed at ameliorating the effects of economic deprivation and family disruption, particularly in the most disadvantaged of areas, will likely have a significant impact on crime reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0306624X11425218">Pratt, 2009</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0306624X11425218">Messner and Rosenfeld (2001)</xref> noted, however, mere attention to poverty or inequality is unlikely to be an effective crime-control strategy in the absence of other cultural and structural changes. In particular, they advocate for institutional reform and note that weak institutions invite active resistance to informal and formal control on the part of residents. The current analysis is supportive of such an approach and details the importance of an increased focus on strengthening local institutions in disadvantaged areas.</p>
<p>Third, the current study integrated the systemic model of crime with ideas about successful correctional intervention to produce a more comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding offender reintegration. In doing so, our results suggest that macro-level criminological theories should be developed more fully to account for variation in the strength of social institutions. Our findings indicated that the counties in Ohio differ substantially in their abilities to secure and retain sound HWH programs. This is consistent with a large body of research that emphasizes the lack of basic social institutions in disadvantaged communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0306624X11425218">Peterson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0306624X11425218">Wilson, 1987</xref>). The current results go beyond this fact by detailing the limited institutional efficacy of HWH programs in disadvantaged communities. Thus, apart from institutions being scarce in these locales, those organizations that are present are likely to suffer in terms of strength and quality. In the end, the current study provides partial support for the systemic model of institutional control: Ecological context played an important role in the development and retention of strong institutions. Given the strong relationship between program integrity and program treatment effects (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0306624X11425218">Lowenkamp et al., 2006</xref>), it is reasonable to assume that the overall model provides a plausible framework for understanding offender reintegration.</p>

<p>To that end, a halfway house (HWH) could be conceived of as a source of formal control, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306624X11425218">Kubrin and Weitzer (2003)</xref> identified as a glaring omission in most social-disorganization analyses. Furthermore, those works that do consider formal control often focus on police presence within a community (compare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0306624X11425218">Rose &amp; Clear, 1998</xref>). A HWH program instead represents an institution intended to reduce recidivism through promoting successful reintegration. It could, therefore, be considered representative of the “formal-informal control nexus” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306624X11425218">Kubrin &amp; Weitzer, 2003</xref>, p. 384), in which actions by the formal criminal justice system are buttressed by a social institution that also promotes informal social control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0306624X11425218">LaFree, 1998</xref>). Although this may be true for the state of Ohio, it is important to note that the manner and extent to which HWH programs are used varies considerably across states.</p>

<p>The full version of the Correctional Program Assessment Inventory (CPAI) contains 77 items. Due to the limited nature of the data collection, the total number of items scored for each HWH was reduced to 62. The current analysis uses a reduced form of the CPAI that includes only the 33 items that were found to be significantly and positively correlated with treatment effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0306624X11425218">Lowenkamp, Latessa, &amp; Smith, 2006</xref>). Doing so provides an additional check that the dependent variable is indeed measuring institutional strength as it relates to reduced recidivism.</p>

<p>There has been considerable debate about the appropriate unit of analysis for measuring the impact of macro-level indicators on criminal justice phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0306624X11425218">Sampson, Morenoff, &amp; Gannon-Rowley, 2002</xref>). It is potentially problematic to use county-level data in that unobserved heterogeneity within counties may lead to an ecological fallacy, yet our use of county-level structural indicators is consistent with prior criminal justice research in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0306624X11425218">Maume &amp; Lee, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0306624X11425218">Osgood &amp; Chambers, 2000</xref>) as well as with recidivism research specifically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0306624X11425218">Mears, Wang, Hay, &amp; Bales, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0306624X11425218">Reisig, Bales, Hay, &amp; Wang, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, prior research has indicated that the structural correlates of crime are generally robust across city, county, and state levels of aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0306624X11425218">Land, McCall, &amp; Cohen, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0306624X11425218">Pratt &amp; Cullen, 2005</xref>). We acknowledge, however, that testing a primarily neighborhood-level theory at the county level is sure to provoke concern among some, and we suggest that future research pay more attention to the dynamics associated with structural characteristics and institutional efficacy at varying levels of aggregation.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn4-0306624X11425218">

<p>A concern with the use of residual-change scores is that the predicted values of the structural characteristics can be above 100% or below 0% whereas the observed values cannot, which leads to incorrect measures of change. This was not a problem in the current data as no predicted values approached either 0 or 100.</p>

<p>A notable omission from the current construct is a measure of unemployment. Principal components analysis revealed that percentage unemployed loaded poorly (i.e., factor loading &lt; .50) on the concentrated disadvantage construct. This is consistent with prior research suggesting that unemployment is conceptually distinct and empirically independent from other indicators of concentrated disadvantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0306624X11425218">Land et al., 1990</xref>). Given the significance of economic conditions for the prediction of criminal behavior in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0306624X11425218">Chiricos, 1987</xref>), and for reentry in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0306624X11425218">Hannon &amp; DeFina, 2010</xref>), we retain independent measures of the change in the percentage of individuals unemployed in our analyses.</p>

<p>The variables indicating the change in the percentage of households that were female headed and the change in the percentage of families on public assistance were reasonably correlated (<italic>r</italic> = .66), and the variance inflation factors and tolerance scores indicated that multicollinearity was potentially problematic for the full model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306624X11425218">Fox, 1991</xref>).

<p>Important to note, however, is that the community support variable was not correlated with recidivism and, thus, was not included in the reduced 33-item CPAI measure used in the above analyses. Also, this item measures whether a program lacks an antagonistic relationship with the community, while a separate variable (not correlated with disadvantage) measures whether the program’s values and goals are congruent with those of the community.</p>
