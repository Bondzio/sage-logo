<p>Andy Bondy and Lori Frost, well-known creators of the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS), have updated their popular book first published approximately 12 years ago. This book provides a concise, but thorough, introduction to a variety of visual communication strategies, with an emphasis on PECS. The first four chapters review communication and the relationship between communication and behaviour. The fifth chapter, written by Canadians Pat Mirenda and Brenda Fossett, provides an overview of a variety of low- and high-tech augmentative and alternative communication systems. New to this edition is information on current (at the time of publication) advances in technology, such as iPhone and iPad “apps” that did not exist when the first edition was published. The sixth and seventh chapters provide an overview of the six phases of PECS. In addition to explaining the structure, the authors do a nice job of addressing commonly asked questions, such as “What is the relationship between PECS and speech development?” and “Should PECS be abandoned once a child begins to speak?” They also provide troubleshooting advice for the most frequently made mistakes when implementing PECS. Finally, although the book is primarily focused on expressive language, the final (eighth) chapter introduces PECS in relation to receptive language.</p>
<p>The authors take care to incorporate evidence from up-to-date research into the book, which is written in clear language, easily accessible for both parents and professionals. Interesting and relevant vignettes, pictures, and tables provide context for the reader and highlight key points. Information on potential resources, including web addresses, is also provided, although these resources are specific to the United States.</p>
<p>Importantly, although this book does provide a nice amount of detail and description on communication strategies and PECS in particular, it is not a training manual. As such, it is not intended as a supplement for specific training in PECS and other functional communication strategies.</p>
<p>This book is an excellent resource to introduce occupational therapists, other professionals, and parents to visual communication strategies, including PECS, for people with autism or related developmental disabilities. The authors’ relevant clinical experiences and dedication to people with autism, their parents, and other caregivers are apparent throughout the book and through their commendable efforts to make this topic interesting, accessible, and informative to a wide audience.</p>
