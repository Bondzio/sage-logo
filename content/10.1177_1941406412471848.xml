<p><italic>Background</italic>. The use of mid-upper-arm circumference (MUAC) as a screening measure for assessing undernutrition has the following advantages: makes use of simple equipment, is easy to carry to field sites, and requires minimal training. MUAC cutoffs for undernutrition are available for children and adults but not for adolescents. <italic>Objective</italic>. To compare MUAC with BMI in assessing undernutrition among adolescent girls and to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of MUAC as a tool in assessing their nutritional status. <italic>Methodology</italic>. A total of 565 unmarried adolescent girls of both school-going and non-school-going age (16-18 years old) from the urban slums of Pune city Maharashtra, India, were recruited for the cross-sectional study. Anthropometric measurements, including height, weight, and MUAC were recorded. <italic>Results</italic>. The percentage of adolescents who were malnourished was 4.8% according to BMI and 5.0% for MUAC. BMI highly correlated with MUAC (r = 0.593), and MUAC as a screening tool showed 28.57% sensitivity and 96.46% specificity. Further studies among different age groups need to be carried out to arrive at standard cutoffs for MUAC.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Body mass index (BMI) in anthropometry has been well established as a useful indicator to assess nutritional status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1941406412471848">1</xref></sup> BMI in the field level has limitations because it involves multiple instruments like stadiometers and accurate weighing scales. Weight, which is one of the components of BMI, can be misleading in the presence of edema. Among the Canadian population, for fiscal and logistic reasons, BMI was computed based on self-reported height and weight. This led to misclassification of BMI categories.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1941406412471848">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Mid-upper-arm circumference (MUAC) measures the arm muscle and fat area. In severely malnourished children and adults, MUAC is used to identify individuals with morbidity and those at risk of mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1941406412471848">3</xref></sup> However, it is not used as an indicator for screening undernutrition among adolescents because of changes in the skeletal muscle and subcutaneous fat of this particular population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1941406412471848">4</xref></sup> Thus, MUAC cutoffs for undernutrition are available for younger children and adults (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1941406412471848">Table 1</xref>) but not for adolescents. Few studies have been conducted in developing countries among adolescents and adults. Work done among adult men in Jharkhand, India, has proposed a value &lt;240 mm as a cutoff for determining undernutrition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1941406412471848">5</xref></sup></p>

<p>Undernutrition is defined as the outcome of insufficient food intake and repeated infectious diseases. It includes being underweight for one’s age, too short for one’s age (stunted), dangerously thin for one’s height (wasted), and deficient in vitamins and minerals (micronutrient malnutrition).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1941406412471848">6</xref></sup> Of the total adolescent population, 88% live in developing countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1941406412471848">7</xref></sup> Addressing undernutrition among adolescent girls in these regions is a major public health priority because they are the future mothers and are likely to be married before 18 years of age. This increases the risk of nutritional deficiencies manifesting in adverse pregnancy outcomes. As MUAC is a simple, noninvasive, and inexpensive method, there is a need for studying its use as a screening indicator for undernutrition among different age groups and ethnicities. Adolescents in developing countries are at a greater risk of the undesirable consequences of undernutrition. Therefore, there is a need to identify simpler techniques to assess undernutrition among this age group.</p>
<p>Studies among adolescent girls in different states of India and national reports like National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau (NNMB) have used BMI to assess nutritional status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1941406412471848">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1941406412471848"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1941406412471848">10</xref></sup> However, a recent study among adolescent boys in Kolkata, India, has shown MUAC to be effective in screening undernutrition by exhibiting high sensitivity and specificity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1941406412471848">11</xref></sup> The present study therefore aims to answer the following research questions: (<italic>a</italic>) How does MUAC compare with BMI in assessing nutritional status? and (<italic>b</italic>) Can MUAC be used as a screening tool to assess undernutrition among adolescent girls, 16 to 18 years of age?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1941406412471848" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methodology</title>
<p>A cross-sectional study was undertaken to assess the nutritional status of unmarried adolescent girls living in 8 different urban slums of Pune city, Maharashtra, India. A list of households having adolescent girls in the selected age group of 16 to 18 years was prepared with the help of health workers, and those participants with a written consent were recruited. A total of 565 girls from the lower socioeconomic status, who were not suffering from major illness prior to or during the course of the study, formed the study sample. Data were collected over a period of 18 months. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from ISBEC (<italic>Inter System Biomedical Ethics</italic> Committee) Mumbai, India.</p>
<p>Anthropometric measurements, including height, weight, and MUAC were recorded. Weight was measured using a portable digital weighing scale calibrated using standard weights at regular intervals and was recorded in light clothing to the nearest 0.1 kg. Height was measured using a portable stadiometer nearest to 0.5 cm, without shoes, ensuring a parallel Frankfurt plane. MUAC was measured on bare skin nearest to 0.1 cm using an inextensible measuring tape after marking the midpoint of the left upper arm between the olecranon and acromion process. The measurement was taken in a relaxed position of the arm by trained personnel to maintain technical errors of measurement within standard limits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1941406412471848">12</xref></sup> The stadiometer and measuring tape were calibrated with a standard meter scale. All anthropometric measurements were taken in triplicate, and the average value was recorded. BMI was calculated using the following formula: Weight (in kg)/Height (in m<sup>2</sup>). Participants having BMI and MUAC less than the fifth percentile as per WHO were categorized as undernourished.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1941406412471848">11</xref></sup> The percentage of adolescent girls found to be undernourished by the 2 different methods were compared using the <italic>t</italic> test. Pearson’s correlation was used to analyze the correlation between BMI and MUAC. MUAC as a screening tool for undernutrition was assessed by sensitivity and specificity calculations. Sensitivity measures the percentage of true positives (undernourished), and specificity the percentage of true negatives (normally nourished) in the selected population. SPSS version 19 was used to analyze the data.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>The means and standard deviations of MUAC and BMI are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1941406412471848">Table 2</xref>. Results indicate that 4.8% and 5% were below the fifth percentile using BMI and MUAC, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1941406412471848">Table 3</xref>). BMI highly correlated with MUAC (<italic>r</italic> = 0.593; <italic>P</italic> = .000) and is presented as a scatter plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1941406412471848">Figure 1</xref>. In the present study, according to MUAC, 8 out of 27 undernourished participants were identified as true positives or undernourished, and 518 out of 538 girls were identified as true negatives or normally nourished, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1941406412471848">Table 4</xref>. The percentages of positive and negative predictive values were 29.62% and 96.28%, respectively. The use of MUAC to assess nutritional status showed 28.57% sensitivity and 96.46% specificity, as presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1941406412471848">Table 4</xref>. A similar observation was reported among children for MUAC, with a sensitivity and specificity of 24.6% and 94.8%, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1941406412471848">13</xref></sup> MUAC is well recognized as a screening tool for undernutrition in children, because the prevalence of undernutrition, specifically severe acute malnutrition and moderate acute malnutrition, is high in developing countries. However, in populations with low prevalence, a lower sensitivity of the same tool has been observed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1941406412471848">13</xref></sup> As stated in Grimes and Schulz,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1941406412471848">14</xref></sup> very good tests when used in a low-prevalence setting can have poor positive predictive values (proportion of positive test results that are true positives). The present study, which was carried out in urban slums, involves a similar setting where there is low prevalence of undernutrition. The higher the prevalence of undernutrition, the greater would be the sensitivity as observed in the work done by Dasgupta et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1941406412471848">11</xref></sup> Because the percentage of undernourished participants in the present study is 4.8% or 5% per BMI and MUAC, respectively, further studies are suggested among populations with a higher prevalence of undernutrition—for example, adolescent girls in rural and tribal India and pregnant adolescents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1941406412471848">15</xref></sup></p>

<p>The sample being selected from a single geographical area is a limiting factor of the study. However, the results of the present study among adolescent girls indicate a positive correlation between BMI and MUAC. A similar study among adolescents in Tanzania showed a high correlation between BMI and MUAC, suggesting that the latter could be used as an assessment tool among adolescents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1941406412471848">16</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Measurement of MUAC, a simple noninvasive method, has been adopted for screening undernutrition among children and adults both in epidemiological and clinical studies. The results of the present study in Maharashtra, India, indicate that MUAC in adolescent girls has a sensitivity and specificity similar to those in studies carried out among populations of children with low prevalence of underntrition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1941406412471848">12</xref></sup> and correlates positively with BMI among adolescent girls in the age group of 16 to 18 years. In comparison with other methods, it offers the advantages of easy-to-carry equipment, even to geographically inaccessible areas; requires minimum training; and is effective in the assessment of nutrition status when measured with care and precision. For these reasons, MUAC has to be studied further among different age groups to arrive at standard cutoffs in developing countries for appropriate interventions. With undernutrition being highly prevalent among adolescent pregnant women in developing countries, MUAC measurement appears to be a promising tool to screen undernutrition.</p>
