<sec id="sec1-1465116511435712"><title>Dylan on dimensionality: The significance of political labeling</title>
<p>On Friday, 13 December 1963, the National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee (NECLC)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1465116511435712">1</xref></sup> organized their annual Bill of Rights dinner in order to present a distinguished individual with its Tom Paine Award. That night, the award was given to a young singer-songwriter dressed in a suede jacket and a pair of blue jeans, attire that starkly contrasted with the furs, pearls, and bow ties worn by the mostly wealthy and elderly liberal NECLC ranks. In his controversial acceptance speech Bob Dylan declared his political independence by stating: ‘There’s no black and white, left and right to me anymore; there’s only up and down and down is very close to the ground. And I’m trying to go up without thinking about anything trivial such as politics.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1465116511435712">2</xref></sup> By 1963, Dylan had become a symbol of the New Left and the Civil Rights Movement, a role that made him uncomfortable. Interestingly, Dylan used two distinct terms to demonstrate his political autonomy; he no longer wanted to be associated with the ‘left’ or the ‘right’. These labels are clearly not Dylan’s inventions nor are they merely a vestigial homage to the seating arrangement in the French Estates General of 1789 where supporters of the Ancien Régime sat to the right of the Assembly president and supporters of the revolution to his left.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1465116511435712">3</xref></sup> The terms ‘left’ and ‘right’ have come to identify distinct historical traditions, different conceptions of the good society, and alternative lifestyles. In the contemporary world, political scientists, politicians, journalists, and voters have come to associate broad streams of ideas with the terms ‘left’ and ‘right’. Although the left–right dimension is sometimes referred to as the ‘ideological super-issue’ – that is, the dimension that bundles the issues that happen to be salient in a society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1465116511435712">Pierce, 1999</xref>: 30; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1465116511435712">Gabel and Huber, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1465116511435712">McDonald and Budge, 2005</xref>) – its poles contrast a more progressive and redistributive role for the state to a more conservative and market-oriented role. Dylan’s unease with the labels ‘left’ and ‘right’ has resonance with the uncertainty of political scientists about the value of ‘left’ and ‘right’ as radical simplifications of political actors’ positions within a political space. The conceptualization and measurement of the dimensionality of political space and the positions of parties and voters within that space lie at the heart of a science of politics and constitute the topic of this special issue.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1465116511435712"><title>Estimating dimensionality: A priori and a posteriori methods</title>
<p>In recent years, the debate concerning the structure of political competition has intensified, especially among political science scholars studying Europe. Is political space in European polities (both East and West) best described as unidimensional? Or is left–right contestation over the role of the state in the economy now accompanied by a new and independent cultural divide pitting nationalists and cultural conservatives against cosmopolitans and cultural libertarians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1465116511435712">Benoit and Laver, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1465116511435712">Dalton, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1465116511435712">Inglehart et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1465116511435712">Kriesi et al., 2008</xref>)? The political science literature explaining the dimensionality of political competition goes back at least to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1465116511435712">Seymour Martin Lipset and Stein Rokkan’s (1967)</xref> pioneering work on cleavage structures. Lipset and Rokkan’s theory of social cleavages hypothesizes how macro developments – the national revolution, the Reformation, and the Industrial Revolution – produce enduring structures of conflict that shape political structure, political organization, and the substantive character of conflict. Cleavages arise to the extent that social structure – chiefly, occupation, religion, and spatial location – determines political preferences.</p>
<p>An implication of this is that new generations of citizens may not find a place in frozen party systems once ‘decades of structural change and economic growth have made the old, established alternatives increasingly irrelevant’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1465116511435712">Lipset and Rokkan, 1967</xref>: 54). Indeed, the links between social structure and political preferences that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1465116511435712">Lipset and Rokkan diagnosed in 1967</xref> appear much looser today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1465116511435712">Franklin et al., 1992</xref>). Models of political competition that conceive stable electorates strongly tied to specific parties through deeply rooted social divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1465116511435712">Lazarsfeld et al., 1944</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1465116511435712">Lipset and Rokkan, 1967</xref>) are no longer accurate depictions of political competition. Political scientists face the challenge of estimating and explaining actor positioning in a volatile political space that is unhinged from its traditional sociological moorings.</p>
<p>There are two methodological approaches to this conundrum (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1465116511435712">Benoit and Laver, 2012</xref>). The first is the deductive method in which researchers derive issue dimensions from theory in advance of measurement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1465116511435712">Lipset and Rokkan’s 1967</xref> paper is an example of this method. The alternative is an inductive approach in which the researcher frames a dataset from which dimensions can be inferred. Prior measurements of party or public stances on an array of issues are used as indicators to produce latent constructs which the researcher then interprets. Much recent work on party competition follows an inductive approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1465116511435712">Bakker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1465116511435712">Laver et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1465116511435712">Slapin and Proksch, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Both approaches are theoretically guided. The deductive or a priori approach makes initial assumptions about dimensionality that may then be tested; the inductive or a posteriori approach makes more or less explicit assumptions about the composition of issues that produce dimensions. The problem is not that issues and dimensions are not physical objects. Confirming or disconfirming a hypothesis involves observation, and all observation is theoretically impregnated whether it is observation of a physical object or observation of a non-physical object (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1465116511435712">Lakatos, 1970</xref>). The fact that one can observe an object ‘with one’s own eyes’ does not make it easier to hypothesize about. Rather, the problem is that, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1465116511435712">Benoit and Laver (2012)</xref> emphasize, dimensional representations of issue spaces are like maps and should be evaluated in terms of their use-value as well as their validity. It is possible to say that a map is wrong, but there are many maps that may be considered useful.</p>
<p>This special issue presents scientific work using both a priori and a posteriori methods to describe and interpret political dimensionality.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-1465116511435712"><title>Theorizing dimensionality: Sociological and strategic approaches</title>
<p>A second distinction is between <italic>sociological</italic>, or bottom-up, approaches that explain dimensionality in terms of the fundamental conflicts in a society and <italic>strategic</italic>, or top-down, approaches that explain dimensionality in terms of party competition, the rules of the political game, and the benefits of reduction. As political preferences have become more volatile, theory has shifted away from political sociology to strategic competition, but both have their proponents.</p>
<p>The sociological approach is concerned chiefly with the substantive character of divisions in society and the probabilities that individuals with particular social characteristics will support one or the other political party. It starts from the Lipset–Rokkan premise that major conflicts are rooted in the historical experience of a society and that these have an intergenerational effect on the values and preferences of citizens. Voters have durable social characteristics, above all class, gender, education, and occupational status, that lead them to identify with certain political parties and not with others. The sociological approach conceives of political parties as programmatic organizations that mobilize and are responsive to ideologically self-selected activists and leaders as well as to voters. As a result, political parties have limited flexibility in responding to new issues that arise on the political agenda.</p>
<p>The strategic approach starts from the Schattschneiderian assumption that politics is a competitive struggle among political parties about which political issues come to dominate the political agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1465116511435712">Schattschneider, 1960</xref>). In this approach, parties are not vessels carrying societal divisions but actively structure and determine the content of societal conflict. As a result, the substantive character of political competition will vary from election to election as new issues are identified and mobilized by one party or another (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1465116511435712">Carmines and Stimson, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1465116511435712">Riker, 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>Political parties politicize a previously non-salient event, policy issue, or societal conflict and attempt to gear up public attention over this controversy. Of course, they have to carefully choose which issue to mobilize and ensure that it resonates with people’s livelihoods and interests. Nevertheless, within the strategic perspective, an issue is likely to structure the political debate only when a political party or candidate gives it political expression (see De <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1465116511435712">Vries and Hobolt, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1465116511435712">Stimson et al., 2012</xref>). Introducing a new issue involves risk because it ‘is capable of subtracting more voters than it adds’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1465116511435712">Stimson et al., 2012</xref>: 293). Consequently, a political party will seek to reduce political issues to the dimension on which it has a competitive advantage (De <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1465116511435712">Vries and Hobolt, 2012</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1465116511435712">Rovny, 2012</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1465116511435712">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>In short, sociological and strategic approaches direct our attention to different sources of dimensionality. The sociological approach roots dimensions in the social divisions that arise in the course of historical development. The strategic approach conceives dimensions as reflecting party competition about the salience of issues as they arise on the political agenda.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-1465116511435712"><title>Searching for dimensionality: A typology</title>
<p>The four-fold matrix in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1465116511435712">Figure 1</xref> combines the choice between a priori and a posteriori methods with the theoretical alternatives of sociological and strategic approaches to dimensionality.

<p>The Lipset–Rokkan theory of cleavages can be understood as an a priori <italic>sociological</italic> approach to dimensionality. It explains variation in cleavage structures across European societies deductively by examining patterns of conflict among elite actors in the course of the national revolution, the Reformation, and the Industrial Revolution. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1465116511435712">Kitschelt and Rehm (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1465116511435712">Oesch (2006)</xref> theorize dimensions of conflict for contemporary democracies and then place actors on these dimensions according to their occupational location and workplace skills. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1465116511435712">Kriesi et al. (2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1465116511435712">2008</xref>) frame a two-dimensional framework – an economic left–right dimension and a cultural dimension dividing the losers and winners from globalization – but use inductive empirical approaches (including multidimensional scaling) to determine the content of these dimensions.</p>
<p>Carmines and Stimson’s theory of issue evolution is an example of a deductive top-down approach. The authors define, a priori, changes in the dimensionality of the American political space from the 1960s onwards and highlight the role of political parties in bringing about that change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1465116511435712">Carmines and Stimson, 1989</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1465116511435712">Stimson et al. (2012)</xref> mix deductive and inductive approaches to dimensionality in France. They begin by estimating dimensionality inductively by examining a large array of policy items over several decades. They then categorize issues as economic left–right or sociocultural to assess the association between these a priori dimensions.</p>
<p>Similar approaches have also been used to examine party competition over European integration and political dimensionality in the European Parliament (EP). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1465116511435712">Hix and his colleagues (2006)</xref> inductively analyze roll-call votes to uncover the dimensions of political competition within the EP. They find a left–right dimension, similar to that in national politics, and a weaker second dimension relating to European integration. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1465116511435712">Proksch and Slapin 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1465116511435712">Slapin and Proksch, 2010</xref>) use a similar inductive approach to analyze party positioning in EP debates.</p>
<p>When it comes to the positions of national parties on European issues, deductive sociological approaches, and combinations with strategic ones, are more frequent. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1465116511435712">Evans and Whitefield (1998)</xref> analyze the dimensionality of political conflict in the Czech Republic and Slovakia as the result of the contemporary challenges faced by these states leavened by historically rooted cleavages. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1465116511435712">Marks and his colleagues (2002)</xref> examine how longstanding ideological commitments are a prism through which parties perceive new issues such as European integration.</p>
<p>Method and theory are in principle independent but there are some affinities. Sociological approaches theorize dimensionality as the outcome of historical episodes or conflicts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1465116511435712">Lipset and Rokkan (1967)</xref> do this, and they are followed in this respect by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1465116511435712">Kriesi et al. (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1465116511435712">Kitschelt and Rehm (2006)</xref>. This line of research almost always hypothesizes two dimensions, and almost never a single dimension. Strategic approaches are usually open-textured with respect to the substantive content of conflict, but have a strong prior concerning the simplifying consequences of elite competition. For example, rational choice theorists argue that the dimensionality of political space is largely a consequence of characteristics of the strategic environment in which parties operate, most notably electoral institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1465116511435712">Cox, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1465116511435712">Duverger, 1959</xref>). Hence, in contrast to the political sociology of dimensionality, research within the strategic tradition detects a single dimension, or one-plus dimensions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1465116511435712">Downs, 1957</xref>).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-1465116511435712"><title>Content of special issue: Seven essays on dimensionality</title>
<p>So, how can one describe the political space in Europe? Can voters and political parties be located with reasonable precision on one, two, or more dimensions? And how can one explain variation in the number of dimensions and their substantive content?</p>
<p>The contributions in this special issue advance a variety of methods to probe these questions. The first paper, by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1465116511435712">Benoit and Laver (2012)</xref>, is concerned with the conceptualization and measurement of dimensionality. The following papers theorize about how dimensionality and positioning on issues vary across countries or over time.</p>
<p>The contribution by Benoit and Laver engages basic epistemological questions that arise when one conceptualizes and measures dimensionality. They do so by drawing our attention to a revealing and instructive example: the Central and Circle lines of the London Underground. Dimensional maps, such as the Underground map, should be evaluated against the purpose for which they are designed. The authors then illustrate the potential risks arising from inductive estimation of dimensions in the European Parliament.</p>
<p>The article by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1465116511435712">Bakker, Jolly and Polk (2012)</xref> maps the dimensionality of party competition across 24 countries using Chapel Hill expert survey (CHES) data. The authors find that the political space in most countries can be characterized as three-dimensional, consisting of an economic left/right, a social left/right, and a pro-/anti-EU dimension. That being said, there is considerable cross-national variation in how these three dimensions relate to one another. Given this substantial disparity in the relationships within this three-dimensional space, the authors present a new measure of dimensional complexity that allows researchers to capture the interrelatedness between the economic left/right, a social left/right, and a pro-/anti-EU dimension.</p>
<p>The article by De <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1465116511435712">Vries and Hobolt (2012)</xref> deals with the question of how and why new issue dimensions are successfully introduced. Building on the analysis of issue evolution in the United States, these authors suggest that ‘political losers’ in the party system can advance their position by introducing a new issue dimension. This strategy of issue entrepreneurship – that is, the attempt to restructure political competition by mobilizing a previously non-salient issue dimension – allows political losers to attract new voters. By examining issue entrepreneurship in the context of party conflict over European integration, De Vries and Hobolt show that, based on concerns related to European integration, voters are more likely to cast their ballot for parties occupying losing positions on the dominant dimension of political competition than for parties holding advantageous positions. What is more, the authors demonstrate that parties employing an issue entrepreneurial strategy on European integration reap clear electoral benefits.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1465116511435712">Rovny’s (2012)</xref> contribution explores how the multidimensionality of political spaces affects the strategies of political parties. The author argues that it is rational for a party to disguise its stance on one dimension by blurring its positioning, while emphasizing its position on another issue dimension. The paper investigates the incidence of emphasis and blurring through a cross-sectional analysis of 132 political parties in 14 West European party systems using Comparative Manifesto Project data, the 2006 CHES, and the 2009 European Election Study.</p>
<p>The article by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1465116511435712">Stimson, Thiébaut and Tiberj (2012)</xref> extends the issue evolution perspective developed in the United States to the mood of public opinion in France from 1973 to the present. The space of party competition in France is much more fragmented than in the United States, yet the authors find that French public opinion is characterized by low dimensionality – more than one dimension but fewer than two. Using an algorithm that builds a single time-series from the available surveys, they find evidence for a thermostatic logic: the public demands more leftist policies when the right is in power, and more rightist policies when the left is in power.</p>
<p>The special issue concludes with a forum piece by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1465116511435712">Proksch and Lo (2012)</xref> that explores the dimensionality of party positioning on European integration and a response by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1465116511435712">Marks et al. (2012)</xref>. Proksch and Lo argue that the dimension of European integration is weakly continuous because it is more difficult to estimate the positions of moderate and pro-integration parties than of Eurosceptic parties. Comparing the 2002 CHES data set with the 2003 Benoit–Laver expert data set and the 2006 CHES data set with voter placements of political parties generated by the 2009 European Election Study, they make a case for treating party positioning on European integration as bimodal.</p>
<p>In their response, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1465116511435712">Marks, Steenbergen and Hooghe (2012)</xref> cross-validate the CHES data across terciles of the European integration dimension and explore the reliability of the expert judgments. They examine the continuity of the dimension and re-evaluate the case for dichotomizing party positions.</p></sec>
