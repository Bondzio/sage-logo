<p>This article addresses the apparent tension in O’Donovan’s overall argument in <italic>The Ways of Judgment</italic> (2005): a tension between his constructive account of judgement (central to Parts I and II), and his endorsement of Jesus’ injunction <italic>not</italic> to judge (central to Part III). After clarifying exactly what kind of judgement O’Donovan intends in identifying judgement as the core political practice, the article highlights a few key aspects of O’Donovan’s political theology that might mitigate, or even take away, the tension in his argument. The article then goes on to address a remaining issue, namely that O’Donovan seems to imply that Christians are to judge only in private, thereby leaving all public judgement to the secular authorities. In response to this impression the article will affirm, in the light of Rom. 12:1-8, that the church does exercise public judgement, by corporately discerning, formulating and enacting the implications of God’s judgement in Christ.</p>

<body>
<p>It is now more than six years since Oliver O’Donovan’s <italic>The Ways of Judgment</italic> was published.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0953946812444679">1</xref></sup> The book, whose chapters were originally presented as the 2003 Bampton Lectures (Oxford), is an impressive exercise in Christian political ethics. It is intended as the sequel to <italic>The Desire of the Nations</italic>, published in 1996,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0953946812444679">2</xref></sup> which is best described as an exercise in political <italic>theology. The Ways of Judgment</italic> examines the political practices and institutions of late modern society in light of the gospel of Christ, whereas <italic>The Desire of the Nations</italic> explores the prior and more general question as to how the gospel has any bearing on political realities at all.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0953946812444679">3</xref></sup> Both books have attracted criticism as well as praise.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0953946812444679">4</xref></sup> In this article I will restrict myself to discussing <italic>The Ways of Judgment</italic> (<italic>WJ</italic>), and focus on an aspect of O’Donovan’s argument that has particularly intrigued me while reading and re-reading the book: the apparent tension between O’Donovan’s constructive account of judgement, and his endorsement of Jesus’ call <italic>not</italic> to judge.</p>
<p>Before engaging with O’Donovan’s account of judgement, and addressing the element of tension in his arguments, let me venture a very brief summary of the overall argument of <italic>WJ</italic>. The label ‘political ethics’ fits the first two parts in particular, since it is here, in chapters 1–12, that O’Donovan offers what one might call a moral phenomenology of political realities: a description of political phenomena that goes beyond mere description, involving the kind of critical examination of practices and institutions that also allows for engagement and participation. Although analytical in style, what these chapters aim to provide is practical guidance, to citizens and politicians alike.</p>
<p>Part I, elaborating on themes already explored in <italic>The Desire of the Nations</italic>, focuses on the <italic>political act</italic>—the act which underlies political practices and institutions, rendering them meaningful and coherent. This act, we are told, is the practice of judgement: the public condemnation of wrong, with a view to protecting and safeguarding the common life of a society. Part II then offers an account of <italic>representation</italic>, with a view to explaining the processes through which public judgements can be recognised as authoritative within particular societies (e.g., elections). Part III moves beyond political ethics properly speaking, and focuses on the life of the church. The latter is described, from a political point of view, as a community that learns to obey rather than exercise judgement, or seek adjudication by others. It is here that Jesus’ injunction to refrain from judgement comes into full view: ‘Judge not, that you not be judged’ (Matt. 7:1). O’Donovan understands this injunction as pointing to the eschatological consummation of all political agency in <italic>communication</italic>; that is, in human sociality that is no longer dependent on acts of judgements for its integrity and continuation. And while such pure communication will only be fully realised in the Heavenly City, when human society is ruled directly, through communion with God, the church is a society that through its practices foreshadows that eschatological political reality. And so the book returns to the point from which it set out, namely political <italic>theology</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0953946812444679">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>In light of this outline, it is clear that the apparent tension in <italic>WJ</italic> is mainly between Parts I and III; that is, between the part in which O’Donovan unfolds his account of judgement as the political act, and the one where he presents the church as a community ‘beyond judgement’. It may seem as if Part III questions the analysis set out in Part I; as O’Donovan is taking with one hand what he had given with the other. In examining whether this impression has any ground, I should begin by establishing what exactly it is that O’Donovan has given in the first place. As I already indicated, what O’Donovan provides in Part I is an account of judgement, and <italic>political</italic> judgement in particular. It is an account that should help us understand and appreciate the political practices and institutions that we have inherited. I would like to highlight a few key aspects of that account, some of which have proved to be controversial in subsequent discussion of O’Donovan’s book.</p>
<sec id="section1-0953946812444679">
<title>What is Judgement?</title>
<p>O’Donovan’s basic thesis in Part I is that ‘the authority of government resides in the practice of judgment’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0953946812444679">6</xref></sup> Underlying this thesis is his assumption, first, that the primary meaning of judgement is that of moral discrimination: to judge is to identify and separate right and wrong by way of the <italic>condemnation</italic> of the latter. The second assumption is that this act of moral discrimination is not just ‘a’ political act, but rather <italic>the</italic> political act. Indeed, O’Donovan assumes that <italic>all</italic> judgement of this primary type is political: the phrase ‘political judgement’ is strictly speaking tautological.</p>
<p>To say that judgement consists primarily in moral discrimination is to acknowledge other types of judgement, such as aesthetic and deliberative judgement, yet to hold that these are derivative or analogous. As for aesthetic judgement: when I walk through an art gallery and rate one painting ‘beautiful’ and another ‘mediocre’, or just ‘ugly’, what I am doing certainly entails ‘identification’ and ‘separation’. Indeed, insofar as (fancying myself an art critic) I end up deconstructing some particularly bad paintings, I have arguably taken on the task of ‘condemnation’. Yet the categories here are different from those involved in moral discrimination. The attributes ‘beautiful’ and ‘ugly’ may correspond to ‘right’ and ‘wrong’, yet they do not mean the same. The art critic may shiver the first time she sees a particularly bad composition. In the long run, however, shrugging our shoulders is the appropriate attitude to aesthetic affronts—unless, of course, the ugliness in question involves a <italic>moral</italic> affront. ‘Wrong’ is a moral category: it demands more than just the shrugging of shoulders, consisting as it does in grave distortion of relationships. As such it cries out for a genuine <italic>response</italic>; that is, condemnation of the act in word and action (confronting and/or punishing the wrongdoer, championing the victim, preventing further wrongdoing, and so on). Judgement, O’Donovan maintains, is precisely this response.</p>
<p>Aesthetic judgement is thus at best derivative of judgement. As for deliberative judgement, it is dubious whether it is a form of judgement at all. Admittedly, insofar as it involves decision-making concerning action—what we should do—deliberative judgement is, like moral judgement, a form of ‘practical reasoning’. Yet the crucial difference is that whereas moral judgement responds to past acts, deliberative judgement considers what is yet to be done. Deliberation is the exercise of considering the innumerable possibilities before us, against the background of the innumerable uncertainties of the future. To judge deliberatively is therefore nothing else than to reach a practical conclusion, to choose one course of action from the many courses of action worthy to be undertaken—either equally worthy, or ‘more or less’. Judgement, on the other hand, faces options and intentions that have been actualised already, in concrete acts and consequences. Deliberation is proactive and forward-looking (prospective), whereas judgement is primarily reflective and therefore backward-looking (retrospective).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0953946812444679">7</xref></sup> And while there are many gradations of worthy and successful action, to judge is simply to identify and respond to wrong—in whatever form of action (and resulting state of affairs). From a practical point of view, then, judgement is rather ‘black-and-white’, only interested in the binary values of ‘right’ and ‘wrong’. To condemn an act is not to accuse the agent of poor deliberation. We do not punish murderers because we think they should have made better use of their time. In condemning an act we say it constitutes wrong, however well executed it may be. The verdicts of judgement are morally precise in a way that deliberative conclusions are not, and cannot be.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0953946812444679">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Judgement, then, is an act of moral discrimination. Unlike aesthetic judgement, it discriminates between right and wrong rather than beautiful and ugly; and unlike conclusions of deliberation, it discriminates between these in a binary manner, identifying acts as ‘wrong’ <italic>simpliciter</italic>. Yet in order fully to grasp which type of judgement O’Donovan generally has in mind in <italic>WJ</italic>, we must distinguish it from yet another sub-category: the kind of judgement which, though fully moral in the sense just described, is pronounced only privately. The distinction here is not so much between judgements made in the silence of our hearts and those shouted from the rooftops. The difference lies rather in the kind of authority with which judgements are made. Everyone engages in the business of judging, some even incessantly. Usually the best reception our judgements get is a polite hearing; more often, however, people ignore them, or challenge them with their own judgements. Yet there are judgements which we all know we may not shrug off so easily, however much we might want to. When a jury or judge, having worked through a court case at great length, finally pronounces that the accused is ‘guilty’, we know that (apart from the possibility of appeal) the case is settled: the accused <italic>is</italic> now guilty. We may doubt or disagree with the verdict, yet we know our judgements no longer stand alongside the one just pronounced officially—as if the debate were still open. If that were allowed to happen, the whole procedure of prosecution and adjudication would begin to unravel, opening the floodgates to a tide of popular trial and revenge. The judgements of the courts are binding, for society as much as for the condemned party, and are enforced by coercive means such as fines and imprisonment. Even the media are bound to use terms such as ‘accused’ and ‘alleged crime’ while a case is still ongoing; similarly, they must drop these very terms once a verdict has been reached. It is this universally binding character which makes a judgement public, and publicly authoritative, rather than merely private. Private judgements are genuine judgements, and form the basis of judgement publicly exercised. Yet, as soon as the authorities have given their judgement, there is no place anymore for private judgements.</p>
<p>In <italic>WJ</italic> this public judgement is considered the primary type of judgement. The paradigm case of judgement is that which is exercised by public officials, on behalf of and with the authority of society as a whole. Returning to O’Donovan’s basic thesis,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0953946812444679">9</xref></sup> we now know in precisely which kind of judicial practice the authority of government is said to reside: it resides in the <italic>public</italic> exercise of <italic>moral</italic> discrimination. It is this practice which constitutes the heart of all political practices, providing a common rationale to the otherwise vast and (often) Byzantine apparatuses of contemporary governments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0953946812444679">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Having established which kind of judgement O’Donovan has in view, one might ask why precisely this type should constitute the core of political practice. It has been argued that in defining political practice as essentially judicial, O’Donovan excludes whole swathes of tasks that are conventionally understood as political, or belonging to governments’ remit.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0953946812444679">11</xref></sup> Now, O’Donovan clearly does not believe the only task of government is simply and exactly that of a judge (or jury), or that the only seat of government is in the courts. Indeed, he maintains that political judgement consists in forward-looking policy as much as retrospective condemnation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0953946812444679">12</xref></sup> And thus he sees the strictly judicial act supplemented by other, more provisional acts of judgement that prepare for and facilitate the rendering of judgement in court, or precisely pre-empt the need for judicial resolution. What are usually referred to as the ‘legislative’ and ‘executive’ powers or branches of government (the latter including the police and prosecution services) O’Donovan considers as two modes in which government facilitates the practice of judgement in court.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0953946812444679">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>It has been pointed out, however, that even on this account certain services still fall outside the parameters of government, such as the building and maintenance of roads, water pipes and sewers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0953946812444679">14</xref></sup> Behind the disagreement lies a more fundamental question, one which goes to the heart of political theology: whether governmental practice is only ‘remedial’, aiming at correcting distortions of social life; or whether government and political order are part of the created order, consisting in organising and facilitating social life as much as protecting it against wrong.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0953946812444679">15</xref></sup> In this article I will leave aside the practical details of that debate. Yet the main point of disagreement is relevant, since it suggests (as we will see) why O’Donovan counsels the church to refrain from judging. Jumping ahead for a moment: according to O’Donovan there is still a place for judgement insofar as there is still much wrong to be remedied; yet the church is called to anticipate the time when such remedy will no longer be required. But let me first explore and expound the various steps in his argument.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0953946812444679">
<title>A History of Judgements</title>
<p>In itself, it is not contradictory to hold that while the task of government lies in judging wrong and punishing the guilty, the church has no part to play in this business. It would be problematic if by this were implied that the business of government is a ‘necessary evil’. For that would be to overlook the element of <italic>judgement</italic> in the whole business: an act which O’Donovan himself describes as the discrimination of right and wrong, and the vindication of the innocent over against the guilty—surely a task even better suited to God than human beings. Yet this only helps to refine the initial question: if even secular governments are given this (semi-divine) task of moral discrimination, then why is there no place for it in the church?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0953946812444679">16</xref></sup> Should Jesus’ injunction against judgement in Matthew 7 be taken to imply that the church is to remain passive in the face of injustice—whether in its own circle, or without? How can it be that the church is to shun a practice essential for the moral integrity of any other society? Or, in terms of the overall structure of <italic>WJ</italic>: if Part I offers a <italic>constructive</italic> account of a core political practice—that is, one that enables our understanding of, participation in and even reform of political institutions (Part II)—then why are we told in Part III to forego this practice?</p>
<p>When faced with an apparent tension or contradiction in an argument, a good starting point is to assume the confusion lies with oneself rather than the author. In seeking to answer the above questions, therefore, I will first try to determine if, and how, O’Donovan’s overall argument in <italic>WJ</italic> might accommodate both perspectives on judgement.</p>
<sec id="section3-0953946812444679">
<title>Judgement—Human and Divine</title>
<p>First of all, I would suggest that the sense of contradiction diminishes substantially once the two perspectives are placed within the grand biblical narrative as understood by O’Donovan, and particularly as it is understood by him to shape and inform political theology and ethics. This is the narrative of ‘salvation history’, the story of God’s people which the church has inherited from Israel and which it regards as culminating in the death, resurrection and ascension of Jesus Christ. It is a narrative in which, for example, Israel’s experiment with kingship illuminates the political significance of cross and resurrection, just as these events throw light on the messianic dimension of that experiment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0953946812444679">17</xref></sup> Human rule and divine rule do not belong to different universes, but rub shoulders in a rather uneasy coexistence. To put this in terms of judgement: human judgement and divine judgement do not belong to altogether different categories. Instead, there is real tension, even rivalry, between what God decrees and the aspirations of the rulers of the nations, even though God ultimately prevails. This rivalry is expressed in Psalm 2, which depicts the nations as posing a genuine challenge to divine rule. If the L<sc>ord</sc> ultimately proves victorious, then that is because his judgement prevails over that of the nations.Judgement is a practice that is shared between God and humans. The crucial difference between divine and human judgement, of course, is that only God judges with the authority of the Creator. And to that extent nobody but God is fully ‘qualified’ to discriminate between right and wrong. Which is not to say that human beings are unable to judge at all. Despite their limited wisdom and perverted aspirations, humans manage often enough to identify the innocent and the guilty.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0953946812444679">
<title>Compromised Judgement</title>
<p>But the relation between human and divine judgement is not one of rivalry only. This becomes clear as soon as we remind ourselves that, biblically and theologically speaking, the wrong to which judgement is the appropriate response is not just a phenomenon among others, part and parcel of the universe as we know it. Scripturally and theologically speaking, wrong is rooted in <italic>sin</italic>: an aberration from God’s good creation, a wilful turning away from the Creator (and even his creation) that has affected the entire human race. At the same time we learn from Scripture that God is working towards reconciliation and restoration, with the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ as the culmination of that work. And thus, while judgement is a provision for dealing with something that wasn’t meant to be (hence a ‘remedy’), in light of the Creator’s redemptive work we may look forward to a time when judgement will no longer be necessary; when one act of judgement will turn out to have been the <italic>final</italic> one, having dealt with wrong definitively. In fact, O’Donovan would say that this definitive judgement has <italic>already</italic> taken place, namely in the death and resurrection of Christ—God’s decisive act of addressing sin.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0953946812444679">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yet things are more complex still. Since sin affects humanity as a whole, human rulers are as much beholden to sin as those whom they punish. God’s judgements, by contrast, are by definition ‘blameless’ (Ps. 51:4), in condemning as well as in vindicating. Death is the rightful fate of the human race, which in Adam turned away from God and corrupted God’s good creation; whereas new life in Christ is grounded in the rightful vindication of the suffering Servant. Thus what initially may have seemed mere rivalry between divine and human judgement, turns out to imply a more complex drama. The question is no longer simply, ‘Who will have the final word?’, but rather, ‘Will the rulers recognise the final word as it <italic>has been</italic> spoken?’</p>
<p>Thus, from the perspective of salvation history we see that judgement, although in itself a worthwhile practice, is severely compromised in the hands of sinners. Human beings are unlikely candidates to act as judges, their judgements often barely escaping from the vicious cycle of retaliation and renewed offence. To what extent can human judgement remain untainted by vengeance and free from hypocrisy? Especially the latter concern, hypocrisy, lies behind Jesus’ injunction in Matthew 7 not to judge. This is clear from the subsequent warning about noticing the splinter in someone else’s eye while failing to see the beam in one’s own (Matt. 7:3-4). And in Matthew 18, the parable of the Unforgiving Servant aims to make listeners aware of the extent of their indebtedness to God’s forgiveness—that which sets them free to forgive their neighbour in the first place. What is implied in this parable is the notion that anyone quick to condemn her neighbour finds herself in a very haphazard position indeed.</p>
<p>Is O’Donovan saying, then, that no one except God has the right to judge, after all? Not quite, as we will see in a moment. For now, however, the point to be noted is simply this: that to offer a constructive account of a practice which serves a moral purpose (i.e., judgement) is not yet to imply that anyone is authorised to exercise it. In short, it matters <italic>who</italic> judges.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0953946812444679">
<title>Imperfect Judgement</title>
<p>This distinction is accentuated even further by another factor, namely the appalling ‘record’ of the human authorities that traditionally exercise judgement. Their record comprises not just the most outstanding cases of tyranny and violence, but the countless cases in which they had to resort to force and violence. In fact, it is only by way of death and/or exclusion, O’Donovan points out, that earthly rulers are able to enact their judgements, whether through the death penalty, imprisonment or exile.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0953946812444679">19</xref></sup> Responsible for this mode of rule are not only the authorities, but also (and perhaps especially) the societies they represent, which, as O’Donovan puts it, ‘flourish…on the manure of their dead members’ flesh’, and benefit from ‘restrictive immigration’ and ‘penal exclusion from society’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0953946812444679">20</xref></sup> In other words, even where politics has not become overtly repressive or violent, it is only by way of death and exclusion that societies can maintain themselves, and have themselves represented through their rulers.</p>
<p>The latter is not necessarily a matter of malicious intent. As O’Donovan points out, human judgement necessarily operates by using the same means as the offence to which it responds, namely <italic>force</italic>. For this reason, judgement, even when meted out by a genuinely ‘third’ party (rather than, say, the victim), still resembles revenge.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0953946812444679">21</xref></sup> We may like to see a justice system that restores offenders to society, rather than, say, locking them up. Yet to demand this from the judicial process, O’Donovan suggests, is to demand what it cannot deliver. We can only judge through condemnation, and impose our judgements by coercive means; only God’s judgement can also truly restore and redeem. That is, only God’s judgement can be <italic>both</italic> condemnatory <italic>and</italic> redemptive. According to O’Donovan, the paradigmatic case of such judgement is God’s definitive judgement in Christ, referred to earlier: God’s judgement enacted in cross and resurrection—condemning both sin and sinner, and yet restoring the sinful dead to new life in Christ.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0953946812444679">22</xref></sup> O’Donovan does not deny that human societies are to some extent able to restore and reintegrate offenders. Yet he would emphasise that the source of their conciliatory capacity lies not primarily in the human power to forgive, but rather in divine mercy—the driving force behind human forgiveness and mercy. Thus, historically, the desire for merciful judgement is strongest in societies that throughout the centuries have been shaped by the gospel. These societies are not necessarily less vindictive than others, yet they have seen generations of clerics pestering kings and princes, urging them to show mercy just as their heavenly King is merciful.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0953946812444679">23</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0953946812444679">
<title>Political Theology as Narrative</title>
<p>Together these observations suggest that human judges find themselves in an awkward position. Given their own involvement in sin (which is subject to God’s judgements) they seek to do what strictly speaking is God’s work. And in doing so, they risk continuing rather than remedying the works of sin. The irony in this is fully revealed, of course, in the Paschal event already referred to: God’s righteous Servant is judged by human authorities, ‘excluded’ from society as he is executed outside the city gates; as Karl Barth put it, here the Judge himself is put on trial.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0953946812444679">24</xref></sup> Yet in the end it is his earthly judges who are exposed as condemned by their own judgement, especially when Jesus is raised from the dead. If anything, it is this drama that definitively brings to view the corruption of human judgement.</p>
<p>What place, then, is there still left for human judgement and political practice? It seems we can only view our rulers—and, indeed, the political communities we belong to—with the utmost suspicion. Yet O’Donovan steers well clear from such scepticism. Yes: to accept the gospel is to accept that in Christ’s death and resurrection God has definitively dealt with sin and its consequences, and has opened a way to forgiveness and new life. In seeking the continuation of judgement one therefore risks ignoring the compromised nature of human judgements, and their being (graciously) overruled by God. In other words, what Jesus says in Matthew 7 is not merely gentle advice, but a command for those who seek to follow him; for them to return to the business of judgement is to act like ‘a dog that returns to his vomit’ (Prov. 26:11). Nevertheless, in a way reminiscent of Luther, O’Donovan also maintains that political authorities are exempted from the general prohibition—or at least for now.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0953946812444679">25</xref></sup> Luther believed that Christians, in line with Jesus’ teaching, may not defend themselves against wrong. As he puts it in <italic>Temporal Authority</italic> (1523), for them ‘there is no need for any suit, litigation, court, judge, penalty, law, or sword’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0953946812444679">26</xref></sup> Their Christian duty to serve others, however, does include the obligation to defend those that are under threat. And especially if the victim is not (yet) a true Christian—and therefore cannot be expected to ‘turn the other cheek’—the only option is to vindicate him through force. This obligation to defend others is the root of temporal authority.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0953946812444679">27</xref></sup> The same basic idea lies behind O’Donovan’s affirmation of secular political authority: pending the definitive fulfilment of God’s judgement in Christ, human judgement provides a modicum of justice and restraint on evil, especially for those who do not (yet) follow Christ. Thus secular government is, in fact, God’s own provision for a world not (yet) fully reconciled with God: a provision which brings about, if not true righteousness, then at least some external conditions conducive to it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0953946812444679">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>With regard to the church, however, O’Donovan’s stance (again, like Luther’s) is unambiguous: those who seek to follow Christ are called to renounce any self-righteousness and dependence on human judgement, and to enter the ‘space’ opened up by God’s definitive judgement—thus anticipating human society as it will once be fully restored in Christ. In moving beyond human judgement, then, the church is to live as a ‘post-political’ community, as O’Donovan puts it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0953946812444679">29</xref></sup> It is to live a social life that is <italic>purely</italic> social, leaving all judgement to God—and also, for now, to God’s secular representatives on earth.</p>
<p>The above is an outline of ‘salvation history’ in its political dimension, such as I believe provides the narrative framework of O’Donovan’s political ethics, including his discussion of judgement. Although I have only been able to touch on a few aspects, in a rather tentative manner, I think the result is useful with regard to our initial problem: the apparent tension between O’Donovan’s constructive account of judgement, and his endorsement of Jesus’ injunction not to judge. We can see how within the larger framework of salvation history (as interpreted by O’Donovan), much of this tension begins to disappear. The evangelical calling to renounce judgement does not in itself undermine the validity of describing judgement as an act of moral discernment (the core of O’Donovan’s thesis in Parts I and II of <italic>WJ</italic>). It does imply, however, that generally speaking human beings are no longer authorised to perform that act. The gospel thus offers us a new perspective on judgement, one that is unattainable through phenomenological inquiry alone. We are told that the ultimate authority to judge lies with God; that God has overturned and overruled all human judgements; that God still grants some judicial authority to human representatives; and that one day even this limited authority is to be surrendered. For the church, therefore, to renounce this authority is not to be skeptical about judgement <italic>per se</italic>, but to acknowledge the true ‘source’ of judgement (God), as well as its true ‘content’ (Christ the representative of humanity).</p>
<p>Some might complain that if this is how the apparent tension must be understood, then O’Donovan’s initial account of judgement in Parts I and II was slightly deceptive. That is, they might argue that his account is insufficiently theological at the beginning of <italic>WJ</italic>, offering what seems a universally valid theory, yet which must be qualified theologically once the element of salvation history is introduced. Now, it is true that narrative and revelation are more important to O’Donovan’s argument than might initially seem. Yet the reader was warned from the outset: this is a book about the <italic>ways</italic> of judgement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0953946812444679">30</xref></sup> And perhaps it was misleading on my part, then, to describe the discussion in Parts I and II simply as ‘phenomenology’. More importantly, however, we should not make the mistake of regarding phenomenology and narrative as incompatible. Without a grasp of the <italic>structure</italic> of our existence, it would be difficult to appreciate the significance of particular events. How could we appreciate the political meaning of Christ’s death and resurrection, for example, if we had no understanding of political dynamic at all?</p>

<title>Ecclesial Judgement</title>
<p>Having resolved some of the tension in O’Donovan’s argument in <italic>WJ</italic>, I will devote the remainder of this article to address an issue which I think still requires clarification. We have seen that in O’Donovan’s political account of salvation history, the secular authorities retain their task of judgement, as a provision from God for the age pending Christ’s return. One could describe this task as one of ‘mediating’ God’s judgement—if only a specific aspect of it, namely condemnation of wrong. The church, on the other hand, is to abstain from judgement; it is called instead to put into practice what God’s definitive judgement offers: the pattern of life as made possible in Christ.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0953946812444679">31</xref></sup> This does not imply that the church is already the New Jerusalem. In O’Donovan’s political narrative the church is similar to the secular authorities in that it is peculiar to the era between the times of Christ’s ascension and his return. In the New Jerusalem there will be no church, as all of humanity will then be gathered around God’s throne. Until that time, however, it is the church which anticipates and witnesses to the New Jerusalem—not the least, according to O’Donovan, by renouncing judgement. Indeed, O’Donovan might add, until that time the church must depend on the secular authorities for that measure of public law and order from which it, too, benefits.</p>
<p>Yet it is here that a question arises. If both secular government and the church are temporal institutions, and if it is given to secular government to mediate God’s judgement, then why is this task not given to the church? Or, more specifically: if God grants secular government the task of mediating God’s condemnation of wrong, then why, given the full scope of God’s judgement, may we not expect the church to be entrusted with the task of mediating the other, <italic>redemptive</italic> aspect of God’s judgement? While secular rulers are authorised to punish wrong, why should the church not have the complementary ministry of, say, reconciliation?</p>
<p>O’Donovan does in fact hint at such a ministry when he discusses the relation between judgement and mercy, in chapter 6 of <italic>WJ</italic>. Here he speaks of an ‘evangelical politics’ in the social life of the church, where ‘we may expect to see the Paschal victory take effect in judgments that immediately serve the creation of mutual love and the forgiveness of sin’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0953946812444679">32</xref></sup> Yet he immediately moves on to say this politics describes what is yet to come, rather than the church’s current life, and that for the time being the church practises this politics only <italic>indirectly</italic>: not through its own, independent exercise of judgement, but rather ‘through engagement with the secular political societies among whom it lives, witnessing to the risen Christ and claiming their judgments in obedience to him’. Apart from this, what is left to Christians to do is what Jesus called to ‘judge for yourself’ (Lk. 12:57), which O’Donovan explains as the practice (hinted at above) of approving of God’s judgement in Christ by acting in accordance to it. ‘When we judge for ourselves,’ O’Donovan explains, ‘we judge that the good which God by his own judgment has set before us to do is now open to us to do.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0953946812444679">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yet the notion of judging-for-oneself, especially in its original context, suggests an act performed in a relatively private sphere. In Lk. 12:57-59, to ‘judge for yourself’ is to settle a matter with your neighbour before it becomes a matter of public judgement. This point seems to be emphasised even further in the final chapter of <italic>WJ</italic>, where O’Donovan focuses on the individual believer.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0953946812444679">34</xref></sup> In commenting on that chapter, Ben Quash notes that too little weight is given to the <italic>community</italic> of believers; the practice of judgement is not given to the church <italic>corporately</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0953946812444679">35</xref></sup> In light of this one might ask how O’Donovan thinks the church obeys the command in Rom. 12:2, ‘Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0953946812444679">36</xref></sup> Does this transformation take place through the personal transformation of each individual member, or rather as a corporate process?</p>
<p>Whereas it seems O’Donovan would emphasise personal transformation, I would argue that the context of Paul’s words suggests a corporate process. Not only are Paul’s imperatives in the plural (which in itself, of course, does not exclude individual obedience); his command also follows his encouragement of the congregation in Rome to offer themselves to God as ‘a living sacrifice’ (Rom. 12:1); that is, a <italic>single corporate</italic> sacrifice, rather than multiple individual sacrifices.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0953946812444679">37</xref></sup> This corporate quality is echoed in verses 3–8, where the sacrifice envisaged by Paul takes further shape in several forms of mutual ministry among the members of the congregation. As Bernd Wannenwetsch comments, Paul’s counterintuitive expression ‘members of one another’ (12:5), read in connection to verses 6–8, suggests a mode of common life in which all have a share in the various forms of ministry within the congregation—including that of critically receiving the ministry offered by others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0953946812444679">38</xref></sup> The ‘living sacrifice’ Paul has in mind thus involves a lively, even ‘messy’ process of mutual ministry. This process is irreducibly public in that the dynamic of ministry is never exclusively unilateral or even mutual: <italic>all</italic> are, in Paul’s words, ‘members of one another’, and therefore each member has a distinct contribution to make to the ministry engaged in by others.</p>
<p>Now, if Paul’s call for the renewal of minds is seen in the light of these verses (including his reference to a ‘living sacrifice’ in verse 1), then what is suggested, at least, is that this renewal of minds is a corporate affair as well. Furthermore, if Paul’s ‘renewal of minds’ is corporate, then presumably the same applies to what immediately follows—the practice of discerning God’s will, ‘what is good, acceptable and perfect’ (12:2). This latter point in particular has implications for the kind of judgement that Christians may exercise. First of all, the corporate process of discernment to which Paul alludes seems to be one that involves judgement, too; if not judgement in its paradigmatic political sense, then at least in the sense of <italic>determining</italic> ‘what is good, acceptable and perfect’—rather, that is, than just deciding to act upon them (as in practical deliberation).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0953946812444679">39</xref></sup> In fact, since in Paul’s phrasing these objects of judgement (i.e., ‘what is good, acceptable and perfect’) coincide with ‘God’s will’, the kind of judgement implied here appears to be rather similar to what O’Donovan considers ‘judging-for-oneself’. Only Paul might have rather called it ‘judging-<italic>with-God</italic>’.</p>
<p>However, secondly, we have already seen that in Romans 12 this practice of ‘judging-for-oneself’ (or ‘judging-with-God’) is not merely private. Indeed, the entire dynamic of ministry as envisaged by Paul is corporate and public, with each member having a stake in the various forms of ministry given to the body as a whole. In terms of judgement this means that, insofar as judgement can be regarded a specific ministry among others, each member has a stake in it; judgement can never be a strictly private affair. In fact, in Rom. 12:1-8 the practice of judgement seems to involve more than one ministry among others. For insofar as each ministry is exercised corporately—through the critical contribution of each other member—each ministry is accompanied by judgement: not so much concerning this or that practical issue, as more generally concerning how God’s will is to be reflected in the life of the body as a whole. And this, surely, is judgement of a distinctly <italic>political</italic> kind: if not in the sense of being exercised by official representatives (and imposed on a political society), then in the sense of being exercised with a view to the shape of a community’s corporate life.</p>
<p>Such corporate judgement is political in the sense in which (the ideal of) parliamentary debate, too, is political. In both cases we find that all members participate in establishing and maintaining the rule to which they are simultaneously subject. In both cases, this dynamic gives expression to that quality which distinguishes judgement from mere private opinion or will, or an aggregate of private opinions or wills. Despite our experience of judgement often lacking this quality, we know it is essential if judgement is to be truthful, authoritative and effective. In the picture arising from Rom. 12:1-8, no member or group of members holds an exclusive political office. We might say they rather exercise judgement insofar as they find each other in common judgement. Their judging is a genuinely corporate exercise and, to that extent, even <italic>more</italic> political than any secular exercise of judgement could ever be.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0953946812444679">
<title>Judging-With</title>
<p>The above interpretation of Rom. 12:1-8 points towards an understanding of ecclesial judgement as public, and as such highlights an element in the church’s life which in O’Donovan’s account remains somewhat ambiguous. In fact, the account of common judgement presented above also deviates from mainstream notions of politics and political practices. Nevertheless, it can draw support from an unexpected and, indeed, a rather unlikely source: the political writings of Hannah Arendt. Arendt takes a particular interest in judgement: the theme crops us at several places throughout her writings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0953946812444679">40</xref></sup> Like O’Donovan, she considers judgement to be a core political practice. In analysing the practice of judgement, however, Arendt draws on the writings of Immanuel Kant (hardly a source of inspiration in <italic>WJ</italic>), in particular his <italic>Critique of Judgement</italic>. One of the ideas she takes from him is the notion that political judgement is analogous to aesthetic judgement (in contrast to the distinction made earlier).</p>
<p>Secondly, and more importantly here, Arendt adopts Kant’s idea that judgement—aesthetic or political—has by definition a communal dimension. As for Kant, his concern was to describe how we can exercise judgements which, though in a sense necessarily subjective, are not arbitrary. He believed that corresponding to this non-arbitrariness is a human faculty which he called <italic>sensus communis</italic>, or ‘common sense’. It is this faculty, he believed, through which we put ourselves in the place of others, transcending our strictly private perspectives and so obtaining a multi-dimensional perspective on the world. Sound judgements, then, are those which include the views and tastes of others; not so much the private views and tastes of each individual, taken one-by-one, as the views and tastes of that evasive yet influential collective called ‘the public’. We can only judge insofar as we judge ‘with’ others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0953946812444679">41</xref></sup> While Kant focuses on aesthetic judgement, Arendt is primarily interested in its political application, arguing that judgement through common sense is particularly relevant in politics: nowhere is it more important than here, she reminds us, that judgement transcends private perspectives and prejudices. The lesson she takes from Kant, then, is this: judgement is something that citizens do together, for the sake of preserving the public space they share and in which they interact. And to that extent judgement is something that requires the participation of many. Rather than being exercised by a few rulers and judges, to be simply obeyed by or enforced upon the rest of society, judgement ought to rest with the whole citizenry. Judgements are to be formed in a communicative process between citizens, with none of them bearing exclusive judicial responsibility.</p>
<p>However remote Arendt’s political ideals might be from Paul’s vision in Romans 12, her notion of judgement through common sense is interestingly close to that of ‘judging-with-God’—the expression that I suggested earlier to characterise ecclesial judgement. The less specific expression ‘judging-with’ is preferable to mine, however, insofar as it covers judgement as jointly exercised between human beings <italic>as well as</italic> judgement exercised ‘with God’—both of which elements can be found in Rom. 12:1-8. Judging-with-God involves judging-with-each-other. This is not to dismiss O’Donovan’s point about the need for Christians to learn to judge for themselves; after all, that point is made by Jesus himself. It is rather to emphasise more clearly that this practice is embedded in the church’s corporate office of judgement. Paul is not just urging the Roman Christians individually to align themselves with God’s judgement, but encouraging them to explore it as they offer themselves in mutual service. This close connection between judgement and mutual service makes sense, since God has already united them to be the body of Christ; and Christ, after all, is the embodiment of God’s judgement.</p>
<p>This picture of ecclesial judgement confirms my earlier suggestion that the church’s task of judgement is both different from and complementary to that of the secular authorities, in that it mediates the redemptive rather than condemnatory dimension of God’s judgement. The focus here is on discovering ‘what is good, acceptable and perfect’ (Rom. 12:2), rather than condemning what is wrong. Moreover, Paul speaks of this discernment in connection with a ‘renewal of mind’, which emphasises the positive, forward-looking character of the discernment involved—as apposed to the intrinsically negative, retrospective nature of condemnatory judgement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0953946812444679">
<title>Defining the ‘Political’</title>
<p>Having explored in some depth how O’Donovan’s account of ecclesial judgement might be complemented, I should finally respond to an obvious objection. The objection is not so much against my overall interpretation of Rom. 12:1-8, or the notion of corporate judgement developed on the basis of it, as against the idea that we are still dealing here with <italic>judgement</italic>. It could be argued that the distinction between condemnatory and redemptive is question-begging, in that it precisely affirms O’Donovan’s point about ecclesial judgement—namely that whatever office the church may hold, it is certainly not that of halting and condemning wrongdoing, and that therefore it does not constitute judgement in a <italic>political</italic> sense.</p>
<p>With this objection we have arrived at what is, perhaps, the nub of the issue. For it draws our attention to the fact that so much in this discussion is about definitions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0953946812444679">42</xref></sup> For example, is ‘redemptive’ judgement an extended, enhanced or complementary version of condemnatory judgement, or is it a different practice altogether? O’Donovan’s reference to God’s judgement as uniting these two aspects speaks in favour, of course, of defining both as forms of judgement. But maybe the underlying question here is how we should define ‘political’. Granted that condemnatory judgement is central to secular political practice, how should we characterise the complementary mode of judgement: is redemptive judgement political too?</p>
<p>It is, in fact, O’Donovan himself who offers a helpful clue towards answering this question. Early on in <italic>WJ</italic> he identifies spheres of public life that can be termed ‘political’ in a derivative sense. While not political in the sense that governmental business is political (as expounded above), public debates and elections <italic>are</italic> political insofar as they generate serious proposals as to what might be adopted as government policy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0953946812444679">43</xref></sup> This analogical understanding of ‘political’ might also help to recognise a particular sense in which this term applies to ecclesial judgement. First of all, as part of society, the church may have many a fruitful contribution to make to the political processes of legislation and policy-making. Yet we would surely diminish the church’s political character if we left it at that. The church does not only look to secular government for the realisation of its judgements. It lives under another jurisdiction as well, one that belongs to God—the ultimate ‘legislator’. There is an important difference, however, between the respective ways in which the church relates to each legislator. While deferring to the judgements of both God and political authorities, it defers to God’s not so much by seeking to have its own judgements ‘sanctioned’ by God (as it may seek to have them sanctioned by secular legislation or government policy); instead, it seeks to explore the implications of God’s judgement exercised in Christ. Here the relation between ‘legislator’ and church is almost reversed in comparison to the interface between church and secular government. That is to say, God’s judgement does not sanction but is itself enacted in (if not quite ‘sanctioned’ by) the church’s judgements and corresponding practice.</p>
<p>Thus, even if the church does not exercise judgement in its primary political sense, it bears a political responsibility exceeding that of voters, campaigners and pressure groups. To draw this conclusion is to point to a kind of political existence that philosophers like Arendt have expected in vain to find in the secular forum (in vain, for reasons so well expounded in <italic>The Ways of Judgment</italic>). In fact, it is to repeat the point which Luke Bretherton demonstrates eloquently in his recent <italic>Christianity and Contemporary Politics</italic>, namely that through practices such as community organising, sanctuary for refugees and Fair Trade the church ‘seeks to summon right judgments from political authority’ and indeed ‘exercises judgment [itself]’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0953946812444679">44</xref></sup></p>

<p>In practice there is, of course, overlap between deliberation and judgement. When we deliberate about what we should do, of the many options and scenarios available we discard all but one, for the simple reason that we can only choose one. Some options, however, are discarded because they elicit immediate condemnation, even before being actualised. In other words, we also exercise judgement <italic>in the course of</italic> our deliberation. And, as O’Donovan would add, often we do this with a view to future action: to condemn a past act is also to judge that similar acts should not happen again in the future, and thereby to set limits to our deliberation.
