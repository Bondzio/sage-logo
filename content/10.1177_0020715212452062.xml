<p>John Darwin’s <italic>The Empire Project</italic> is a megahistory of the British Empire from 1830 to 1970. It is densely packed with a bundle of discrete histories of the core of the empire and its parts, sometimes calling and treating it as a ‘system’ but often focusing on its parts as discrete entities. It plays with a sort of tension between seeing its general subject as a ‘project of empire’ rather than an empire, on one hand, and a London-centered ‘world-system’, on the other. Darwin is rightly suspicious of structural explanations of empire that expect too much in terms of the core state’s ability to fashion and direct the imperial project as a puppeteer directs her puppets. Yet his internal histories of empire are presented in all of their complicated glory, in such a way that makes it very difficult to really speak of ‘system’ at all. Indeed, Darwin asks repeatedly ‘was it really a ‘‘system’’?’ from the point of view of whether it displayed systemic characteristics of interdependence of its parts.</p>
<p>The book has several themes that provide its structure of presentation. First, it presents the history of British imperial ‘rise and decline’ as interplay of two tensions: internal and external. The ‘internal’ tension is over continual disagreements about how the empire should work. The ‘external’ one is about how the empire is ‘pulled this way and that by the ‘‘exogenous’’ forces of the global environment’ (p. 8). This use of analytical categories may be common in history or in economics but this reader is already skeptical about the ultimate success of a book that wants to shed light on the British ‘world-system’ when it defines that system in such a way that the global environment is ‘exogenous’. Among elements ‘external’ to Darwin’s British world-system are a ‘passive’ East Asia, the rest of Europe, and the United States.</p>
<p>To Darwin, the British world-system is a structure that is composed of four parts: a core (the ‘imperial center: the British Isles, yoked together for most of the period in a British ‘‘Union’’ or by the ‘‘dominion’’ relationship with Southern Ireland between 1921 and 1948’, p. 9); India; the ‘commercial republic’ of the City of London; and the self-governing white-settler colonies. By the late 19th century a British world-system had developed. It was system-like in two ways: first, private and public activity had combined, and the military supported commerce; second, the four parts of empire helped each other to expand.</p>
<p>The demotion of non-white parts of empire (excluding India) and the rest of the world from consideration as ‘parts’ of his subject is disquieting, as is the lack of consideration of informal empire. Nonetheless, Darwin’s rather open consideration of how empire works, by managing things ‘well enough’ instead of directing things to great effect, rings true. Early on, he sets out his vision of Britain’s power with respect to the rest of the globe:<disp-quote>
<p>. . . the key to British power lay in combining the strength of its overseas components with that of the imperial centre, and managing them – not commanding them – through the various linkages of ‘imperial politics’: some persuasive, some coercive, some official, some unofficial. Stripped of those assets that lay outside the direct control of the administrators in Whitehall, British power in the world would have been feeble indeed. The rest depended upon the willingness of political and business elites in different parts of the world to acknowledge the benefits that membership of the British system conferred. . . (p. 13)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This flexible and open way of thinking about empire is a strength of the book. Yet it would be more impressive if it was coupled with a conception of world-system that truly covers the <italic>world</italic>-system instead of seeing so much of what defines the <italic>place</italic> of empire (i.e. Britain’s hegemonic position with respect to the whole world) as ‘external’. One would also like to see more of how the system relied on force, often downright bloody force and famine, to bring its parts to heel, especially in the Late Victorian age.</p>
<p>Thus, Darwin winds up with a most peculiar time-frame for his understanding of the beginning and end of the ‘British world-system’: 1830–1970. ‘From the 1830s onwards’, he writes, ‘the Victorians gradually transformed their sprawling legacy of war and mercantilism into a world-system much of whose fabric survived into the 1940s’ (p. 23).</p>
<p>At the front end, this misses the whole construction of the Atlantic economy (the ‘first British hegemony’ as some analysts would see it), without which an understanding of ‘high imperialism’ is stunted. ‘The years from the 1830s to the 1870s were the critical phase of Britain’s <italic>emergence</italic> as a global power in command of a world-system’, he writes, because before 1830 it was <italic>only</italic> ‘an Atlantic power with a great Eastern outpost’ (my emphasis, p. 57).</p>
<p>At the back end, it is a rather schizophrenic view. To his credit, Darwin has some rather stinging things to say about ‘myopic’ British leaders who thought they could keep the empire alive after the First World War and Great Depression (p. 652). Yet he still defines the end of empire as by its formal end (thus his end date of 1970), without recognizing that his ‘British world-system’ had ceased to function as a real world power long before the formal empire fell apart. Darwin’s Britain won the ‘war for empire’ (the First World War), then ‘made the peace’, and then ‘held the centre’ until after Second World War. It then attempted to reassert world power over its ‘world-system’ in a serious way (as if the game was not already over) and made a ‘reluctant retreat’ in 1959–1968.</p>
<p>Indeed, here it seems that Darwin is truly dealing with the ‘fabric’ of empire, to use his own words. And this is where his continued use of an internal/external dichotomy lets him down. His astonishingly detailed analysis of the decline and fall of the British empire – <italic>from within</italic> – takes up fully half of the book (300+ pages). Yet he never really addresses the hegemonic conflict in the larger <italic>world</italic>-system that made the maintenance of empire impossible. Of course, the US has been an ‘external’ actor all along, since it won its independence from empire (never mind the importance of the Southern slave/cotton economy to British hegemony and the Board of Trade’s role in securing cotton supplies in the first place). Darwin never even mentions the Marshall Plan, which was crucial to the project whereby the US supplanted colonial control of much of the world after the Second World War and replaced it not with a new form of territorial control but with a new triangular trade whereby the US supplied industrial goods and helped Europe to buy them, at the cost of forced entry of US direct investment into all the far-flung reaches of empire. This is a story that is hardly ‘exogenous’ to empire but which is part and parcel of the story of decline, as viewed through the lens of inter-hegemonic conflict, world war, and the eventual emergence of a new hegemon within a newly organized world-system that was based on a very different accumulation regime.</p>
<p>In the end, this is a book that is full of fascinating ‘internal history’ of the British Empire. It is certainly more than worth its price for the information it contains on the internal empire. But it is short on convincing social analysis and particularly is missing a conception of world-system that can illuminate how this set of regions (the British Empire) played so central a role to the history of world capitalism and, indeed, helped define the <italic>real</italic> world-system for such a long time.</p>
