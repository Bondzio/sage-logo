<p>This volume will prove to be an excellent introductory text for the undergraduate. All the essays, a diverse range of texts by leading scholars, have been previously published, but uniting them in one collection provides a very good overview of key events of the Russian twentieth century. This is no mean feat, as the history of modern Russia contains drama and complexity like few other subjects. Assessments are offered on the fall of the Romanov monarchy, World War One, the Revolutions of 1917, the Bolshevik seizure of power, the Great Terror, Russia’s wartime experience during the Great Patriotic War, the relatively under-studied Khrushchev and Brezhnev periods, and the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union. Several essays cover the post-Soviet period. Specialists will need no reminding that such events go a long way towards forming not only an understanding of Russian history, but also many current and later developments in world politics, culture and ideas. Whilst the Berlin Wall no longer stands and the last statue of Stalin in Gori has been toppled, the Soviet Union has left a sometimes indefinable but undeniable imprint on the world as it exists today.</p>
<p>The book is intended primarily as a student resource and its task as such is to orientate the newcomer with some of the main themes in a diverse and lively scholarship, as well as providing background on the events themselves. Given its intended readership, such a volume should aim for clarity and authority as well as accessibility. It succeeds on all these fronts, providing a refreshingly balanced assessment of the historical picture as it currently stands, as well as covering a broad range of topics, with both articles and reviews. The contributions themselves are of a uniformly high quality, spanning almost fifty years of scholarship. They start with Leopold Haimson’s classic essay on the problem of social stability in urban Russia, originally published in 1964. That the scholarship included covers such a wide period is particularly useful, given how the changing writing of the history of twentieth-century Russia is itself highly instructive for its study. It is pleasing to see the volume reflect this. The majority of the articles date from after 1991, and hence include scholarship that makes use of the ‘archival revolution’. Building on this, especially where the revolutionary and Soviet periods are concerned, the volume has a focus on historiography as well as the great events and key players. Essays by Edward Acton, Sarah Badcock and Ronald Grigor Suny focus on the historical debates surrounding the challenge of revisionism and later attempts to broaden understanding by providing different subjects for scholarly enquiry. This will no doubt help orientate the newcomer with some of the main arguments within the discipline, and serve to show how the historical writing of Russian history has itself changed, and why. Other contributions focus on particular events. For example, essays by Sheila Fitzpatrick on the Civil War and John Barber and Mark Harrison on the Great Patriotic War will help familiarize the student with these diverse and often difficult areas.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, the tone of the volume shifts as the period covered accelerates towards the present day. The post-Soviet period, as with others, is dealt with admirably in breadth as well as depth. Given the availability of sources and the recent nature of the events under consideration here, that this section in the volume has a less historiographical focus and includes some slightly more tentative conclusions is entirely understandable. Another particularly interesting feature concerns the period covered. Unlike, for example, the recent third volume in the Cambridge History of Russia series, this book treats the twentieth century in chronological terms, rather than merely as a timeframe that is helpful by being roughly coterminous with the existence of the Soviet Union. By doing so, it attempts to highlight the continuities as well as the differences between Tsarism, the Soviet period and post-Soviet Russia. As Kocho-Williams explains in his introduction, features such as Russia’s autocratic tradition of governance are best understood by including discussions of all of the Imperial, Soviet and post-Soviet eras, as this gives additional opportunity to compare and contrast the similarities and differences of Russian rule that appear to have much in common to the outsider, but were in their own ways aiming for very different ends.</p>
<p>Though the volume introduces the reader to various dimensions of Russian history, the approach is in the main somewhat old-fashioned, with most of the essays focusing on high politics and ‘rule from above’ rather than social or cultural history. The emphasis on historical writing makes amends for this by providing leads to works where a markedly different interpretation to the ones offered in the volume will be offered. Overall, the volume can be unhesitatingly recommended to any interested student seeking an introduction to the study of modern Russian history.</p>
