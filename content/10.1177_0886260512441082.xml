<p><italic>Family Violence Research, Assessment and Interventions</italic> is an excellent resource for students, researchers, and practitioners seeking an overview of important achievements in child maltreatment research and prevention. This book, a collection of interviews and research summaries, succeeds in distilling major themes of the family violence literature, touching on recent developments, successes, and remaining challenges in this broad area of applied research and practice. The core of the book revolves around interviews with a handful of prominent scholars, which were published previously in a newsletter of the Center for the Study of Traumatic Stress (CSTS) at the Uniformed Services University. Those interviewed for the project reflect on findings and implications from their respective research programs. Importantly, each section provides a concise summary of major contributions by that scholar, along with references for further review. Some sections include an additional interview with the same scholar, building on themes of the prior interview. As a collection, the chapters offer a comprehensive look at some of the more pressing issues facing the field today, particularly in the areas of assessment and prevention planning. Less traditional in format than other books on the covered topics, I believe <italic>Family Violence Research, Assessment and Interventions</italic> could serve as a valuable, supplementary classroom text for students at the graduate level and an important resource for service providers. Researchers, too, may find this a useful reference, given its emphasis on empirical findings and relatively deep coverage of several content areas. In the paragraphs that follow, I comment on just a few of the contributors and various sections of the book to give readers an idea of what they can expect from this well-written volume.</p>
<p>The book begins with a discussion with Sandra Azar about her influential work on parenting and family interaction patterns. In the interview, she is asked about strategies to engage parents at-risk for child maltreatment. She explains that her goal is to have parents become more flexible in their thinking about children’s behavior and to develop better strategies to handle challenging interactions when they arise. She also speaks about the role of social and environmental context and its impact on parents’ capacity to parent well, and the need to help caseworkers apply cognitive-behavioral approaches in their interventions with abusive and neglectful parents.</p>
<p>The following section focuses on the work of Ernest Jouriles, who has made numerous contributions to the family violence literature and has helped increase knowledge of the intersection between child abuse and domestic violence. There are many interesting aspects of the two featured interviews, including Jouriles’ comments on the challenges in practice that come from knowing that children often encounter, and are harmed by, family violence of different forms—yet at the same time realizing that agencies and service systems are usually not equipped to handle the immediate, often diverse needs of the most vulnerable families. Jouriles’ remarks stop short, unfortunately, of addressing the troubling and very complicated question of what can be done now and over the long-term to change systems of care so work as they should.</p>
<p>Interviews that come later with Bruce Perry, Howard Dubowitz, and Desmond Runyon highlight various findings on the overlap in child maltreatment and other risk factors within families and the developmental impacts of family violence for young children. Interviews with these well-known scholars also attend to their and others’ research on resilience and coping—themes that are of the utmost importance for planning prevention programs that focus on strengths and empowerment, less so deficits and impairment. An interview with Bruce Perry, for example, highlights the very important role of extended social support networks as buffers of risks that extend from early trauma. Other entries in this section focus on genetics and brain development (Perry), screening in pediatric settings (Dubowitz), and measurement of multitype maltreatment (Runyan).</p>
<p>Evident throughout the book is a call to strengthen prevention and intervention efforts that can break the cycle of violence that exists within families. Interviews with John Eckenrode, for example, explore what has been learned over the years about home visiting as a primary prevention model. Eckenrode explains that “who” performs the role of the home visitor matters as much for the success of that program as do the characteristics of the families they serve. Importantly, lower risk, higher functioning families appear to benefit less than those in greater need, thus suggesting a targeted or more selective approach to intervening in which services are directed only to those at elevated risk for abuse.This particular point is worthy of further analysis in the research and practice literatures not only to increase awareness of these findings but also to generate conversation about the implications for other areas of prevention.</p>
<p>Interviews toward the latter part of the book with Lee Badger and Mary Ann Forgey provide useful insights for the assessment of domestic violence and the process of training field professionals for this practice role. Particularly helpful are suggestions they make about training clinicians to attend not only to the underlying dynamics and patterns of violence within families but also to the social and contextual risk and protective influences that affect families— recommendations echoed in other chapters of the book. Another helpful suggestion has to do with the role of theory in assessment and intervention. On this topic, Dr. Forgey suggests that having access to multiple theories and perspectives on family violence will help practitioners make individualized, case-by-case decisions of how to intervene—an approach that has intuitive appeal but which runs counter to the push by some for increased standardization.</p>
<p>In sum, this is a well-written, timely, and potentially influential resource for various audiences, including classroom instructors and practitioners in the field. The book is a relatively straightforward read and the sections, while related by theme, can stand alone as single topic overviews. I will recommend this book to others who care about the prevention of family violence, not so much because the information is new but more because the book succeeds in delivering important, practice-relevant material to a broad readership. Ultimately, the goal of the book is to improve practice in real-world settings, which is, of course, a goal shared by many of us, researchers and practitioners alike. I will also recommend this book because it features some of the most respected child maltreatment and prevention researchers, whose comments will help readers understand and appreciate the complexities of conducting applied research to improve human lives and to better serve the most vulnerable in our society. Perspectives offer a diverse, yet balanced and informed discussion of the state of the field, drawing on sound empirical work and practice expertise. I look forward to seeing other publications of this sort in years to come.</p>
