<abstract>
<p>The flow field that evolves inside a duct upon the departure of a shock wave from its open exit is studied experimentally. The present investigation covers a relatively long time period, almost until the shock-induced flow inside the duct ceases. During the investigated time period, the appearance of a second shock wave is observed inside the duct. The effect of introducing a door inclined to the duct’s exit plane, on the pressure field developed behind the second shock is reported. Three different inclination angles are studied, 30°, 45°, and 90° relative to the duct’s exit plane. It is shown that keeping the exit door at different angles and, thereby changing the size of the exit area, has a direct effect on the pressures prevailing inside the tube and on the exit door. The highest pressure on the door and the lowest pressure behind the second shock wave are observed when the exit door is kept at an angle of 30°.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954410011411385"><title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>The flow developed inside a shock tube has been thoroughly studied over the past seven decades and it is now considered in most standard textbooks on gas dynamics. Less attention has been paid to the flow that evolves behind a shock wave as it emerges from an open-ended shock tube. Among the published papers on this topic, one should mention the works of Yu and Grönig [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954410011411385">1</xref></bold>], Jiang <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954410011411385">2</xref></bold>], Bazhenova <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954410011411385">3</xref></bold>], Kim <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954410011411385">4</xref></bold>], Lee <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954410011411385">5</xref></bold>], and Hideo <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954410011411385">6</xref></bold>]. In reference [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954410011411385">1</xref></bold>], a two-dimensional colour schlieren photography was used as the main tool for studying the exit of a shock wave from different exits. Different exits were employed in order to find its effect on the shock attenuation. The emerging shock enters a vacuum chamber used for dust removal from industrial equipment. The flow structure of diffracting shock waves was also simulated in reference [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954410011411385">1</xref></bold>] using an upwind finite volume scheme. Jiang <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954410011411385">2</xref></bold>] conducted numerical and experimental investigations on the evolution of a transmitting shock wave and its associated primary vortex loop, discharging from the open end of a shock tube. A disc with an opening equal to that of the tube was attached to the tube exit plane creating a symmetrical half-sphere exiting shock wave. An experimental and numerical investigation aimed at studying ways to attenuate the shock waves emerging from an open-ended shock tube was reported in reference [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954410011411385">3</xref></bold>]. Three different tube exits were used to evaluate the propagation processes of the emerging shock waves. It was found that the duct geometry affects the shock action on a barrier. Partial closure of the duct exit leads to a barrier pressure decrease in the case of a strong shock (with the Mach number of the incident shock wave higher than 2.2, <italic>M<sub>is</sub></italic> &gt; 2.2) and to an increase for a weak shock wave (1.1 &lt; <italic>M<sub>is</sub></italic> &lt; 1.7). Kim <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954410011411385">4</xref></bold>] experimentally and numerically studied shock wave discharge into the surroundings. A simple shock tube was used in the experimental part and experiments with and without baffle plates were conducted. The size of the baffle plate was varied in order to understand its effect on the reflection of the weak shock wave emerging from the tubes open end. An improved empirical equation for the reflection of a weak shock wave from the open end of a duct both with and without a plate was developed. Lee <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954410011411385">5</xref></bold>] also studied the discharge of a shock wave from an open-ended tube. They claimed to achieve an understanding of the unsteady flow physics associated with the impulsive wave discharge from the duct. Their study was purely numerical, considering several exit conditions and incident shock waves within the range 1.1 ≤ <italic>M<sub>is</sub></italic> ≤ 1.5. Hideo <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954410011411385">6</xref></bold>] focused their attention on the noise/sonic boom associated with the emergence of a weak shock wave from an open-ended duct. In their experimental work, a simple open-ended shock tube with a flange placed at the tube exit was used. The influence of the open end on the correction length and the diameter of the flange on the magnitude of an impulsive wave were discussed in their paper. It is important to note that in the previously mentioned studies attention was given solely to the complex flow and wave pattern developed behind the emerging shock wave immediately after it left the tube (for example, the investigated time was less than 500 µs in reference [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954410011411385">2</xref></bold>]). Furthermore, attention was given to the flow field developed outside the tube ignoring the internal tube flow. The present study investigates the flow and wave pattern evolved inside the tube for a much longer time after the incident shock wave has left the tube, almost until the flow ceases. As could be expected due to this longer time, waves were observed that have not been previously reported in the literature. The attention given to the flow developed inside the tube induced by the emerging shock wave is due to its application in designing compartments for jet engines. In such ducts, safety valves are used for expelling unexpected, sudden high-pressure pulses/shocks.</p>
<p>In the present experimental investigation the flow and wave pattern developed inside a tube due to the discharge of a planar shock wave is studied for three different tube exit geometries. The same initial conditions were used in testing each of the three exit geometries. As mentioned, the investigated flow duration was much longer than reported in the previously mentioned papers; it was up to 50 ms (5×10<sup>4</sup> µs).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0954410011411385"><title>2 EXPERIMENTS</title>
<p>Experiments were conducted using the T80 shock tube shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954410011411385">Fig. 1</xref>. This tube has a square cross-section, 80 × 80 mm, and a variable inclination. During the experiments the shock tube was kept in a horizontal position. Technical details regarding this shock tube are available in reference [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954410011411385">7</xref></bold>]. The range of incident shock waveMach numbers available in this shock tube is from 1.05 to 5. The shock wave Mach number used in the present study was 1.1, and the incident shock wave propagated into ambient air. In all experiments the device shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954410011411385">Figs 2(a)</xref> to (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954410011411385">c</xref>) was placed at the end of the shock tube’s driven section. Three different sets of experiments were conducted. In the first, the rotatable door was kept completely opened by Velcro strips as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954410011411385">Fig. 2(a)</xref>. In this case, no obstacle hinders the shock wave emerging from the tube. Thereafter, two additional sets were conducted; in one the door was kept at an angle of 45° relative to the tube exit plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954410011411385">Fig. 2(b)</xref>) and in the second, the door was kept at an angle of 30° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954410011411385">Fig. 2(c)</xref>). In these two cases, the door was held by a wedge interfering with the exiting air flow during the tests. The side walls of the section added at the end of the shock tube’s driven section were made of Plexiglas in order to allow flow visualization in proximity to the tube exit. Four pressure transducers were placed in the driver section and 11 in the driven section.

<p>In the section added at the tube exit, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954410011411385">Fig. 2</xref>, there is an option to install five pressure gauges onthe section’s upper wall and five on the lower wall. In addition, one pressure gauge could be installed on each of the section’s side walls, close to the exit plane and one in the door centre (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954410011411385">Fig. 2</xref>). This gauge distribution was chosen in order to have a detailed and accurate pressure mapping in proximity to the tube exit. The used shock tube has a very high repeatability enabling the same experiment to be run with different positions of the recording gauges.</p>
<p>High-frequency piezoelectric ENDEVCO pressure transducers (type 8530B-200) were used. They are connected via an ENDEVCO conditioner (type 136) to a multi-channel digital oscilloscope (Tektronics TDS). The shock wave velocity was deduced fromthe obtained pressure readings. The locations along the shock tube walls of the various pressure transducers used in the present experiments are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954410011411385">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954410011411385">2</xref>.

<p>A Z-type schlieren photographic system was used to observe the evolved wave pattern inside the tube, close to its exit, and also outside of the shock tube. This system was adjusted to record events starting just before the incident shock wave emerges from the tube and ending shortly before flow termination. The schlieren system is composed of two 0.3 m diameter f/3m spherical mirrors, a Dedolight 400 W tungsten light source, and a high-speed digital camera. The arrangement of the schlieren system in conjunction with the shock tube is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954410011411385">Fig. 1</xref>. This arrangement enabled the simultaneous recording of events taking place inside and outside the tube. A lens was placed in front of the door section to correct light path deviations caused by the Plexiglas walls. Image acquisition and slow motion analysis was obtained via Photron Fastcam SA1, capable of handling over 5400 frames per second at mega pixel (1024 × 1024) resolution and up to 675 000 frames per second with a reduced image size. In the present study, an acquisition frequency of 20 000 frames per second for a spatial resolution of 384 × 448 pixels was chosen.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0954410011411385"><title>3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title>
<p>A sequence of schlieren photographs showing the flow field generated by the emerging shock wave inproximity to the shock tube exit is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954410011411385">Fig. 3</xref>. The time (in milliseconds) appearing on each photo indicates the time that has passed since diaphragm rupture. In these photos, the initial incident shock wave (<italic>M<sub>is</sub></italic> = 1.1) is moving from left to right. At <italic>t</italic>=8.7 ms (image A), the planar incident shock wave generated by the diaphragm rupture is clearly visible inside the tube. When this shock wave reaches thetube exit, at <italic>t</italic> = 8.8 ms (image B), it starts its exit process that lasts until <italic>t</italic> = 9.2 ms (image E). During this time, the shock wave changes its shape until it becomes a spherical blast wave and its speed decreases. In the time interval 8.8 &lt; <italic>t</italic> &lt; 9.2 ms, the emerging shock wave exhibits an asymmetrical shape since at its top it is still propagating along a rigid wall (the open door) while its lower part is exposed to the free atmosphere. As a result, the post-shock flow becomes three dimensional. Theflow expansion once the shock wave leaves the tube’s bottom wall is via a vortex seen at <italic>t</italic> = 8.85 ms (image C); a second vortex is generated at <italic>t</italic> = 9.1 ms (image D) when the emerging shock leaves the open door. From this time, the emerging wave is a continually decaying spherical blast wave that quickly reduces to a Mach wave. After the exit of the incident shock wave from the shock tube, the rarefaction wave that had reflected from the driver section’s end wall will reach the shock tube’s open end and will exit. Amore detailed description of waves emerging at later times will be given subsequently when discussing the pressure records and the <italic>x–t</italic> diagrams deduced from these records. However, it is interesting to note now that at <italic>t</italic> = 38.5 ms (image F) a second shock wave isobserved inside the shock tube, close to its exit. Its shape is not perfectly plane, and close to the tube’s lower wall, it has a lambda shape. Later this wave exits the tube and its propagation in the open atmosphere is observable until <italic>t</italic> = 39.2 ms (image I).

<p>The explanation for the origin of this shock wave can be given with the help of the pressure records andthe <italic>x–t</italic> diagram deduced from these records. In order to obtain a detailed pressure history at different points inside the shock tube using a limited number of pressure gauges, the same experiment was repeated eight times. Each time, the location of the pressure gauges was changed thereby obtaining pressure histories at 27 different locations along the shock tube and on the walls of the door section. Eight gauges were placed along the lower wall of the transparent last section of the shock tube (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954410011411385">Fig. 2</xref>), one on the side wall of this section, and 18 were placed along the top wall of the shock tube. The relatively large number of pressure gauges installed along the tube’s upper wall was needed to create sufficient data to allow the origin of this second shock wave to be understood. Examples of recorded pressure histories at four different locations along the tube’s upper wall and one recorded at the door’s centre are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954410011411385">Fig. 4</xref>. Arrows appearing in the figure indicate the direction of the considered waves; when arrows are from left to right, the considered waves travel fromthe driver to the driven section and <italic>vice versa</italic>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954410011411385">Fig. 4</xref>, time counting starts at diaphragm rupture. Based on all recorded pressure histories, the <italic>x–t</italic> diagram for the considered flow was constructed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954410011411385">Fig. 5</xref>). This figure shows that main waves appear inthe flow field 55 ms after the rupture of the diaphragm. This diagram was constructed from recorded pressure signals obtained from the 18 gauges placed on the upper wall of the shock tube.

<p>At diaphragm rupture, a rarefaction wave (rw1) is transmitted into the driver section and an incident shock wave (IS1) travels into the driven section of the shock tube. Once the rarefaction wave reaches the driver's end wall, it is reflected back into the driven section (Rrw1), as seen <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954410011411385">Fig. 5</xref>. When the incident shock wave reaches the end of the driven section (at <italic>t</italic> = 8.7 ms) and emerges into the ambient air, it converts from a planar shock wave into a curved blast wave [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954410011411385">2</xref></bold>] and a rarefaction wave (Nrw1) is transmitted into the shock tube (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954410011411385">Fig. 5</xref>). The recorded pressure signature of the blast wave generated upon exiting the shock tube is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954410011411385">Fig. 4</xref>, in pressure histories recorded by gauges C<sub>top</sub> and C<sub>door</sub>. It is apparent from these records that following the sudden pressure jump across the blast front, a rapid pressure decrease takes place. The restoration of ambient pressure at the open end of the shock tubeis achieved via a compression wave appearing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954410011411385">Fig. 5</xref> as a green line.</p>
<p>As the prevailing pressure behind Nrw1 is below the ambient level, a compression wave (Cw1) propagating into the shock tube raises the exit pressure back to ambient level. It is apparent from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954410011411385">Fig. 5</xref> that this compression wave coalesces into a shock wave (sw2), shortly before it reaches the driver's end wall. Upon reaching this end wall, at about <italic>t</italic> = 26 ms, itreflects back into the tube’s driven section as ashock wave (Rsw2). This reflected shock wave (Rsw2) reaches the tube exit at about <italic>t</italic> = 38.5 ms and exits the tube. It is clearly visible in the schlieren photograph taken at <italic>t</italic> = 38.8 ms (image H), shown in<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954410011411385">Fig. 3</xref>. It is also clearly visible as a pressure jump across Rsw2 in the recorded pressure shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954410011411385">Fig.4(c)</xref> by pressure gauge C1.</p>
<p>This shock wave was not observed in the previously cited papers since they limited their attention to a short time after the incident shock exited the tube and to the flow field developed behind this emerging shock, outside of the tube. When the rarefaction wave (Nrw1) reaches the driver's end wall (at <italic>t</italic> ≈ 21 ms, see<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954410011411385">Fig. 5</xref>), it reflects back towards the open end of the shock tube (RNrw1). When it reaches the tube’s open end, shortly before shock Rsw2 exits, a new compression wave (Cw2) is reflected into the tube in order to raise the post-Nrw1 pressure back to ambient level (see the pressure history recorded by gauge C1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954410011411385">Fig. 4(c)</xref> and the <italic>x–t</italic> diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954410011411385">Fig. 5</xref>). Upon the exit of shock wave Rsw2 from the tube a new rarefaction wave, Nrw2, propagates into the shock tube. This process of alternating compression and rarefaction waves continues until the waves reduce to Mach waves. This decay process is clearly visible in the pressure history recorded by gauge C<sub>top</sub>, placed close to the tube’s exit plane and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954410011411385">Fig. 6</xref> during a longer time period. As expected, only two shock waves are visible in this figure, IS1 and Rsw2, all others are compression waves.

<p>In the present experiments, shocks emitted from the shock tube are asymmetric waves since their upper part progresses along the open door (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954410011411385">Fig.2(a)</xref>) and therefore this part behaves like a normal shock wave. On the other hand, the lower and side parts of the emerging shock wave exit directly to theambient air. These parts of the emerging shock wave diffract over the tube’s lower and side walls. This diffraction is via an expansion vortex (e.g. see image C taken at <italic>t</italic> = 8.85 ms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954410011411385">Fig. 3</xref>) that introduces ambient external air into the tube. The incident shock wave, IS1, is stronger than the reflected shock Rsw2, and shortly before IS1 leaves the shock tube (image A taken at <italic>t</italic> = 8.7 ms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954410011411385">Fig. 3</xref>) it appears as a perfect normal shock wave. This is not the case with Rsw2 appearing in the frame taken at <italic>t</italic> = 38.5 ms (image F) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954410011411385">Fig. 3</xref>; it developes a lambda shape near the bottom wall of the shock tube. When this shock leaves the tube (image G at <italic>t</italic> = 38.65 ms), its lower part is reduced to a weak compression wave (or a Mach wave) and as a result, the expected expansion via a vortex is invisible in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954410011411385">Fig. 3</xref> at this time. Support for the above statement is found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954410011411385">Fig. 7</xref>, where pressure measurements were taken close to the exit plane of the shock tube at three different locations: at the upper, lower, and side walls, all gauges were placed at the same distance from the tube’s exit plane. It is apparent from this figure that while gauge C<sub>top</sub> exhibits a well-formed shock wave signature, the pressure histories recorded by gauges C<sub>bottom</sub> and C<sub>side</sub>, suggest the existence of a compression wave. This is not surprising since, as already noted regarding <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954410011411385">Fig. 3</xref>, at <italic>t</italic> = 38.5 ms (image F), sw2 behaves as a normal shock wave near the tube’s upper wall whereas it has a lambda shape close to the tube’s lower wall.

<p>The study of emerging shock waves from a duct has importance in the safe release of sudden high pressure that might occur in jet engines and/or in industrial ducts. With respect to such problems, it is of interest to prevent the appearance of a new shock (after the incident shock wave) inside the jet engine compartment or the industrial duct. A possible way to reach this goal is by deflecting the exiting shock waves using the geometry shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954410011411385">Fig. 2</xref>. In order to check this suggestion, the experiments conducted with the open door (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954410011411385">Fig. 2(a)</xref>) were repeated keeping the same initial flow conditions; first, when the exit door is kept at 45° relative to the tube exit plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954410011411385">Fig. 2(b)</xref>) and second, at30° relative to the tube exit plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954410011411385">Fig. 2(c)</xref>). Asequence of schlieren photographs showing the evolved shock pattern around a 45° inclined door is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954410011411385">Fig. 8</xref>. At <italic>t</italic> = 8.65 ms (image J), one observes the incident shock wave shortly before it reaches the tube exit. As expected, at this time, it is a planar shock wave. Once the shock reaches the tube exit, it loses its planar shape; in the early part of its exit (image K taken at <italic>t</italic>= 8.8 ms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954410011411385">Fig. 8</xref>) while the shock’s centre part still maintains its planar form, its upper part is already reflected from the inclined wall and is moving downward (in a direction vertical to the tube’s exit plane) while the lower part of the emerging shock is almost spherical as a result of its diffraction over the tube's lower wall. During the diffraction process, a vortex behind the shock front is evident. With progressing time (image L taken at <italic>t</italic> = 8.9 ms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954410011411385">Fig. 8</xref>), the reflected shock continues its downward motion and part of it enters the shock tube while the remainder of the transmitted shock wave completely loses its original planar shape. At <italic>t</italic> = 9 ms (image M), the transmitted shock wave diffracts over the edge of the inclined door, generating a new vortex and the reflected shock reaches the tube’s floor. The part of this reflected shock that penetrated into the tube is reflected from the tube’s floor and travels upward toward its upper wall; see images N and O taken respectively at <italic>t</italic> = 9.1 and <italic>t</italic> = 9.2 ms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954410011411385">Fig. 8</xref>. The process of repeating reflections between the upper and lower walls of the shock tube will continue until the shock decays to a Mach wave. Following the departure of all shocks from the field of view into theambient air (outside of the tube), the emergence of the contact surface starts; see frames taken from <italic>t</italic>=9.2 ms to <italic>t</italic> = 10.15 ms. Thereafter, highly turbulent flow emerges from the tube.

<p>At <italic>t</italic> = 38.6 ms (image P), one observes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954410011411385">Fig. 8</xref> a second shock wave close to the exit of the tube. As in the previously discussed case, now too the lower part of this shock wave has a lambda structure close to the bottom wall of the shock tube. Since this shock is significantly weaker than the incident one its reflection from the inclined door is less pronounced than that observed in the case of the incident shock; itcan be detected only in shadowgraphs taken at <italic>t</italic>=38.8 (image Q), 38.9 (image R), and 39 ms (image S). Once this shock has left the tube, it is reduced to a weak compression wave and therefore is not observable in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954410011411385">Fig. 8</xref>. An alternative observation of the considered waves is available in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954410011411385">Fig. 9</xref> where pressure records obtained from five different gauges (C<sub>door</sub>, C<sub>top</sub>, C1, C7, and C10) are given.

</p>
<p>As expected, at early times, pressures recorded by gauges C1, C7, and C10, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954410011411385">Fig. 9</xref> are similar to those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954410011411385">Fig. 4</xref>. In both cases, one sees clearly the formation of a rarefaction wave (rw1) entering the driver section and a shock wave (IS1) transmitted into the driven section. When rw1 reaches the driver's end wall, it reflects as a rarefaction wave Rrw1 and when IS1 reaches the open end of the driven section and emerges, a rarefaction wave (Nrw1) is transmitted into the tube. Once the rarefaction fan (Rrw1) exits the tube, a compression wave (Cw1) is transmitted into the tube raising the pressure back to the atmospheric level; see Figs. 9(c) and 10. When this compression wave reaches the driver's end wall, it is reflected as a stronger compression wave (RCw1) that quickly coalesces to a shock wave (sw2); see pressure histories recorded by gauges C10, C7, and C1, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954410011411385">Fig. 9</xref> and the <italic>x–t</italic> diagram shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954410011411385">Fig. 10</xref>. In the present case, thecompression wave (Cw1) coalesces into shock wave (sw2) only after its reflection from the driver's end wall, unlike the case when the exit door was kept completely opened (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954410011411385">Fig. 5</xref>). The reason for this difference is that now the open gap between the door and the shock tube walls is smaller and therefore the strength of waves reflected into the tube are reduced. This delays the formation of the second shock wave (sw2) and attenuates it as it approaches the open end of the shock tube’s driven section; see the pressure recorded across shock (sw2) by gauge C1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954410011411385">Fig. 4(c)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954410011411385">Fig. 9(c)</xref>. This observation is of importance in designing a pressure relief system, but as seen from comparing recorded pressure histories acting onthe door by gauge C<sub>door</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954410011411385">Fig. 4(e)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954410011411385">Fig. 9(e)</xref>, it is clear that as could be expected, the pressure jump across the incident shock wave (IS1) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954410011411385">Fig. 9</xref> is significantly higher than that recorded in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954410011411385">Fig. 4</xref> when the door was kept completely open.</p>
<p>The pressure increase recorded on the inclined door is a direct result of the incident shock wave’s reflection from the door. This is clearly visible in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954410011411385">Fig. 11</xref>, where pressure histories recorded by three pressure gauges placed very close to the shock tube exit, C<sub>bottom</sub>, C<sub>side</sub>, C<sub>top</sub> and the gauge placed on the inclined door, C<sub>door</sub> are shown. The largest overpressure jump was recorded on the door; it reached 0.58 bar. This is similar to the pressure prevailing behind a normal reflection of an incident shock wave (Mach 1.1, in one-dimensional (1D) flow), 0.54 bar. The small difference is due to the non-1D flow on the inclined door and the accuracy range of the gauge used. In addition to the higher pressure recorded across the incident shock wave (IS1) by gauge C<sub>door</sub> in the 45° inclined case, one notices in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954410011411385">Fig. 9</xref> a pressure increase (OP1). This pressure rise is not visible in the pressure recorded by C<sub>door</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954410011411385">Fig. 4(e)</xref>. The reason for this difference is that only in the inclined door case does a part of the reflected shock from the inclined door penetrate the shock tube and become reflected between the tube’s lower and upper walls. The recorded overpressure (OP1), seen behind IS1 in Figs. 9(d) and 9(e) is the result of these reflections between the tube’s ceiling and floor. In industrial applications (e.g. the engine compartment of a jet), itis important to limit the duration of the pressure rise; therefore, even if the level of this pressure rise (OP1) is weakened because of its proximity to the tube exit, the duration of this overpressure is important and it must be considered.

<p>It is of interest to check the effect of reducing the size of the exit gap on the evolved flow field. For this purpose the gap between the door and the shock tube’s exit plane was reduced by setting the door at an angle of 30°, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954410011411385">Fig. 2(c)</xref>. The evolved wave pattern is visible in the sequence of schlieren photographs given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954410011411385">Fig. 12</xref>. As seen in the previous case, at <italic>t</italic> = 8.65 ms (image T) the incident shock wave is visible close to the tube’s exit plane. During the time period from <italic>t</italic> = 8.75 ms to <italic>t</italic> = 9.05 ms, a complex pattern of shock wave reflections from the inclined door and its diffraction over the shock tube wall take place. Part of the shock reflected from the door enters the shock tube and reflects between the tube’s floor and ceiling. This is followed by the exit of the contact surface (from <italic>t</italic> = 9.15 ms to <italic>t</italic> = 9.9 ms) and thereafter, the exit of highly turbulent flow is visible (from <italic>t</italic> = 10 ms to <italic>t</italic> = 14 ms). Similar to the previous cases, at <italic>t</italic> = 38.4 ms (image U) a second shock is seen close to its departure from the shock tube. Its reflection from the inclined door is visible in shadowgraphs taken between 38.5 ≤ <italic>t</italic> ≤ 38.6 ms.

<p>Pressure histories recorded by pressure gauges C<sub>door</sub>, C<sub>top</sub>, C1, C7, and C10 are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0954410011411385">Fig. 13</xref>. While almost identical pressure histories are recorded by gauges C1, C7, and C10 in Figs 9 and 13, differences are easily detectable in the pressure histories recorded by pressure gauges C<sub>top</sub>, and C<sub>door</sub> in these figures. This is expected, as in the present case, that the open space for the emerging flow is smaller resulting in higher pressure (OP1) recorded by C<sub>door</sub>, a stronger rarefaction wave RNrw1, and a weaker shock wave sw2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0954410011411385">Fig. 13</xref>. Inspection of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0954410011411385">Fig. 14</xref> indicates that the coalesce of compression wave RCw1 into shock wave sw2 takes longer time than observed in the previous case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954410011411385">Fig. 10</xref>) and it is formed closer to the tube exit than that observed when the door inclination was 45°. It is not surprising therefore that a weaker shock wave sw2 is present in this case.

<p>It is of interest to compare results obtained for each of the three tested configurations. Special attention is given to the intensity of the generated shock wave (sw2), the pressure pulse prevailing behind the incident shock wave upon its reflection from the door (RIS1), and the pressure prevailing behind the part of the reflected shock wave that penetrated into the tube (OP1), in the vicinity of the shock tube exit. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954410011411385">Fig. 15</xref> recorded pressure histories at stations C1, and C<sub>side</sub> are shown. The investigated time is limited to the range 32 ≤ <italic>t</italic> ≤ 42 ms in order to clearly observe the formation of the second shock wave, sw2. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954410011411385">Fig. 15(a)</xref>, the pressure jump induced across sw2 is clearly shown for thethree different door positions. Ahead of sw2, the prevailing pressure is sub-atmospheric due to the presence of the rarefaction wave RNrw1. It is evident from these pressure records that the highest post-shock (sw2) pressure is obtained when the door is kept at an angle of 90° relative to the shock tube’s exit plane. Reducing the door angle to 45° resulted in a small pressure reduction across the shock front. However, when the door angle was reduced to 30°, a significant reduction in the pressure jump across the shock wave (sw2) is evident. While the pressure jump across the shock front in the case when the door is kept at a 90° angle is about 0.15 bar, it is only 0.08 bar when it is kept at 30° (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954410011411385">Fig. 15(a)</xref>). As expected, there isnosignificant difference in pressures recorded in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954410011411385">Fig. 15(b)</xref> since this gauge is placed at the tube’s side wall very close to the tube exit and therefore it record pressures resulting mainly from the shock diffraction over this wall.

<p>The pressure signatures recorded by C<sub>bottom</sub> for the three different door angles are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0954410011411385">Fig. 16</xref>. During the time covered in this figure, one sees the emergence of the incident shock wave (IS1) from the tube and the penetration of the reflected shock (RIS1) from the door into the tube. As expected, when the door is kept completely open (at 90°), the lowest post-shock pressure is recorded simply because now there is no shock reflection from the door. It is evident from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0954410011411385">Fig. 16</xref> that the highest pressure recorded by C<sub>bottom</sub> is when the door is kept at an angle of 30°. The reason for this observation becomes clear when looking at the shadowgraphs shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0954410011411385">Fig. 17</xref>. In this figure, one sees the wave pattern that evolves on the exit of the incident shock wave from the tube. When the door inclination is 30°, gauge C<sub>bottom</sub> initially records the pressure increase due to the reflected shock wavethat penetrated into the tube, RIS1 and immediately thereafter, the pressure increase behind the reflection of RIS1 from the tube’s floor, R²IS1. For the case where the door is kept at an angle of 45°, the planar part of the reflected shock from the door RIS1 (where the shock is the strongest), propagates outside of thetube. Only its tail, the diffracted part of the reflected shock DRIS1 (where the shock is weaker), enters the tube (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0954410011411385">Fig. 17</xref>).

<p>It was shown, in Figs. 9 and 13, that the exit of the incident shock wave (IS1) from the tube is followed by a compression wave (OP1). The effect of the door inclination on the magnitude of the pressure rise caused by OP1 is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-0954410011411385">Fig. 18</xref>. As expected, when the door is kept completely opened upon the exit of IS1, a rarefaction wave (Nrw1) is transmitted into the tube reducing the pressure back to atmospheric level. This is no longer the case when the door is kept in an inclined position; now at about <italic>t</italic> = 9.4 ms, the pressure drop caused by Nrw1 ceases and the compression wave OP1 raises the pressure at the location of gauge C<sub>top</sub> to values above atmospheric level. The highest increase is seen when the door is kept at an angle of 30°; it rises to 0.13 bar over atmospheric pressure. An explanation for the higher pressure caused by OP1 at C<sub>top</sub> when the door is kept at 30° can be found in theshadowgraph sequence shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-0954410011411385">Fig. 19</xref>. This sequence of shadowgraphs covers the exit period of shock IS1 from the tube. For the case where the door is kept completely open (90°), as expected, no shock reflection and no compression wave accompany the exit of the incident shock wave from the tube. For the cases involving an inclined door, the shock reflection from the door, the penetration of the reflected shock wave into the tube, and the reflection of the penetrated shock wave from the tube’s walls are clearly visible in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-0954410011411385">Fig. 19</xref>. While similar wave patterns are observable in the cases of inclined doors, it is clear from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-0954410011411385">Fig. 19</xref> that when the door inclination is 30° all waves in the shadowgraphs propagate faster than those seen in the 45° inclination case. A faster shock is a stronger shock and therefore it is not surprising that higher pressures are measured behind OP1 when the door inclination is 30°, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-0954410011411385">Fig. 18</xref>.

<p>The described shock and compression waves are sources of problem that prevent smooth functioning of relief systems used in jet engine compartments asthey generate a dynamic loading that causes dangerous stresses; they are also a source of vibration andeven possible destruction. The present investigation underlines problems which must be taken intoaccount in designing such pressure relief systems.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0954410011411385"><title>4 CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>The present experimental investigation provides a detailed description of the flow which evolves inside a tube following the exit of a planar shock wave fromthe tube. This knowledge is of interest in designing safety valves for jet engine compartments. It is needed to prevent rupture in cases where a sudden overpressure pulse is generated inside the jet engine. Unlike the results previously published in the literature, the present investigation covers a much longer time period after the exit of the incident shock wave from the tube. The generation of a second shock wave is observed and the pressure prevailing behind it when three different exit door inclinations are used is reported. The presented <italic>x–t</italic> diagrams show that this second shock wave is a result of the coalescence of thecompression waves generated when the initial rarefaction waves leave the tube. It was shown that, keeping the exit door at different angles, and thereby changing the size of the exit area, has a direct effect on the pressures prevailing inside the tube and on the exit door. When the exit door is kept at an angle of 30°, one observes the highest pressure on the door and the lowest pressure behind the second shock wave.</p></sec>
