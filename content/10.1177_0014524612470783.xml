<p>22 Park Circus, Glasgow’s Registry Office. Rock salt and confetti crunch beneath our feet on a crisp February morning. “Have you got your ticket? Have you got your home office letter and reference number? How do you spell your name?” This time the man’s uniform is green, previous uniforms have been black, grey, brown, blue even red. This journey through the colours of official state security is coming to an end. In just 45 minutes time my companion, an 18 year old from Zimbabwe, will be British.</p>
<p>We go into the opulent Edwardian room. On walls are pre-raphaelite prints and the Queen. White faces, as out of place as mine. I’m here because I just happened to be there when the young man’s father was sent a letter from the border agency informing him that his son would be deported on his 18<sup>th</sup> Birthday unless he could apply for citizenship, for which he satisfied all the legal conditions of length of residence and present immigration status, but for which £1,800 was required to complete the application.</p>
<p>The official in the green uniform calls each new citizen out to choose the colour of their oath: pink for a solemn affirmation; blue for an oath sworn to ‘Almighty God.’ The majority choose God. Muslims and Christians standing together to make their vows as an act of faith. “I chose the God one, Dad,” says the young man. I wonder at what those in the room have already gone through. In front of me is a woman I recognise from Dungavel Removal Centre – all smartly dressed in a blue tweed suit now, and a big smile. The stories of bureaucratic mess and mistake throng together for this short time in this place. I find myself wondering if there ought to be a collective noun for the countless boxes which have been ticked for this group of 30 people to be able to be present at this time. An outrage of tickboxes? Perhaps, even, a safety of tickboxes? - for this is what has been achieved, at long last: safety, the right to a UK passport, to vote, to participate fully in the life of the city.</p>
<p>The official welcomes us. Her welcome is rather like that of an unwelcoming church. It’s read off a pretty piece of printed card. “This is a solemn ceremony and there are a lot of children here today. The new citizens need to be able to hear so if your children are disturbed you must take them out and you can return for the photographs.” The family along from us don’t have enough arms for the two babies as the mother and 7 year old son are to go forward and can’t take the babies with them. So I take one. Her name is Joy.</p>
<p>And then the words are said, the pink ones and the blue ones. There are some quiet tears. Mine drips onto the sleeve of Joy’s tiny pink coat as I feel the extraordinary moment of a confluence of so many long journeys, so many years of waiting in hope and anguish.</p>
<p>We all stand for the National Anthem. And then we are invited for a cup of tea or coffee. The fruits of the former colonies are served up to the new citizens, most of whom have fled the ongoing consequences of those times. This is not what I would normally describe as a ritual of healing but I am aware that this has, at last, marked an end for those tired and dulled by the endless processions of uniforms, security questions, letters, reference numbers and expensive legal fees. Something is accomplished.</p>
