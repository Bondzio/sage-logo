<p>A man in a loud shirt stands against a blue screen, his hands shaping words delivered in a lisping British voice: ‘The process of seeing paintings, or seeing anything else, is less spontaneous and natural than we tend to believe.’ My first encounter with John Berger and <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> was in 1978 in a darkened lecture theatre in Sydney, Australia. I was in my first year of an undergraduate degree at the University of Sydney, attending a compulsory class on the history of modern art as part of my study of art history. The class was, as I appreciate much more in retrospect, quite an experimental one, seeking to forge a new kind of art history appropriate to the times. It was being conducted 10 years after the events of May 1968 in a context that included the recent contributions to a more engaged art history by T.J Clark and Griselda Pollock, then both working in Leeds, but also the interdisciplinary model of scholarship offered by the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies in Birmingham. But it was also being taught on the cusp of the intellectual movement that came to be known as postmodernism, a movement embraced by a new generation of Australian writers and artists who saw ‘French Theory’ as complicating, if not outright displacing, the more familiar insights of British Marxism.</p>
<p>But this class in Sydney, taught primarily by art historian Terry Smith and artist Ian Burn, was also forged in the aftermath of some events specific to Australia – the giddy election in 1972, after 23 years of conservative rule, of a Labor government under Prime Minister Gough Whitlam and its abrupt dismissal three years later by the Queen of England’s Governor-General. This was a moment, then, not dissimilar to the one Berger himself described in 1973, in his essay ‘Between Two Colmars’, when he discusses his changing perceptions of an altarpiece by Grünewald, before and after 1968; as he tells us, ‘he saw differently’, in part because he was ‘forced to place myself historically’. The class I took had the same aim: to force we students to see modernism differently, by placing it, and us, historically. In Australia, the history of modern art had for some time been dominated by accounts emanating from the United States, and especially from the Museum of Modern Art in New York. In 1975, a fateful year, both Smith and Burn had been involved in events organized to protest against and critique the MoMA touring exhibition <italic>Modern Masters: Manet to Matisse</italic>. These events followed on from their 1974 collaboration (with Mel Ramsden) on an Art &amp; Language publication, <italic>Draft for an Anti-Textbook</italic>, that focused on the effects of the international traffic between center and periphery – what Smith called ‘the provincialism problem’. Smith had also published an essay on ‘Doing Art History’ in a 1975 issue of <italic>The Fox</italic> in New York, a kind of manifesto for the teaching he went on to do.</p>
<p>The choice of <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> as the centerpiece of this introductory class was therefore a very strategic one, driven as much by local as by international debates. As Smith remembers it:
<disp-quote>
<p>The big targets were Kenneth Clark’s bourgeois humanist elitism as evidenced by his <italic>Civilization</italic> series (1969, but still very popular in Australia, that I assumed to be the deep underbelly of the local love of art), Greenbergian formalism (as it was manifest in Arnason’s <italic>History of Modern Art</italic>, ‘the textbook’), and orthodox avant-gardism (Renato Poggioli and Peter Bürger).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The screening of the films was framed by an idiosyncratic array of lectures, including one on Chinese peasant posters delivered by Smith in an ill-fitting Mao suit (acquired on a recent visit to China) and another by the farmer who oversaw the Northeast Queensland fruit display stands at the Royal Easter Show in Sydney. Burn gave lectures on Conceptual Art that embodied his own ambivalence as a major player in the movement, while a new arrival in Australia, the American film scholar Alan Cholodenko – soon to be a key promoter of postmodern theory – gave detailed analyses of <italic>Citizen Kane</italic>. An Aboriginal activist was invited to talk about Indigenous rights. Assignments included a dissection of an advertisement, in which students were asked to cut up and reconstitute a chosen ad to critical effect. For this, Berger’s episode on publicity was supplemented by readings taken from Judith Williamson’s <italic>Decoding Advertisements</italic>, which had just become available. That chapter in Berger’s book is the one I still set for my own students as a prompt to thinking critically about the way in which promotional images do their work on us.</p>
<p>The representation of women, both in the history of images as discussed by Berger and in <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> itself, was a central concern of the class. Long discussions were held in the lecture theatre after the screening of the episode about the tradition of the female nude in painting. A number of my fellow students noticed the way the camera panned across the group of women that Berger, cigarette in hand, engages in conversation at the end of the episode, each of them extraordinarily articulate, thoughtful and well-informed but each also a kind of female stereotype.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Men act</italic> and <italic>women appear</italic>. Men look at women. Women watch themselves being looked at. This determines not only most relations between men and women but also the relation of women to themselves.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The camera in <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> replicates Berger’s claim by resting purposefully on these women as they speak, or cutting away to another female face or figure as they listen. The women are shown to us as delectable sights even as they carefully analyze precisely this outcome. He, on the other hand, is always represented in the program as a man of action, forceful and authoritative, never just a passive figure to be looked at merely for the pleasure of doing so. With feminism offering the most forceful critique of traditional art history then available, <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> was itself an exemplary case study of how difficult it is not to reproduce some version of Berger’s dichotomy.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in the particular Australian context I have briefly described, Berger’s insistence that there are, indeed, many ‘ways of seeing’ – the greatest provocation of his program was already in its title – had a special appeal. For a start, it implied that there might well be ways of seeing modernism other than those provided by the Museum of Modern Art (as evidenced in his own mixture of high art and vernacular culture, a mixture repeated in the class I took). It could even be taken to suggest that perhaps there was an ‘Australian’ way of seeing waiting to be discovered, or enacted. This possibility resonated with an approach to art history that was then gaining renewed popularity in Australia, an approach sometimes called ‘inversion theory’. Emerging periodically to explain the belated and second-hand nature of Australian culture, the inversion hypothesis seeks to take this apparently fatal flaw and make it a strength; it argues that the lack of originality that characterizes provincial cultures could be precisely what is original, or at least distinctive, about them. By 1984, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470412912444187">Burn (1994[1984])</xref> was offering a reading of paintings from the 1940s by Australian artist Sidney Nolan in which their sophisticated borrowings were taken as an ironic commentary on the very provincialism problem that had so preoccupied Australian intellectuals in the 1970s.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The spatial complexity of <italic>Railway Guard</italic> – a mess by most of the standards by which modern art history has been written – is neither a mess nor confusion. Its logic resides not in the picture but in the viewer, the culturally specific spectator. Nolan has not tried to suppress or gloss over incompatible elements: different intentions, artistic conventions and even cultural needs coexist and are set side by side. The picture has a richness which allows us to relate to quite contradictory factors, with enthusiasm and self-confidence. (p. 69)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In Burn’s hands, inversion theory proposes the possibility of historical models that take exchange, rather than delayed transmission, as their governing logic and sees the particular experience of this or that provincial locus as a basis for presenting a history of modernity in general. It asks, in other words, why the story of modernity in Australia should not be taken as a perspective on this phenomenon that is just as valid and ‘original’ as that emanating from Paris or New York. <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic>, a stringent critique of traditional art history put together by five people, even if forever associated with its presenter John Berger, offered a timely model for this kind of collective rethinking. And even today, 34 years after I first saw it as a naïve student in Sydney, the program and its little book continue to suggest what might be possible for those who dare to think differently, including those art historians working in and on the margins of the global economy.</p>
