<p>Despite pressing concerns about the need to prepare high-quality teachers and the central role of teacher educators (TEs) in this process, little is known about how TEs teach about teaching specific subject matter, and how they develop their expertise. This empirical study focuses on the specific expertise that science TEs bring into teacher education. Individual interviews and story lines were conducted with 12 experienced science TEs from four different teacher education institutions in Australia and the Netherlands, to gain insight into their aims for teaching about science teaching, and how their expertise has developed on the basis of their professional background and experiences. The findings of this exploratory study reveal similarities among the concerns of these TEs and yet considerable diversity among their approaches. The study aims to contribute to a better understanding of science TEs’ work and the development of a pedagogy of science teacher education.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Internationally, the urgency of providing relevant and high-quality teacher education has been highlighted for immediate attention (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022487112466266">Cochran-Smith &amp; Zeichner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022487112466266">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD], 2005</xref>). Given widespread concerns regarding the quality of teachers and teaching, there are obvious implications for teacher educators (TEs) who have an essential role in preparing teachers to teach effectively to groups of students of increasing diversity. Especially in situations of teacher shortages, which require efficient and yet high-quality programs for teacher education, TEs are faced with increasingly challenging demands and expectations. Furthermore, TEs are expected to be involved in forming educational change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022487112466266">P. K. Smith, 2010</xref>), and are seen “by design or default . . . [as] the linch pins in educational reforms of all kinds” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022487112466266">Cochran-Smith, 2003</xref>, p. 5). Yet, despite these pressing concerns about the need to prepare high-quality teachers, and the central role of TEs in this process, there does not seem to be an organized or formal way of preparing TEs for their tasks. TEs come from various backgrounds and bring very different experiences into teacher education, yet it does not seem to be a career that one deliberately plans to enter. Moreover, there seems to be “a huge literature about the curriculum, the pedagogy, the organization and the students but next to nothing about the people who are teacher educators” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022487112466266">Acker, 1997</xref>, p. 66). In a special issue of <italic>Teaching and Teacher Education</italic>, guest editors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022487112466266">Korthagen, Loughran, and Lunenberg (2005</xref>, p. 107) pointed to a serious lack of knowledge about “what teacher educators do and how their work is constructed.” Although this situation is beginning to change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022487112466266">Lunenberg, 2010</xref>), research on TEs is still quite rare and so far has focused mainly on rather generic issues, such as TEs’ transition into the role and the broad set of skills, attitudes, and knowledge that they may need.</p>
<p>At the same time, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022487112466266">Darling-Hammond (2000)</xref> asserted that “an important contribution of teacher education is its development of teachers’ abilities to examine teaching from the perspective of learners who bring diverse experiences and frames of reference to the classroom” (p. 166). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022487112466266">Gore (2001)</xref> also argued for a focus on pedagogy in teacher education such that preservice teachers (PSTs) should “develop deep understanding of the complexities surrounding learning as well as strong skills for producing learning,” to support their own students to “achieve high quality learning outcomes” (p. 127). So far, however, research on TEs has not paid much attention to what it takes from TEs to support PSTs’ processes of learning to teach subject matter, in particular, the complexities associated with learning specific subject matter, and that thus make sense from the perspective of the students in the PSTs’ classrooms. Programs of teacher education usually include method courses for this purpose. However, in most institutes, these courses are taught by one specialist educator, sometimes aided by an adjunct or a graduate student, who is then responsible for his or her own curriculum. This may lead to huge differences not only between various programs (e.g., in the way chemistry method courses are taught) but also within one particular program (e.g., between chemistry and history method courses). Yet, few studies exist that address TEs’ pedagogy of teaching specific subject matter or how they develop their expertise.</p>
<p>In the case of science teacher education, a specific demand concerns the problem that science education, in particular at the secondary level, is not very successful in promoting student understanding and engagement (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022487112466266">Millar, 2006</xref>). Programs for science teacher education often struggle with the task of delivering what beginning secondary science teachers need to know, and providing better conditions for learning about teaching secondary science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022487112466266">Northfield &amp; Gunstone, 1997</xref>). While a dominant theme in science education research is teaching for conceptual development and change, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022487112466266">Russell and Martin (2007)</xref> asserted that being able to develop learners’ conceptual understanding “requires dramatic changes in how [teachers] teach” (p. 1152), so that modeling the approaches advocated in a program of science teacher education and the value of learning from experience needs to be purposefully highlighted. Consequently, curricula for science teacher education with a conceptual change orientation are aimed at helping future science teachers to reflect on practice and make decisions grounded in student learning. This implies a focus, especially in secondary method courses, on how students learn science, including common misconceptions, and conceptual change approaches. Moreover, recent curricula for science teacher education often aim at preparing science teachers to design and test curricular materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022487112466266">Van Driel &amp; Abell, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>This empirical study focuses on the specific expertise that science TEs bring into teacher education, in particular, in secondary method courses. The study aims to contribute to a better understanding of what science TEs emphasize in these method courses and why they do this; in other words, what their aims are, and how their expertise has developed on the basis of their professional background and experiences. Given the central role of TEs in science teacher education programs, this understanding is of interest to all those who are engaged in preservice and inservice science teacher education.</p>

<title>Research on TEs</title>
<p>Research on what TEs know, how they act, and why, is relatively rare. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022487112466266">Cochran-Smith (2003)</xref> highlighted a contrast, between the “enormous attention” paid over the past two decades to “what K-12 teachers need to know and be able to do in order to be effective with their students,” and the relative silence around “what teachers of teachers need to know” (p. 6). She noted that although there has been substantial research produced focusing on teacher education (e.g., books about the teacher education knowledge base, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022487112466266">F. B. Murray, 1996</xref>, and handbooks of research on teacher education, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022487112466266">Cochran-Smith, Feiman-Nemser, McIntyre, &amp; Demers, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022487112466266">Houston, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022487112466266">Sikula, Butterey, &amp; Guyton, 1996</xref>), discussion within these volumes tends to concentrate on
<disp-quote>
<p>demographics and general trends—who teacher educators are, what their backgrounds are, what they teach in methods and foundations courses—than on what they know or need to know and/or on how it is that they learn to teach teachers. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022487112466266">Cochran-Smith, 2003</xref>, p. 6)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022487112466266">Martinez (2008)</xref> identified “a noticeable gap in [the] rich mosaic of knowledge relate[d] to teacher educators themselves,” with

(p. 36)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Looking across the body of research that is beginning to accumulate about TEs and their work reveals three broad and interrelated strands: (a) Research on the competencies that might be used to define the (broad) expertise of TEs, (b) research on the transition experiences of TEs into the academy, and (c) research conducted by TEs themselves, using their own professional contexts as research sites. In terms of strand (a), research on TEs’ competencies, some scholars have focused on lists of competencies to define the expertise of TEs. Obviously, TEs need a whole range of skills, attitudes, and knowledge, some of which are generic, like having excellent communication skills and being able to work in a team (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022487112466266">Koster, Brekelmans, Korthagen, &amp; Wubbels, 2005</xref>). Others have focused on more pedagogically oriented aspects, such as modeling practice that is consistent with accepted best practices in teacher education, or fulfilling the various expectations of academia, such as engaging in and contributing to scholarship, in this case related to teacher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022487112466266">Kessinger, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022487112466266">K. Smith (2005)</xref> offered insights into the nature of expertise of TEs and how it differed from classroom teachers, through her study of a group of TEs, viewed from the perspective of these TEs and a group of novice secondary education graduates from a small teacher education college in Israel. K. Smith pointed at subject-matter knowledge and “pedagogical and didactical knowledge” as being very important to TEs.</p>
<p>In terms of strand (b), research on the transition experiences of TEs into the academy, the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022487112466266">J. Murray and Male (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022487112466266">J. Murray (2005)</xref> has been a notable addition, examining the experiences of a group of new TEs during their first 3 years in seven higher education institutions in the United Kingdom. Their work revealed two key tensions for career entry TEs, “developing a pedagogy for Higher Education-based Initial Teacher Education work, and becoming research active” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022487112466266">J. Murray &amp; Male, 2005</xref>, p. 125). Many of the participants in their study reported a stressful entry into the academy, “feeling deskilled, anxious, vulnerable, powerless and insecure” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022487112466266">J. Murray &amp; Male, 2005</xref>, p. 125). In a further report on this research, J. Murray focused more on the new TEs’ priorities for induction and on existing structures and processes of induction.</p>
<p>Further research related to the transition experiences of TEs can be found within strand (c), research conducted by TEs themselves, which is typically related to the development of their new professional identities as academics (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022487112466266">Bullock, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022487112466266">Dinkelman, Margolis, &amp; Sikkenga, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022487112466266">Williams, 2010</xref>). Such self-studies take a teacher-as-learner stance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022487112466266">Loughran &amp; Berry, 2012</xref>), and focus on the processes and practices of teaching and learning, as they are experienced by the various participants themselves. Many studies belonging to strand (c) highlight the importance of TEs’ processes of (professional) identity formation, and the role of reflection as a tool to help make the tacit aspects of their practice explicit to PSTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022487112466266">Berry, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022487112466266">Loughran, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022487112466266">Williams &amp; Ritter, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Focusing on Science TEs</title>
<p>In terms of research conducted by TEs themselves (strand c), a growing contribution comes from science TEs. Typically, these studies are driven by learning outcomes from research into contemporary science education issues such as student conceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022487112466266">Scott, Asoko, &amp; Leach, 2007</xref>), and engagement in learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022487112466266">Millar, 2006</xref>), as TEs seek to challenge traditional approaches to science teaching and learning. In a recent handbook chapter, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022487112466266">Loughran and Berry (2012)</xref> summarized and reviewed self-studies conducted by science TEs, highlighting a number of common foci, including how they promote reflective practice in themselves and their students, and investigating the nature of the relationship between the learner and the science content (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022487112466266">Loughran, 2007b</xref>). Other common issues include challenges encountered by TEs in seeking to promote particular approaches to science learning (e.g., conceptual change or scientific literacy), and ways in which specific approaches to science learning (e.g., science inquiry processes) learnt at university transfer, or do not transfer, into practicum. A dominant theme across these self-studies appears to be a concern by science TEs to incorporate a constructivist perspective into their teaching about science teaching and learning. This is typically developed through an emphasis on promoting opportunities for PSTs to experience self-directed learning and problem solving.</p>
<p>Such studies have helped to make explicit a number of issues that have affected not only TEs’ understanding of beginning science teaching but also the manner in which they needed to reconsider what they did, how, and why in their science teacher preparation programs. At the same time, much of the work reported from these studies is often deeply personal and context bound, so that knowledge of teaching and learning about science teaching that can affect the work of others and contribute to the “big picture enterprise” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022487112466266">Russell, 2007</xref>, p. 190) of science teacher education tends to be limited.</p>
<p>While self-study research offers one (growing) perspective of science TEs’ knowledge of practice, there have been very few studies focusing on the specific expertise that science TEs have (or need) to teach PSTs about teaching science. A notable exception is a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022487112466266">D. C. Smith (2000)</xref>, who described a part of her professional expertise in terms of three kinds of Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) she developed as an elementary science TE, that is, knowledge of (a) PSTs’ backgrounds as science learners, (b) PSTs’ ideas about science and scientists, and (c) PSTs’ views of learning to teach science. For each of these knowledge categories, she indicated why her knowledge mattered for her work as a TE, and how it influenced the curriculum design, and her approach toward planning and teaching about teaching elementary science. D. C. Smith concludes that explicating and sharing the knowledge base TEs have developed, will advance our understanding of teaching about teaching science, and of the progress PSTs make, or fail to make, in programs of teacher education. In particular, new science TEs may benefit from access to such knowledge as it may “fast track” their understanding of the process of learning to teach science.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022487112466266">Abell, Park Rogers, Hanuscin, Lee, and Gagnon (2009)</xref> focused on the development of PCK of TEs in various phases of their careers. These authors identified different roles (i.e., observer, apprentice, partner, independent instructor, and mentor), and related these roles to phases in the development of science TEs. Specifically, the authors advocate the inclusion of learning to become a science TE in doctoral programs in science education, so that when a doctoral student concludes this program, he or she is able to work as an independent instructor.</p>
<p>Although studies like this are quite useful as starting points, they are of limited value when it comes to defining the specific expertise science TEs need to support PSTs to learn to teach science. In particular, PSTs of science need to become aware that even though they may have been successful learners of science themselves, for most of the students in their classrooms (school), science is experienced as problematic, both in terms of conceptual difficulties and in terms of relevance. Moreover, PSTs often have prior beliefs about teaching and learning science that are based on a system that may have worked for them, in the past, but will not always be effective for the students they are going to teach.</p>

<sec id="section5-0022487112466266">
<title>Aim of the Study</title>
<p>The present study builds on the ideas of a pedagogy of teacher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022487112466266">Loughran, 2006</xref>). In Loughran’s framework, TEs are expected to</p>
<list id="list2-0022487112466266" list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>simultaneously promote awareness among PSTs of themselves as learners and as developing teachers (i.e., of science),</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>model specific approaches to teaching,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>be explicit and analytic about one’s own teaching, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>study and share practice as a way to develop professional knowledge as a teacher.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Our study takes as a starting point that TEs develop their expertise as a result of their personal professional experiences, for example, as teachers, educators, or researchers. Although most TEs have been schoolteachers for several years before becoming TEs, there are other pathways into (and alongside) teacher education experiences (e.g., through academic research, either in a specialist science discipline, or in education), which shape the orientation and the expertise of TEs. Developing a pedagogy of science teacher education requires TEs to be aware of, and explicit about, the problematic nature of science and of teaching. Moreover, TEs should be willing to design and engage in experiences in their programs that enable meaningful and relevant learning to take place for all participants in the learning to teach process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022487112466266">Loughran &amp; Berry, 2012</xref>). The present study aims to help institution-based science TEs to explicate their knowledge and experiences, to understand what they do, and why, in developing and enacting their pedagogy. In this way, the study aims to contribute to the articulation and development of a shared language for TEs as the basis of a pedagogy of science teacher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022487112466266">Loughran, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Instruments</title>
<p>Given the absence of specific theories and empirical studies on TEs’ expertise on teaching about teaching subject matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022487112466266">Berry, 2007</xref>), a small-scale, in-depth descriptive study seemed appropriate. To answer our research questions, data were collected from experienced science TEs about their approach to teaching preservice science teachers, and why they chose to provide PSTs with specific experiences. In addition, these educators were invited to talk about their personal and professional experiences, and how these led them to become TEs and shaped their purposes and practice.</p>
<p>An interview scheme was set up consisting of two parts (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0022487112466266">appendix</xref> for interview schedule). Part A focused on factors influencing career decisions. This part had an open structure, allowing TEs to give an account of their personal and professional experiences. In Part B, TEs described and explained their pedagogical approach in detail, in terms of activities, ideas, and ways of assessment, by focusing on how they prepare PSTs to teach a specific topic (e.g., force or evolution). At the end of the interview, an additional source of data was obtained from participants through the use of a storyline protocol. TEs were asked to draw and then explain a story line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022487112466266">Gergen &amp; Gergen, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022487112466266">Henze, Van Driel, &amp; Verloop, 2009</xref>) on how their satisfaction as a science TE had developed over time, and which experiences had influenced this development.</p>

<sec id="section8-0022487112466266">
<title>Sample and Context</title>
<p>To obtain a comprehensive insight into the variety of science TEs’ emphases and approaches, a sample of TEs was purposefully selected over a range of variables: science discipline (i.e., biology, chemistry, and physics), experience (teaching science method classes for at least 2 to more than 20 years), background (different career pathways, for example, teaching many years as a secondary teachers vs. having a research background in university), qualifications (having finished a PhD or not), and institutes. For the purpose of this study, four institutes of teacher education were invited to participate, two from Australia, the home country of the first author, and two from the Netherlands, where the second author resides. The four institutes were chosen because their science teacher education program had a good reputation (e.g., apparent from external evaluations). All of the TEs who were invited volunteered to participate in this study. Participants in this study were five science TEs from two Australian universities and seven science TEs from two Dutch universities. All of them had previously taught science at the secondary school level for a period ranging from 2 to 38 years. Six were (full-time) university-based educators holding a PhD who combined teacher education with a research task; the other six were staff with a part-time job that did not include research activities. The first author interviewed the Dutch educators, and the second author interviewed the Australian educators. All interviews were conducted in English.</p>
<p>All of the TEs taught method courses (in Dutch called “vakdidactiek” or subject-specific pedagogy) in the context of the teacher education programs of their institute. In the Dutch universities, this program consists of a 1-year master’s program, qualifying participants for the teaching of either chemistry, physics, or biology at preuniversity level (cf. Grades 10-12 of secondary education). During the entire program, PSTs stay at practice schools (teaching about 5-10 lessons per week), while simultaneously taking part in institutional activities (two afternoons per week, on average), including in each semester a series of eight method course (vakdidactiek) sessions. In the Australian universities, the science teacher education program varies across university providers (Graduate Diploma in Education, Double Degree—Bachelor of Science/Bachelor of Education and Master of Teaching), although graduates from all programs are qualified to teach General Science (Grades 7-10), as well as one or two senior science specialisms from biology, chemistry, and physics, depending on participants’ science background. Different university programs have different practica requirements such that students may complete 2 × 5 week school placements (5 weeks per semester), or undertake an internship 4 days per week with additional teacher education classes taking place at the school site and/or the university.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>All interviews and explanations of story lines were transcribed verbatim. For the analysis, there was no a priori system of codes or categories. Instead, to do justice to the respondents’ own stories, and capture the richness of their ideas, the data were analyzed from an interpretative phenomenological perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022487112466266">J. A. Smith, 1995</xref>). Both authors first read and discussed all transcripts until they agreed about the most salient features of each individual TE’s account. For each TE, these features were then summarized, focusing on (a) his or her concerns and purposes when preparing PSTs to teach science, (b) the emphases in his or her approaches to teaching about teaching science, and (c) previous personal and professional experiences and career decisions that had contributed to, or shaped, TE’s purposes and approaches. Next, the summaries per TE were compared with the aim to identify commonalities and differences across TEs. Cross-case analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022487112466266">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>) was applied to enable the comparison of the different TEs against the aforementioned foci: concerns, purposes, and approaches, and relations of each of these to TEs’ personal professional backgrounds.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In this section, we present the findings from the analysis of the interviews and story lines according to the three research questions.</p>
<list id="list3-0022487112466266" list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>Research Question 1</italic>: What are science TEs’ concerns and main purposes when preparing PSTs to teach secondary science?</p></list-item></list>
<p>All TEs shared a concern about the general quality of science teaching in schools—that is, they stated that science education, typically, does not promote meaningful learning of science concepts, nor does it commonly inspire students’ interest in learning about science, or motivate students to continue their study of science. One TE stated that teachers in schools tend to use traditional approaches to teaching and learning:
<disp-quote>
<p>I would say most teachers in high school still very much support the idea of drilling these students in problems and sort of manipulating these formulas put in numbers and do calculations, because that’s what the hard physics is all about. (N3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>All TEs talked about the limited influence and the few opportunities they have to influence how PSTs teach in practice. Most of them felt that the absence of a strong connection, in particular, the lack of frequent communication with the school supervisors of the PSTs, hindered the accomplishment of their goals. A dilemma they encounter is that as traditional approaches are still widely practiced in schools, the impact of their message is often diluted when PSTs enter the “real” world of practice in schools. For example, A1 explained that when she visits schools, she would focus on talking with the supervisors of the PSTs:
<disp-quote>
<p>So, it’s actually confronting the supervisor to shift their expectations . . . a lot of it is about mixed different expectations and it is more about me finding out what the expectation of the supervisor is. (A1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>N5 expressed the idea that PSTs are harsh judges of the usefulness of anything that is offered by their TEs. In particular, he recognized that many PSTs perceive educational theory as irrelevant. Thus, the influence of TEs is limited if they are not aware of the needs of their PSTs: “Their feedback is without condition, they just say it doesn’t work” (N5).</p>
<p>This TE had written a book aimed to help PSTs access a range of theoretical ideas (i.e., about teaching and learning biology). Although this book was a success, in that PSTs found it useful and interesting, he still faced the problem that PSTs often fail to recognize its content as “theory,” and so his attempts to show the usefulness of theory in teacher education are not realized:
<disp-quote>
<p>They love the book very much. They find it nice to read. The trouble is a little that they don’t think they learn theory. They think theory is something very difficult with lots of references, etc. (N5)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In relation to the above concerns, we distinguished three main purposes among this sample of TEs.</p>
<list id="list4-0022487112466266" list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>Purpose 1</italic>: Encourage PSTs to focus on teaching for conceptual understanding.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Most TEs talked about challenging the traditional or didactic approaches, common in schools, and aimed to promote more interactive approaches aimed at conceptual understanding of science (e.g., N3, A4, A5). For example,
<disp-quote>
<p>One of the key things that I hope comes through in the course that I have put together is about the importance of conceptual understanding and how as a teacher you should set about improving your students’ conceptual understandings of whatever the topic is that you are trying to teach. So, for me, it is of paramount importance that as teachers they need to have an idea about what the students’ alternate conceptions might be. (A4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>They are aware, however, that in the context of the school, some of the ideas they try to encourage among PSTs get lost or diminished.</p>
<list id="list5-0022487112466266" list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>Purpose 2</italic>: Help PSTs develop motivating teaching strategies and curricula, mainly to engage students and make science more relevant to their lives.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Worrying about the perceived relevance and popularity of school science by students, several TEs aimed to make PSTs aware of the need to make science more engaging. For example,
<disp-quote>
<p>My purpose here is to get them to interact with the kids, rather than just talk about it on the overhead . . . There’s a flight from chemistry . . . I hope they realize that this will brighten up a dull lesson. (A2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One biology TE (N1) focused on familiarizing PSTs with a new curriculum, which aims to make biology more relevant to students. Another biology TE suggested that biology would be more motivating if PSTs would reverse the typical teaching sequence in this subject (i.e., structure followed by function): “I think that a biology lesson would be more motivating for students when you start with an application” (N5).</p>
<list id="list6-0022487112466266" list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>Purpose 3</italic>: Promote a critical, questioning attitude among PSTs, and broaden their scope beyond the existing, traditional science curriculum and ways of teaching.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Six TEs explicitly aimed to make PSTs think critically about some of the fundamental issues underlying science education. For instance, they would stress the purpose of teaching science, by raising questions, such as “Why are we teaching this?” and “Why is it important for students to learn this?” Moreover, these TEs stressed the importance of PSTs articulating their thinking as a learner and as a new teacher. Two of them summarized their views as follows: “The biggest challenge for me is how to get them to think about what they’re doing” (N1), and “My aim is to create thinking chemistry teachers, if you are not prepared to think, you are in the wrong place” (A1).</p>
<p>Similarly, another TE expressed the desire to push PSTs beyond the level of learning “tips and tricks,” and confront them with theoretical notions, even if this conflicts with PSTs’ expectations: “I need therefore to be very explicit [with them] about what I think they need and why I am not delivering some of the things they think they want” (A5).</p>
<list id="list7-0022487112466266" list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>Research Question 2</italic>: What do science TEs’ emphasize in their approach to teaching about teaching secondary science?</p></list-item></list>
<p>Related to the purposes discussed in the previous section, a variety of approaches to teaching about teaching science was identified. In relation to <italic>the focus on conceptual understanding</italic>, TEs emphasized the need for PSTs to become aware of the ways in which their students learn science, how students often misunderstand what is being taught, or fail to grasp scientific concepts. All TEs aim to encourage PSTs to adopt the perspective of learners in science, for example, “I keep telling them, so what would it be like if you are a person in this lesson, what would you be feeling right now?” (A1), or “We always tell preservice teachers that they should put the students at the center and they should learn to sort of look at the roles of teacher and other people within a school” (N3).</p>
<p>The following issues were emphasized in particular:</p>
<list id="list8-0022487112466266" list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The role of <italic>students’ prior knowledge</italic>, and the importance for a science teacher to find out what students know when they enter their classroom. One TE explained how her own insights into learning difficulties of secondary students had increased by explaining and discussing scientific topics to her own daughter, helping her with homework (N7). This inspired her to frame an assignment for PSTs around talking to a small group of students, to sensitize their abilities to recognize particular learning difficulties and misconceptions. Other TEs drew on research literature, in particular, studies on student misconceptions of certain scientific topics and/or concept maps, to be used by PSTs to study the prior knowledge of their students (N3).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The role of <italic>language</italic>, for instance, how terms that are used in the context of a science class, by a teacher and/or schoolbook, can be very confusing for students when the same terms are used in everyday situations. Several TEs (N4 and N6) mentioned, in particular, that PSTs often use language that is inappropriate for their students and could easily evoke misconceptions and learning difficulties. Therefore, they aimed to make their PSTs aware of their use of language and the problems inherent in its use, for instance, by discussing and analyzing videos of science lessons, aimed at conceptual and/or language issues.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The role of <italic>PSTs’ own subject-matter knowledge</italic>. Many TEs discussed how PSTs are often unaware that they hold misconceptions, and how such misconceptions may hinder effective communication with their students: “Here’s . . . people with degrees in physics and they’ve still got the wrong notions in their heads on what’s happening” (A4). TEs seek to challenge their PSTs’ subject-matter knowledge, for instance, by using apparently simple experiments to deliberately confuse their PSTs. By asking PSTs to explain the phenomena they have observed and discuss the outcomes of such experiments, they aim not only to alert PSTs to gaps in their own subject-matter knowledge but also to misunderstandings and conceptual problems their students might experience in trying to understand the subject matter at hand.</p></list-item></list>
<p>In relation to <italic>the focus on engaging students and making science more relevant</italic>, TEs emphasized the need for PSTs to teach science in ways that are more activating, motivating, and innovative compared with the ways in which science is normally taught. In this context, some TEs (e.g., A2 and A4) present PSTs with lots of demonstrations, experiments, applets, and so on, and offer them opportunities to get acquainted with these by practicing during method course sessions, before PSTs actually use these tools in the lessons they teach during their practica in schools. At the same time, they made it clear that PSTs should develop their own styles and strategies, and not copy or imitate those of other teachers (including themselves): “I think the role I can do is alert them to what’s in kids’ heads and some of the strategies that I have seen used and that I have used myself” (A4).</p>
<p>Others (e.g., N5), however, focus on the design of lesson plans by PSTs, for instance, by analyzing and then changing the structure of regular science lessons (e.g., starting from a problem or an application rather than starting with explaining theory).</p>
<p>As for <italic>promoting a critical attitude among PSTs, and broadening their scope about science teaching</italic>, TEs emphasized that they want to make PSTs aware of the background of the curriculum they are supposed to be teaching, and of the limitations of this curriculum. Moreover, and in connection to this, some of them focus on the cultural views inherent (but often implicit) in traditional science curricula, and how they try to familiarize PSTs with, and challenge, these views. For example,
<disp-quote>
<p>It always becomes a question of well, why are we doing this? . . . It has to be grounded culturally: Why have we as Western society come to the point where we develop such ways of talking about things, describing things, and so on? (A3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For this purpose, several approaches appeared to be applied in method courses:</p>
<list id="list9-0022487112466266" list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The use of literature, in particular, on the history, the philosophy, and/or the nature of science.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Group discussions about the goals of science teaching, as implied by science curricula, questioning why these goals would be worth teaching, and exploring alternative goals.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Learning to think “out of the box,” for example, by asking PSTs to consider teaching topics that are usually not taught within their curriculum (such as safety in a biology class—N2). In this context, some also aimed to challenge how PSTs view the world as a scientist, trying to broaden their often rather monocultural views.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The use of action research to promote PSTs’ learning about their own teaching and to make “them more curious about their own practice” and to give PSTs “some experience with educational research so they can set up a little investigation in their own school” (N1).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 3</italic>: How do TEs’ prior professional and personal experiences shape their purposes and approaches to teaching about teaching secondary science?</p></list-item></list>
<p>As became apparent from the interviews (Part A of <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0022487112466266">appendix</xref>), and also from the explanations to their story lines, each TE had a different, personal story about how he or she had entered teacher education. Ten of the 12 participants began as secondary schoolteachers (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022487112466266">Table 1</xref>), and at some point, sometimes very late in their careers (e.g., A2), and for different reasons, had become TEs. Only two participants (A3 and N5) had different career starts. A3 became interested in teaching after obtaining a PhD in astrophysics and only worked for a short time in a secondary school before returning to university as a TE and lecturer in physics. N5 started to work in environmental engineering, but then embarked on a PhD in biology education, and did some teaching in secondary schools only after finishing his PhD. In any case, no one had planned a career as a TE. It seemed that all of them became more or less “accidental” TEs.</p>
<p>In terms of the sources of influence that shaped their expertise, they were also quite different. Some, coming from research in a discipline, felt more associated with the (academic) community of that discipline (e.g., N3). Others, particularly those with a long history as schoolteachers, identified more with the community of teachers and schools (e.g., A2). Yet others had a strong philosophical stance (N5 and A3), or were strongly driven by the general idea that education matters and makes a difference to people’s lives (A5). These different backgrounds led to some interesting views on how these TEs perceive their job, for example,
<disp-quote>
<p>I have two drives, one is to make a [theoretical] model which encompasses all kinds of teaching, that’s my researcher brain that tries to make a consistent model about it. The other part is that it should work in practice, so I worked on both sides and I think I’m only able to do that . . . because I also teach student teachers, otherwise my model becomes, a bit too airy. (N5)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Or,
<disp-quote>
<p>I want to make . . . the science learning better, but I also have this other research stream that is about documenting professional practice . . . What constitutes evidence, how do you actually document your philosophy, how do you articulate that, how do you communicate that, how do you crystallize those things? Those sorts of thinking, that sort of thinking is really important. (A1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Many of these TEs described their prior experiences as important sources informing their approach to teacher education. One TE phrased this in terms of having multiple identities:
<disp-quote>
<p>Yeah, but it’s [i.e., teacher educator] a part of my identity but another part is I’m an educational researcher and as an educational researcher I’m teaching student teachers how to do educational research, and on the other hand my work with the teachers in the . . . examination program pilot is more as a developer of materials. (N1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another TE perceived the ability to teach science in school as a defining part of who she is as a TE and as she did not have anything else to “lean on,” she expressed the need to stay in touch with this aspect to feel confident as a TE:
<disp-quote>
<p>For the first six years as a teacher educator, I did stand in work on a regular basis . . . for shorter or longer periods of time . . . I thought, what I’m good at is the practicality of teaching and I really haven’t achieved all this teacher educator stuff yet, so let’s make sure I don’t end up being nowhere, because you lose teaching really quick. The real parts of it, I’ve seen so many people lose it. So I thought I have to make sure I keep doing it until I feel confident enough about what I’m doing here. (N6)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The personal experiences of another TE helped her to see that people use science knowledge in different ways, which then led her to develop an approach that emphasized that student teachers need to look beyond how they themselves view the use of scientific knowledge:
<disp-quote>
<p>I grew up on a farm . . . it is all about practical use of your knowledge . . . If I take something like acids and bases, I have taught it to young kids . . . secondary kids, tertiary, nurses, artists, . . . [who] have a very different view of this. You know, there are all these different people who need to know this stuff, but need to know it in entirely different ways, . . . I know how I understand it, but it’s not really about my understanding, but . . . helping others understand it in ways it is useful for them. (A1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For most of these TEs, their prior experiences seemed much more influential on their approach than institutional features. However, one TE (N7) described the distinction between TEs with and without a background in research in relation to the different institutions in which she had worked. She noted that as a TE without a research background, she felt more as a “performer” and it was not until she had the chance to interact with research literature that her understanding of teacher education began to take shape:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think having a group that is researching stimulates you and the group as well to look up the literature. New teacher educators here have to do a . . . literature course, so that brings you also into contact with the . . . more general literature about teacher education. (N7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the four institutes that were included in this study, there appeared to be very limited, if any, support for beginning TEs, let alone a certain learning trajectory. As TEs only had brief (and distant) experiences of being a student in a teacher education program themselves, they had had little “apprenticeship of observation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022487112466266">Lortie, 1975</xref>) to work from. Consequently, TEs talked about learning their role through experience, for example, “It’s been an on the job training for me really . . . because like I said my own teacher training was a four months program” (N3).</p>
<p>Some TEs reported they had had a colleague who coached them or cotaught with (e.g., N3 and N4). However, this mostly seemed a matter of personal initiative rather than institutional policy. As N1 stated, “We talked together how we would fill in the courses we had, I didn’t do it really on my own. But how to do the interaction with the students, they just trusted you can do it” (N1).</p>
<p>Also, most, if not all, TEs had to invent their own individual curriculum, leading to rather different and highly personal approaches:
<disp-quote>
<p>I had to start out from zero and that gave me the opportunity to think about and try out what’s important and what I think is important for chemistry teachers . . . So it took me 5 years to try things out, to find out what’s important, what’s important for the preservice teachers, what I think is important they learn. (N7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>This study revealed similarities and differences in the aims and approaches of science TEs in the context of method courses, aimed at preparing preservice secondary teachers to teach science. An important common issue concerned their focus on stimulating PSTs to implement innovative practices of science teaching (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022487112466266">Timmerman, 2009</xref>) aimed at making science more comprehensible and more attractive to school students. This is consistent with recent curricula for science teacher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022487112466266">Van Driel &amp; Abell, 2010</xref>). For all participants, this focus implied a tension with current practice in schools that seems to encourage PSTs to adopt traditional and didactic teaching strategies. In particular, although TEs aimed at empowering their PSTs to teach science in a way that focused on student learning, they felt rather powerless as far as their contribution to how PSTs would be teaching in practice was concerned.</p>
<p>Differences between the institutes and (national) contexts in this study were not strongly evident. In none of the four institutes did we find something that reflected a common view or policy with respect to teaching about teaching secondary science. However, and partly because of this, substantial differences between the TEs were noted. Individual differences between TEs, even within one institute, were much larger than differences between institutes. The study made clear how TEs’ personal background and individual career path played out quite differently in their pedagogy of teacher education, as it became apparent in their aims and approaches in their method courses. Differences in expertise seemed to be related to the professional communities TEs feel most closely associated with (i.e., disciplinary or schoolteachers). In this context, TEs’ expertise in research, in terms of doing research themselves, or accessing research literature, seemed to matter. In particular, some TEs explicitly drew on (their own) research to inform their practice. Typically, these TEs’ expertise was characterized by a focus on making their PSTs think critically about their curriculum, and challenging them to reconsider their goals and related teaching approaches. However, TEs with a long history as a schoolteacher and little or no research experience usually displayed a more pragmatic type of expertise, focusing strongly on stimulating PSTs to engage and interact with their students as something they need to recognize as crucial to effective science teaching.</p>
<p>In summary, science TEs’ expertise seems to be related to the ad hoc ways in which they enter the profession, plus the apparent lack of a structure that could help them develop their practice as a community (e.g., the absence of an induction program for TEs or planned professional learning). Taken together, we think this largely explains why these individual differences may occur, and persist, and why, consequently, teaching about teaching science in practice may look very different, even within one teacher education institute.</p>
<p>These insights are important because it is anticipated that explicating and sharing TEs’ knowledge and practice of teaching about teaching science will stimulate both the theory and practice of science teacher education (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022487112466266">D. C. Smith, 2000</xref>). As it was grounded in the practice of experienced TEs, we think the outcomes of the present study can be used to promote the development of a pedagogy of science teacher education that can be shared among the community of science TEs (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022487112466266">Loughran, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022487112466266">2007a</xref>), and thus can become part of their common expertise. For instance, in a practical sense, these findings might serve to stimulate dialogue between TEs within their institutions to see what they recognize about their own purposes and approaches that may form steps toward more common approaches; or contribute to the construction of a language to describe TEs’ practices. Furthermore, by building on these insights, some common aspects of science TEs’ expertise may be identified, such as means of encouraging learning for conceptual change, enhancing the relevance of science for school students, and supporting PSTs of science to become critical and reflective thinkers. For those who come into science teacher education with little or no research experience, specific activities could be organized aimed at learning about research and learning to do research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022487112466266">Lin, Wang, Spalding, Clecka, &amp; Odell, 2011</xref>). For instance, pairs of TEs with and without a research background could work together as educators and collaborate in research projects. Taken together, the activities briefly outlined above are aimed to promote an organized approach to science TE development, particularly for those newly entering the profession, and PSTs learning.</p>
<p>The present study has obvious limitations. Our sample was rather small, and not meant to be representative for science TEs in Australia or the Netherlands, let alone for TEs in general. The concerns, purposes, and approaches of TEs that were reported (i.e., Research Questions 1 and 2) seem quite specific to science education, and thus we are reluctant to broaden the outcomes of the study to teacher education in general. However, the findings about the different pathways that TEs brought into teacher education, and the sources they draw on (i.e., Research Question 3), do not seem specific for science teacher education. More research, however, is needed to explore how this issue plays out in a broader sample of TEs. The authors chose to collect data from the TEs who were not from their home country. Although this introduced a language issue (i.e., for seven TEs and one researcher, English is their second language), we think that this contributed to openness and less bias on the part of both researchers and TEs. At the same time, the data are limited to TEs’ self-reports of their practice. In future research, we would like to investigate how different aims and approaches of TEs affect PSTs’ learning to teach science. We assume that, given the substantial differences found in this study, and taking into account that any sample of PSTs these days is often quite heterogeneous in terms of background, motivation, and so on, there will be huge differences in what PSTs take away from their science teacher education programs into their emerging school practice.</p>

<list id="list11-0022487112466266" list-type="order"><list-item><p>Please select a topic from the curriculum of general science/biology/physics/chemistry that you consider important for student teachers to learn to teach, and that is addressed in your course/ workshops. Please indicate why you choose this topic (<italic>Topic X</italic>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>At some point in your course, the teaching of <italic>Topic X</italic> is addressed. Can you explain at what point (in time), and if/why this timing is important?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Please describe how you introduce the teaching of <italic>Topic X</italic> to student teachers? What sort of arguments do you use to focus their attention on the importance of the teaching of <italic>Topic X</italic>?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What sort of activities do you organize to prepare student teachers for the teaching of <italic>Topic X</italic>?</p></list-item>

<title>Story Line</title>
<p>You are asked to draw a graph in which you depict your own satisfaction with the way you teach about science teaching.</p>
<p>First, assess your <italic>current</italic> level of satisfaction on a 5-point scale, ranging from 1 (<italic>very unsatisfied</italic>) via 3 (<italic>not satisfied</italic> nor <italic>unsatisfied</italic>) to 5 (<italic>very satisfied</italic>). Mark this point in the graph.</p>
<p>Then go back in time, and assess your level of satisfaction going back to the first time you taught about teaching science, and draw a graph connecting the points.</p>
<p>Finally, explain the graph and indicate what influenced its course (slope, highs, and lows). In this context, you may discuss the influence of experiences with student teachers, and also with colleagues or science teachers (e.g., learning from each other through collaboration, coteaching).</p>
