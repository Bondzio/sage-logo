<abstract>
<p>This study was designed to fulfill a twofold purpose. First, based on the hope theory framework and previous research, a 16-session hope-based substance abuse treatment program to help female drug abusers achieve a better recovery was developed. Second, ANCOVA was used to test the effectiveness of this treatment model. The participants were 40 female drug offenders who were randomly assigned into experimental and control groups. The 20 experimental group participants received 16 sessions of hope-based substance abuse treatment whereas the 20 control group members were put on the waiting list for another term of treatment. The results indicated that the members of the two groups had significant differences in their posttest scores for recovery goal setting and pursuing, pathway controlling, adequate energy, knowledge of the changing process, ability to cope, adequate cognition, emotion regulation, and self-esteem.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>According to recent statistics from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0306624X11426418">Ministry of Justice (2010a)</xref> in Taiwan, 43% of the prison population is comprised of drug offenders, and the rate of repeat offense has continued to increase. It has been documented that the rate rose from 38% in 2007 and 41% in 2008 to 43% in 2009 and 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0306624X11426418">Ministry of Justice, 2010b</xref>). Although substance abuse has been identified as a disease in the medical model, it was identified as criminal behavior by the criminal justice system in Taiwan for a long time, and drug offenders would receive the punishment of jail time with no rehabilitation or treatment. This could be one reason that the recidivism rate for drug offenders has remained high for years and continues to be one of the major concerns of the criminal justice field in Taiwan. In response to this concern, in 1998 the criminal justice system in Taiwan resolved to identify drug offenders as criminal patients to show their reorganization in viewing drug offenders not just as criminals but also as having a medical problem in drug addiction. Adopted along with this resolution was a goal to develop a drug treatment system to help drug offenders fight their drug addiction physically and mentally, and hopefully to achieve full recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0306624X11426418">Jiang, 1999</xref>). Since then, a few studies have been conducted in Taiwan to test drug treatment programs for male inmates, and the programs have been found to be effective in decreasing maladaptive beliefs on drug usage and reducing the amount of amphetamines ingested through smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0306624X11426418">Jiang, 1999</xref>) as well as increasing self-confidence, patience, and self-understanding in the recovery process and enabling recovering addicts to pursue a healthier life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0306624X11426418">Jiang, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Many people have a stereotyped view of drug abuse as a male problem; however, according to recent statistics from the Taiwan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0306624X11426418">Ministry of Justice (2010b)</xref>, substance abuse was the leading cause of incarceration for both males and females in Taiwan, and furthermore, a higher percentage of females were classified as drug offenders than males (i.e., in 2009, the percentage was 42.9% for females and 27.9% for males). These statistics have pointed to the urgency of developing drug treatment programs to fit the needs of females. However, to our knowledge, no empirical studies of drug treatment programs for female offenders have previously been conducted in Taiwan. To fill this gap, the aims of this study were twofold. First, a substance abuse treatment program was developed based on the characteristics of female drug offenders identified from empirical evidence mainly from United States along with a few studies from other countries. Then, a study with a two-group pretest and posttest control group design was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the hope-based treatment program for female drug offenders in Taiwan.</p>

<title>The Characteristics of Female Substance Abusers</title>
<p>Several scholars from the United States have explored the characteristics of female substance abusers and concluded that there are key differences between male and female substance abusers, which can be categorized into three aspects—physical, environmental, and psychological—as follows (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0306624X11426418">Gerolamo, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0306624X11426418">Molidor, Nissen, &amp; Watkins, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0306624X11426418">Shelton, 2000</xref>). Physically, due to hormonal differences and a higher percentage of fat in the female body makeup compared with males, females were found to be more vulnerable to being affected by substance usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0306624X11426418">Davis &amp; DiNitto, 1998</xref>). Environmentally, more female substance abusers have suffered from traumatic experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0306624X11426418">Hien, Cohen, &amp; Campbell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0306624X11426418">Koenig, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0306624X11426418">Peterson, Berkowitz, Cart, &amp; Brindis, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0306624X11426418">Wu, El-Bassel, Witte, Gilbert, &amp; Chang, 2003</xref>), a dysfunctional family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0306624X11426418">Finnegan &amp; McNally, 1997</xref>), sexual abuse and assault (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306624X11426418">Baker, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306624X11426418">Hiebert-Murphy &amp; Woylkiw, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0306624X11426418">Nyamathi, Longshore, Keenan, Lesser, &amp; Leake, 2001</xref>), domestic violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0306624X11426418">Najavits, Sonn, Walsh, &amp; Weiss, 2004</xref>), and physical and emotional abuse in their early childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0306624X11426418">Nyamathi et al., 2001</xref>) than male substance abusers. Psychologically, females substance abusers were found to be more likely to feel depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0306624X11426418">Finnegan &amp; McNally, 1997</xref>) and to have low self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0306624X11426418">Dodge &amp; Potocky, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0306624X11426418">Messina &amp; Prendergast, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0306624X11426418">Sowards, O’Boyle, &amp; Weissman, 2006</xref>), low impulsive control, and weak emotional management skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306624X11426418">Diamond, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0306624X11426418">Miller &amp; Guidry, 2001</xref>) than male substance abusers. Reciprocally, hopeless people were more vulnerable than others to having a lifetime risk of substance abuse dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0306624X11426418">Conrod, Pihl, Stewart, &amp; Dongier, 2000</xref>) and greater risk of relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0306624X11426418">Grella, Scott, Foss, Joshi, &amp; Hser, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0306624X11426418">Gutierres and Puymbroeck (2006)</xref> pointed out in detail how hopelessness arises from the reciprocal effects between childhood abusive experiences, substance misusage, and adult victimization from domestic violence. They observed that childhood sexual and physical abuse has traumatized many women and led to their having low self-esteem, anxiety, and depression and that many women use substances to cope with these negative feelings. Moreover, their vulnerability tends to lead to adult victimization from domestic violence, which reinforces lower self-esteem and depression, eventually resulting in deeper feelings of hopelessness in regard to their ability to stop using drugs, or leading them to question the possibility of improving the quality of their lives. This vulnerability can be present even if the women are able to stop using drugs because their life situation may have been previously damaged financially or socially due to their prior drug usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0306624X11426418">Weiss, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Sadly, one study from Sweden indicated that even if some female substance abusers finally decided to receive treatment, individuals who were lacking in hope due to an unclear treatment plan or failure to provide maintenance medication treatment (i.e., Methadone, Buprenorphine) were 7.5 times more likely to drop out than others with clear plans and maintenance treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306624X11426418">Berman, Kallmen, Barredal, &amp; Lindquist, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0306624X11426418">Sowards et al. (2006)</xref> found in a study conducted in the United States that female substance abusers with the least hope for their future were most likely to have bad outcomes and suggested that instilling hope should be the most important emphasis in developing substance treatment programs for females.</p>

<title>The Role of Hope in Substance Abuse Recovery</title>
<sec id="section5-0306624X11426418">
<title>The definition of hope</title>
<p>According to hope theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0306624X11426418">Snyder, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0306624X11426418">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0306624X11426418">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0306624X11426418">Snyder, Harris, et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0306624X11426418">Snyder, Irving, &amp; Anderson, 1991</xref>), hope includes three important elements: goal, pathway, and agency. This theory defines hope as a cognitive set with positive motivation to set up goal-directed pathways (pathways) and the energy to follow the pathways to achieve the goals (agency). Pathway, which is also described as pathway thinking, refers not only to individuals’ ability to set up a plan but also to a self-belief in their own capacity for doing so. This is especially important when roadblocks are encountered because, through pathway thinking, individuals have the ability to find alternative pathways to reach the goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0306624X11426418">Law &amp; Guo, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0306624X11426418">Snyder, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0306624X11426418">1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0306624X11426418">1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0306624X11426418">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0306624X11426418">Snyder, Harris, et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0306624X11426418">Snyder, Ritschel, Rand, &amp; Berg, 2006</xref>). Similarly, agency, which is also known as agency thinking, refers to the need for individuals to have not only motivation to pursue the goals but also a belief in their capacity to do so. This is a very important element for goal pursuit because without motivation and energy, the goals and pathways would become meaningless, especially when barriers are encountered during the pursuit of a goal and strong energy is required to push through (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0306624X11426418">Law &amp; Guo, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0306624X11426418">Snyder, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0306624X11426418">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0306624X11426418">Snyder, Lapointe, Crowson, &amp; Early, 1998</xref>). Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0306624X11426418">Snyder (2000)</xref> stressed that hope will not exist without reciprocal interaction between pathways and agency; the combination of agency and pathway which is essential to hope indicates that these two components will affect each other during the goal pursuit process.</p>

<title>The Role of Goals in Substance Abuse Recovery</title>
<p>For this line of research seeking to apply hope theory to substance abuse recovery, a few of the existing documents from the United States offer evidence that points to the essential role of clear goals during the recovery process. Regarding the impact on hope of establishing a clear goal on entering treatment, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306624X11426418">Jackson, Wernicke, and Hassga (2003)</xref> found that having hope with a clear goal was a strong predictor of voluntarily entering substance abuse treatment for a federal prison inmate. Other research with participants drawn from the general population also confirmed that having positive expectancy toward a goal was a good predictor for entering treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306624X11426418">Grencavage &amp; Norcross, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0306624X11426418">Pfeiffer, Feuerlein, &amp; Brenk-Schulte, 1991</xref>). In regard to having a clear goal for each step of the treatment process, the transtheoretical model of the process of change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0306624X11426418">Prochaska &amp; DiClemente, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0306624X11426418">Prochaska, DiClemente, &amp; Norcross, 1992</xref>) distinguishes five stages in the substance abuse recovery process of change: precontemplation (in which people are not aware of the problem and have no intention of changing), contemplation (in which people have mixed feelings about changing and are not ready to take a dramatic step for change), preparation (in which people start to have an intention to change for recovery), action (in which people take steps in pursuit of recovery), and maintenance (in which people continue to stay substance free). Jackson et al. and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0306624X11426418">Rollnick, Morgan, and Heather (1996)</xref> pointed out that hope, positive outcome expectancies, and personal will toward the goal were important factors that enabled the substance abuser to move forward through these stages. Finally, regarding completion of the treatment program goal, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0306624X11426418">Irving, Seidner, Burling, Pagliarini, and Robbins-Sisco (1998)</xref> discovered that individuals in treatment for substance dependence who had high hope with a clear goal would have a longer time of abstinence after the treatment, better life quality, higher self-efficacy, less belief in the positive aspects of substance usage, and more social support.</p>

<title>The Role of Pathway Thinking and Agency Thinking in Substance Abuse Recovery</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0306624X11426418">Tillich (1965)</xref> reminded, “Hope is easy for the foolish, but genuine hope is something rare and great” (p. 17). As we have seen, many female substance abusers have experienced a great deal of stress from traumatic life experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306624X11426418">Baker, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0306624X11426418">Finnegan &amp; McNally, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306624X11426418">Hiebert-Murphy, &amp; Woylkiw, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0306624X11426418">Hien et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0306624X11426418">Koenig, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0306624X11426418">Najavits et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0306624X11426418">Nyamathi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0306624X11426418">Peterson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0306624X11426418">Wu et al., 2003</xref>), felt more depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0306624X11426418">Finnegan &amp; McNally, 1997</xref>), and had lower self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0306624X11426418">Dodge &amp; Potocky, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0306624X11426418">Sowards et al., 2006</xref>) than others. For this reason, we expanded our exploration to investigate whether it might be helpful to focus on coping ability, regulation of emotion, and building self-esteem in strengthening pathway thinking and increasing energy for goal pursuit.</p>

<title>Enhancing pathway thinking by increasing coping ability</title>
<p>Several studies from the United States have indicated that when women had experienced higher levels of traumatic stress, they were more likely to relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0306624X11426418">Dawes et al., 2000</xref>), to continue to use drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0306624X11426418">Stevens, Murphy, &amp; McKnight, 2003</xref>), to have a craving for drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0306624X11426418">Sinha, Fuse, Aubin, &amp; O’Malley, 2000</xref>), and to have a difficult adjustment in prison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0306624X11426418">Salisbury, Voorhis, &amp; Spiropoulos, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, parental stress was found to be a risk factor for technical violation when inmates were released from incarceration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0306624X11426418">Salisbury et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, scholars have recommended that teaching coping skills, such as spirituality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306624X11426418">Arévalo, Prado, &amp; Amaro, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0306624X11426418">Brown, O’Grady, Farrell, Flechner, &amp; Nurco, 2001</xref>), ways of controlling craving, refusing temptation, control of anger emotion, stress management, and making commitments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0306624X11426418">Kadden et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0306624X11426418">Litt, Kadden, Cooney, &amp; Kabela, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0306624X11426418">Snyder et al., 1998</xref>), during the drug treatment program would be very helpful for reducing participants’ stress and enabling them to take action to achieve abstinence.</p>

<title>Enhancing pathway thinking through emotional regulation</title>
<p>Emotional regulation refers to strategies such as suppression or cognitive reappraisal of a stressful situation that people can use to manage their emotion and move from a negative to a more positive attitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0306624X11426418">Gross, Richards, &amp; John, 2006</xref>).

Thus, enhancing the ability to regulate emotion should be another focus for the drug treatment program. Scholars have found that for female substance abusers, especially those who have suffered a traumatic experience, learning to regulate emotion by using strength-based strategies like rediscovering personal life goals, developing alternative choices, rebuilding adaptive skills, and sharing positive personal stories and growth memories through personal lifeline activities could help clients rebuild their self-efficacy and recharge positive emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0306624X11426418">Ford &amp; Russo, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0306624X11426418">Ford &amp; Stewart, 1999</xref>).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11426418">Cooper (1994)</xref> mentioned that people usually use drugs when they wish to seek excitement, stimulate their enjoyment of social encounters, avoid peer pressure, or find release from negative life event stress. In fact, many empirical studies from the United States have confirmed that women’s negative life experiences can strongly impact their psychological well-being, with such results as low self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0306624X11426418">Clements, Ogle, &amp; Sabourin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0306624X11426418">Clements, Sabourin, &amp; Spiby, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0306624X11426418">Gutierres &amp; Puymbroeck, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0306624X11426418">Williams &amp; Mickelson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0306624X11426418">Zlotnick, Johnson, &amp; Kohn, 2006</xref>) and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0306624X11426418">Gutierres &amp; Puymbroeck, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, low self-esteem was found to be a strong risk factor for suicidal thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0306624X11426418">Wilke, 2004</xref>), depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0306624X11426418">MacInnes, 2006</xref>), and substance use relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0306624X11426418">Grella et al., 2003</xref>).

<title>Overview of the Present Study</title>
<p>Abundant evidence cited in the previous literature review has shown that in recent years, a higher percentage of females have been classified as drug offenders than males in Taiwan. Furthermore, in numerous studies, it was found that many female substance abusers felt hopelessness due to their traumatic life stress; thus, instilling hope should be an important focus for female substance abuse treatment programs. Unfortunately, to our knowledge, in Taiwan hope theory has not been widely applied in substance abuse treatment in either clinical settings or correctional facilities, or examined in empirical studies. Nevertheless, a few studies in the United States have confirmed that a hope-based treatment group is effective in helping substance abusers enter treatment and in increasing motivation for recovery as well as obtaining higher treatment program completion rates. Building on these evidences, in this study a 16-session hope-based treatment program was designed; it was hypothesized that this program would help female drug offenders in Taiwan set up clear recovery goals, enhance their coping ability, and aid them in establishing appropriate pathways for achieving their goals. Furthermore, this program was expected to enhance their emotional management skills and self-esteem and thus promote stronger motivation for recovery.</p>

<sec id="section15-0306624X11426418">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants for instrument validation and the current study were female drug offenders from a correctional institution in central Taiwan. They had committed a drug-related crime and were recommended by the social worker for the treatment program. To be eligible to participate, inmates had to have a history of drug abuse or drug dependence.</p>
<sec id="section16-0306624X11426418">
<title>Participants for instrument validation</title>
<p>Prior to the study, a pilot testing and a confirmation testing were conducted to validate each of the three instruments that would be used to collect the data for this study. To test the validity of each instrument, prior the current study, 153 female inmates served as the pilot run sample and a factor analysis was conducted to test the construct validity of the inventory. The ages of the participants ranged from 19 to 50 (<italic>M</italic> = 38). The average age for their first incidence of drug use was 15. Among them, 47% were single, 19% were married, and 34% were divorced. As for educational background, 85% of the participants were middle school graduates and 15% were senior high school or vocational high school graduates. Then, another group of 150 female inmates was utilized to further validate each of the inventories using the structural equation model to reconfirm the model structure from the pilot study and for the purpose of testing its reliability. Their ages ranged from 20 to 52 (<italic>M</italic> = 39). The average age for their first incidence of drug use was 16. Among them, 46% were single, 18% were married, and 36% were divorced. As for educational background, 83% of the participants were middle school graduates, and 17% were senior high school or vocational high school graduates.</p>
<p>The chi-square independent test was used to examine whether there was a difference between the distribution for the above two groups on each demographic variable (i.e., age, first incidence of drug use, marital status, and educational background) at the significant level of .05. None of the chi-square values reached a significant level (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .05), indicating homogeneity between the two groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0306624X11426418">
<title>Participants for current study</title>
<p>A total of 40 female drug offenders were referred by the social worker for the treatment program as a mandatory requirement. They were randomly assigned into the experimental and control groups. The experimental group participants received 16 sessions of hope-based substance abuse group treatment, meeting once per week for 2 hr for a total of 16 sessions, whereas the control group members received no treatment for the duration of this research and were put on the waiting list for the same treatment program in another term. Because their participation was mandatory, no compensation was given for their time.</p>
<p>The ages of participants in the experimental group ranged from 19 to 44 (<italic>M</italic> = 34). The average age for their first incidence of drug use was 16. Among them, 50% were single, 17% were married, and 33% were divorced. As for educational background, 83% of the participants were middle school graduates, and 17% were senior high school or vocational high school graduates. The ages of participants in the control group ranged from 18 to 42 (<italic>M</italic> = 32). The average age for their first incidence of drug use was 17. Among them, 48% were single, 18% were married, and 34% were divorced. As for educational background, 81% of the participants were middle school graduates, and 19% were senior high school or vocational high school graduates. As in the pilot study, none of the chi-square values on the demographic variables reached a significant level (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .05), indicating homogeneity between the two groups.</p>

<title>Learning Satisfaction Scale</title>
<p>The five questions of the Learning Satisfaction Scale were based on the objectives of each session and were developed to assess protocol fidelity. Ratings are made on a variation of a Likert-type scale, with responses ranging from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>), 2 (<italic>disagree</italic>), 3 (<italic>no opinion</italic>), 4 (<italic>agree</italic>), to 5 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>).</p>

<title>Hope Index for Substance Abuse Offender Recovery</title>
<p>The 29 questions of the Hope Index for Substance Abuse Offender Recovery were developed for this study based on the theoretical structure presented in previous research studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0306624X11426418">Snyder, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0306624X11426418">2000</xref>) to measure participants’ ability in goal setting and pathway planning and their motivation for recovery. Ratings are made on a variation of a Likert-type scale, with responses ranging from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>), 2 (<italic>disagree</italic>), 3 (<italic>slightly disagree</italic>), 4 (<italic>slightly agree</italic>), 5 (<italic>agree</italic>), to 6 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>). To test the validity of this scale, prior to the current study, 153 female inmates served as the pilot run sample. A factor analysis was conducted to test the construct validity of this inventory, and the results indicated that a three-factor solution could account for 71.420% of the variance; the factor loading of each item was between .485 and .831. Then, another group of 150 female inmates was utilized to further validate the scale using the structural equation model to reconfirm the three-factor model from the pilot study and for the purpose of testing its reliability. The results of the confirmatory factor analysis showed that the model was a good fit and confirmed that the selected items can be properly explained by the three latent factors assessed in this inventory, as follows. The Goal Setting and Pursuing subscale assesses the participants’ ability in setting goals and overcoming obstacles and their persistence in pursuing the goals they have set up. (A sample item is “I have set up a clear and specific goal for my recovery.”) The Pathway Controlling subscale assesses the participants’ ability to set up pathways based on their goals. (A sample item is “I am able to follow a plan, take one step at a time to attain a goal.”) The Adequate Energy subscale assesses the participants’ belief about their ability to carry out the plan to attain the goal. (A sample item is “I believe the success of substance abuse recovery relies on my own determination.”) The Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of the whole inventory was .976; the coefficients for each subscale were Goal Setting and Pursuing = .958, Pathway Controlling = .955, and Adequate Energy = .881, indicating good reliability for this instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0306624X11426418">Ornum, Dunlap, &amp; Shore, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Cognitive and Behavior Change of Substance Abuse</title>
<p>The 31 questions of the Cognitive and Behavior Change of Substance Abuse inventory were developed for this study based on the theoretical structure presented in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306624X11426418">Beck, Wright, Newman, &amp; Liese, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306624X11426418">DiClemente &amp; Prochaska, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0306624X11426418">Newman &amp; Ratto, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0306624X11426418">Rotgers &amp; Nguyen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0306624X11426418">Tiffany, 1990</xref>) to measure clients’ cognitive and behavioral changes in the path as they moved toward recovery.

The same pilot run sample described above was used to test the validity of this scale. The results of factor analysis indicated that a four-factor solution could account for 45.162% of the variance; the factor loading of each item was between .485 and .831. Then, the same confirmation sample as described above was utilized to further validate the scale using the structural equation model to reconfirm the four-factor model from the pilot study and for the purpose of testing its reliability. The results from this confirmatory factor analysis showed that the model was a good fit and confirmed that the selected items can be properly explained by the four latent factors assessed in the inventory, as follows. Knowledge of the changing process refers to the participants’ knowledge about the recovery process and awareness of situations that would impact their recovery. (A sample item is “I understand the changing process of recovery.”) Ability to cope refers to the participants’ ability to use positive coping skills for recovery. (A sample item is “I know how to say no to drugs.”) Adequate cognition refers to the participants’ ability to use positive thought in viewing recovery. (A sample item is “Using drugs cannot solve my problems effectively.”) Emotion regulation refers to the participants’ ability to manage their emotion and maintain a positive attitude to face recovery. (A sample item is “Managing emotion appropriately would help me get away from drug usage.”) The Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for the whole inventory was .95; the coefficient for each subscale was Knowledge of the Changing Process = .83, Ability to Cope = .86, Adequate Cognition = .91, and Emotion Regulation = .93, indicating good reliability for this instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0306624X11426418">Ornum et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Research Design and Treatment Program</title>
<p>Prior to data collection, this research was approved by the first author’s Institutional Review Board and permission was received from the research site. This study had a two-group pretest and posttest control group design to strengthen internal validity and ensure that participants’ changes were from the treatment itself and not due to history, maturation, testing effect, and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0306624X11426418">Spata, 2003</xref>). Both groups took the Hope Index, the Cognitive and Behavior Change Scale, and the Self-Esteem Scale at the same time before the first session was held for the pretest. Then, the experimental group participants received 16 sessions (for a total of 32 hr) of hope-based substance abuse group treatment whereas the control group members received no treatment for the duration of this research. The group treatment of the experimental group was conducted by the coauthor of this study, who is a licensed counselor and has had intensive counseling experience in conducting substance abuse treatment; the study was conducted in the participants’ native language, which was Mandarin Chinese in this case. At the end of the treatment, members of both groups filled out the three instruments mentioned above at the same time for the posttest. The questionnaires were completed in a group setting using a self-administered style for approximately 30 to 40 min. To keep all the information confidential but also feasible for use in the pre–posttest design, the participants were informed prior to the research that their identifiers would be removed from the information prior to its processing and their names would not be identified in any form of research report.</p>
<p>The hope-based substance treatment program, which is based on the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0306624X11426418">Lopez, Floys, Ulven, and Snyder (2000)</xref> framework and other related documents in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0306624X11426418">Monti, Kadden, Rohsenow, Cooney, &amp; Abrams, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0306624X11426418">Prochaska &amp; DiClemente, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0306624X11426418">Prochaska et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0306624X11426418">Reilly &amp; Shopshire, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0306624X11426418">Velasquez, Maurer, Crouch, &amp; DiClemente, 2001</xref>), was designed for this study primarily by the first author of this study, who is a licensed counselor and has had intensive counseling experience in conducting substance abuse treatment. After intensive discussion, the authors reached agreement, and the final product was completed and implemented accordingly. There are three stages in this treatment process, as described in the following paragraphs.</p>
<sec id="section24-0306624X11426418">
<title>Stage 1: Finding hope from a personal life story</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0306624X11426418">Lopez et al. (2000)</xref>, sharing stories will help people to find the pattern of how their hopeful thoughts grow or are diminished. Three sessions were designed in this stage to help participants find hope through their stories. In the first session, participants were asked to recall and share a story of something that happened before they used drugs. In the second session, participants learned the hope theory and used that framework to explain their life stories. In the third session, participants explored how to use past successful experiences to help solve their current problems.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0306624X11426418">
<title>Stage 2: Increasing hope</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0306624X11426418">Lopez et al. (2000)</xref> believed that people with hopeful perspectives will be good at setting goals, generating strategies for attaining goals, and maintaining pathways that are more effective, and thus will be more likely to attain their goals. Sessions 4 through 13 were designed with a focus on enhancing members’ hopeful thoughts. The transtheoretical model of motivation was introduced in the 4th session; then, based on this model, participants shared stories or thoughts about their recovery journey. The 5th session was devoted to exploring how inappropriate cognitive processes could trigger drug usage and how to use alternative statements to replace inappropriate thoughts.In the 6th through 8th sessions, the participants identified possible causes of anger and how anger triggered drug usage, and learned anger management skills through role-play and relaxation training. In the 9th and 10th sessions, participants identified a personal goal for recovery and developed ways to achieve that goal. The 11th session was designed to enhance participants’ agency thoughts for attaining the recovery goals though a process of breaking down their recovery goals into smaller attainable objectives and making an action plan for achieving those objectives. The 12th session was designed to help participants explore obstacles that hindered them in carrying out the action plan and possible coping strategies. The 13th session was focused on assertiveness skills training.</p>

<sec id="section26-0306624X11426418">
<title>Stage 3: Hope reminding</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0306624X11426418">Michael (1999)</xref>, recollecting previous successful experiences can enhance people’s sense of hope. The 3 sessions of this stage were designed for this purpose. In the 14th session, participants drew a lighthouse and listed their previous successful experiences on the picture to encourage them to become their own reminders, like lighthouses for their own life journeys. In the 15th session, participants reviewed the progress they had made during the treatment. Finally, in the last session, participants shared their insights about finding hope and their progress in recovery and gave feedback to each other.</p>
<p>To document the participants’ attendance and assess protocol fidelity, participants were required to sign in on their entry for treatment, and their satisfaction with fulfillment of the objectives of each session was assessed at the end of the session. To ensure the fidelity of our data set, it was decided that only data from those participants with full attendance records would be included in this study.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>First, the mean and standard deviation of the Learning Satisfaction Scale were calculated for each session to assess protocol fidelity for each session. Next, it was a concern that, because the participants in the research were assigned by the social worker to receive treatment and then were randomly assigned into two groups, the samples might not be representative of all female drug offenders and the equality of the two groups might be questionable. In addition, pretest effect was also a major concern as it could affect the internal validity of this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0306624X11426418">Spata, 2003</xref>). Based on the suggestion of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0306624X11426418">Silknitter, Wisnowski, and Montgomery (1999)</xref>, it was determined that ANCOVA would be the best tool to handle these limitations because it can be “used to increase the precision of a model fit when an uncontrollable but observable nuisance variable has an impact on the response variable” (p. 303). Accordingly, ANCOVA was used to test the effectiveness of the hope-based treatment of substance abuse. The pretest scores of the subscales from both groups served as a convenient variable for testing the significant differences between the posttest scores on each subscale for the two groups. The significant alpha level was set at .05.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>One of the best strategies for treating female drug abusers is to help them find and enhance hope, and to continually remind them of this newly found hope, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0306624X11426418">Lopez et al. (2000)</xref>. Based on this perspective, we designed a hope-based substance abuse treatment program with the expectation that this program would successfully help female drug offenders achieve a better recovery than they had prior to their treatment as well as in comparison with female drug offenders who did not receive treatment. This study has been a beginning effort to test the effectiveness of a hope-based substance abuse treatment program in helping female drug offenders in Taiwan. The results will be discussed in detail in the following analysis.</p>
<p>First, based on previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306624X11426418">Grencavage &amp; Norcross, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0306624X11426418">Irving et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306624X11426418">Jackson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0306624X11426418">Pfeiffer et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0306624X11426418">Rollnick et al., 1996</xref>), we expected that a hope-based substance treatment program would be helpful in empowering female drug offenders in Taiwan to set goals, establish pathways, and realize increased motivation for recovery. Consistent with previous research, this expectation was fulfilled by the evidence provided in the present study; based on self-report, the hope-based substance abuse program was able to instill significant levels of hope in the female drug offenders who completed the program compared with those who did not have a chance to attend.</p>
<p>Second, based on previous findings, hope and positive outcome expectancies along with better coping skills can help to prevent substance abusers’ relapse and enable them to move along in the different stages toward recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0306624X11426418">Prochaska &amp; DiClemente, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0306624X11426418">Prochaska et al., 1992</xref>) and to have a better treatment outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306624X11426418">Grencavage &amp; Norcross, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0306624X11426418">Irving et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306624X11426418">Jackson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0306624X11426418">Kadden et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0306624X11426418">Litt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0306624X11426418">Marlatt, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0306624X11426418">Pfeiffer et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0306624X11426418">Rollnick et al., 1996</xref>). Based on this perspective, in the design of our hope-based treatment program, we included sessions to introduce the changing process and to teach coping strategies for handling craving and expected the content of these sessions to empower the female drug offenders in Taiwan who completed the program to use better coping skills and experience better transition in recovery stages. Consistent with previous research, this expectation was fulfilled by the evidence provided in the present study; based on self-report, the hope-based substance abuse program helped the female drug offenders who completed the program to gain significantly more knowledge of the process of change and significantly more coping ability compared with inmates in the same institution who did not participate in the treatment. Although the drug use behavior after reentry was outside the scope of this current study and was not measured, these significant changes might be expected to contribute to the participants’ capacity for pathway development in the future.</p>
<p>Third, several previous studies found that control of anger emotion was an important factor for promoting recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0306624X11426418">Kadden et al., 1992</xref>); in contrast, difficulty with regulation of emotion was found to be highly related to substance abuse and to block energy in pursuing recovery goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0306624X11426418">Fox et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0306624X11426418">Linehan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0306624X11426418">Sher &amp; Grekin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0306624X11426418">Tice et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0306624X11426418">Walfish et al., 1990</xref>). Based on suggestions from the previous studies, we designed several sessions addressing emotion management and expected that female drug offenders in Taiwan would gain greater ability to regulate emotion through these sessions. This expectation was fulfilled by the evidence provided in the present study; based on self-report, the hope-based substance abuse program contributed to a significant increase in the scores of the female drug offenders on ability to regulate and manage their emotion compared with those who did not participate in the treatment.

Thus, one of our goals for this study was to reboot female drug offenders’ self-esteem through the hope-based treatment program. Evidence provided in the present study suggested that this expectation was fulfilled; based on self-report, the hope-based substance abuse program contributed to a significant increase in the scores for self-esteem of the female drug offenders in Taiwan who completed the program compared with those who did not participate in the treatment. These significant changes would in turn contribute to increasing their motivation for pursuing goals.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<sec id="section34-0306624X11426418">
<title>Limitations of the Study</title>
<p>The results of this study could serve as a framework for conducting a hope-based substance abuse treatment program to help female drug offenders in Taiwan. However, there are some limitations of this study worth mentioning. First, due to the lack of empirical evidence in this line of research in Taiwan, the literature review and framework building relied heavily on supporting studies from the United States. Although the findings of the present study comprise a significant contribution to the drug treatment field in Taiwan, more studies in related areas will be necessary for further confirmation. Second, the correctional institution of this study was not randomly selected so that the participants cannot be said to be representative of the nationwide female drug offender population in Taiwan and, furthermore, participants included only nonrandom selected female drug offenders from the same institution who were mandated to participate in the study. Thus, as it would be inappropriate to generalize the results obtained from mandated inmates from a single institution to the entire population of female drug offenders in Taiwan, application of these results to treatment of female drug offenders should be viewed with caution. The third limitation is in regard to outcome comparison. Results from participation of mandated inmates (i.e., which might be characterized by lack of motivation, passive participation, etc.) could not be realistically compared with those of other treatments in which participants were voluntarily involved. In further study, encouraging inmates to participate in the treatment program voluntarily would be an effective way to address this limitation. Fourth, the small size of the substance abuse treatment program in the correctional institution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0306624X11426418">Pearson &amp; Lipton, 1999</xref>) may diminish the statistical power of the results when the purpose of this study was to detect the significant differences between experimental and control groups. For future study, an increased sample size would be desirable to increase statistical power for comparison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0306624X11426418">Sheppard, 1999</xref>). The fifth limitation that should be mentioned is in regard to use of objective scales to collect behavioral data related to knowledge, cognition, and behavior changes in this study. Due to the complexity of drug-related recovery procedures, some of the changes that participants have experienced might be difficult to describe by means of an objective scale. In further study, adding open-end questions, face-to-face interview, observation records, and so on as strategies for data collection would be desirable to maximize the accuracy of the data. The sixth limitation that should be mentioned is in regard to self-report bias. Especially, as the study was conducted in a correctional setting, it might have been difficult for inmates to admit that they had displayed their true insights; they might have felt embarrassed about admitting weakness or been concerned that their personal information could be used against them in court. It was hoped that, by handling participants’ self-report data in a confidential manner, randomly assigning participants in a two group pretest and posttest control group design, and using ANCOVA for data analysis, the rate of accuracy of the responses could be maximized.</p>

<title>Policy Implications</title>
<p>If the results are confirmed by future studies, our findings have the following implications for policy. First, this study indicates that a hope-based drug treatment program can help female drug offenders by strengthening their hope, increasing emotional regulation skills, and empowering self-esteem. Several sources of empirical evidence have indicated that the majority of female drug offenders in their studies suffered from low hope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0306624X11426418">Conrod et al., 2000</xref>), lacked emotional regulation skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306624X11426418">Diamond, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0306624X11426418">Miller &amp; Guidry, 2001</xref>), and had poor self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0306624X11426418">Dodge &amp; Potocky, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0306624X11426418">Messina &amp; Prendergast, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0306624X11426418">Sowards et al., 2006</xref>), and that such problems might block their confidence in recovery and put them at greater risk of relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0306624X11426418">Grella et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, implementation of a hope-based drug treatment program offered on a regular basis should be required in correctional institutions so that the entire population of incarcerated female drug offenders have equal chance to benefit from the program. Furthermore, abundant evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0306624X11426418">Ford &amp; Russo, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0306624X11426418">Ford &amp; Stewart, 1999</xref>) has indicated that it would be more difficult for female drug offenders who have suffered traumatic experiences to build up hope than for those who have not had such experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306624X11426418">Baker, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0306624X11426418">Finnegan &amp; McNally, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306624X11426418">Hiebert-Murphy &amp; Woylkiw, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0306624X11426418">Hien et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0306624X11426418">Koenig, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0306624X11426418">Najavits et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0306624X11426418">Nyamathi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0306624X11426418">Peterson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0306624X11426418">Wu et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, these women should be required to attend a hope-based treatment program as soon as they enter the correctional institution to instill and foster new hope and thus to strengthen the possibility of their recovery. Finally, as resisting the temptation to use drugs and stay sober will be a major challenge when female drug offenders reenter society, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0306624X11426418">Roesch, Duangado, Vaughn, Aldridge, and Villodas (2010)</xref> emphasized the importance of promoting substance abusers’ hope by helping them to utilize better coping strategies to reject the temptation to return to substance usage. Therefore, the correctional institutions should require inmates to complete the hope-based treatment program before they are released. Empowering drug offenders with a clear goal, a better plan, and high energy for recovery will minimize their chance for relapse and optimize the prospects for their recovery.</p>
