<body>
<p><italic>Childism: Confronting Prejudice against Children</italic> is a remarkable and powerful book. Its author, Elisabeth Young-Bruehl, was an accomplished psychoanalyst. At the same time, she was extremely conversant with the social and political history of the mistreatment of children; her research into this history is exhaustive and integrative. Young-Bruehl, a noted and prolific author, has written other books bearing directly on this one, including <italic>The Anatomy of Prejudices</italic> and <italic>Anna Freud: A Biography.</italic> She brings to this book a unique combination of scholarly energy, exhaustive research in the social and political realm, the perspective of an extremely talented clinical analyst, and a keen sense of ethical and moral imperatives. Her death in December 2011 is a great loss.</p>
<p>Young-Bruehl sees childism as occurring when “people as individuals and in societies mistreat children in order to fulfill certain needs through them, to project internal conflicts and self-hatreds outward, or to assert themselves when they feel their authority has been questioned” (p. 1). She makes a compelling and comprehensive argument for the existence of prejudice against children and how to correct it.</p>
<p>I will review <italic>Childism</italic> with an emphasis on the book’s importance for analysts and will show how adult and child analysts bring a perspective that is uniquely useful in correcting the problem of prejudice against children. I will also outline the importance of analysts’ using their unique perspective to make significant contributions not only in their work but in more public settings.</p>
<p>In the introduction Young-Bruehl defines childism: “My first task in this book . . . is to make that word, the term whose definition is ‘prejudice against children,’ a part of our vocabulary and to provide a nuanced, comprehensive definition of it” (p. 4). It is her hope that this will make it possible to reconsider the “huge range of anti-child social policies and individual behaviors directed against all children daily” (p. 4). Yet childism is a complex concept that to me does not seem user-friendly. This makes it less powerful as a term denoting a social problem to be combated. It might be better to use it in a positive sense, as denoting an attitude countering the mistreatment of children and the neglect of their developmental needs.</p>
<p>Young-Bruehl reviews how over the past sixty years harm to children has been rationalized and normalized. It is her hope that childism can “act as an umbrella concept, a heuristic, and a synthesizer, and [that] it can function as a guide for political action” (p. 8). She points out that we can best elucidate the complexities of prejudice against children by listening to children and families in a safe and supportive setting like analysis. Analysts can use their understanding of child development and the challenges of each developmental phase to assess deviations from the optimal treatment of children.</p>
<p>The book’s first chapter, “Anatomy of a Prejudice,” places childism in relation to the field of prejudice studies. In this context she defines childism as “a prejudice against children on the ground of a belief that they are property and can (or even should) be controlled, enslaved, or removed to serve adult needs” (p. 37). This chapter is like a musical overture touching on all the themes to be developed in the ensuing performance, but seems to me too densely packed and lacking organization. Young-Bruehl points out that a unique aspect of prejudice against children is that their very immaturity facilitates negative projections onto them. She notes that studying prejudices like racism, sexism, and anti-Semitism has not been helpful in understanding childism. A central aspect of this failure is the lack of attention to motivation. For instance, what are the motivations when adults make their needs a priority over those of children? However, putting children’s interests first is not as simple as it might seem. For example, child labor stems from the clear economic motivations of adults. But what of the parents of a five-year-old who has separation problems and wants to sleep in the parents’ bed every night? In some cultures this can seem the norm and not be problematic, while in others it can be seen as interfering with the parents’ privacy and sleep and as not allowing the child to separate, become autonomous, and comfort him- or herself.</p>
<p>Young-Bruehl discusses how children are not accorded an identity of their own and are considered their parents’ possession. She describes the projection of rage and murder onto children, who are thus seen as rebellious, powerful, and disruptive. She highlights fantasies that contribute to the mistreatment of children. One of these is being able to “self-reproduce and to own self-reproduced offspring, fantasies about being able to have slaves—usually sex slaves—who are not incest objects, and fantasies about being able to eliminate something felt to be invidious or secretly depleting from within” (p. 35). She points out that people who fear children are also obsessed by them. Parents’ projections are reintrojected and often become part objects within the child that can have a sexual, fetishlike aspect.</p>
<p>Young-Bruehl underscores the enormous importance of dissociation in the lives of children and how not appreciating its extent makes it difficult to understand crucial parts of their experience. She also points out the centrality of the intergenerational transmission of trauma and its complex vicissitudes. Even though trauma and dissociation are well known as psychological phenomena, I believe their effects and complex dynamics are underestimated. In my work I have become ever more aware of the importance of trauma in our therapeutic efforts, including the treatment of psychosis.</p>
<p>The dependency of children, according to Young-Bruehl, is one reason that prejudice against them is not easily recognized and has been rationalized. Dependency and helplessness are central to childhood and when exploited can lead to serious conflict, distress, and compromise later in life. Often overlooked by adults are children’s capacities and how, through play for example, children express the human capacity for spontaneity, creativity, mastery, and renewal.</p>
<p>In chapter 2, “Three Forms of Childism: Anna’s Story,” Young-Bruehl describes in detail the analysis of a woman in her late twenties who experienced sexual, physical, and emotional abuse and neglect. This part of the book is much easier to digest. Young-Bruehl’s sophisticated, nuanced analysis of this patient shows clearly that she brings to this book the perspective of a talented psychoanalyst. Her remarkable work with Anna is alone, as they say, worth the price of admission. Indeed, her account of this treatment should be published in a journal to make it more readily available.</p>
<p>The analysis illuminates the patient’s experience in a cult-like family, as Young-Bruehl presents the patient’s three main abusers as illustrating different aspects of childism: attempted erasure of the child’s identity, use of the child as a sexual toy, and neglect of the child and her elimination as a competitor for attention. Young-Bruehl makes the crucial point in her work with this patient and, in fact, with all patients, that it is essential not to be afraid to discover the extremely painful details and feelings of the complex and unique story the patient is trying to tell. Young-Bruehl demonstrates in a powerful way the importance of the analyst’s observations of her own experience during such a treatment and the centrality of the patient’s use of dissociation and body memories. For example, at one point Young-Bruehl says, “I realized . . . that this conceptualizing was how I contained my initial rage over Anna’s abuse at the hands of her stepbrother, her father, and her stepmother” (p. 85). The analysis of Anna illustrates how the experiences of children who are the object of childism are so excruciatingly painful that not only the patient but also the analyst have difficulty letting themselves experience it. At the end of her analysis Anna said, “Well, I suppose that is what I learned here—talk, talk, talk honestly for as long as you need to. Then you can leave and go on and look for the right person, for real, you know, in reality, really a life. Real person to the real person, no performance” (p. 97).</p>
<p>In the next chapter, “Child Abuse and Neglect: A Study in Confusion,” Young-Bruehl explores how over the past sixty years American society has attempted to deal with issues of childism. Her immersion in the archives of this era is immensely impressive, though I found the density of her review of this complex sociopolitical environment, replete with acronyms, to be daunting and not easily metabolized. I am not sure that this degree of detail is necessary to make the point that prejudice against children is real and relentless, but perhaps the aim was to present a thorough research effort in this area. Young-Bruehl underscores the importance of listening to the stories of children and parents in detail, no matter how painful, in order to devise interventions. She emphasizes how children are asked to provide parents the love and attention they had not received from their own parents and how these children exist to serve their parents’ needs. Again she elaborates the extensive problem of intergenerational transmission of trauma. These are useful points for all adult and child analysts because they sensitize us to the complex forces and effects of childism, even in its less severe forms. For example, how often do we fail to recognize the subtle ways our patients have been asked to take care of their parents at the expense of their own development? How true, in fact, is this of many of us as analysts in relation to our patients? In addition, there is the striking observation of the huge number of children removed into foster families that too often are problematic in their own right. This provides a way of getting children out of society, much as is done in the formation of ghettos. Young-Bruehl argues that child abuse and neglect need to be seen as a disruption of child development, that maltreatment needs to be recognized as the negative end of the continuum of child rearing, and that the positive aspects of child rearing need to be supported.</p>
<p>Young-Bruehl describes how the struggle to deal with sexual abuse has resulted in mass hysteria and the politicization of child abuse. She paints a rich tapestry from which I will emphasize a few salient points bearing on our clinical work. Noting how therapists and researchers often experience apathy and futility in trying to help families where there is neglect and abuse, she points out that these feelings are a direct route to discovering what the children and the perpetrators have experienced in the present (and the perpetrators in their own childhood). She cites books for the general public about childism (such as Louise Armstrong’s <italic>Kiss Daddy Good Nigh</italic>t and <italic>Mommy Dearest</italic>, written by the daughter of Joan Crawford) as illustrating the importance of powerful personal details as a springboard for interventions. These popular accounts, as well as treatments of patients suffering from sexual, physical, and emotional abuse, help the process, now well under way, of overcoming the influence of Freud’s early theories emphasizing the primacy of children’s oedipal and sexual fantasies. The overemphasis on fantasy at the expense of trauma has been more easily eliminated in the work of child analysts, I think, than in that of adult analysts. Perhaps this is due to the immediacy of the trauma in the child’s experience and to the greater freedom that play, action, and enactment bring to child analysis. Young-Bruehl points out that in many early studies of child maltreatment the motivations and beliefs of the adults, which were internalized by the child, were not investigated. Doing so is crucial for our work with children and with the child in our adult patients.</p>
<p>Young-Bruehl emphasizes work done by Terr, citing her article, “Childhood Trauma: An Outline and an Overview” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0003065112465644">1991</xref>), where the symptoms these children present are classified in four categories: (1) strongly visualized or otherwise repeatedly perceived memories that are sometimes repressed so can only be inferred from drawings or games; (2) repetition of traumatization in behavior and stories told and enacted; (3) trauma-specific fears and phobias; (4) the attitude that people cannot be trusted or counted on for protection and a view of the future as painful and full of terror (pp. 222–223). Young-Bruehl adds the important aspect that children look for the motivations behind their mistreatment. This leads to their being internally split, to self-blame and self-traumatization, and to the conclusion that they are bad and unlovable.</p>
<p>Young-Bruehl provides clinical vignettes to illustrate two different types of childism: (1) narcissistic, obsessional-eliminative and (2) hysterical, role-manipulative. In scenarios of the first type, family regimes involve tyranny of the narcissistic parent and erasure of the child’s sense of self. In the second type, boundary violations and invasion of privacy are frequent, the atmosphere is eroticized and sexualized, and attention-seeking and depressive symptoms are seen. Young-Bruehl describes how the manipulated roles may include hero, villain, redemptive child, outlaw, renegade, and replacement child. But these distinctions seem awkward and complexly overlapping. Basically they involve exploitation in terms of assigning roles that are developmentally inappropriate and that erase the child’s spontaneous self. A patient who exemplified this tries to solve the question of whether her mother had intended to neglect her or to eliminate her from the family because she was her father’s daughter or because she didn’t bond to the mother as the other children did.</p>
<p>Young-Bruehl raises the question of whether the prescription of medication and diagnoses such as bipolar disorder are tyrannical ways of getting children to acquiesce. This is a complex question worth raising, but in my experience it is more complicated than presented here. This is true also of her indictment of baby boomers throughout the book. She sees their childism as inflicting great damage on their children. Her view is that the baby boomers’ devotion to causes such as fighting racism and sexism resulted in their seriously overlooking the needs of children. A great value of this book is that it sensitizes all readers, including child and adult analysts, not just to the extreme forms of prejudice against children but also to the more subtle ones. But in making this needed case against childism she fails to recognize that many parents do reasonably well by their children despite their own difficulties. As adult and child analysts we also know in depth parents who struggle with a great range of difficulties (trauma, depression, and many other neurotic and characterological problems) who nevertheless are able to put their children’s issues largely first and foremost.</p>
<p>In the final chapter, “Education and the End of Childism,” Young-Bruehl discusses how we can influence the conditions that provoke, permit, and even encourage childism: “With education comes the creation of programs to repair the damage, secure the progress that has been made, and continue to work to eradicate the prejudice” (p. 268). For this it is crucial to understand child development and the needs of children. As contributions in this area, Young-Bruehl gives credit to Benjamin Spock’s <italic>The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003065112465644">1946</xref>) and to <italic>The Irreducible Needs of Children</italic> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003065112465644">Brazelton and Greenspan (2000)</xref>. Brazelton and Greenspan emphasize the basic needs of every child. This provides a crucial scientific yardstick around which to organize social, political, and therapeutic efforts. This can be helpful in assessing trends in different eras. For example, there is presently a debate about American culture being too child-centered. In Europe a more strict and structured approach is recommended that puts greater emphasis on parents’ interests. Young-Bruehl writes that “parenting practices as well as policy proposals and specific legislation can be evaluated in terms of whether they meet . . . developmental needs. Both in terms of political and legislative processes and in terms of preventive public health policy, the positive focus is clear” (p. 279), which is crucial for the children of the world and for the future.</p>
<p>The value of this book for the practicing adult or child analyst lies not only in the extreme cases of child abuse it presents, but also in its illumination of more subtle prejudice against children. It helps sensitize us in our daily work. Analysts provide crucial contributions to understanding the deep developmental unfolding of children and the importance of their conflicts, their defenses, and their deepest feelings and fantasies. Analysts understand the great impact of childhood on subsequent adult life. This book reminds us of the ongoing challenge and essential importance of being open to exploring the great areas of pain and distress in our child and adult patients’ lives and, together with this, the pain in our own lives.</p>
<p>This is an important book for analysts. It is tempting to close off our painful feelings for many reasons, including our unique character, history, defenses, and intense countertransference. Many of us work largely in a dyadic situation in our offices and in small groups in our analytic teaching. Many of us, I believe, are anxious about being more involved in larger settings. Nevertheless, I think this book successfully argues that it is essential that we stretch ourselves to share our knowledge of the powerful and unique details presented by our child patients and the child within the adults we treat. This requires working in many settings. It is also essential that we recognize the work of analysts doing psychotherapy and of those working in the many other areas benefiting children. We need to collaborate with people who conduct behavioral therapy, psychopharmacology, and school and residential treatments, as well as with those working in community and political settings. An essential part of this is to join these groups as a colleague, one who listens carefully and does not presume to have greater knowledge than others, and thereby to form a working alliance. We need to recognize the importance of being knowledgeable about other interventions in childhood, of collaborating with those who provide them, and of knowing how to organize them to facilitate a child’s development.</p>
