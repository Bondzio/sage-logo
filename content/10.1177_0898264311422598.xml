<body>
<p>It is widely understood that falls in older adults (65+) have serious implications for their health, mortality, and quality of life. Having had a fall often leads to a fear of falling (FF) in this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0898264311422598">Scheffer, Schuurmans, van Dijk, van der Hooft, &amp; de Rooij, 2008</xref>). One potential consequence of a FF is activity restriction. Estimates of the prevalence of activity restriction due to a FF (hereafter referred to as “AR/FF”) range from 19% to 60% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898264311422598">Curcio, Gomez, &amp; Reyes-Ortiz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898264311422598">Deshpande et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898264311422598">Fletcher &amp; Hirdes, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898264311422598">Fletcher, Guthrie, Berg, &amp; Hirdes, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0898264311422598">Jang, Cho, Oh, Lee, &amp; Baik, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898264311422598">Kempen, van Haastregt, McKee, Delbaere, &amp; Zijlstra, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898264311422598">Murphy, Williams, &amp; Gill, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0898264311422598">Wilson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0898264311422598">Zijlstra et al., 2007</xref>). This has important implications as AR/FF is related to lower levels of performance in activities of daily living (ADLs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898264311422598">Curcio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898264311422598">Deshpande et al., 2008b</xref>), reduced mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898264311422598">Deshpande et al., 2008b</xref>), and falls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898264311422598">Curcio et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Several studies have examined different types of medications and the risk of falls in community-dwelling older adults. For example, the risk is increased among those taking benzodiazepines (BZDs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898264311422598">Ensrud et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0898264311422598">Leipzig, Cumming, &amp; Tinetti, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0898264311422598">Souchet, Lapeyre-Mestre, &amp; Montastruc, 2005</xref>), antidepressants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898264311422598">Kelly et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0898264311422598">Leipzig et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0898264311422598">Souchet et al., 2005</xref>), cardiac medications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0898264311422598">Souchet et al., 2005</xref>), narcotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898264311422598">Ensrud et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898264311422598">Kelly et al., 2003</xref>), and anticonvulsants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898264311422598">Ensrud et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898264311422598">Kelly et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Some medications have also been linked to an increased risk of fracture and other injuries. In particular, BZDs have been found to slightly increase the risk of femur fracture among nursing home residents(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0898264311422598">Sgadari et al., 2000</xref>) and to elevate the risk of various types of injuries, including fractures, sprains, strains, and contusions, among veterans attending an outpatient medical clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0898264311422598">French, Campbell, Spehar, &amp; Angarn, 2005</xref>). Some research has also shown that older adults (aged 50+) taking a particular type of antidepressant, namely selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), had twice the risk of experiencing a fragility fracture (e.g., fracture caused by minor trauma such as falling from a bed or a chair; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0898264311422598">Richards et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The literature linking falls and medication use has been limited by several methodological issues. For example, a recent systematic review identified that many studies have failed to explicitly outline how they define a “fall,” medications have not been categorized using a standardized therapeutic classification system (e.g., Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical system developed by World Health Organization) and several confounding variables, such as age and sex, have been inadequately adjusted for in multivariate analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898264311422598">Hartikainen, Lonnroos, &amp; Louhivuori, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, some studies have failed to consider confounding by indication, which assesses the degree to which the risk of falls is related to underlying comorbid conditions as opposed to the therapeutic drug regimen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898264311422598">Daal &amp; van Lieshout, 2005</xref>). The presence of certain chronic health conditions may be more important than medication use as a risk for falling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0898264311422598">Lawlor, Patel, &amp; Ebrahim, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Although it is well understood that certain medications increase the risk of falls, little is known about the use of medications and AR/FF. From a clinical point of view, it is conceivable that persons taking certain medications and experiencing more falls and/or symptoms that put them at risk of falling (e.g., dizziness) may limit their activities due to an AR/FF. Polypharmacy has been shown as an important risk factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898264311422598">Curcio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0898264311422598">Jang et al., 2007</xref>) and in one study; the risk was increased among those taking drugs to treat depression or anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898264311422598">Austin, Devine, Dick, Prince, &amp; Bruce, 2007</xref>). It is not well understood whether certain classes of medications are independently associated with an increased risk of AR/FF and how previous falls and other risk factors for falling influence this relationship.</p>
<p>The current article attempts to address several of the limitations in the current literature by assessing the unique contribution of different classes of medications, while taking into account important confounding variables, including the presence of various chronic health conditions, as they relate to AR/FF. We hypothesized that certain classes of medications, known to increase the risk of falling (e.g., BZDs, antidepressants), would increase the risk of AR/FF in this sample of community-dwelling older adults after controlling for other established risk factors for falling.</p>
<sec id="section1-0898264311422598" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The current project represents secondary analysis of data collected during five independent intervention studies on falls among older adults in the community. The methods have been described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898264311422598">Fletcher, Berg, Dalby, &amp; Hirdes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898264311422598">Fletcher et al., 2010</xref>). Briefly, each of the sites were individually funded, set their own inclusion criteria, and determined the data collection procedures and instruments to be used. However, as part of the current project, each site was also required to collect additional assessments for each participant. The research teams from each site oversaw subject recruitment and all data submitted were stripped of unique identifiers. As such, additional ethics approval was not required for the analyses of combined data sets.</p>
<p>Five sites recruited older adults (typically those aged 65+) for a falls intervention program. The nature of each program varied in intensity and approach. Some projects simply provided information to study participants whereas others offered a more intense and multifactoral intervention.</p>
<p>Research assistants (RAs) within each site were trained to complete an early version of the interRAI Community Health Assessment (CHA). This assessment tool was designed by interRAI (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.interrai.org">www.interrai.org</ext-link>), a not-for-profit research network, of more than 30 countries, whose focus is on the development and testing of assessment systems to improve the quality of life and delivery of services for vulnerable populations including older persons and persons with disabilities. The interRAI CHA captures basic demographic background as well as detailed information across 13 domains, including activities of daily (ADLs), instrumental ADLs, social functioning, mental health, and pain. In Ontario, interRAI assessment tools have been mandated by the provincial government in the home care sector, in complex continuing care facilities and phased implementation is currently ongoing in all long-term care homes.</p>
<p>Training in the use of the interRAI CHA was led by an experienced clinical educator affiliated with the University of Waterloo. The RAs were given detailed instructions for coding of each item as outlined in the training manual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0898264311422598">Morris et al., 2006</xref>). Each participant was assessed twice, both prior to (baseline assessment) and following (reassessment) the site-specific intervention. The average time between assessments was 249.7 days (<italic>SD</italic> = 138.4).</p>
<sec id="section2-0898264311422598">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>The interRAI CHA contains approximately 150 items that represent a subset of the larger interRAI Home Care Instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0898264311422598">Morris et al., 1999</xref>). The main dependent variable, activity restriction due to an AR/FF, was captured with a single dichotomous item: “Person limits going outdoors due to a fear of falling (e.g., stopped using bus, goes out only with others”; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0898264311422598">Morris et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Although not included in the core items on the interRAI CHA, two other questions were added and were taken verbatim from items include in the interRAI Home Care Instrument. One question assessed the person’s ability to walk a quarter of a mile (about three blocks) and was coded from 0 (<italic>no difficulty</italic>) to 3 (<italic>completely unable</italic>). The second question rated their ability to navigate stairs and was coded as 0 (<italic>up and down stair without help</italic>), 1 (<italic>up and down stairs with help</italic>) or 2 (<italic>did not go up and down stairs</italic>).</p>
<p>A number of health subscales can be generated from the interRAI CHA. The Cognitive Performance Scale (CPS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0898264311422598">Morris et al., 1994</xref>) ranges from 0 to 6 (higher scores indicate greater cognitive impairment) and has been validated against the Mini-Mental State Examination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0898264311422598">Hartmaier et al., 1995</xref>). The Depression Rating Scale (DRS) assesses depressive symptoms and a score of three or higher is typically used as a cut-off predictive of psychiatrist ratings and clinical thresholds used with the Hamilton and Cornell Scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0898264311422598">Martin et al., 2008</xref>). The Activities of Daily Living Self-performance Hierarchy Scale (ADL SHS) uses four ADL items and rates individuals from 0 to 6, with a higher score indicating a greater need for assistance. Its reliability and validity have been previously established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0898264311422598">Morris, Fries, &amp; Morris, 1999</xref>). The Changes in Health End-stage Disease Signs and Symptoms (CHESS) scale was developed to detect health instability. Higher scores on the CHESS are associated with reduced survival over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898264311422598">Armstrong, Stolee, Hirdes, &amp; Poss, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0898264311422598">Hirdes, Frijters, &amp; Teare, 2003</xref>). The Pain Scale uses two items to create a score that ranges from 0 (<italic>no pain</italic>) to 3 (<italic>severe daily pain</italic>) and has been shown to be highly predictive of pain on the Visual Analogue Scale in nursing home residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898264311422598">Fries, Simon, Morris, Flodstrom, &amp; Bookstein, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Each person was also assessed with the Berg Balance Scale. This scale includes 14 items that represent typical daily activities (e.g., sitting, standing) and generates a score from 0 to 56, with a higher score indicating better performance. The scale has been previously validated in older individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0898264311422598">Muir, Berg, Chesworth, &amp; Speechley, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Assessors recorded all medications taken within the previous week, including both prescription and over-the-counter preparations. The assessors were trained to use all information available to them, including reviewing the labels on pill bottles, asking the person or family member directly, and/or contacting the family physician or pharmacist as needed. The drug order date was not captured. Medications considered as risk factors for falling or AR/FF was coded into four mutually exclusive therapeutic classes: (a) nervous system active medications (e.g., benzodiazepines, antidepressants); (b) analgesics (e.g., nonopioid analgesics, including nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, opioid analgesics); (c) cardiovascular medications (e.g., anticoagulants, antihypertensives); and (d) diuretics. These classes were based on a modification to the American Hospital Formulary System (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898264311422598">American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, 2006</xref>) and coding of each drug was led by a physician (EW).</p>
<p>Participants taking at least one of the medications in a given category were included in that category (i.e., presence vs. absence of taking any drug within the category) regardless of the frequency or dose. The only exception was in the case of low dose aspirin (81 mg per day) which was coded as an anticoagulant (Category 3), and higher doses of aspirin, were included with analgesics (Category 2; nonopioid analgesic).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0898264311422598">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Because of concerns about data quality, one site (<italic>n</italic> = 150) was removed prior to data analysis. The participants from this site were significantly more likely to be female (92.4% vs. 67.1%; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001), to be divorced/widowed/never married (17.4% vs. 7.4%; <italic>p</italic> = .003), were less likely to report AR/FF (12.9% vs. 30.1%; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001), and were significantly younger (mean age: 70.4 years vs. 79.5; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001). The final sample included 571 individuals, of whom, 441 (77.2%) participants had nonmissing data for the main outcome on reassessment. The lack of outcome data on reassessment reflects the voluntary nature of the study and the fact that we had virtually no control over data collection and follow-up with study participants.</p>
<p>All explanatory variables and potential confounders were measured using the baseline assessment. The Pearson’s chi-square test was used for categorical variables and the Student <italic>t</italic>-test for continuous variables to assess the bivariate (unadjusted) relationship between outcome variables, explanatory variables, and potential confounders. An alpha level of .05 (two-tailed) was used in all cases.</p>
<p>Multivariate logistic regression models were created to examine the influence of medication use after controlling for other potential explanatory variables. Variables considered as potential covariates included: age, sex, marital status, site, number and specific type of comorbid health conditions, Berg Balance Scale score, and scores on each of the CPS, DRS, ADL SHS, CHESS Scale, and Pain Scale, stair climbing, previous falls, poor self-rated health, dizziness, presence of environmental home hazards, vision impairment, ability to walk a quarter of a mile, loneliness, distress related to a decline in participation in social activities, the presence of any psychiatric diagnosis (single item), and each therapeutic class of drug. Specific subclasses of drugs (e.g., benzodiazepines) were only included if at least 10% of participants were taking these medications.</p>
<p>A variety of modeling techniques were used, including forward selection, backward elimination, and stepwise methods, to rule out order effects prior to specification of the final model. Only the covariates that were significantly related to the dependent measure (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) were examined in the multivariate models. Once the final multivariate model was specified, those candidate variables which had been significant at the bivariate level were then individually entered into the final model in order to assess whether they would remain significant or change the contribution of the existing covariates. This was done to eliminate the possibility of covariates being dropped from the model due to order effects in the stepwise procedures.</p>
<p>Logit plots were created for all continuous and ordinal variables and indicated that four covariates should be entered as discrete variables, namely, marital status, age, ADL SHS and number of health conditions. In the final model, all two-way interactions were considered but none were statistically significant. Multicollinearity in the final model was assessed using the variance inflation factor (VIF), whereby a score of 2.5 or higher was considered indicative of multicollinearity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0898264311422598">Allison, 2001</xref>). All analyses were completed using SAS version 9.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0898264311422598">SAS Institute Inc., 2001</xref>).</p>

<p>Participants with AR/FF were significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 in all cases) more likely to be taking multiple medications, to have three or more coexisting health conditions, to be experiencing unsteady gait, to have had two or more recent falls, to have a vision impairment, to being showing signs or symptoms of depression, to have ADL impairments, to have moderate to severe health instability, and to have moderate to severe pain. The study site was also significantly related to AR/FF (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001) with the prevalence ranging from 2.3 to 41.1% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0898264311422598">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The most prevalent type of medication used was cardiovascular medications (66.9%), followed by analgesics (51.7%), nervous system active (NSA) medications (30.8%) and last, diuretics (11.1%; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0898264311422598">Table 2</xref>). Individuals who reported AR/FF were significantly more likely to be taking any NSA medication (<italic>p</italic> = .003) or any cardiovascular medication (<italic>p</italic> = .001). Individuals who were taking any type of NSA medication, any type of cardiovascular drug or any type of analgesic had a significantly lower (i.e., worse performance) score on the Berg Balance Scale (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 in all cases). Across the four classes of medications, age was a significant factor only for cardiovascular medications, such that those taking any of these drugs were significantly older than those who were not (81.0 years vs. 79.0; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Among those taking any NSA medications, they were significantly more likely to be female (75.7% vs. 62.6%; <italic>p</italic> = .007). Gender was nonsignificant across the other drug classes. Participants taking any NSA drug were also significantly more likely to have multiple falls in the previous 90 days (17.7% vs. 9.9%; <italic>p</italic> = .0006). Previous falls was not related to the other classes of medications (data not shown).</p>

<p>In a preliminary model (Model 1 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0898264311422598">Table 3</xref>), several demographic characteristics were not significant predictors of AR/FF, including age, sex, and marital status. The same was found for the number of previous falls as well as each of the four therapeutic classes of medications. After adjusting for these variables, the covariates that were statistically important included: having three or more comorbid health conditions (OR = 1.78), needing assistance with stairs (OR = 3.52), the presence of a visual impairment (1.87), and having a lower score on the Berg Balance Scale (0.73). In the final multivariate model, which included only these four significant covariates (Model 2), the odds ratios remained quite stable when compared to Model 1. The Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness-of-fit chi-square was not significant (<italic>p</italic> = .73), suggesting an adequate fit of the model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0898264311422598">Hosmer &amp; Lemeshow, 2000</xref>). Furthermore, the variance inflation factor was less than 1.75 in all cases, suggesting that multicollinearity was not present.</p>

<p>In this project, 29% of adults limited their outdoor activities due to a fear of falling. This is consistent with other studies among community-dwelling seniors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898264311422598">Fletcher et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0898264311422598">Jang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898264311422598">Murphy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0898264311422598">Zijlstra et al., 2007</xref>) and those receiving home care services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898264311422598">Fletcher &amp; Hirdes, 2004</xref>), but significantly lower than that reported in two previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898264311422598">Curcio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898264311422598">Deshpande et al., 2008b</xref>). This is likely a reflection of the definition of activity restriction. This article used a more global definition of outdoor activities captured with a single question, whereas other research, reporting a higher prevalence, measured activity restriction across a number of specific activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898264311422598">Deshpande et al., 2008b</xref>).</p>
<p>A key objective of this project was to assess the role of specific medications in predicting AR/FF. At the bivariate level, both central nervous system active (NSA) drugs and cardiovascular medications were important predictors. In addition, NSA drugs were related to an increased number of falls and three classes of medications, namely NSA drugs, cardiovascular drugs, and analgesics, were associated with worse performance on the Berg Balance Scale. Other research has shown an important role for antipsychotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898264311422598">Fletcher &amp; Hirdes, 2004</xref>) or for other NSA drugs to treat depression or anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898264311422598">Austin et al., 2007</xref>) in the risk of AR/FF. However, after adjusting for other covariates, these classes of medications were nonsignificant. This may be due to the sample size of the study and the limited number of participants who were taking specific types of medications, such as antipsychotics. These results may also reflect the fact that medications, although associated with AR/FF, may have a more indirect effect through changes to one’s risk of falling (e.g., through symptoms such as dizziness) that are difficult to detect without extensive longitudinal data that better map out the sequential changes that occur following the implementation of certain medications.</p>
<p>Our study confirms the importance of visual impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898264311422598">Curcio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898264311422598">Fletcher &amp; Hirdes, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898264311422598">Murphy et al., 2002</xref>) and difficulties with balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898264311422598">Deshpande et al., 2008b</xref>) as important independent predictors of AR/FF. Requiring assistance in navigating stairs was also an important predictor and has not been reported in other studies. Having multiple coexisting health conditions was also important, and has been infrequently shown to be a risk factor in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898264311422598">Murphy et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Depression has also been previously reported as a predictor of this outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898264311422598">Austin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898264311422598">Curcio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898264311422598">Deshpande et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898264311422598">Murphy et al., 2002</xref>). The current analysis also found, at the bivariate level, an increased likelihood of AR/FF among clients with signs or symptoms of depression and among those taking antidepressant medications. The presence of symptoms of depression, however, was not important in the final multivariate model. The single item on the interRAI CHA indicates the presence of any psychiatric diagnosis, so we were unable to examine the diagnosis of depression on its own. However, given the high prevalence of the use of antidepressants (18% in our sample), it is likely that depression was the main psychiatric diagnosis.</p>
<p>A decline in social activities, with perceived distress on the part of the person, was associated with the main outcome variable. Although measured somewhat differently, other studies have also found that measure of social isolation, such as living alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898264311422598">Austin et al., 2007</xref>) or being alone for long periods of time in a day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898264311422598">Fletcher &amp; Hirdes, 2004</xref>) are associated with AR/FF. Given the fact that depression appears to be related to activity restriction, this suggests that AR/FF may be a key indicator of more global restrictions in one’s activities. Activity restriction may reflect a process whereby older adults become more socially isolated and in turn, begin experiencing signs of depression. Alternatively, it may be that depression, and subsequent lack of motivation and/or lack of confidence, may lead to activity restriction.</p>
<p>One clear departure from the current evidence is the lack of an independent association between AR/FF and previous falls. Multiple studies have shown falls to be an important risk factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898264311422598">Austin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898264311422598">Curcio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898264311422598">Fletcher &amp; Hirdes, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898264311422598">Fletcher et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0898264311422598">Zijlstra et al., 2007</xref>) and only one did not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0898264311422598">Jang et al., 2007</xref>). In the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898264311422598">Murphy et al. (2002)</xref>, only injurious falls were associated with activity restriction. We did, however, show falls to be important at the bivariate level but the item did not remain significant after adjusting for factors such as difficulties with navigating stairs and difficulties with balance.</p>
<p>Neither age nor sex was important, after adjusting for other important covariates. There are mixed findings in the current literature with some studies reporting older age as important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898264311422598">Kempen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898264311422598">Murphy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0898264311422598">Zijlstra et al., 2007</xref>) and others, reporting a non-significant relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898264311422598">Austin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0898264311422598">Jang et al., 2007</xref>). Being female has typically been seen to increase the risk of AR/FF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898264311422598">Fletcher &amp; Hirdes, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898264311422598">Kempen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898264311422598">Murphy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0898264311422598">Zijlstra et al., 2007</xref>). However, in at least one study, adjusting for AR/FF removed the effect of gender on activity restriction, suggesting that fear was the key factor as opposed to being female per se (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898264311422598">Deshpande et al., 2008a</xref>).</p>
<p>One limitation to this study is the fact that the participants represent a nonrandom convenience sample of volunteers. As such, it is likely that their risk profile, for falling and AR/FF, is different from the larger population of seniors in Ontario. This could, at least in part, explain the lack of consistency between this project and previous research, as it relates to risk factors such as age, sex, and previous falls.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have chosen activity restriction, a behavioral outcome, as the main dependent variable. Although we can explore the relationship between activity restriction and a host of clinical and functional risk factors, the cross-sectional nature of the data do not allow for a full exploration of how medication use may lead to changes in symptoms related to falls, such as dizziness or unsteady gait, which may increase the risk of falls which, if a fall takes place, may then result in activity restriction. As such, the current findings cannot easily shed light on the causal pathway linking certain medications, and the diagnoses for which they were prescribed, with changes in psychosocial and behavioral outcomes. Future research using a prospective cohort design would be better able to address these limitations.</p>
<p>A longitudinal design would also be able to address the fact that the interRAI CHA does not include the date the medication was ordered. The cross-sectional nature of this study makes it difficult to clearly determine cause and effect when looking at medication use. Given that the interRAI CHA is scheduled to be mandated for all community support services in Ontario, this type of analysis may soon be feasible.</p>
<p>The use of the interRAI CHA represents a significant strength of this project given its multidimensional nature and the fact that it will soon be the assessment of choice across the province. With data such as these, we have been able to study a broad range of covariates related not only to demographic characteristics but also to physical performance, functional status, and psychosocial factors. As has been demonstrated, understanding AR/FF is a complex issue that cannot be explained simply by looking at physical performance in areas such as vision, walking, or gait. There appears to be a psychosocial component related to social isolation and depression that should be explored further in a more rigorous study that includes a larger sample size than in the current project.</p>
<p>For clinicians, and those serving older adults in the community, understanding what contributes to activity restriction can have a positive effect on the quality of life and health of their clients. As we have shown, certain classes of medications (e.g., nervous system active and cardiovascular medications) are related, on their own, to AR/FF. However, there are other modifiable risk factors (e.g., impaired vision, difficulties with balance) that appear to be more important in predicting activity restriction due to an AR/FF than medications. By recognizing how these modifiable factors may lead to activity restriction, which in turn may result in feelings of social isolation or depression, there is an important opportunity to identify seniors at risk early in this process. Early identification can ideally result in timely intervention. Given the importance of balance as a risk factor, prevention efforts should incorporate opportunities to increase capacity in areas such as balance, strength, and endurance.</p>
<p>If the appropriate programs and interventions are put into place that enable older adults to be more active, improve their balance, be less fearful and be engaged socially, there is the strong potential to reduce the likelihood of negative outcomes such as falling or developing an AR/FF.</p>
