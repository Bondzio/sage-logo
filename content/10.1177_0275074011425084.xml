<abstract>
<p>Teleworking is the most common alternative work schedule used in public organizations. Despite the adoption of teleworking in government agencies, no studies were found that empirically examined the effect it has on retention in these agencies. This article therefore extends the literature by examining the impact of teleworking on turnover intentions in U.S. federal agencies. In so doing, the findings suggest that teleworking did not exact a social exchange in public agencies. That is, teleworkers and nonteleworkers reported similar intentions to quit implying that telecommuting should not be used by managers and organizations “solely” to reduce the turnover of government employees. Furthermore, an examination of each of the teleworking and nonteleworking arrangements revealed that government workers were more likely to report a leave intention when they were denied the opportunity to telecommute. As a result, this finding validates the social denial hypothesis. The managerial and theoretical implications of these findings are thoroughly discussed in the article.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Public organizations have searched for ways to improve the performance of workers. As research indicates “that the activities and experiences in the family domain can influence employee experiences and productivity within the work domain” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0275074011425084">Facer &amp; Wadsworth, 2008</xref>, p. 166), agencies have reacted by adopting family-friendly policies, which refer to programs that help employees better manage the demands of work and personal obligations. Hence, these policies assist employees in attaining work-life balance.</p>
<p>One such category of programs subsumed under family-friendly policies that is gaining in popularity is to move away from the traditional 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday work schedule and offer employees alternative work schedules (AWSs) instead. In general, AWSs, which include such work arrangements as teleworking, flextime, job sharing, and a compressed workweek, allow work schedules to be negotiated and modified in a manner that balances the needs of the organization with those of the employees. Thus, AWS gives employees more control over, and flexibility with, their work schedules.</p>
<p>Teleworking, in particular, is the most common type of AWS affording workers the opportunity to “periodically, regularly, or exclusively perform work for their employers from home or another remote location that is equipped with the appropriate computer based technology to transfer work to the central organization” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0275074011425084">Hunton &amp; Norman, 2010</xref>, p. 67). Yet despite the adoption of teleworking in government agencies, no studies were found that empirically examined the effect it has on retention in these agencies.</p>
<p>The present study extends the literature by examining the impact of teleworking on turnover intentions in the U.S. federal agencies. Examining this association is important, because turnover affects costs (separation, recruitment, training, and productivity; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0275074011425084">Moynihan &amp; Landuyt, 2008</xref>), organizational performance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0275074011425084">Meier &amp; Hicklin, 2008</xref>), and employee morale (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0275074011425084">Rainey, 2003</xref>). Organizations also have adopted this flexible arrangement, because they wanted to reduce turnover and its effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0275074011425084">Karnowski &amp; White, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0275074011425084">Martinez-Sanchez, Perez-Perez, de-Luis-Carnicer, &amp; Vela-Jimenez, 2007</xref>). And, as no studies have examined this effect in government, we do not know the extent to which teleworking achieved this promised benefit in the public sector.</p>
<p>To examine the association between telework and turnover, the article is structured in the following manner. First is an explanation of teleworking and its outcomes. Second, the hypotheses are developed from administrative literature. The third section explains the methodology and survey measures. Fourth are the results of the tested model. Last, the results and their implications are discussed followed by the conclusion.</p>

<sec id="section2-0275074011425084">
<title>Teleworking</title>
<p>Teleworking, also called telecommuting (used synonymously with teleworking in this article), e-working, or virtual working, involves an agreement, whereby employees are allowed to work a few hours a week or full time at a location other than the traditional office. Although variation exists, employees are typically excluded from teleworking when their duties have to be performed at the traditional office, and when they have violated specific absentee, ethical, and performance standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0275074011425084">Manoochehri &amp; Pinkerton, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0275074011425084">U.S. Office of Personnel Management [OPM], 2011</xref>). Generally, telecommuting entails fitting employee residences with communication technologies that allow them to perform some portion of their work from home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0275074011425084">Belanger &amp; Allport, 2008</xref>). In other words, the work location is moved to employee residences. However, teleworking is also frequently done outside of employee homes. In many cases, regional satellite facilities are established by employers, closer to where workers live. Such locations are popular, because employees are afforded with the same amenities as traditional offices (e.g., offices, workstations, desks), and employees are able to interact with one another in the same manner they would at the traditional office. Therefore, the isolation some employees experience while working exclusively from home is diminished when they work at regional telecommuting centers. Similar to employee residences, this type of location also results in lower commute times and organizational-related costs than working at the main office (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0275074011425084">Mello, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, teleworkers can sometimes work from any remote location—meaning employees can work from virtually anywhere. For instance, employees can work from such appealing and relaxed settings as cafes and libraries. Frequent travelers can even perform their duties at airports, hotels, or while in trains. And, a parent can work from their automobile as they wait for their child to finish their extracurricular activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0275074011425084">Whittle &amp; Mueller, 2009</xref>). Hence, teleworkers have the flexibility to choose when and where to work as well as the ability to better manage their work and family obligations.</p>
<p>Although telecommuting began in the 1970s as a result of the energy crisis, many barriers hindered its widespread acceptance including low-speed modems, which made communicating extremely slow, large and expensive computer hardware that exceeded what organizations could afford, and lack of support and trust from managers—that is, they did not believe they could properly manage teleworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0275074011425084">Baruch, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0275074011425084">Martinez-Sanchez et al., 2007</xref>). In the 1990s, many of these barriers were removed making remote work much more practical, thereby causing telecommuting to proliferate. The U.S. government also played an important part in the adoption of telework by requiring organizations to comply with the 1990 Clean Air Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0275074011425084">Karnowski &amp; White, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Since the 1990s, the U.S. Congress has continued to support this flexible arrangement by passing several laws, with the most significant being the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 1993, which mandated the utilization of telework in the executive branch. More specifically, this law “required each federal agency to establish a policy under which eligible employees of the agency may participate in telecommuting to the maximum extent possible without diminished employee performance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0275074011425084">U.S. General Accounting Office [GAO], 2003</xref>, p. 9). The executive branch also joined the efforts to support this flexible work arrangement by establishing a pilot program in the early 1990s and, more recently, by instituting measures to increase the percentage of employees that telework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0275074011425084">GAO, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>To gauge the effectiveness of these efforts, 102,900 employees telecommuted in executive agencies in 2008 representing 5.24% of the entire workforce and 8.67% of the population that was eligible (OPM, 2009). Despite the rather low percentages, the number of federal teleworkers has been steadily increasing. From 2007 to 2008, for example, the percentage of workers taking part in this arrangement increased by 8.72%, and 61% of all agencies indicated that their total numbers increased (OPM, 2009). Even though teleworking has increased as a result of federal efforts, the proportion remains low, primarily due to managerial resistance to change—that is, “a shift from managing by observation to managing by results” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0275074011425084">GAO, 2003</xref>, p. 48).</p>
<sec id="section3-0275074011425084">
<title>Outcomes of Teleworking</title>
<p>Telecommuting has several presumed employee-related benefits. Teleworking assists employees in balancing work and life, because they often work from home, affording them more time to attend to family needs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0275074011425084">Caillier, (2012)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0275074011425084">Maruyama, Hopkinson, &amp; James, 2009</xref>). As employees can work from home or at a regional center that is closer to their residence, travel costs are also much lower. In addition, telecommuting assists compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act in that telework is the only way many disabled individuals can work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0275074011425084">Mello, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Telecommuting also has organizational benefits. Research indicates that workers felt their job performance was positively affected by teleworking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0275074011425084">Major, Verive, &amp; Joice, 2008</xref>), and that CEOs and HR managers believed it increased organizational productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0275074011425084">Martinez-Sanchez et al., 2007</xref>). Why did productivity increase? Teleworkers have been found to work longer hours owing to fewer office-related interruptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0275074011425084">Manoochehri &amp; Pinkerton, 2003</xref>) and fewer sick days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0275074011425084">Crandall &amp; Gao, 2005</xref>). Another organizational benefit is that telecommuting can lower agency expenses. For instance, it has been found to reduce costs associated with overhead and training by 35% and 25%, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0275074011425084">Major et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, telecommuting benefits society. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0275074011425084">U.S. Department of Transportation (2006)</xref> indicated that telework can reduce air pollution, automobile accidents, and energy consumption. Furthermore, the agency noted that it can also reduce costs associated with maintaining such infrastructure as roads and bridges. In the event of a natural or man-made disaster, organizations can even continue to operate when employees telecommute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0275074011425084">Mello, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these many benefits, telework has several disadvantages. Although proponents promote its ability to assist workers in managing work and life, telecommuting can actually have a negative effect on work-life balance. For instance, home becomes the office when telecommuting is done exclusively from residences, perhaps causing work to interfere with family obligations or vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0275074011425084">Baruch, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0275074011425084">Mirchandani, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0275074011425084">Tietze &amp; Musson, 2005</xref>). Teleworkers also frequently feel isolated from face-to-face office interactions, and that their absence will cause them to be passed over for promotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0275074011425084">Khaifa &amp; Davidson, 2000</xref>). From the organization’s perspective, several shortcomings emerge as well. Specifically, teleworkers are more difficult to manage, teleworking can compromise sensitive information, teleworking reduces teamwork, and organizations lose control over safety issues when employees telework (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0275074011425084">Crandall &amp; Gao, 2005</xref>). With that backdrop, following is a discussion of telecommuting and employee intentions to leave.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0275074011425084">
<title>Teleworking and Turnover Intentions</title>
<p>Turnover, a conscious and intentional eagerness to leave an organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0275074011425084">McNall, Masuda, &amp; Nicklin, 2010</xref>), is a major concern to public organizations, because recruiting and training employees can increase costs and decrease organizational performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0275074011425084">Brown, Garino, &amp; Martin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0275074011425084">Moynihan &amp; Landuyt, 2008</xref>). Because of these concerns, the GAO has addressed the impacts of executive agency turnover in 262 reports to Congress<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0275074011425084">1</xref></sup> causing the executive branch to develop and implement human capital strategies specifically designed to limit turnover. In particular, the OPM has been tasked with this responsibility in the executive branch providing ongoing guidance to agencies on how to increase retention.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0275074011425084">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of course, actual turnover and turnover intentions are not identical. Nevertheless, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0275074011425084">Dalton, Johnson, and Daily (1999)</xref> reviewed results from five meta-analyses and found correlations between turnover intentions and actual turnover to range from .31 to .52. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0275074011425084">Vandenberg and Nelson (1999)</xref> also asserted that turnover intentions are one of the best predictors of actual turnover, despite the variation among studies. Moreover, turnover intent is frequently used as a surrogate for actual turnover in public administration literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0275074011425084">Bertelli, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0275074011425084">Bright, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0275074011425084">Kim, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0275074011425084">Lee &amp; Jimenez, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0275074011425084">Lee &amp; Whitford, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0275074011425084">Moynihan &amp; Landuyt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0275074011425084">Naff &amp; Crum, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0275074011425084">Wilson, 1994</xref>) with some advantages being,

<sec id="section5-0275074011425084">
<title>Social Exchange Theory</title>
<p>Social exchange theory has frequently been used to explain certain employee-employer interactions. According to this theory which was derived from public choice theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0275074011425084">Anderfuhren-Biget, Varone, Giauque, &amp; Ritz, 2010</xref>) and the norm of reciprocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0275074011425084">Gouldner, 1960</xref>), workers will feel obligated to reciprocate in ways that are important to the organization after they perceive they are given a favorable benefit. Moreover, for employees to reciprocate, the benefit must be voluntary and based on discretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0275074011425084">Blau, 1964</xref>). Several examples of favorable benefits that activate the norm of reciprocity are training and development programs, empowerment, and managerial support (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0275074011425084">Gould-Williams &amp; Davies, 2007</xref>). Another such benefit that triggers reciprocation is telecommuting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0275074011425084">Martinez-Sanchez et al., 2007</xref>), because it is discretionary and assists workers in balancing work and life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0275074011425084">Bailey &amp; Kurland, 2002</xref>). Therefore, teleworkers perceive their supervisors are helping them manage work and life, causing them to want to remain, because they are compelled to do so based on the norm of reciprocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0275074011425084">Duxbury, Higgins, &amp; Neufeld, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0275074011425084">Gadjendran &amp; Harrison, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0275074011425084">Golden, 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0275074011425084">Hornung, Rousseau, &amp; Glaser, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0275074011425084">Hunton &amp; Norman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0275074011425084">Martinez-Sanchez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0275074011425084">Scandura &amp; Lankau, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Although none were found in the public sector, studies in the private sector have found a connection between telework and turnover. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0275074011425084">Gadjendran and Harrison (2007)</xref> performed a meta-analysis on 46 studies and found that telecommuting led to lower leave intentions. Thus, support was found for the social exchange hypothesis, even after controlling for other antecedents of turnover. Furthermore, a decade-long study at the Institute for the Study of Distributed Work found that well-implemented telework programs can reduce employee turnover by 20% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0275074011425084">Major et al., 2008</xref>), also supporting this theory. The hypothesis is then as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-0275074011425084" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: The turnover intentions of federal government workers will be lower for teleworkers than for nonteleworkers.</p></list-item></list>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0275074011425084">
<title>Social Denial Hypothesis</title>
<p>Even though employees are eligible to work at an alternative location, they still may not be allowed to because of idiosyncratic factors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0275074011425084">Mokhtarian, Bagley, and Salomon (1998)</xref> examined city of San Diego employees and suggested that managers were less willing to afford their clerical workers this arrangement than other occupations. They also found that women were more likely to report supervisory unwillingness than men, despite the fact that this arrangement was more advantageous to women.</p>
<p>Another reason why employees may not be offered this arrangement is because of managerial resistance to change. In the federal government, the U.S. GAO studied several departments, and independent agencies and found that resistance to change was the largest barrier hindering the implementation of telework among managers. For instance, allowing employees to telework meant federal government managers had “to shift from managing by observation to managing by results,” a transformation many were unwilling to make (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0275074011425084">GAO, 2003</xref>, p. 48). In other words, managers had to see employees perform their duties to believe they were actually working.</p>
<p>Therefore, managers are the gatekeepers to telecommuting, and as a result, can deny access to employees for any number of reasons, even though an employee is in a job that gives him or her this option. This then begs the question: What will happen to employees when managers do not allow them to telework? The expectation is the inverse of the social exchange theory, or what is referred to here as the social denial hypothesis. To be more precise, employees will not feel an obligation to remain with the organization because the organization is not catering to their needs. Furthermore, because these employees are actually denied the benefit of telecommuting (the ultimate rejection), the expectation is that they will have higher intentions to leave the organization than teleworkers and those that cannot telework as a consequence of personal preferences, technological limitations, and specific job duties that require them to be physically present. As a result, the following hypotheses are averred:</p>
<list id="list2-0275074011425084" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2a</italic>: Employees who are not allowed to telework, despite meeting specific criteria, will have higher turnover intentions than frequent teleworkers.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2b</italic>: Employees who are not allowed to telework, despite meeting specific criteria, will have higher turnover intentions than infrequent teleworkers.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2c</italic>: Employees who are not allowed to telework, despite meeting specific criteria, will have higher turnover intentions than workers that cannot telework, because their job duties require them to be physically present.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2d</italic>: Employees who are not allowed to telework, despite meeting specific criteria, will have higher turnover intentions than workers that cannot telework because of technical issues.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2e</italic>: Employees who are not allowed to telework, despite meeting specific criteria, will have higher turnover intentions than workers that those chose not to telework.</p></list-item>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Data for this article comes from the Federal Employees Viewpoint Survey (FedView 2010 Survey) which replaced the biennial Federal Human Capital Survey in 2010. Although both are almost identical, the FedView 2010 Survey further delineates categories of teleworkers and nonteleworkers making this empirical examination possible (see independent variables in this section for more clarification). Furthermore, the goal of the FedView 2010 survey was to find out what makes organizations effective from the perspective of government employees.</p>
<p>Regarding dissemination, the FedView 2010 survey was primarily sent electronically over the Internet during February and March of 2010 to 504,609 full-time permanent employees in U.S. federal government departments and independent agencies. To increase the response rate, the Office of Personnel Management also sent follow-up letters to a sample of employees. All totaled, 263,475 employees completed and returned the survey for a response rate of 52%.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0275074011425084">3</xref></sup> Following is a discussion of the survey items that were chosen to measure the dependent variables.</p>
<sec id="section8-0275074011425084">
<title>Dependent Variable</title>
<p>The dependent variable that was used to investigate the hypotheses is employee-turnover intentions. In the FedView 2010 survey, employees were asked, “Are you considering leaving your organization within the next year, and if so, why?” And, the response categories were (a) No; (b) Yes, to retire; (c) Yes, to take another job within the Federal Government; (d) Yes, to take another job outside the Federal Government; and (e) Yes, other. In the data set, employees stating an intention to leave their agency were coded as 1, whereas those indicating that they wanted to remain (No) were coded as 0. It is important to note that respondents reporting they were going to retire were removed from the sample, as this article only examines voluntary turnover which does not include retirement (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0275074011425084">Selden &amp; Moynihan, 2000</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0275074011425084">
<title>Independent Variables</title>
<p>Several independent variables were included in the model, and these variables consist of the main independent variable, telework, as well as several categories of secondary variables. To gauge the effectiveness of telework legislation, OPM posed the following statement to federal government employees: Please select the response below that best describes your teleworking situation. The responses were: (a) “I telework on a regular basis;” (b) “I telework infrequently;” (c) “I do not telework because I have to be physically present on the job;” (d) “I do not telework because I have technical issues;” (e) “I do not telework because I am not allowed to, even though I have the kind of job where I can telework;” and (f) “I do not telework because I choose not to telework.” As these responses represent categories, dichotomous variables were used to indicate the employee’s agreement regarding their telecommuting and nontelecommuting situation (1 = <italic>situation</italic>, 0 = <italic>all others</italic>). A more detailed explanation of the coding mechanism is in the results. A caveat to the first two response categories, however, is that the proportion of time spent teleworking was not asked. Instead, it indicates just whether the employee teleworks less or more than 1 day a week.</p>
<p>Next are the secondary variables which are categorized as individual characteristics, job characteristics, and work environment. Similar to previous employee-attitudinal research, the following individual characteristics are presumed to have an effect on turnover, and are, therefore, included in the model: gender, ethnicity, age, tenure, pay, and supervisory status (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0275074011425084">Moynihan &amp; Landuyt, 2008</xref>). Older and more tenured employees were found to have lower turnover rates, as they were more resistant to change (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0275074011425084">Moynihan &amp; Landuyt, 2008</xref>). Higher paid employees were found to have lower quit rates than lower paid employees did in a nationwide study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0275074011425084">Selden &amp; Moynihan, 2000</xref>). And, supervisors were found to remain more often in their respective public organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0275074011425084">Moynihan &amp; Landuyt, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The next category of secondary variables is job characteristics, and the first factor in this category is the employee’s workload, which has been used to measure employee burnout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0275074011425084">Moynihan &amp; Landuyt, 2008</xref>). The presumption is straightforward: employees will experience burnout and then quit when their workload is unreasonable. To gauge the appropriateness of employee workload, the following item was used: My workload is reasonable. The next variable in this category is job satisfaction, and a conventional hypothesis is that unsatisfied employees have high turnover intentions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0275074011425084">Tett &amp; Meyer, 1993</xref>). The item that was used to measure the factor was, “Considering everything, how satisfied are you with your job?”</p>
<p>The next category of secondary variables pertains to several facets of human resource management. First, this article employs the item that was used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0275074011425084">Bertelli (2007)</xref> to capture employee perceptions regarding the objectivity of the performance appraisal, with the expectation that unfair appraisals will lead to turnover intentions. Specifically, it states, “My performance appraisal is a fair reflection of my performance.” Next, perceptions regarding the fairness of promotions have been hypothesized to affect employee intentions to remain. This article uses the same item as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0275074011425084">Bertelli (2007)</xref>, which states, “Promotions in my work unit are based on merit.” Another predictor that has been presumed to have an effect on voluntary turnover in public organizations is the degree to which employees are provided with professional development and training activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0275074011425084">Kim, 2005</xref>). The two items that best represent this predictor in the survey are: “My training needs are assessed” and “Supervisory/team leaders in my work unit support employee development.” To be consistent with the other scales, the two professional development items were averaged and the Cronbach’s alpha was .73. Employee attitudes regarding the degree to which human resource policies promote diversity has also been associated with turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0275074011425084">Moynihan &amp; Landuyt, 2008</xref>). Thus, the following item was used in the model: “Policies and programs promote diversity in the workplace.” Last is the degree to which employees were satisfied with their pay (“Considering everything, how satisfied are you with your pay?”), and similar measures have been linked to turnover intentions in U.S. federal agencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0275074011425084">Bertelli, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The last facet of the organization that was examined in this article is the employee’s work environment. As it has been hypothesized that employees report higher leave intentions when they work in low performing work units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0275074011425084">Bertelli, 2007</xref>), the following item from the FedView 2010 survey was employed: “How would you rate the overall quality of work done by your work unit?” It is important to note that as performance is difficult to quantify in public organizations, researchers have typically used subjective measures, such as this one, to measure performance. Moreover, research suggests subjective measures are correlated with objective measures of performance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0275074011425084">McCracken, McIlwain, &amp; Fottler, 2001</xref>). Thus, this item is a reasonable performance measure in government agencies.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0275074011425084">Table 1</xref> provides descriptive statistics for the sample. As demonstrated, variables representing turnover intentions (1 = <italic>leave intention</italic>; 0 = <italic>intention to remain</italic>), males (1 = <italic>male</italic>; 0 = <italic>females</italic>), minorities (1 = <italic>minority</italic>; 0 = <italic>nonminority</italic>), supervisors (1 = <italic>supervisor</italic>; 0 = <italic>employee</italic>), and teleworkers (1 = <italic>teleworker</italic>; 0 = <italic>nonteleworker</italic>) were coded with dummy variables. Age was coded using the following scale: 1 = <italic>19 and younger</italic>, 2 = <italic>20 to 39</italic>, 3 = <italic>40 to 49</italic>, 4 = <italic>50 to 59</italic>, and 5 = <italic>above 60 years of age</italic>. And, employee tenure with their current agency was coded with the following: 1 = <italic>less than one year</italic>, 2 = <italic>1 to 3 years</italic>, 3 = <italic>4 to 5 years</italic>, 4 = <italic>6 to 10 years</italic>, 5 = <italic>11 to 20 years</italic>, and 6 = <italic>greater than 20 years</italic>. For pay grade, 1 represented GS levels 1 through 12 as well as the Federal Wage System, 2 represented GS levels 13 through 15, and 3 high ranking officials such as the senior executive service. Last, job satisfaction and satisfaction with pay were coded from 1 (<italic>very dissatisfied</italic>) to 5 (<italic>very satisfied</italic>), and the remaining variables, reasonable workload, performance appraisal, promotion based on merit, professional development, diversity policy, and work unit performance from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 5 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>).</p>

<p>The next table, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0275074011425084">Table 2</xref>, details the correlations for the study variables. The correlation statistic for the variable teleworkers reveals that it was statistically significant but with a low correlation (<italic>r</italic> = –.034, <italic>p</italic> = .01) indicating that these employees were slightly less likely to state a turnover intention than nonteleworkers. Although not in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0275074011425084">Table 2</xref>, variables representing employees who were denied along with the other arrangements posted higher correlations than the teleworking variable in the table. For instance, employees who were denied the opportunity to telework and employees who chose not to had the highest correlation with intent to quit (<italic>r</italic> = .20, <italic>p</italic> = .01), employees who were denied and employees whose job required them to be physically present had the second highest correlation (<italic>r</italic> = .16, <italic>p</italic> = .01), employees who were denied and employees who teleworked frequently had the third highest correlation (<italic>r</italic> = .15, <italic>p</italic> = .01), employees who were denied and employees who teleworked infrequently were next (<italic>r</italic> = .14, <italic>p</italic> = .01), and last was the variable representing employees who were denied and those who could not telecommute because of technical issues (<italic>r</italic> = .11, <italic>p</italic> = .01). In comparison, some of the other variables, like job satisfaction, professional development, and promotion based on merit, had much higher bivariate associations (<italic>r</italic> = –.441, –.318, and –.291, respectively, <italic>p</italic> = .01).</p>

<p>To test the hypotheses, binary logistic regression was used because the dependent variable, turnover intentions, was coded dichotomously. Furthermore, this estimator is deemed appropriate when models employ such coding mechanisms for dependent variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0275074011425084">Norusis, 2005</xref>). To ease the interpretation of the binary logistic estimator, the higher a variable’s Exp(B) is (above 1), the greater the likelihood employees will report an intention to leave. Conversely, the greater the Exp(B) is (below 1), the smaller the chance that employees will report a leave intention. An additional observation about logistic regression is that its coefficients can be used to calculate the probability employees will report a leave intention, when the dichotomous variables are held to their base and the ordinal variables are held to their means.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0275074011425084">4</xref></sup> As the sample is large and small, meaningless variations within variables may be statistically significant, calculating the probability of the scales is important because the size of the turnover variation is known, allowing judgments to be made about the magnitude of each factor’s impact on turnover intentions. Although not in the chart, the probability is discussed in this section, and for the sake of brevity, the predicted probabilities are given for employees’ teleworking and nonteleworking situation without mentioning that dummy variables are held to 0 and the ordinal factors to their sample means.</p>
<p>The first hypothesis posited that the turnover intentions of federal government workers will be lower for teleworkers than for nonteleworkers. To examine this association, employees’ teleworking situation was coded 1 if they teleworked frequently or infrequently and 0 if they didn’t (all other responses). The results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0275074011425084">Table 3</xref> indicate that teleworkers were less likely to state an intention to leave than were nonteleworkers (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). However the probabilities only indicate a very small turnover differential between teleworkers and nonteleworkers. For instance, the probability that a teleworker would report a leave intention was .103, whereas it was .107 for nonteleworkers—an imperceptible difference of .004. In other words, 10.3% of teleworkers reported a leave intention compared with 10.7% of nonteleworkers. Therefore, Hypothesis 1 was not supported.</p>

<p>The results also indicated that several other variables were significant. First, workers were less likely to report a leave intention when their perceptions regarding job satisfaction, pay satisfaction, merit based promotions, reasonableness of workload, diversity, and professional development were high. To determine the relative impact of teleworking on turnover intentions, it is important to mention the predicted probabilities of these job characteristics and human resource factors. The probability that employees who were very satisfied with their jobs and who would state an intention to leave was .043, whereas it was .542 for a very dissatisfied employee—a difference of .499, which was much larger than the one between teleworkers and nonteleworkers. Moreover, job satisfaction posited the highest differential. Conversely, the other factors’ effect sizes were more modest but still larger than the variable teleworking situation. For employees who were very satisfied with their pay, the probability was .093 and .143 for very dissatisfied with pay (a difference of .05); employees who strongly agreed promotions were based on merit and reported a leave intention probability of .079, whereas it was .147 for those strongly disagreeing (a difference of .068); employees who strongly agreed their workload was reasonable and had a leave intention probability of .09, and .131 for employees believing the opposite (a .041 difference); the probability was .103 for those strongly agreeing diversity was promoted, and .113 for those strongly disagreeing (a difference of .01); and, .086 for employees who strongly agreed they were the beneficiary of professional development, whereas it was .155 for employees who strongly disagreed (a difference of .069).</p>
<p>Several additional variables were also found to be significant in the model. Males had higher leave intentions than females (a difference of .004), minorities had higher leave intentions than nonminorities (a difference of .03), supervisors had higher leave intentions than nonsupervisors (a difference of .03), and employees in the highest pay category had higher leave intentions than those in the lowest pay category (a difference of .09). Conversely, turnover intentions were lower for older and more tenured employees.</p>
<p>To examine the social denial hypothesis—employees who are not allowed to telework, despite meeting specific criteria, will have higher turnover intentions than teleworkers and the other categories of nonteleworkers—each of the categories pertaining to employees’ teleworking and nonteleworking situation were compared with employees who were denied this opportunity. This entailed restricting the data set to the following classes of employees in the models: employees who were denied the opportunity (coded 1) and employees who teleworked frequently (coded 0) in model 1; employees who were denied the opportunity (coded 1) and employees who teleworked infrequently (coded 0) in model 2; employees who were denied the opportunity (coded 1) and employees who did not telework because their job demands them to be physically present (coded 0) in model 3; employees who were denied the opportunity (coded 1) and employees who did not telework because of technical issues (coded 0) in model 4; and employees who were denied the opportunity (coded 1) and employees who did not telework because they choose not to (coded 0) in model 5.</p>
<p>Unlike the previous table, only the coefficients are detailed in the chart. As indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0275074011425084">Table 4</xref>, each of the variables representing categories of federal government employees’ teleworking and nonteleworking situations in models 1 through 5 were positive and highly statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = .000). Therefore, Hypotheses 2a through 2e were confirmed. Similar to the previous model, predicted probabilities are used to examine the disparities in each model. The predicted probability for turnover intention in model 1 was .19 for employees who were denied the opportunity to telework, and .134 for employees who telework frequently—a difference of .056 points. After comparing employees who were denied with employees who telework infrequently (Model 2), the predicted probability was .19 and .159, respectively. Thus the turnover differential was .031. In model 3, denied employees’ predicted probability stating an intention to leave was .192, whereas it was .127 for those employees whose jobs required them to be physically present. The largest predicted probability disparity of .065 was between these two teleworking situations. Model 4 demonstrates that there was a .041 point turnover intention differential between denied employees and those who could not telework because of technical issues (.191 and .150, respectively). Last, model 5 indicates the results for employees who were not allowed to telework and employees who chose not to telework. The predicted probabilities for this model are .189 for the former and .134 for the latter with a .055 difference. Therefore, a shift from employees in other arrangements to those who were denied to telework resulted in a 3% to 6% point increase in turnover intentions. When the predicted probabilities for <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0275074011425084">Table 4</xref> are taken together and compared with <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0275074011425084">Table 3</xref>, more perceptible support is found for Hypotheses 2a through 2e. Therefore, the model, based on the effect sizes, supports these hypotheses.</p>

<p>Similar to the previous model, the same job characteristic and human resource factors, with the exception of diversity policy, were significant across each of the models. In addition, when the probabilities for the teleworking situations were compared with these factors, the teleworking differences were relatively large in comparison to the other factors. This demonstrates the comparative impact that being denied this arrangement had on turnover intentions.</p>

<sec id="section11-0275074011425084" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion and Implications</title>
<p>Based on the findings, several theoretical and managerial implications emerged. First, the turnover intentions of teleworkers and nonteleworkers were similar with only .004 separating the two arrangements. This finding therefore does not support the social exchange hypothesis: that employees will reciprocate (i.e., remain with the organization) after they are allowed to perform their work on their own time, away from their employer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0275074011425084">Hornung et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0275074011425084">Martinez-Sanchez et al., 2007</xref>). Concerning organizations, this suggests that public agencies and managers may not see a noticeable reduction in turnover after workers are allowed to perform their duties away from the traditional office. That is not to say that telecommuting should not be adopted by agencies, as it does provide benefits to organizations and employees in the way of lower overhead costs, lower fuel costs, a greater work-life benefit, and enhanced recruitment. As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0275074011425084">Wadsworth, Facer, and Arbon (2010)</xref>, teleworking provides more benefits than drawbacks.</p>
<p>This finding is also contrary to those from the private sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0275074011425084">Gadjendran &amp; Harrison, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0275074011425084">Golden, 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0275074011425084">Igbaria &amp; Guimaraes, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0275074011425084">Stavrou &amp; Kilaniotis, 2010</xref>) with a possible explanation being that there could be differences in sectors accounting for why teleworking positively affected retention in the private sector and not the public sector. For instance, government employees may work more from regional satellite offices which may not reduce turnover intentions, because it is somewhat similar in many respects to working at the traditional office.</p>
<p>The second implication deduced from the findings is that other factors, namely job satisfaction, promotion based on merit, and professional development, were found to have a much more substantial impact on the turnover intentions of public employees than teleworking, and organizations should seek to enhance those factors. For instance, very dissatisfied employee-leave intentions were greater than .50, meaning 50% of these employees reported that they intended to leave the agency—an astounding amount. When employees were very satisfied with their jobs, however, less than 5% reported that they would leave. In fact, this factor was the most important predictor in the model, validating a similar study on public agencies that also found job satisfaction to be an important predictor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0275074011425084">Moynihan &amp; Landuyt, 2008</xref>). That said, managers can significantly reduce turnover by redesigning jobs, for example, which has been shown to increase worker satisfaction with specific aspects of their job (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0275074011425084">O’Toole &amp; Lawler, 2006</xref>). In addition, very satisfied workers who were also very satisfied with professional development opportunities had turnover probabilities of .035 which was lower than very satisfied employees who were indifferent about professional development. Organizations seeking to reduce turnover should thus not rely on only improving one aspect of the organization but should endeavor to improve all areas that have been proven to have an effect on employee turnover.</p>
<p>Finally, the results of the models demonstrated that turnover intentions were higher for those employees who, for whatever reason, were not allowed to telework than it was for those employees in other teleworking situations. More precisely, teleworkers who were denied this flexible work arrangement had higher turnover intentions than employees who teleworked frequently and infrequently, as well as those employees who did not telecommute because of technical issues, job requirements, and personal preferences. In fact, the turnover disparities between denied employees and those in the other teleworking situations were more substantial than between teleworkers and nonteleworkers indicating that each situation is distinct and should be examined as such. Support was therefore found for the social denial hypothesis, and the organizational implication is that employees will have high levels of turnover when they are not allowed to perform their duties via this flexible arrangement, and that turnover can be reduced when employees are not denied this benefit. Furthermore, employees who are denied this opportunity may have resentment towards their teleworking coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0275074011425084">Manoochehri &amp; Pinkerton, 2003</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0275074011425084">Golden (2007)</xref> found that the prevalence of teleworkers was negatively associated with nonteleworkers’ satisfaction of telecommuters.</p>
<p>When taken together, the findings suggest that turnover is not affected by being afforded this arrangement but rather by being denied its benefits. Nevertheless, organizations should still offer this program, because it produces many other advantages, although the suggestion is that employees should only be denied this benefit when there is a “business reason” to do so, and if not, risk alienating denied workers.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Before the contributions of the article are summarized, its limitations are noted. First, the research design was cross-sectional, meaning it is not possible to determine how turnover intentions were affected by the various arrangements over time. The second limitation was that the survey was constructed to help government better manage human capital and not for theoretical research purposes. Therefore, some key factors were missing that could have influenced turnover intentions. As turnover intentions may vary by site, the last limitation is that the teleworking variable did not specify where employees’ teleworked from. To further this study, scholars could incorporate independently validated measures from turnover studies and administer them to teleworking and nonteleworking government workers. A comparative study of teleworkers in all sectors would also be fruitful.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, this article advances our understanding regarding the turnover intentions of teleworkers in several ways. First, teleworking did not exact a social exchange vis-à-vis turnover intentions in public agencies. Specifically, teleworkers and nonteleworkers reported similar intentions to quit implying that telecommuting should not be used by managers and organizations “solely” to reduce the turnover of government employees. Next, other factors, such as job satisfaction, were found to be an important predictor of turnover intentions, and organizations should seek to improve employee attitudes regarding those factors. An examination of each of the teleworking and nonteleworking arrangement also revealed that government workers were more likely to report a leave intention when they were denied the opportunity to telecommute thus supporting the social denial hypothesis. Therefore, these workers had higher turnover intentions than did frequent teleworkers and infrequent teleworkers, as well as those who did not telework because of technical issues, job duties that required them to be physically present, and personal preferences. Finally, the findings imply that denying employees the opportunity to telework has a greater impact on turnover than affording them the benefit.</p>
