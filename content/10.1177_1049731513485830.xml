<p>There is an ongoing focus in the child and family mental health literature on evidence-based practices (EBPs) that strive to improve child mental health outcomes while also aiming to address caregiver needs and psychosocial stressors. Delivery of evidence-informed care to youth and their families will occur within the context of a changing healthcare system, shifts in reimbursement strategies from both Medicaid and private insurers, and increased demand on social work practitioners. More than ever, there is a need to develop, implement, and test culturally and contextually relevant EBPs that are effective in “real world” settings, particularly for focused on those most in need, poverty-impacted families living in under-resourced urban communities and experiencing simultaneous, multilevel stressors.</p>
<p>
<italic>Research on Social Work Practice (RSWP)</italic> announces a call for papers and invites manuscripts on EBPs and empirically-supported service approaches involving families living through extremely stressful circumstances. The goal of this special issue is to promote the dissemination of empirically-based strategies with this population. In particular, this special issue seeks scholarly work along the following suggested topics:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Original outcome studies of empirically-supported mental health interventions involving highly stressed caregivers or families. Examples of studies include systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-experimental trials, single-system designs, and other rigorous evaluation methods.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Effectiveness trials comparing outcomes of interventions for families along a continuum of stress levels.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Evaluations of empirically-based practices that enhance social work practitioners' effectiveness and enhance child and caregiver outcomes.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Research-supported strategies for engaging in interdisciplinary work that promotes improved outcomes for children and caregivers experiencing multilevel stressors.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Innovative strategies for integrating community mental health EBPs involving highly stressed families into health and/or educational settings.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>All manuscripts meeting the submission criteria as listed above will undergo blind peer review, and manuscripts should reflect the author(s) original work and be formatted according to current APA format as found in the APA Manual. There is no page limit on submissions. Completed manuscripts should be submitted via email as two Microsoft Word files (title page and manuscript) by the submission deadline stated above, subject line “RSWP Special Issue”. Submissions should be directed to Jerrold M. Jackson, PhD, LCSW, via email at jerrold.jackson@nyu.edu.</p>
