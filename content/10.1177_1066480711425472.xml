<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this article is to provide specific guidelines for child-centered play therapists to set behavioral outcome goals to effectively work with families and to meet the demands for accountability in the managed care environment. The child-centered play therapy orientation is the most widely practiced approach among play therapists who identify a specific theoretical orientation. While information about setting broad objectives is addressed using this approach to therapy, explicit guidelines for setting behavioral goals, while maintaining the integrity of the child-centered theoretical orientation, are needed. The guidelines are presented in three phases of parent consultation: (a) the initial engagement with parents, (b) the ongoing parent consultations, and (c) the termination phase. In keeping with the child-centered approach, the authors propose to work with parents from a person-centered orientation and seek to appreciate how cultural influences relate to parents’ concerns and goals for their children. A case example is provided to demonstrate how child-centered play therapists can accomplish the aforementioned goals.</p>

<p>When young children, aged 2 to 9 years, are experiencing emotional and behavioral problems, most approaches to family therapy are limited because of children’s inability to communicate effectively using words. The literature indicates that for therapy to be most effective, play therapists are strongly encouraged to collaborate with families, and particularly the parents, when working on behalf of young children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066480711425472">Guerney, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066480711425472">Kraft &amp; Landreth, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066480711425472">McNeil, Bahl, &amp; Herschell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066480711425472">Shaw &amp; Magnum, 2006</xref>). However, the degree to which parents are involved varies. One approach has been using family play therapy in which play activities, that include young children, are used with all members of the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066480711425472">Gil, 1994</xref>). Another approach is offering intensive parent training models, such as filial therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066480711425472">Guerney, 2000</xref>), Child–Parent Relationship Therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066480711425472">Bratton, Landreth, Kellam, &amp; Blackard, 2006</xref>), and Parent–Child Interaction Therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066480711425472">Eyberg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066480711425472">McNeil, Bahl, &amp; Herschell, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>While family play therapy and parent training models have been researched and deemed effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066480711425472">Gil, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066480711425472">Guerney, 2000</xref>), parents’ interest and emotional readiness to conduct sessions with their children differ. Furthermore, depending on the clinical issues some children may warrant individual professional intervention. When this is the case, the need for parent involvement remains essential. However, many times when children enter therapy, parents’ involvement has not extended much beyond intake sessions and brief periodic check-ins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066480711425472">Shaw &amp; Magnuson, 2006</xref>). For this reason, play therapy with individual children, coupled with consistent collaboration with parents, is one approach to helping families with young children.</p>
<p>Leading authorities in the field of play therapy recognize that working with parents increases the likelihood of success with children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066480711425472">Cates, Paone, Packman, &amp; Margolis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066480711425472">Kraft &amp; Landreth, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066480711425472">McNeil, Bahl, &amp; Herschell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066480711425472">Shaw &amp; Magnuson, 2006</xref>). In a national survey of 1,166 play therapists, Phillips and Landreth (1998) found that 78% of respondents believed that the degree of caregiver involvement in the play therapy process contributed to treatment success. This is particularly important because parents who do not understand how play therapy is beneficial for their children are more likely to prematurely end counseling services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066480711425472">Athanasiou, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066480711425472">Cates et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1066480711425472">Van Fleet, 2000</xref>). Therefore, a goal for parent consultations is to affirm that play therapy interventions are purposeful and that the effectiveness of the play therapy interventions can be assessed. Even though the need to train play therapists to consult effectively with parents is evident, in a recent national survey, play therapists identified consulting with parents as one of their greatest needs in clinical supervision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1066480711425472">VanderGast, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>An essential component of working effectively with parents is to establish specific, behavioral goals for children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066480711425472">Athanasiou, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066480711425472">Cates et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066480711425472">McGuire &amp; McGuire, 2001</xref>). Behavioral goals establish benchmarks for progress and become the basis for follow-up consultations. In addition, the goal setting process gives parents hope that the process will help their children and increases their trust in the play therapy process. Establishing behavioral goals is also necessary, given that managed care requires therapists to assess the effectiveness of interventions with measureable, outcome goals. Among play therapist theoretical orientations, child-centered play therapy is the most frequently taught in graduate school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1066480711425472">Ryan, Gomory, &amp; Lacasse, 2002</xref>), the most widely practiced approach among play therapists who adhere to a specific theoretical orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066480711425472">Phillips &amp; Landreth, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1066480711425472">Ryan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1066480711425472">VanderGast, 2008</xref>), and the most commonly used theoretical orientation of Registered Play Therapy Supervisors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066480711425472">Fall, Drew, Chute, &amp; More, 2007</xref>). However, because setting behavioral goals could be contradictory to the premises of the theory, while guidelines for working with parents are emphasized in the child-centered literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066480711425472">Cates et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066480711425472">Landreth, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066480711425472">McGuire &amp; McGuire, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1066480711425472">Van Fleet, 2000</xref>), further explanation to help child-centered play therapists set behavioral goals is warranted.</p>
<p>A basic premise in child-centered play therapy is that it is the innate self-actualization force within children that brings about change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066480711425472">Axline, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066480711425472">Paone &amp; Douma, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066480711425472">Ray, Blanco, Sullivan, &amp; Holliman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066480711425472">Rogers, 1951</xref>). Child-centered play therapists do not use specific techniques, specific toys, or interpretation to promote personal growth in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066480711425472">Landreth, 2002</xref>). Instead, play therapists have a firm belief in children’s ability to be the best determiner of what should be the focus of each therapy session. Given this theoretical base, there is a danger that setting behavioral goals at the onset of child-centered play therapy could lead therapists to act in a certain way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066480711425472">Landreth &amp; Sweeney, 1997</xref>), which would be incompatible with this theoretical model. Thus, the child-centered theoretical orientation adheres to “broadly defined objectives” (p. 29) proposed with the ultimate goal of helping children become self-reliant, accepting of themselves, better problem solvers, and more able to assume responsibility for their own behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066480711425472">Landreth, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Setting broadly defined objectives does not satisfy the demands of managed care for therapists to assess the effectiveness of interventions with measureable, behavioral goals. Neither do these broadly defined objectives satisfy the need to establish benchmarks to assess progress during parent consultations. In response, this article offers guidelines that can be used by child-centered play therapists to work with parents when they bring children to therapy. Consistent with this theoretical orientation, it is important to highlight that goals are set in consultations between the counselors and parents outside of the playroom; however, these goals should not impact the therapists’ behaviors in the playroom where children will always control the direction of the therapy session. The proposed guidelines are presented in three different phases of parent consultation: (a) the initial engagement with parents, (b) the ongoing parent consultations, and (c) the termination phase. A case example is used to illustrate the process. In keeping with the child-centered approach, the authors propose to work with parents from a person-centered orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1066480711425472">Rogers, 1942</xref>) and seek to appreciate how cultural influences relate to parents’ concerns and goals for their children.</p>
<sec id="section1-1066480711425472">
<title>Initial Engagement With Parents</title>
<p>The goals of the initial meeting with parents are to (a) learn their perspective of why their child needs therapy while developing a trusting relationship with the parents, (b) develop goals for their child’s treatment, and (c) help parents understand how child-centered play therapy addresses specific behavioral problems.</p>
<sec id="section2-1066480711425472">
<title>Learning About the Child and Developing a Trusting Relationship With Parents</title>
<p>Because “parenting is at best a difficult, stressful, and often frustrating process” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066480711425472">Landreth, 2002</xref>, p. 366), the importance of the play therapists’ ability to convey the core conditions of empathy, acceptance, and genuineness cannot be overemphasized. It is through these conditions that a strong therapist–parent alliance starts to form. Additionally, play therapists should use parent consultation meetings as an opportunity to model the person-centered approach, thus, increasing parents’ awareness of the power of these basic principles. To start building such a relationship, it is recommended that therapists meet parents for the initial session without any children present. During this session, therapists collaborate with the parents to establish goals and to describe the child-centered play therapy process while being intentional about establishing a strong relationship.</p>
<p>The first step in the initial phase of the consultation process is listening to the parents’ descriptions of the child client. The process results in a shared understanding of the parents’ perception of the problem. Two cautions exist as therapists listen to the parents’ concerns. First, they must keep the focus of the consultation on the child’s issues, not on the parents’ issues. With awareness and sensitivity, therapists can both demonstrate care for parents and simultaneously help them focus their attention on their child. For example, in a situation in which a mother has concerns that her husband is not engaged enough with their child, the therapist can focus the discussion on the impact that behavior has on the child and the implications for the child rather than on the problems in the marital dyad. A second caution is that as many issues need to be addressed during the time allotted (e.g. consent forms, scheduling), therapists must wisely manage the time.</p>
<p>As play therapists learn about the parents’ perceptions of the child, conveying understanding of the parents’ world view is critical both in terms of establishing a relationship with the parents and understanding the cultural context of the child. For example, as one mother who had not completed high school described her reasons for bringing her child to play therapy, the therapist sensed the mother felt uncomfortable in the elementary school environment and also felt intimidated by her child’s teacher. In this situation, the therapist demonstrated sensitivity to the mother’s perspective by responding to her feelings of uncertainty and discomfort in that environment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1066480711425472">
<title>Establishing Measurable Goals</title>
<p>As mentioned above, setting measurable goals with parents prior to starting child-centered therapy does not change the way play therapists relate to the child. Child-centered play therapists do not engage in any predetermined interventions that seek to change the child’s behavior. Instead, therapists consistently offer the child a safe relationship and environment where the child is free to be self-directive. The therapists’ trust in the child’s ability to move toward self-actualization continues to be the focus, not the goals set prior to treatment. Whereas in other play therapy theoretical approaches, play therapists may select interventions based on the treatment goals, child-centered play therapists set goals as a way to assess treatment progress while maintaining a child-centered approach in the playroom. In fact, child-centered play therapists are encouraged to reflect upon their way of being in the playroom to make certain they do not inadvertently direct the child’s behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066480711425472">Landreth &amp; Sweeney, 1997</xref>). This issue is ideally addressed in supervision.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1066480711425472">Young (2009)</xref>, effective therapeutic goals are concrete, measurable, and observable. Goals should be framed from a strength-based approach focusing on solutions, not on the problems. These characteristics are guidelines for the therapeutic goals when meeting with parents. It is not uncommon for parents to have numerous concerns about their child when presenting for counseling. Because good therapeutic goals are realistic (Young), child-centered play therapists must help parents identify the most important issues and focus on only three or four goals at a time. As parents describe their perceptions of the child’s problem, reasons for bringing the child to play therapy, and their hopes for the child, the therapists’ responsibility is to translate the parents’ concerns into concrete goals for the child. Two questions therapists can ask to accomplish this are, “How would you like for your child’s life to be different after play therapy?” and “How will you know when your child has changed and no longer has this problem?”</p>
<p>During this process, play therapists must be sensitive to parents’ cultural background, for parents’ values will influence the types of goals established for their child. For example, in some cultures, compliance with authority, both at school and at home, is highly valued. The goals that evolve through the therapist–parent interaction for the child could focus on compliance and responsiveness to limits. In other cultures where children experience a more permissive relationship with their parents, the goals for play therapy could be increasing the child’s ability to make decisions and enhance self-confidence. This collaborative process between parents and therapists result in a consensus on the goals for the play therapy intervention.</p>
<p>In addition to consulting with parents to create goals, play therapists will also note significant behaviors observed during the play therapy sessions with the child which might not have emerged as a goal in the initial parent consultation. For example, therapists might notice that the child persistently asks permission to play with toys. This behavior might indicate a low level of confidence and an inability to act independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066480711425472">Landreth, 2002</xref>). These clinical observations should be translated into additional behavioral goals for the child. The following case example illustrates how to set specific goals during an initial parent consultation.</p>
<sec id="section4-1066480711425472">
<title>Case example</title>
<p>Taylor was a 5-year-old female. Two years earlier, Taylor’s older brother was hit by a car when crossing the street. While her brother’s life was in danger, he survived after several months in the hospital. Taylor witnessed the accident, and according to her mom, since that time, Taylor became “a totally different child.” Taylor was afraid to be away from her mom, unable to make friends, aggressive toward others, and awakened most nights with nightmares. Although these behaviors began several years ago, the immediate reason Taylor was brought for play therapy at that time was that she was in danger of failing kindergarten due to her inability to concentrate in school.</p>
<p>It was important to establish rapport with Taylor’s mother. After listening to Taylor’s mother and being responsive to her feelings, the therapist, through the use of basic reflection skills and the questions suggested above, identified the following specific measurable behavioral goals: (1) increase self-control, as indicated by an increase in the number of days Taylor could refrain from hitting or yelling at others at home or school every day from no times each week to two times each week; (2) increase from the baseline of 1 day per week to 3 days each week, with no report from the teacher about inattention/lack of focus in school (3) increase to at least one play date a week with another child, from current baseline of zero, when Taylor plays cooperatively for a minimum of 30–45 min; and (4) increase to four nights each week, from the current baseline of one, the number of nights that Taylor sleeps without waking up with a nightmare. These goals are concrete (can be stated in one sentence and with reference to a specific behavior), measurable (can be assessed in terms of frequency compared to a baseline), and are observable (Taylor’s mother and teacher can observe if there is a change in the behaviors). The goals are stated positively. For example, instead of stating goal number two as “decrease to two times per week the number of times Taylor gets a behavioral report from the teacher,” the goal is stated as “increase from the baseline of 1 day per week to 3 days each week, with no report from the teacher about inattention/lack of focus in school.”</p>
<p>When the described behaviors are hurtful to the child or others, it is helpful to provide parents with specific parenting skills that are congruent with the skills used in child-centered play therapy. The therapist should stay mindful of not overwhelming Taylor’s mother with numerous suggestions in the first parent consultation. In this case, helping Taylor’s mother find ways to deal with Taylor hitting others provides an opportunity to teach parenting skills that could help the mother feel empowered to help her child. The mother shared that if she saw Taylor hit another child, her normal response was to scream at Taylor, and this usually “made things worse.” The therapist concentrated on conveying the importance of responding to Taylor’s feelings with empathy during these times and practiced reflection of feelings with Taylor’s mom. It was decided that to begin with teaching the parent to set limits with her child could be overwhelming during the first session; however, it was noted that limit setting and choice giving would be areas for parent training related to the goal of increasing the child’s ability to control her behavior without hitting or yelling.</p>

<title>Explaining How Behaviors of the Child are Addressed in the Child-Centered Playroom</title>
<p>Child-centered play therapists must be skillful in explaining how the different skills used in the playroom to help children achieve the established goals. In brief, play therapists need to share with parents that they will use the following skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066480711425472">Landreth, 2002</xref>): tracking which is the skill of describing what the child is doing to show attention and involvement; reflecting feelings; returning responsibility to the child which is the skill of helping children make decisions for themselves in the playroom by allowing them to decide which toys to play with and how to play with them; and limit setting which is the skill of helping children learn to control their behavior through the ACT approach of acknowledging the feeling, communicating the limit, and targeting an alternative behavior. While describing in detail how each of the child-centered skills is linked to the different types of behavioral goals is beyond the scope of this article, the importance of child-centered play therapists using their understanding of the theoretical principles to communicate effectively how child-centered play therapy relates to specific goals for the child client cannot be overemphasized. Clearly addressing how the child-centered approach can help children is essential to gaining parental commitment to the process. Play therapists can help parents by describing how each of the established goals could be addressed in the playroom. The process is shown in the example below.</p>
<sec id="section7-1066480711425472">
<title>Case example</title>
<p>The therapist explained to Taylor’s mother the child-centered approach in words the mother could understand with statements such as, “as Taylor starts to feel safe in the playroom, she will express her feelings through play. In this way, she can process some of the feelings she cannot express in words. This could reduce her need to express these feelings in inappropriate ways in her daily life.” Additionally, the therapist told the mother how Taylor might express aggressiveness, one of the identified problems, in the playroom by saying, “Taylor may show anger in the playroom by hitting the bop bag, having toys behave aggressively with each other, or by throwing toys at me. If this happens, I will respond to her feelings. If there is a danger she could hurt herself, me, or the toys, I will use therapeutic limit setting. The goal for setting limits is to help Taylor develop self-control. The idea is that through these experiences in the playroom, Taylor will have an opportunity to regain control of her behaviors and practice decision making that could help her choose more appropriate ways of responding outside of the playroom.” Two other goals for Taylor are concerning friendships and nightmares which may be symptomatic of anxiety and fear. The therapist said to the mother, “Taylor may show fear or anxiety in the playroom by not facing me when she plays or by not engaging me while she is playing. If this happens, I will respond to her with empathy and care. I will not directly speak to her about her anxiety or about facing me as she plays. I will not ask her to play with me, but I will respond warmly if she invites me to play with her or asks me to help her. As she feels more comfortable to face me and to play with me, we might see that she is more comfortable both interacting with others outside the playroom and having fewer nightmares.”</p>

<sec id="section9-1066480711425472">
<title>Assessing Progress Through Ongoing Consultations</title>
<p>Every four or five sessions, therapists should meet with parents without the child present. The purpose of the ongoing consultations is threefold. First, regular meetings help maintain and foster a strong therapist–parent alliance. Second, the meetings allow the parents and play therapists to collaboratively assess the progress toward goals. Finally, these consultations can be used to educate parents about child development, parenting skills, and community resources that can be used to help the child.</p>
<sec id="section10-1066480711425472">
<title>Maintaining and Fostering a Strong Therapist–Parent Alliance</title>
<p>Because access to working with young children is dependent upon parents valuing play therapy enough to bring them to sessions, play therapists must consistently foster a positive relationship with the parents. Ongoing consultations provide this opportunity. It is helpful to begin each session with time to allow parents to share what they wish since the last meeting together. During this time, therapists can use person-centered active listening to demonstrate understanding and care, and they can refer back to this interaction when sharing with parents some ways they can communicate with their children.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1066480711425472">
<title>Assessing Progress</title>
<p>It is important for child-centered play therapists to maintain good case notes that can be used to assess the child’s progress. Case notes are used to document significant events, attitudes, and play themes in the play sessions. In addition, child-centered play therapists should be attentive to child’s behaviors in the playroom that are related to the established goals and document any changes in those play behaviors. For example, if a child is experiencing anxiety out of the playroom, case notes can indicate changes in behaviors that could indicate anxiety in the playroom, such as making decisions about what to do in the playroom, facing the therapist, or interacting with the therapist. For a child presenting with goals related to aggressive behavior outside of the playroom, documentation might note changes in the child’s response to limits setting and determine whether the changes observed in the playroom are evident of changes out of the playroom. In addition to reviewing case notes to observe progress toward goals exhibited in the playroom, play therapists should also identify themes of the play sessions to share with the parents (e.g., themes of power, mastery, or nurturance). When preparing, play therapists should remain sensitive to maintaining the child’s confidentiality by not disclosing specific play behaviors or child’s verbalizations during play sessions to parents.</p>
<p>After listening to the parents’ initial concerns, play therapists should direct the session to assess progress toward goals—if the parent has not addressed these issues. The counselor can ask an open-ended question like “How have things been going with ___?” Using active listening skills at this time ensures shared understanding of what the parents are saying. Play therapists should listen for information related to the stated goals for therapy. If the parents do not address each goal, therapists can then systematically address those goals that were not mentioned by the parents. After reviewing the goals, therapists and parents collaboratively determine whether the original goals were met, need to be modified, or if it is time to terminate the relationship.</p>

<title>Parenting Skills and Community Resources</title>
<p>If the decision is made to continue play therapy, play therapist and parents review the updated goals and establish a time for their next meeting. During parent consultations, therapists can share appropriate parenting skills based on the needs of parents and the child. Most parents are eager to learn new approaches to discipline and highly value the skills of limit setting and choice giving. Also, sharing the skills of responding to the child’s feelings and returning responsibility has been found to reduce parental stress and create a more positive environment in the home which can influence the entire family system.</p>
<p>During ongoing parent consultations, therapists can also address themes observed in the play therapy sessions, especially those related to the established goals of therapy, such ability to control behaviors when limits are set, and an increasing ability to assume responsibility for decisions. In addition, the ongoing meetings with parents provide the opportunity to address other needs the child may have that are not being met and provide appropriate resources. For example, if a child appears to have a learning disability, play therapists should make appropriate referrals for the child to be assessed for needed services.</p>

<title>Case example</title>
<p>After four individual play sessions with Taylor, the therapist scheduled a meeting with Taylor’s mother without Taylor present. The mother began the session by talking about her own level of stress, and the therapist responded empathically. Then the therapist asked an open-ended question about how things were going with Taylor. Her mother reported that Taylor had one report from her teacher this past week for throwing a pencil at another child in the classroom. In addition, Taylor hit her mom during the past week when asked to put away her toys before dinner. The therapist noted to the parent that the teacher’s report about throwing the pencil and hitting her were related to the original goal regarding aggressive behavior, so the therapist and parent discussed Taylor’s progress with regard to this goal. Her mother reported that Taylor had complained of stomach aches at school during the past week. The therapist thought that the stomach aches might indicate anxiety and made a “mental note” about a future goal for Taylor.</p>
<p>When the parent finished describing her perceptions, the therapist noted that Goal 1 was met at the level desired, because Taylor only had one aggressive behavior in school during the week and only one instance of resisting the request to pick up her toys during the week. Then the therapist focused on the other three goals that the parent had not mentioned. Goal 2 was to receive fewer reports from the teacher about inattention/lack of focus in school. Taylor’s mother reported that this has gotten worse, as indicated by more frequent reports from the teacher. Goal 3 was to have one play date a week. The mother reported that she was trying to make this happen, and in the past 2 weeks, Taylor had “play dates” with two different children. During both play times, the children played cooperatively. It appeared this goal had been met. Goal 4 was to have four nights in a week without nightmares. The mother looked surprised and said it had been weeks since Taylor had had a nightmare, indicating that this goal had been met. The mother and therapist decided to continue play therapy and to reassess progress toward the first three goals; there was no need, at this time, to continue with the fourth goal regarding nightmares. When discussing the stomach aches, the mother decided that since this behavior had just occurred in the current week, she wanted to wait and see whether it was a pattern before adding this as an additional goal.</p>
<p>At this time, the therapist shared with the parent ways in which the original goals had shown themselves in the playroom. For example, without describing in detail the actual incidences that occurred, the therapist did share that she did need to set some limits with Taylor. She reported that Taylor responded well to the limit setting and was able to control her behavior in the playroom each time. In addition, the therapist shared that Taylor’s confidence seemed to be increasing as indicated by assuming responsibility for her decisions in the playroom and asking fewer “permission” questions. The therapist shared with the parent that Taylor did show themes in her sessions about safety and protection. Finally, the therapist shared with the parent how to set limits when Taylor was noncompliant with requests and with aggressive behavior. After describing the skills, the therapist demonstrated to the parent what to say in different situations and then gave the parent the chance to practice the skills in several role plays. Counseling with Taylor continued for about 6 months. Every 4 or 5 weeks, the therapist met with the mother to assess progress toward goals using the guidelines presented above. During each parent consultation, the therapist and mother continued to assess progress toward the original goals, to modify them as needed, and to gradually introduce the parenting skills of responding to feelings, returning responsibility to the child, responding to the child’s efforts, limit setting, and choice giving. Similar to many parents, the parent was most grateful to learn limit setting and choice giving skills and frequently shared with the therapist times that these skills were effective with Taylor.</p>

<title>Termination Phase</title>
<p>Through assessment of established behavioral goals and through therapists’ observation of child’s behaviors in the playroom, the parents and therapists assess when to terminate treatment. Honoring the importance of the therapist–parent relationship and the pivotal role of parents in children’s lives, the decision to terminate treatment is always done in collaboration with parents. When there is a decision to terminate, therapists and parents decide collaboratively on a time frame for the termination. A clear, predictable termination process is most important for children who have been through major changes in their lives, such as changed living arrangements with parents because of separation of parents or trauma. Play therapists can start the termination process by gradually increasing the time between play sessions from weekly to biweekly to monthly until termination is achieved. A change in the frequency of play therapy sessions is helpful because it gives the child time to adjust to not coming to therapy every week. Additionally, this approach allows parents to observe whether the child exhibits any adjustment problems during the termination process while still having the reassurance of therapists’ availability. Just as child-centered play therapists must be careful to ensure child’s well-being throughout the termination process, they must also attend to the parallel termination process that occurs with parents.</p>
<p>Parents who have been engaging in frequent parental consultations and who have formed a strong therapist–parent alliance may experience a grieving process associated with terminating services. Thus, child-centered play therapists are encouraged to address parents’ feelings toward termination during the last parent consultations. Play therapists need to provide parents with specific guidelines on how to contact them in the future or make appropriate referrals for future services.</p>
<sec id="section16-1066480711425472">
<title>Case example</title>
<p>Taylor continued services for about 6 months. By the end of this time, Taylor’s mother reported that Taylor was rarely aggressive at school. In addition, her ability to focus and pay attention at school seemed to mirror her ways of being in the playroom. When she was focused in her play, it seemed that she was focused in the classroom. Taylor’s work in school, though still inattentive at times, did not prevent her from progressing through the first grade, and her mother felt more comfortable in working with teachers to help Taylor in school. Upon assessing Taylor’s progress, the therapist and the mother collaboratively decided to terminate treatment. The termination process was done gradually with Taylor coming for three more sessions, every other week, after the decision was made. The parent and therapist let Taylor know they were going to have three more sessions to ensure Taylor had enough time to work through the termination process in the playroom. Additionally, the therapist met with Taylor’s mother one last time to process termination with the mother. The mother was encouraged to call the therapist, should Taylor have any problems in the future.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>To respond to the demands of managed care in agency setting and to demonstrate the value of providing evidence for the effectiveness of their work with children, play therapists must have the skills of establishing behavioral outcome goals and assessing progress toward achieving those goals. Because child-centered play therapists focus on the relationship with the child, rather than the problem, they face unique challenges when helping parents understand their theoretical approach, develop measureable goals, and assess progress. A review of literature showed a lack of attention to how child-centered play therapists can effectively set specific measurable behavioral goals while maintaining the integrity of the philosophical tenets of the child-centered approach. To address this need, this article proposed guidelines specifically designed for child-centered play therapists.</p>
