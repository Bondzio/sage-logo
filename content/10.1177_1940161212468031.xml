<abstract>
<p>The framing of elections represents the most overt instance of the media’s power to influence politics. We content analyzed twelve newspapers’ coverage of the 2011 general election in Ireland. Ireland’s newspaper market has some special advantages for social scientists, as it allows us to separate the newspaper types/formats (tabloid vs. broadsheet) from their commercial basis (vulnerability or otherwise to short-term sales and profits). Therefore, we are able to make a particular contribution to the long-standing debate about the interaction of free market capitalism and the media. Our results do not find a homogeneous general election frame in Ireland. The variation in framing across Irish newspapers was much greater than that between the five countries for which we can find strictly comparable results. The different commercial statuses of the newspapers do seem to be related to different dominant frames of election coverage, but only after we develop a new measure that takes account of the relative overall prominence of election coverage in the newspapers examined.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Media scholars often bemoan the lack of standardized cross-national comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1940161212468031">Esser et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1940161212468031">Hallin and Mancini 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1940161212468031">Norris 2009</xref>). However, the literature on election coverage is rapidly becoming an exception to this rule, notwithstanding the challenges of improving conceptual clarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1940161212468031">Aalberg et al. 2012</xref>). There is now a significant body of scientific research from several countries, which considers whether media coverage of national elections primarily frames politics as a strategic game or as an arena for public debates on policy issues. Most of these studies have concluded that the media tend toward the game frame in election news coverage. Nonetheless, the question remains as to why some media outlets, or some countries, are more inclined to frame elections in terms of issues while others are dominated by the game frame. Prominent explanations in the literature include the commercial position of the media outlet and the country’s media system.</p>
<p>The growth in research on this question provides an opportunity for single-case studies to be rigorously comparative, as they can be building blocks in a wider research effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1940161212468031">George and Bennett 2005</xref>: 76). We present a content analysis of the coverage of twelve national newspapers during the 2011 Irish general election. Ireland’s newspaper market has some advantages for social scientists, as it allows researchers to separate newspaper types (tabloid vs. broadsheet) from their commercial basis (the extent of their vulnerability to short-term sales and profits). In this regard, this study makes a particular contribution to the long-standing debate about the interaction of capitalism and the media. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1940161212468031">Calcutt and Hammond (2011)</xref> argue that journalism and commercialism have “flowed through history as complementary but non-identical streams” (p. 18). Through an examination of newspaper coverage of the 2011 Irish election, we can test the impact of different ownership models and commercial pressures.</p>
<p>Our results are consistent with a powerful influence of commercialization on election framing. This result is even stronger when we improve on the existing literature by weighting our figures by the extent to which a newspaper covers the election. Variations in commercial sensitivity are associated with different frames, but there is great variety in how Irish newspapers frame the election. Commercialization has not forced a common frame on the Irish media. We also benchmark our results internationally to studies of the United States, Belgium, Sweden, and Spain. By contrast to our intranational study, this cross-national study does not show an association between commercialization and election framing. However, we lack the improved measure of framing for our comparator countries.</p>
<p>The paper begins with a consideration of framing theory and how different business models may or may not influence newspapers’ choice of election frames. The following section introduces the Irish case, showing how several special characteristics make it possible to dismiss some potential explanations and leverage unusual variation to test explanations based on commercial pressure and newspaper type. The paper then provides a detailed account of the content analysis and shows that this work compares closely with a series of two-country studies undertaken by Strömbäck and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1940161212468031">Strömbäck and Dimitrova 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1940161212468031">Strömbäck and Luengo 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1940161212468031">Strömbäck and van Aelst 2010</xref>). The subsequent sections offer two contributions to scholarship in this area: in the form of a revised measure of election coverage framing that provides a more rigorous test of hypotheses about commercial position and newspaper type, and second through a replication of Strömbäck’s work that allows comparison with four other countries. The conclusion highlights how this research can assist the development of theory and measurement in cross-national media studies.</p>

<title>Theory</title>
<p>Framing is now considered central to understanding public opinion on political as well as many other issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1940161212468031">Chong and Druckman 2007</xref>). The groundbreaking work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1940161212468031">Kahneman and Tversky (1984)</xref> showed that people’s responses to a question could be radically but predictably altered by changing the way the question is framed. In media research, frames are thought to “select, organize, and emphasise certain aspects of reality, to the exclusion of others” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1940161212468031">de Vreese et al. 2001</xref>: 108). There is an infinite variety of ways in which experience can be interpreted. The specific way in which we do so depends on our framing of reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1940161212468031">Goffman 1974</xref>). Journalists, like all of us, must operate within particular frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1940161212468031">Tuchman 1978</xref>) that structure the way they approach an issue or evaluate an object. This article deals with generic framing or metaframing, not with issue-specific frames. Generic frames “allow comparisons between frames, topics, and, potentially, framing practices in different countries” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1940161212468031">de Vreese et al. 2001</xref>: 109).</p>
<p>We test whether, and why, politics is framed as a game between competing teams or as a debate of issues and policies and a choice between political parties or ideologies. These alternative generic frames were first investigated in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1940161212468031">Cappella and Jamieson 1996</xref>) but their applicability to cross-national research has since been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1940161212468031">Strömbäck and Kaid 2008</xref>). There is evidence, including experimental research, that these different frames can have substantial effects on citizens’ attitude to politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1940161212468031">Cappella and Jamieson 1996</xref>: 79). Clearly, there are other important aspects of election coverage, but these frames provide very useful insights into this vital set-piece for the media and democracy.</p>
<p>The explanations for the choice of frames relate to the long-term development of public opinion, politics, and the economy, perhaps most famously seen in the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1940161212468031">Habermas (1989)</xref>. Commercialization has been a particular focus of media studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1940161212468031">Curran 2011</xref>: 88; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1940161212468031">Patterson 2000</xref>: 253; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1940161212468031">Williams 1965</xref>: 226). Here, we concentrate on the way commercial pressure affects the framing of elections. Hallin and Mancini synthesize many literatures to categorize media systems as being polarized pluralist, democratic corporatist, or liberal. Commercialism plays a major role in their analysis:
<disp-quote>
<p>In the liberal countries, the media are closer to the world of business and further from the world of politics. In the polarized pluralist systems, they are relatively strongly integrated into the political world, while in the democratic corporatist countries the media have strong connections to both the political and economic worlds. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1940161212468031">Hallin and Mancini 2004</xref>: 76)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Hallin and Mancini argue that commercialized newspapers are less likely to emphasize politics in the way their politically connected predecessors did in many countries. However, they note that the empirical literature on the amount of coverage devoted to elections offers contradictory findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1940161212468031">Hallin and Mancini 2004</xref>: 280–81). On framing, Hallin and Mancini’s extremely wide-ranging discussion does not directly engage with the game and issue frames. However, they think that commercialism drives “personalization and the tendency to privilege the point of view of the ‘ordinary citizen’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1940161212468031">Hallin and Mancini 2004</xref>: 279). The first is associated with the game frame’s emphasis on the leadership. Hallin and Mancini also link commercialism to “information-oriented” as opposed to “commentary-oriented” journalism. The former seems more consistent with following a competition between teams of players than the latter, which appears more appropriate to principled policy debate. It is important to emphasize that this does not mean the game frame is inherently more superficial or less political. Those with a great interest in politics will often be keen to follow the details of campaign strategy and closely evaluate political leaders. Similarly, issues are frequently presented in simplistic terms by newspapers, perhaps with the aim of catching the attention of less politicized readers.</p>
<p>Hallin and Mancini do not directly address our research question; nevertheless, their approach links commercialism and the game frame. They rank media systems in terms of the importance of commercialism, and therefore help inspire a cross-national hypothesis for the relative importance of the game frame. Hallin and Mancini also think media systems have been commercializing over time and that this process has been particularly striking in systems where commercialism was previously less important. This means that the game frame should be increasing over time. Moreover, the further commercialization has proceeded the clearer should be the predominance of the game across media systems and the narrower should be the differences between media systems.</p>
<p>The specific literature on election framing also mentions commercialism. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1940161212468031">Strömbäck and Kaid (2008)</xref> formulate a clear hypothesis: “[T]he more commercialized a particular media system is, the more likely it is that politics will be framed as a game rather than issues” (p. 8).</p>
<p>They also mention the importance of ownership that can vary within, as well as between, countries. Public companies are under the most immediate commercial pressure, but family-owned outlets or those responsible to a trust do not necessarily have to be so responsive to commercial imperatives. Elsewhere, Strömbäck and van Aelst target revenue sources, rather than ownership, to proxy commercial pressure. They argue that newsstand newspapers are driven to cover politics as a game, using headlines stressing who is going to win, rather than dry reports about complex policy positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1940161212468031">Strömbäck and van Aelst 2010</xref>: 46). Thus, this empirical literature is consistent with Hallin and Mancini in perceiving commercialism as the “driving force” behind the metaframing of politics as a game (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1940161212468031">Strömbäck and van Aelst 2010</xref>: 55) and explaining both cross- and intranational variation in election coverage. Nonetheless, there is obvious room for improvement, especially in empirical testing.</p>
<p>We break the commercialism thesis down into two hypotheses: commercialism and convergence, and variations in commercialism. We also state clear operational hypotheses that can be applied at the level of media systems or media outlets:</p>
<list id="list1-1940161212468031" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: A convergence on commercialism explains a convergence on the game frame.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1a</italic>: The game frame predominates within all outlets or systems.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1b</italic>: There is a narrow range of framing between outlets or systems.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Variations in commercialism explain variations in framing.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2a</italic>: More commercialized outlets or systems tend to emphasize the game.</p></list-item></list>
<p>We are able to evaluate all of the other hypotheses above in both cross-national and intranational versions.</p>
<p>Intranational studies of election coverage are usually careful to vary the format of newspapers by selecting tabloids and broadsheets. This is on the basis that tabloids will be more likely portray politics as a game because of their greater focus on “infotainment” and dependence on newsstand sales. However, format affects the extent of election coverage as well as framing. Indeed, so does commercialism. Imagine a paper that frames 90 percent of its election coverage as issues but only devotes 1 percent of the newspaper to the election. Imagine another paper that frames 50 percent of its election coverage as issues and dedicates 50 percent of the newspaper to the election. Which is the most issue oriented? Surely the latter, in which 25 percent of the paper covers the issues of the election, as opposed to the former, in which only 0.009 percent of the paper deals with issues of the election. Commercialization and tabloid format drive the marginalization of election coverage in addition to, and to a greater extent, than they drive framing as a game. The extent to which politics is covered is an important part of Hallin and Mancini’s discussion of the effects of commercialism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1940161212468031">Hallin and Mancini 2004</xref>: 280–81). Consider how a tabloid can sensationalize a policy issue such as social welfare provision or immigration. Furthermore, “horse-race” coverage is important even to policy-oriented readers because it indicates what policies are likely to be implemented. The format will have a primary impact on tone, but beyond tone, the format should also determine the degree to which politics is covered at all, not merely the nature of political coverage. If tabloids are bought primarily to entertain rather than inform, election coverage must compete with sport, entertainment, and human-interest stories. The hypothetical example above is not too far away from some examples in our Irish sample. If we adopt the literature’s standard and calculate issues as a proportion of election coverage, we end up with some rather strange results. For our Irish case study, we are able to test our hypotheses about the predominance of the game as a proportion of both election coverage and the newspaper’s overall content.</p>

<sec id="section3-1940161212468031">
<title>The Irish Case</title>
<p>Ireland provides a useful case study for the question of game versus issue frames and variation in election coverage because it allows us to distinguish between the paper’s commercial basis and the format. There are a number of companies in the Irish market that own both tabloid and broadsheet newspapers. But Ireland is also different in that no papers have a bedrock of subscribers, so all depend on newsstand sales to maintain their position in the market. There are, however, important differences in their dependence on advertising revenue. We begin with a consideration of the commercial situation of Irish newspapers and then move on to more political variables.</p>
<p>The subscription model has never managed to develop a substantial income in Ireland. Like their counterparts in other countries, newspapers in Ireland have had to cope with rapid change in terms of a loss of readers, advertising, and business value. Circulation and advertising have been undermined by the Internet. The collapse in the Irish economy from 2008 onward, and the wider international financial crisis, has compounded a difficult situation. Nevertheless, through programs of aggressive cost cutting, some publishers have succeeded maintaining profitability, albeit at lower levels than previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1940161212468031">Raleigh 2011</xref>). This approach has necessitated some difficult decisions: Independent News &amp; Media (INM) shut down two loss-making titles in 2011.</p>
<p>Irish newspaper circulation has fallen for several successive years. Sales of the seven leading national daily newspapers declined by 19 percent between 2007 and 2011.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1940161212468031">1</xref></sup> Advertising revenue declined by 7 percent in 2010. Continued decline was predicted for traditional newspaper advertising as online advertising grows. The newspaper publishers in this study have struggled with these declines in circulation rates and advertising revenues, as well as the impact of the Internet. All newspapers in the Irish market are privately owned, either as publicly quoted companies or as private entities (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1940161212468031">Table 1</xref>). Because of historical ties and close geographical proximity, the leading British newspaper groups have a significant presence in the Irish market. Yet, regardless of whether they are classified as either “Irish owned” or “Irish editions of British newspapers,” all the leading national daily and Sunday titles included in this study are dependent on commercial revenues. However, they vary in their degree of commercialization.</p>

<p><italic>The Irish Times</italic> is owned by a complex charitable trust—somewhat akin to the Guardian in the United Kingdom. Nonetheless, during the economic boom, <italic>The Irish Times</italic> invested in several businesses outside its core newspaper operation in a manner similar to its competitors. Nevertheless, given its trust structure <italic>The Irish Times</italic> is not answerable to shareholders, as in a publicly quoted company, or to personal owners, as in a privately owned entity. This arrangement ensures the newspaper is not exclusively focused on profit maximization. As its readership is predominantly middle class and well educated, <italic>The Irish Times</italic> has been able to rely more on advertising revenue and less on circulation than its competitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1940161212468031">Competition Authority 1995</xref>). <italic>The Irish Times</italic> should be under less pressure to report the “game” than its competitors.</p>
<p>The largest newspaper group in Ireland, INM, is a publicly quoted company that publishes the <italic>Irish Independent</italic>, the <italic>Sunday Independent</italic>, and the <italic>Sunday World</italic>. It also jointly owns the <italic>Irish Daily Star</italic> with the U.K.-based Express Newspapers. INM has a range of international media interests. Its longtime dominant shareholder, Sir Anthony O’Reilly, is the closest Irish example to a media baron in the newspaper industry. Nonetheless, the fact that INM quoted on the stock market means it is profit driven. O’Reilly’s control of the company has been challenged by another investor, Denis O’Brien, who has sought a much more profit-driven approach. If the first hypothesis is correct, this approach to profit should mean the INM newspapers in this study are under some pressure to promote the “game” to win readers and advertisers. In comparison with <italic>The Irish Times</italic>, the INM newspapers have been much more dependent on sales rather than advertising.</p>
<p>The other significant “local” newspaper publisher in the Irish market is Thomas Crosbie Holdings (TCH), a privately owned business that publishes the daily <italic>Irish Examiner</italic> and the weekly <italic>Sunday Business Post</italic>. Like <italic>The Irish Times</italic>, the <italic>Sunday Business Post</italic> derives a relatively large proportion of its income from advertising. The <italic>Irish Examiner</italic>, also owned by Crosbie, is more dependent on sales. As TCH is a private company, it does not face shareholder pressure to maximize profits to maintain dividends and share price.</p>
<p>The other main national newspapers with significant circulation rates are all U.K. owned and produce specific editions of their British newspapers for their Irish market. This category includes the Associated Press titles, the <italic>Irish Daily Mail</italic> and <italic>Irish Mail on Sunday</italic>, as well as <italic>The Irish Sun</italic>, the <italic>Sunday Times</italic>, and the now defunct <italic>News of the World</italic>, the latter three titles published by News International. While these firms have made sizable investments in their Irish operations, they could relatively easily withdraw from the Irish market. In this regard, these two British publishers should be under greater pressure than their Irish-owned competitors to maintain sales and portray politics as a “game.”</p>
<p>Ireland is a famous exception to the clear left–right structuring of most Western party systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1940161212468031">Carty 1981</xref>: 110; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1940161212468031">Mair and Weeks 2005</xref>: 136). There is no major difference on the socioeconomic questions that dominate politics and the news, and, particularly dominated the Irish general election of 2011. All papers take a broadly right-of-center line, although there is more variation in terms of issues of personal morality. It appears that this ideological consensus emanates from an editorial stance, rather than the views of the journalists themselves. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1940161212468031">Corcoran’s (2004)</xref> survey of Irish journalists revealed a profession markedly more liberal and left wing than their readers. The source of this editorial stance is harder to know, but it is presumably related to a commercial judgment to reflect the views of a society in which the left has always been marginalized. There is insufficient variation for ideological commitment to explain different framing of elections.</p>
<p>The seismic Irish election of 2011 massively increased the proportion of coverage given to issues compared with 2002 and 2007.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1940161212468031">2</xref></sup> While the 2002 and 2007 elections took place in the context of buoyant economic growth, the 2011 election occurred in a local recession and global financial crisis. In an attempt to prevent a banking crisis in 2008, Ireland assumed the large loan-books of several financial institutions, the majority of which were ultimately shown to be worth much less than had been thought. The challenges of curtailing public deficits and dealing with the banking crisis proved too great, and in November 2010, Ireland sought external assistance from the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission, and the European Central Bank. The incumbent coalition government eventually fell, but not before a further so-called “austerity” budget was passed. Unsurprisingly, the economy featured prominently in the February 2011 election campaign.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1940161212468031">Brandenburg and Zalinski (2008</xref>: 172–73) show that between 2002 and 2007, election coverage in tabloids decreased in comparison with broadsheets. However, the increase in 2011 occurred more or less equally across newspaper types when comparing data from this study with that for 2007.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1940161212468031">3</xref></sup> Therefore, the particular characteristics of the election did not change the ranking of the newspapers. Indeed, the direction of the change also rules out the recent emergence of “antipolitics” as an explanation for game framing. As the ranking of the papers did not change and there is no ideological variation, it is possible to concentrate on newspaper type and ownership in attempting to explain differences in framing across 2011 election coverage. Therefore, our case selection has a clear rationale in relation to the general literature on political communications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1940161212468031">Norris 2009</xref>: 337). Moreover, as the following section shows, its measures are comparable with those used in studies of other countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1940161212468031">Norris 2009</xref>: 340).</p>

<title>Benchmarking Cross-National Comparison of Election Coverage</title>
<p>In their study of Sweden and Belgium, Strömbäck and van Aelst identify all articles that “explicitly referred to domestic political actors or institutions or the elections” in the three weeks before the 2006 general election in Sweden and the 2007 general election in Belgium. They include news stories of more than ten sentences in the main section. They code all articles as game or issue on a “dominant frame basis” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1940161212468031">Strömbäck and van Aelst 2010</xref>: 48). The other country comparisons we cite here used a virtually identical methodology.</p>
<p>We coded newspaper articles from each of the twenty-four days of the official 2011 election campaign. The analysis includes twelve national newspapers, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1940161212468031">Table 1</xref>. The coders went through the news, and news review sections of each newspaper, numbering all articles that covered the election. A random number generator was used to select 40 percent of the articles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1940161212468031">4</xref></sup> This study is restricted to all articles of more than two hundred words in the main section of the newspapers, of which there are 798. Instead of coding a whole article, we coded by “quasi-sentence.” Quasi-sentences are used as the coding unit in the Comparative Manifestos Project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1940161212468031">Budge et al. 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>We understand “the game” to refer to the
<disp-quote>
<p>strategy of political campaigning, . . . the horserace and battle for voters, . . . the images of politicians . . . political power as a goal in and of itself, or . . . politicians and persons rather than as spokespersons for certain policies. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1940161212468031">Cappella and Jamieson 1996</xref>: 74; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1940161212468031">Strömbäck and van Aelst 2010</xref>: 48; Codes 130, 140, and 150 in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1940161212468031">Appendix 1</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We coded coverage of issues and issue positions, and the consequences of these issue positions (Codes 10–120). We count an article as game- or issue oriented if a majority of its quasi-sentences fit into the category in question.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1940161212468031">5</xref></sup> The distinction between issue- and game-oriented election coverage is theoretically and substantively appealing. We investigated its empirical power using a principal components analysis. Using nineteen codes on 1,440 articles, of all lengths in all sections and including commentary and editorials, our analysis shows that components loading positively on game codes and negatively on coverage of the economy are the most powerful in summarizing the variety of content in our articles (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-1940161212468031">Appendix 2</xref> for details). Thus, these two generic frames also have an empirical basis in our data.</p>
<p>We measured intercoder reliability in a number of ways. Because the unit of analysis for our two coders was the quasi-sentence rather than the whole article, we sampled twenty-six articles to give us up to 501 units. If we code each article as whether it is predominantly game or policy using the aggregate scores of each quasi-sentence, we find almost complete agreement (twenty-five out of twenty-six), but as the number of articles is low, we prefer to use Krippendorff’s alpha. It is a conservative measure for intercoder reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1940161212468031">Lombard et al. 2002</xref>: 600). We treated each potential code as the unit of analysis, and for each article, we assigned each quasi-sentence to a code. For the sample, the Krippendorff’s alpha was .66 if we treat the data as ratio or .93 if we assume the data as interval. Intercoder reliability scores compare well with Strömbäck and van Aelst’s work as well as similar studies.

<p>Readers of the Quality Press in Britain and Ireland will be surprised to find the tabloid <italic>Daily Mail</italic> that has the second highest proportion of issue-oriented articles. The <italic>Sunday Business Post</italic> is placed first and the self-styled “newspaper of record,” <italic>The Irish Times</italic>, is third. The two most game-oriented newspapers, the <italic>News of the World</italic> and the <italic>Sunday World</italic>, conform to stereotypes: two Sunday tabloids that concentrate heavily on crime, sport, and entertainment news.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1940161212468031">Table 3</xref> tests whether newspaper type or commercial position can explain the framing of election news. Predictably, the findings show that tabloid newspapers are more game oriented than broadsheets. Sunday qualities are somewhat more issue oriented than dailies, but the relationship is reversed among tabloids. Indeed, the real contrast is between the Sunday tabloids and the rest: They are much more game-oriented focus than the other types of paper. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1940161212468031">Table 3</xref> also offers moderate support for the hypothesis that different commercial situations can explain variations in election coverage framing. The trust- and privately owned newspapers are more issue oriented than publicly owned newspapers. Among the publicly owned newspapers, those with Irish ownership are more issue oriented. However, more subtle distinctions do not seem to hold. The private category is slightly more issue oriented than the trust category. The U.K. and Ireland publicly owned paper is somewhat more issue oriented than the publicly owned Irish newspapers. And, of course, most of the tabloids are in the U.K.-owned category, making their strong game orientation difficult to explain as an ownership effect. Overall, the Irish data emphatically did not support the hypothesis that commercialization has caused a convergence of election coverage. It does suggest that variations in the commercial sensitivity of papers tend to explain the predominance of the game frame.</p>

<p>The Strömbäck method identifies the framing of election coverage, while ignoring the extent of election coverage. Here, we include the amount of election coverage in each newspaper, and present a method of analysis that produces significantly different results.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1940161212468031">6</xref></sup> In our sample, there were huge differences in the proportion of articles covering the election campaign ranging from as little as 3 percent in the <italic>News of the World</italic> to some 35 percent in the <italic>Sunday Business Post</italic>. The <italic>y</italic>-axis of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1940161212468031">Figure 1</xref> displays the same statistic as earlier tables—the proportion of policy-oriented election articles minus the proportion of game-oriented articles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1940161212468031">7</xref></sup> The <italic>x</italic>-axis shows the proportion of election articles in each newspaper. By adopting this approach, we find that the Irish <italic>News of the World</italic> and <italic>Sunday World</italic> stand out with a game orientation and a low proportion of election articles. The other ten newspapers occupy the top half of the range of the policy variable, but represent virtually the whole range of proportion of election coverage. Thinking of this heterogeneous group as a quadrilateral, one corner would be occupied by <italic>The Sun</italic>, which has the highest proportion of policy-oriented articles but the second lowest proportion of election coverage. The <italic>Daily Star</italic> also has a low proportion of election coverage but is relatively game oriented. The <italic>Sunday Independent</italic> is the most game oriented of the large group but has the second highest proportion of election coverage. Finally, the <italic>Sunday Business Post</italic> dedicated more of its newspaper to the election than any other title and has a relatively issue-oriented profile. Obviously, there is little correlation between the proportion of election coverage and the frame dominating that coverage.</p>

<p>These new results largely reflect the conventional view that tabloid newspapers use the game frame as a smaller proportion of the newspaper’s overall space. There is a statistically significant difference between broadsheets and tabloids on this measure (.115 vs. .048, <italic>p</italic> = .013) if we group each paper by its physical format. However, neither do the results merely reproduce stereotypes. The <italic>Irish Mail on Sunday</italic> may mostly concentrate on the game, but overall, it is one of the papers most concerned with the election. A quarter of its articles were election oriented—the same fraction as <italic>The Irish Times</italic>. In terms of the overall newspaper content, it is the third most issue oriented.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1940161212468031">Table 5</xref> presents these figures by newspaper type and commercial situation. All the papers in the trust, private, and public (Ireland) categories are broadsheets, but there are important differences between them. The only paper in the public (Ireland-U.K.) category is a tabloid. It has a higher proportion of issue-oriented election coverage than the six U.K.-owned newspapers, which include the broadsheet <italic>Sunday Times</italic>. However, the overall low score of the public-U.K. category may well reflect the five tabloids in that category. The daily tabloids now come well behind the daily broadsheets, just ahead of the Sunday broadsheets. The Sunday tabloids continue to occupy a distinctive position. The rank order of the different ownership models now fits the framing of the election perfectly. The more commercially sensitive are the newspapers owners’, the lower is the proportion of issue-oriented election coverage. Thus, the association between commercial differences and framing cannot be reduced to differences in the format of the papers.</p>

<p>The data also reject the convergence hypothesis even more strongly. The score for the most issue-oriented paper is now nineteen times that for the least issue oriented versus a multiple of less than five before the extent of election coverage was factored in. The second most issue-oriented paper is over seven times that of the second least issue-oriented paper versus a little over three times in the previous version. Although these results are striking, the number of newspapers means that the research must be regarded as exploratory. More definite conclusions probably require time series of framing and commercialization.</p>
<p>The results are consistent with different interpretations of the relationship between commercial position, newspaper format, and the framing of general elections. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1940161212468031">Figure 2</xref> presents two alternative causal models. First, it is possible that format and business model independently affect the framing of elections. Broadsheet newspapers emphasize politics at the expense of entertainment news or sport and frame elections in terms of issues rather than a political game. Commercially sensitive newspapers concentrate on entertainment news and sport instead of politics and their election coverage is dominated by the game frame. Second, perhaps there is a partial dependence between business model and format. Short-term, profit-maximizing owners may prefer tabloids to broadsheets, both in terms of purchasing and founding titles. Nonetheless, the format of a newspaper and its framing of elections can only be influenced, not controlled, by owners. Existing newspapers will have a reputation and a market segment that it would be foolhardy to ignore. Moreover, the professional ethos of journalists will often defend editorial autonomy and issue-oriented framing.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1940161212468031">Table 6</xref> benchmarks Ireland against four other cases. These countries were chosen because they have been studied according to a common methodology, which we have managed to closely replicate, and because they represent different media systems and levels of commercialization. According to Hallin and Mancini’s account of the relationship between media system and commercialization and their placement of each country, the cases can be ranked from most to least commercial: the United States, Ireland, Spain, Belgium, and Spain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1940161212468031">Hallin and Mancini 2004</xref>: 70). The findings tend to confirm the convergence hypothesis. All except Ireland exhibit the dominance of the game. The cross-national range is 41 versus 129 within Ireland. This is only 20 percent of the theoretical maximum range, so it can be interpreted as relatively narrow. However, the figures do not support the commercialization thesis. The framing data do not match the order predicted by the relationship between media system and commercialization. Ireland is the most out of place, but Spain and Belgium are two places away from their positions as predicted by Hallin and Mancini’s ranking of commercialism. So, even without the Irish case, which is affected by the economic crisis, these ranks are problematic for the commercialization argument.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, our comparator studies do not include data on the proportion of the newspapers dedicated to election coverage. Therefore, we cannot calculate an improved statistic as we did for Ireland. This leaves the results open to very different interpretations. Perhaps the measurements are misleading and, if weighted by coverage, the framing figures would correlate with levels of commercialization. Alternatively, perhaps the figures represent well the differences between the media systems: While levels of commercialization can explain differences within media systems they cannot explain variations across media system, probably because the effects of political system are more powerful than those of commercial imperatives. Moreover, framing is surely influenced by how political context can change in one country. For example, in a close election, the press might tend to frame the election as a game. However, in an economic crisis, there might be a tendency toward issue framing.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Many scholars conclude that commercialization results in a depoliticization of newspapers. Instead of protagonists in political struggle, they become instruments of social control. Irish newspapers are hardly radical and reflect the unusually narrow center–right consensus of Irish politics and society. Nonetheless, our research uncovers great diversity in the extent to which the election is covered and the way in which the election is framed. Even though our research is exploratory, our results are consistent with the idea that different commercial situations lead to different framing of politics. A useful characteristic of the Irish case is that commercial situation and newspaper type can be separated. Broadsheets on average have a relatively strong representation of the issue frame. Nevertheless, the rank order of newspapers casts doubt on simple stereotypes of game-oriented tabloids and issue-oriented broadsheets.</p>
<p>The results of this Irish election study can be compared with research on the media and elections in other countries. Following the standard of the literature produces an ordering of countries that does not seem to correlate with the commercialization of media systems. There are several possible interpretations of the absence of a pattern such as the weakness of cross-national theory and differences between the salience of elections. This article proposes a new and relatively straightforward explanation for this puzzle. It seems very likely that newspapers vary, not just in how they frame elections but in the amount of coverage they devote to elections. If this is true, a recalculation of the figures on the framing of elections might well produce results that confirm, rather than confound, media systems theory. We ranked ownership types by commercial sensitivity, but it may be possible to find more direct measures of commercialization such as sources of revenue in further research. The newspaper retains an important role in politics in contemporary democracies, but it is clear that its heyday has passed. The alternative frames of the game and issues can also be applied to broadcast and online media, as can our measures. In principle, hypotheses about business models and framing should be relevant to other media too. It would be very interesting to see whether ownership variations drive choice of frame in other media in a similar way to that suggested by our research. A series of consistent case studies would allow a more illuminating test of media systems theory than has been hitherto achieved. Indeed, they might even serve as a basis for the quantitative cross-national studies that are so common in other social science disciplines.</p>

<p>To interpret the components, we have highlighted loadings on variables of more than 0.25 and less than -0.25 in bold. Thus, the first component primarily identifies articles that concentrate on polls and the “horse race,” and secondarily identifies articles that tend to have little coverage of the economy. The second component primarily identifies articles on campaigning, again eliding economic issues. The second component also de-emphasizes polls and the horse race. In other words, the two dominant metaframes are the game and issues. Moreover, these two metaframes are alternatives to each other. Given that we had a coding scheme, this process is, of course, not entirely inductive. However, given that there were nineteen, not just two, codes, this exercise suggests that the generic frames fit the structure of Irish newspaper coverage of elections and are not misleading, externally imposed artifacts.</p>
