<abstract>
<p>The acknowledgement of basic human vulnerability in relationships between mental health service users and professionals working in community-based mental health services (in Norway) was a starting point. The purpose was to explore how users of these services describe and make sense of their meetings with other people. The research is collaborative, with researcher and person with experienced-based knowledge cooperating through the research process. Data is derived from 19 interviews with 11 people who depend on mental health services for assistance at least three times a week. Data is analysed according to the Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Results confirm that reciprocity is fundamental for relationships, and that recognizing the individual entails personal involvement. The participants describe a struggle, and recognizing this struggle may help the professional to achieve a deeper understanding of the individual. </p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Being seen and valued as a human being is essential to all people. The absolute dignity (menschenwürde) or basic humanity that all humans share<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733011423293">1</xref></sup>
<sup>,</sup>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733011423293">2</xref></sup> is maintained and promoted when a person is recognized by others. ‘Social dignity’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733011423293">3</xref></sup> is used to explain the reflection or mirrored image of absolute dignity, as a person’s humanity depends on, is created by and is upheld in social settings. An individual’s dignity depends on being able to recognize humanity in others and having one’s own humanity recognized by others. To recognize means to see once more, to accept, to distinguish, to acknowledge, to understand and to strengthen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733011423293">4</xref></sup> Thus, humanity implies vulnerability as we depend on others for recognition. When people depend on professional help in everyday life their vulnerability becomes more obvious. This may explain why different aspects of dignity and issues connected to recognition are included in many studies about patient’s experiences with mental health services. (Previous studies conducted in ‘hospitals settings’ have used the term ‘patients’. This article uses ‘service-user’ as this is the term used in community-based mental health services.) Being respected as a ‘normal person’ is mentioned as part of recovery from mental illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733011423293">5</xref></sup> Other ways of expressing this is ‘being perceived as a human being’, ‘to experience reciprocity in contact with others’,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733011423293">6</xref></sup> ‘to be confirmed’, ‘to be listened to’ and ‘to be seen as an individual’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733011423293">7</xref></sup> </p>
<p>How mental health patients perceive themselves is related to their experience of being recognized by professional helpers and this relationship is a necessary context for recovery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0969733011423293">8</xref></sup> Dignity is the foundation for the relief of suffering.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733011423293">9</xref></sup> A lack of confirmation in the patient-caregiver relationship may contribute to a feeling of being a burden, and verbal contact with staff is essential for the process of healing and the desire to go on living.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969733011423293">10</xref></sup> The patient can feel respected only if the helper understands, and this requires involvement and courage from the care-giver. If the level of closeness is low, it will reduce the patient’s chance of maintaining his/her dignity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733011423293">11</xref></sup> </p>
<p>In the current article, the word ‘recognize’ is used to express the maintaining of one’s dignity and it is implicit that a person’s basic human value depends on relationships. Recognizing in this sense of the word is an issue in many studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733011423293">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733011423293"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733011423293"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0969733011423293"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733011423293"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969733011423293"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733011423293"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0969733011423293"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733011423293"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733011423293"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969733011423293">15</xref></sup> which can be seen as a reminder of the need for a continued focus on this basic ethical quality. It is part of professional’s basic knowledge to recognize service-users, at the same time it seems to be so common for the service-users to experience not being recognized. This indicates a need to keep looking for new perspectives and deeper understanding of service-users’ values and priorities in meeting with professionals. This study attempts to bring out one such perspective by exploring how mental health service-users describe and make sense of their encounters with other people. Special attention is given to how this perspective is a message to professionals about ethical priorities when relating to service-users. </p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) was used as foundation for this study. IPA helps to explore people’s relationship to the world and how they make sense of their life experiences. This is personal to each of us and at the same time a property of our relationships with the world and others. There is a quest to examine these life-experiences on its own terms, rather than according to a predefined category system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969733011423293">16</xref></sup> Collaborative research involving person with knowledge based on experience as user of mental health services was used in order to widen the perspective and strengthen the relevance of the research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969733011423293">17</xref></sup>

<title>Ethical considerations</title>
<p>The Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics in eastern Norway approved the study (Ref 2009/1316). The participants signed a written consent and were informed that they were free to withdraw at any time during the study. They were also told during the interviews that they could contact the health service workers or the interviewers if they regretted giving any information or needed support after the interview.</p>

<sec id="section4-0969733011423293">
<title>Participants and data-collection</title>
<p>The participants were recruited among users of community-based mental health services in a rural area of Norway. People who were older than 18 and used mental health services at least three times a week could be included. The participants represent the perspective of people living with mental health problems, and depend on others for support and help in their everyday lives. Potential participants were informed about the study by posters, information meetings, written information and by professionals in the community-based mental health services. The interviewers met each potential participant in a ‘pre-meeting’. In this meeting the participant had the opportunity to decide if the interviewers and the study seemed trustworthy, and their final decision to participate could be done without the knowledge of the professionals. Time and place for the interview was decided in cooperation with the participant, 17 interviews were held in the local library and two in participants’ homes. All who volunteered for the study were included. Some details about the participants can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0969733011423293">Table 1</xref>. </p>

<p>The interview-guide was open, and focussed on feelings and thoughts about meetings and relations to other people. The interviewers initiated a theme and the participants were given space and time to talk even if the apparent relevance was not clear to the interviewers at the time. The interviewers focussed on responding to make the participant feel the message was received, and by exploring details, feelings and thoughts the participant had related to their narratives. This was done in order to explore how the everyday experience was an ‘experience of importance’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969733011423293">16</xref></sup> Two interviews with each participant were planned in order to ensure detail and richness of the data and at the same time allow for short sessions in case of impaired concentration. The researchers did a tentative analysis after the first interview, and the second interview was based on this. Eight of the participants agreed to be interviewed twice. A PhD student with background as a nurse and a co-researcher with experienced-based knowledge from being a user of mental health services conducted the interviews together. The interviews, which lasted between 40–90 minutes, were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim.</p>
<p>An interview is an interaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969733011423293">16</xref></sup> in which the participant and the interviewers work towards a common understanding. The agenda for the conversation is set in the research question, at the same time the participant is given power in the sense that the answer lays with him and the interviewers need to be humble and open to this. The participant’s presentation of his life-world and the way this is met by the researcher’s professional knowledge and the co-researcher’s experience-based knowledge is the basis for the analysis. During the interviews the interviewers encouraged the participants to talk more about what each of them found to be relevant issues. </p>

<sec id="section5-0969733011423293">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>The framework for analysis described in Smith et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969733011423293">16</xref></sup> was followed. ‘Step one: Reading and re-reading’ involved the researcher and co-researcher getting to know the material by listening, reading and reflecting several times. ‘Step two: Initial noting’, was first done individually by the researcher and co-researcher, and the notes were used as foundation for discussions that led to insight in the transcribed material and the participants’ perspective and understanding. Notes based on these discussions were made. ‘Step three: Developing emergent themes’ and ‘Step four: Searching for connections across emerging themes’ was a process which involved looking at the details, the whole and the notes taken. Data from each participant was analysed independently, to include the individual’s understanding. Tentative themes were decided on, and changed again as they seemed to either be too shallow or not to capture the essence of the material. A narrative including the main findings in the material across the participants was written and discussed among the research-team. Based on this new themes emerged and were adjusted as we went back to the details in the transcribed data. Emphasis was on staying as close to the material as possible while also interpreting and structuring it in order to bring out its essence. The results are a joint product of the participants and the researchers. It is a representation of the participants’ lived experience, but at the same time the researcher’s account of how the participants are thinking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969733011423293">16</xref></sup> The analysis revealed that the participants describe that there is a struggle, an effort and even a fight to be oneself and be part of a fellowship with others. These struggles are important parts of how they make sense of who they are in relation to the world around them. Thus, two of the main themes in the structural analysis were: ‘It’s a struggle to be me’ and ‘It’s a struggle to be recognized’. A third theme describes the ideal situation: ‘I have been recognized’. In the findings ‘participant’ and ‘service-user’ are used interchangeably, ‘he’ means ‘he or she’ and each participant is identified by a number.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<disp-quote>
<p>It has been important to me at least that they (the professionals) have given something of themselves. Perhaps talk a little about own experiences. That’s when we become human. Everyone has their own issues, in a way. It can’t always be compared, but to see that they are actually human, that they share from their experiences, that they show their humanity. They do not have to reveal themselves. The fact that they show they care. That I’m not only someone in the crowd. Feeling like a person in a way, not just a case. (Participant 11)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This quotation represents the essence of the participants’ description of being recognized. There is emphasis on mutual recognition of each others’ value as human beings. It entails being a person, a self or a valued individual and having a sense of sharing that humanity with the other person. There is a give and take for the involved parties. To reveal one’s humanity is prerequisite. The quotation: ‘That’s when we become human’ points beyond acting a role or having a label that defines you. </p>
<p>The material reveals that ‘to be recognized’ is a process that the person is involved in and that this process is inseparable from the world around him. The person needs to come to terms with who he is, who he would like to be and how he can be recognized by others. In this process his thoughts about himself are mingled with experienced expectations from others. The person has the power to reveal or hide the self, and being able to trust the professional as well as the professionals’ receptiveness decides the degree of openness. Professionals take away the opportunity for sharing by being indifferent, not understanding or by setting an agenda that the service-user does not recognize. </p>
<sec id="section7-0969733011423293">
<title>It’s a struggle to be me</title>
<p>The struggle to be me seems to start in the experience of not being like ‘ordinary people’ (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0969733011423293">Table 2</xref>). The service-user needs to come to terms with ‘me’ within the limits set by the illness, the dreams and wishes that the person has for his life and the parameters set by society. ‘Ordinary people’ seems to be an image of who the individual would like to be or what he feels can be expected from a person in general which is coloured by expectations from other people. </p>

<p>A fundamental feeling of being worth less or having a lesser value as a person may become part of being ‘me’. <disp-quote>
<p>So I was not good enough. Typical; it’s always something like that. (Participant 3) </p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This is a profound feeling of not living up to one’s own and society’s expectations concerning everyday life such as ability to work, completing one’s education and managing household tasks. <disp-quote>
<p>I feel that I can’t manage anything. There are many things that I should have done that I can’t do, things that ordinary people manage. I can’t pull myself together for it. So I struggle a lot with these thoughts that everyone else can do, and that I cannot. (Participant 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition to this there could be changes in the body because of medication that influences the way the service-user thinks about himself and the way other people see him. <disp-quote>
<p>I gained (x) kg because of pills that I didn’t need. And now, I have lost it . . . And I'm struggling a bit with this now, because now everyone thinks I’m on drugs. So there are like a lot of problems on top of the other problems. (Participant 7) </p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There is sadness implied in the need to accept and come to terms with a realistic version of ‘me’ that fits what is possible to accomplish. <disp-quote>
<p>I do everything depending on the shape I'm in, so that’s very ok. I've hit the wall so many times that now I think I shouldn’t feel . . . (pause) What I have to learn is to set smaller goals than the big goal, because otherwise I feel like a total failure. (Participant 7) </p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>And even if the individual is able to accept ‘me’ despite the limitations, there may be a feeling of shame or guilt. <disp-quote>
<p>…But I often get a sense of guilt because I’m not working. (Participant 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Living with this sadness, and sometimes shame, makes it hard to face other people’s’ standards. One participant actively works at not being affected by derogatory remarks about people with no education: <disp-quote>
<p>I've learned to think like that. Before I didn’t think like that, but now I don’t care. Or it does affect me, but not so much that the world stops turning. (Participant 9)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>And even if the service- user is able to accept and value himself as he is, there is still a feeling of not being respected and accepted by other people. <disp-quote>
<p>It depends what you mean by respected. When you have a mental disorder . . . (pause) Many people have the attitude that it means you're crazy. I do notice that. (Participant 4)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0969733011423293">
<title>It’s a struggle to be recognized</title>
<p>The struggle for recognition is about revealing what others recognize and being forced to hide what others do not recognize. This is not always a conscious act, but is something the service-user seems to learn by experience. One participant was not recognized and ended up with no hope of ever getting help:<disp-quote>
<p>So I gave up eventually. I kept going (to the doctor). Finally I gave up. I wanted to talk to someone, but I never thought they would get it. They never got anything right in (name of city), so then you don’t think that they can do it somewhere else. (Participant 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In an acute situation, there may be a loss of control and a problem with understanding what is going on. <disp-quote>
<p>Because I did not know my own best interests. I couldn’t take care of myself. (Participant 11)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this vulnerable position there is a need for others to be in charge, and that implies reflecting an image to the individual that he can recognize. For the service-user, the vulnerability means leaving the power of definition in the hands of the professionals. Loneliness and desperation can be a result when this power is misused: <disp-quote>
<p>But it was like the wrong focus came on everything. I was not angry, but I became locked. So then I said nothing. They were somehow omniscient. And then I had to rely on them, I didn’t know better. But now I'm careful. (Participant 7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This means it is risky to trust the professionals to set the agenda and define the situation. The solution is to try to be in charge, which is another struggle: <disp-quote>
<p>You have to be well enough to manage to have some control. If you can’t, then you might get the wrong help, so I had to take responsibility. And it is a lot of stress. It’s a hassle. You have to be active. If you’re not, you won’t get better. (Participant 7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As a result maintaining the struggle and regaining control becomes necessary. Even if all the participants refer to situations in which they had a sense of ‘not knowing my own interest’, this was temporary. The narratives indicate clear visions of each person’s goals and obstacles. However, their visions are not always shared by the professionals, as some professionals have their own agenda or are not able to understand. Others do not seem to make an effort to get to know the individual or are not aware of the significance that an issue has in the service-user’s life. The service-user is left with a feeling of not being able to share with others what really matters:<disp-quote>
<p>Usually I'm not asked the right questions, so to speak. I don’t want to keep it secret, but people on the outside are not interested in listening to it. (Participant 3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Several participants talk about issues in the interviews that they are not able to share with professionals. They seem to think that there is no sense in sharing things that will not be understood or recognized. The result is they remain lonely in the struggle:<disp-quote>
<p>… so I’ve had a difficult time, having to carry this by myself . . . It's silly of me to explain why I can’t (the discussed problem) because no one understands it. So I've really struggled with myself, I did not tell the doctor or anything, I just kept it to myself. (Participant 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Knowing what can be revealed, to whom and in what situations is another struggle. It is about sharing and hiding, and depending on a chance for recognition or the risk of rejection. This implies portioning ‘me’ or working to protect ‘me’ by making adjustments. One way of doing this is to withdraw: <disp-quote>
<p>I must be as anonymous as possible. (Participant 3)</p>
<p>I dared not say anything. (Participant 10)</p>

<p>Another reaction is to play a role or pretend to be somebody else. Being in a hospital-ward might require looking more like a patient: <disp-quote>
<p>I couldn’t have put makeup on, or looked normal, because then I would sort of have been well. So you kind of had to use some tactic. (Participant 7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This portioning or adjustment is not only about protecting ‘me’, but also about struggling to be somebody the professionals will recognize. There is a need to adjust in order to maintain good relations with the professional: <disp-quote>
<p>Well if I say too much, he gets mad at me again, and then (pause) would not want me there. (pause) Yes, I try to be the good one, really. (Participant 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The participants realizes that there are limits to what individual professionals are able to understand and limits to what they can be expected to recognize. There is a need to partially conceal or to portion what is shared in order to protect one-self as well as the others:<disp-quote>
<p>And then I'm afraid that if I tell people how I feel, that I will bring them down. But I do sit down and tell them, about things that bother me and such, but I try to portion it out, so to speak. (Participant 7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The struggle for recognition is about deciding who you can trust and what is possible to reveal, which goes on all the time for some participants:<disp-quote>
<p>Always the antennas, you know, feelers, like for who you can talk to and what I can . . . but I miss with a lot of people, I make some mistakes. (Participant 4)</p>

<p>Losing control can be a crisis when there are problems with recognizing one-self. In this vulnerable position it seems to be possible to ‘re’-cognize (find back/see again) one-self in relation to others. ‘To be recognized’ by individuals and have a place in the fellowship is a step towards accepting and recognizing one-self. </p>

<title>I have been recognized</title>
<p>If the person is recognized, the struggle can be shared with others. Individuality is acknowledged, responsibility is shared and there is a sense of being like ‘ordinary people’ in relation to other people. Sharing oneself with others does not involve risks, and being vulnerable is less frightening as someone will recognize the person if he loses control. <disp-quote>
<p>7: It is not really explainable, because it is as it should be. Here, I do not think about it. (Researcher): Then you can just be yourself? 7: Yes, that’s right. I don’t have to think. (Participant 7)</p>
<p>It’s sort of an individual tolerance; if you are different then you will still be accepted. (Participant 3)</p>

<p>The need to decide what to reveal and what to hide is unnecessary. Good professionals are described as those who involve themselves and give of themselves in relation to the service-user. There is some type of reciprocity in the relation. <disp-quote>

<p>This can lead to a trusting relationship, and the participant can share the responsibilities and does not have to struggle alone. <disp-quote>
<p>If we are wondering about something, we try to figure it out. Without fussing about it. So there is cooperation; that’s what it is about. (Participant 7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The service- user feels respected and can count on being taken seriously. <disp-quote>
<p>He talked to you in a very different way. He was completely on ground level. He discussed. He took people seriously no matter what they said. (Participant 2)</p>

<p>This type of relation can be used to offer support and to challenge.<disp-quote>
<p>They are people who dare to confront me a bit and challenge me. And have faith that I can do this. Helping me to stretch boundaries a bit. (Participant 11)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Recognition is about special relations to individuals, but it is also feeling valued in general and this is connected to living up to one’s own and other’s expectations. It is easier for the person to live with illness and cope with not fulfilling his dreams and expectations when others accept and acknowledge.

<p>He told me that. Those words warmed my heart, really. I’ll always remember those words. (Participant 2)</p>

</disp-quote></p>
<p>The feeling of being appreciated or being valued is connected to being an ordinary person and doing what is expected. <disp-quote>

<p>To be recognized is about having a sense of being a valued human being in the eyes of oneself and in the eyes of others. These two aspects are inseparable; the struggle to value me is entwined with the struggle to be valued by others.

<title>To be recognized as a human being</title>
<p>The starting-point of this paper was that being recognized as a human being and being valued by others is essential to all people. Recognition of humaneness has been seen as a goal in itself, as this is about preserving and promoting the individual’s dignity. In the interviews, attention was paid to meetings and relations to other people in general, not only professionals. We did not ask what good care is or how they get the best help, even so it was presupposed that the results could contribute to professional knowledge of good care and useful help. It was assumed that the relation between professional and service-user is reciprocal and fundamentally the same as any other relationship in the sense that we are human beings that recognize others as human beings. We see the value of the other and at the same time the value in ourselves.</p>
<p>In order for the participant to be recognized as a human being, the professionals need to show themselves as human beings. The quote: ‘. . . they have given something of themselves . . . That’s when <underline>we</underline> become human.’ indicates an essential feeling of being like the other or sharing humaneness. Others said the professional was: ‘like a sister or a friend’, that they were ‘talking about everyday matters’ or ‘sharing their personal experiences’. Stabell and Nåden found this to be an ethical challenge to the nursing staff and add that involvement and courage from the care-giver is required.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733011423293">11</xref></sup> The need for being valued and sharing humaneness with others may also explain why the participants are so concerned with being like ‘ordinary people’ (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0969733011423293">Table 2</xref>). To be the same as other people would mean being a human being like other human beings. </p>
<p>Pettersen and Hem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0969733011423293">23</xref></sup> argue that reciprocity and ‘mature caring’ should be a normative basis for caring. The concept ‘mature care’ focuses on the interface between the carer and the cared for, and emphasizes caring relationship as an encounter between two equal human beings. (Full justice to the theory of ‘mature care’ is not done in this article.) Care is not something that is passively received by the patient. A reciprocal relation does not mean that there is no power-imbalance or asymmetry. There is acknowledgement that both the service-user’s and professional’s interests are equal in principle and the goal for the relation is the best interests of the service-user. Mature care will entail a dialogue where both parties have a voice and both parties are willing to change perspective and listen to the other.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0969733011423293">23</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>It makes sense to understand the relation as reciprocal as the participants describe clearly how they play an active part in relation to professionals. The struggle they describe for revealing what others recognize and to hide what others do not recognize show that they are in fact part of ‘mature’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0969733011423293">23</xref></sup> caring relationships. They possess ‘contextual sensitivity’ by considering possibilities and limitations in the situation and also seem to reflect on their own role in the relation. These are skills significant for ‘mature care’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0969733011423293">23</xref></sup> By understanding the relation as reciprocal there is an opportunity to take into consideration both parties’ contribution. </p>
<p>A reciprocal relation as a foundation means that the professionals cannot decide the agenda on their own. It is not possible for the professional to hide behind goal-oriented actions without attending to recognition of the individual’s situation. Defining what the best interest of the service-user is and how to understand the situation must be done in cooperation between professional and service-user. The aim for the community-based mental health services (in Norway) is <underline>goal-oriented</underline> activity in order to: ‘promote autonomy and sense of belonging and strengthen the ability to cope with their lives’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0969733011423293">18</xref></sup> This goal-orientation and focus on issues that are important from the professional’s point of view may be counteractive to reciprocity. Schibbye argues that in order to recognize the person, one cannot have a goal at the same time; there is no room for technique or instrumental thinking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733011423293">4</xref></sup> </p>

<title>To be recognized as a struggling human being</title>
<p>Various studies support the notion of ‘a struggle’ being an implicit aspect of living with chronic illness and depending on others for help. Lilja and Helzen interpret the experience of being a psychiatric inpatient ‘as a <italic>struggle</italic> for dignity in the face of discrimination and rejection’. That study describes how the patients strive for a sense of control by adapting or developing coping strategies in order to maintain their identity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733011423293">13</xref></sup> Perseus et al. write that living with a personality disorder is a ‘struggle for health and dignity’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733011423293">9</xref></sup> Lomborg et al. included people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who needed assisted personal body care. ‘Struggling for self-preservation’ was found to be the main issue. Their findings were the same as the current study on several issues: dependency is experienced as a problem in itself; strategies for coping with the dependency are accepting or reforming one’s way of thinking; and the need to economize in order to live with the limitations set by the illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969733011423293">19</xref></sup> </p>
<p>In order to help others, there is a need to ‘see the world with the eyes of the other person’,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0969733011423293">20</xref></sup> and being aware what the person’s individual struggle is about might be a way of fulfilling this. The participants said that the professionals: ‘have my best interest in mind’ and ‘want the best for me’. Even so, they did not experience to be recognized on their own terms. The professionals may not be aware of or, do not pay attention to the service-users’ struggle. A struggle may be conceived as something negative, and focussing on negative issues is opposed to values like positive thinking and promoting ‘healthy’ behaviour. But a struggle is also a positive drive, and the significance for the individual of the struggle to be me and the struggle to be recognized by others can be a key to the individual’s strengths and wish to belong. In a reciprocal relation the struggle could be investigated in order to find words to express what it entails. It may not make sense to make it the centre of attention all the time, but if the professional is aware of and take into consideration the issues the individual struggles with, there is an opportunity to share the burden as well as reflecting to the individual that their labours are recognized. In this way the mature caring will relieve pain as well as promote growth and development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0969733011423293">23</xref></sup>

<title>Methodological and ethical issues</title>
<p>There was a risk of adding burdens to the participants’ lives when confronting them with issues such as their relations to others and who they can trust. Speaking about sensitive issues such as loneliness might have revealed parts of their lives they were trying to deny. None of the participants said the interviews had made them uneasy or upset, while some stated it had brought new thoughts to their mind which they saw as something positive. They seemed to be conscious of their situation, and some expressed appreciation for the opportunity to speak about these issues. </p>
<p>The co-researcher contributed based on the experience of living with mental illness, whereas the researcher recognized and reflected based on theoretical knowledge and experience from clinical work. This dual perspective and cooperation has been used from the planning stages of the project, to data collection and analysis, and was used in order to broaden the horizon and as an attempt to come closer to the research-person’s perspective. The cooperation challenged the main researcher’s understanding of the data, and brought important insights and different priorities in terms of what was seen as significant.</p>
<p>In the interview-situation the presence of two interviewers may have increased the power imbalance between the interviewers and the participants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0969733011423293">22</xref></sup> It was assumed that the individual will tune in to the people facing him/her, and that what is relevant in the conversation depend on who is present. In this way it was possible to value the experienced-based knowledge. Some said it made no difference that the co-researcher was there, although others were very positive in saying it made them feel more secure and that speaking to people who shared their own experience was good, as they were sure to be understood. One participant did not want the co-researcher present.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The findings in this article show that mental health service-users are concerned with and value highly their relations to other people. They reflect on their own role in relationships to others and on how they believe others perceive them. They adapt their behaviour to enhance relationships with others, and consider what it is appropriate to share with which individual other. There is a strong wish to relate to others and to experience to have the same value as other people. </p>
<p>These findings are taken as an indication of the need of having reciprocity as a basic norm for relations between service-users and professionals. Reciprocity means recognizing each other as human beings, and that both parties in a relation have the same value and right to promote their interests. </p>
<p>The service-user’s perspective as they are presented in this article represents one part in the relation between professional and service-user. And if the relation is reciprocal this one-sided perspective cannot be taken as clear indications to what the professional’s response should be. The service-users ask for personal involvement, and professionals have to consider to what extent this would be possible and helpful. Professionals are challenged to recognize the individual’s struggle, and need to work out what it entails and if it will promote health to do so. And is it possible to provide services that are not goal-oriented? These issues need further discussion and research. </p>
