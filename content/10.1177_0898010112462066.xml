<abstract>
<p>Considering the paucity of studies dealing with the holistic aspect of the cancer experience, this grounded theory study seeks to conceptualize the process of cancer survivorship among Filipinos. Twenty-seven Filipino cancer survivors were purposively selected, and a two-part instrument, specifically <italic>robotfoto</italic> and focus group interviews, was used to gather data. The Glaserian method of grounded theory analysis was used, and extended texts were analyzed inductively via a dendrogram. Member checking and correspondence were observed to validate the surfacing stages, leading to the conceptualization of a theoretical model termed as the <italic>Ribbon of Cancer Survivorship</italic>. The said model describes the <italic>trifling</italic> (living before), <italic>transfusing</italic> (accepting the reality), <italic>transforming</italic> (being strong), and <italic>transcending</italic> (living beyond) phases of cancer survivorship. Ten interesting substages were also identified, namely: <italic>tainting, desolating, disrupting</italic>, and <italic>embracing</italic> for the transfusing phase; <italic>tormenting, distressing, awakening</italic>, and <italic>transfiguring</italic> for the transforming phase, and <italic>trembling</italic> and <italic>enlivening</italic> for the transcending phase. The resulting theoretical model has clearly and successfully described the entire process of cancer survivorship among Filipinos. It is hoped that the model be used as a reference for future studies about cancer survivorship and as a guide for nurses in providing a more empathetic care among cancer patients.</p>

<body>
<p>Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for 7.6 million or around 13% of all deaths in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0898010112462066">World Health Organization, 2008</xref>). However, the number of cancer survivors is increasing, primarily because of the technological advances in early detection and treatment. In fact, cancer is now being viewed as a chronic disease that can be effectively treated and controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0898010112462066">Mattioli, Montanaro, &amp; Romito, 2010</xref>), as evidenced by the emergence of early detection techniques, efficacious therapies, and screening programs for various cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0898010112462066">Sant et al., 2009</xref>). Top-of-the-line primary cancer therapies are now being made available, with various advances currently aimed toward secondary and comorbid cancer management. As a result of these concerted efforts, it is projected that the number of cancer survivors will increase up to 3% every year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0898010112462066">Maddams et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Cancer is perceived both as a bodily reflection and a human experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0898010112462066">Vivar, Whyte, &amp; Mcqueen, 2009</xref>), encompassing a dynamic and lifelong process termed as “cancer survivorship” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0898010112462066">Rasmussen, Hansen, &amp; Elverdam, 2010</xref>). It is described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0898010112462066">Hewitt, Greenfield, and Stovall (2006)</xref> as a distinct phase of cancer that follows primary treatment and lasts until recurrence or end of life. The definition of “survivor” was later expanded to include family, friends, and voluntary caregivers who are affected by the diagnosis in any way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0898010112462066">National Cancer Institute, 2006</xref>). However, despite the increased importance of the process of survivorship in the development of patients’ quality of life beyond cancer, systematic studies concerned with this matter of contention are limited in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898010112462066">Bjordal, Mastekaasa, &amp; Kaasa, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898010112462066">Mols, Coebergh, &amp; van de Poll-Franse, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0898010112462066">Rao &amp; Demark-Wahnefried, 2006</xref>). Additionally, studies on cancer survivorship are not yet well-developed and findings about cancer outcomes are poor and insufficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0898010112462066">Mattioli et al., 2010</xref>). The impact of cancer does not end after treatment and that current approaches fail to address the full range of physical, psychological, social, spiritual, and financial needs that cancer survivors may have after treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0898010112462066">Feuerstein, Hansen, Calvio, Johnson, &amp; Ronquillo, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0898010112462066">Vivar et al., 2009</xref>), further emphasizing the need to fully understand what these cancer survivors go through as they undergo the process toward cancer survivorship. Hence, this article seeks to conceptualize the struggles of Filipino cancer survivors with the acceptance of their condition and their fortitude in dealing with its demands, ultimately leading to the development of a theoretical model that explains the process of survivorship among these patients.</p>

<sec id="section2-0898010112462066">
<title>Research Design</title>
<p>This qualitative investigation used the grounded theory design. It is considered as a powerful means for collecting and analyzing qualitative research data and is inductively derived from the study of the phenomenon it represents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0898010112462066">Allan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0898010112462066">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0898010112462066">Vijayan, 2009</xref>). Most grounded theory studies undergo four stages of analysis, starting with coding or the identification of anchors that represent salient points of the data being studied. The resulting codes will then be subjected to concept grouping, and the emerging concepts will be classified according to distinct categories. The final step in conducting grounded theory research is the formulation of a theory that explains the underlying process of the phenomenon being studied.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0898010112462066">
<title>Research Sample and Instrumentation</title>
<p>The researchers purposively recruited 27 respondents to participate in study. Eligibility criteria for selection include the following: (a) cancer survivor for at least 6 months, (b) 40 years and older, and(c) able to follow oral and written directions. Respondents were excluded from the study if they (a) have difficulties in communication and comprehension and (b) have a coexisting chronic condition, such as diabetes.</p>
<p>The researchers used a two-part instrument to surface the process of acceptance, fortitude, and recovery among adult cancer survivors. The first part, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0898010112462066">Table 1</xref>, is the subject’s <italic>robotfoto</italic>, a Dutch term defined as “a cartographic sketch of the subject” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0898010112462066">Kelchtermans &amp; Ballet, 2002</xref>) to establish the baseline characteristics of the cancer survivors under study. It consists of circles and blank spaces to obtain needed information. The second part is a focus group interview intended to elicit the respondents’ own experiences with regard to their path to recovery, guided by key interview questions from the <italic>aide memoir</italic>. Three separate sessions were conducted to complete the total number of participants: one for the 13 respondents previously diagnosed with breast cancer, another for the 11 who had colon cancer, and a third for the remaining 3 participants.</p>

<title>Data Collection and Ethical Considerations</title>
<p>Beguiling the process of the phenomena, a triangulation of data collection strategy was used. Prior to the data collection procedure, the participants were asked to sign an informed consent and were given a full explanation of the purpose and design of the paper. On the permission of the participant to be included in the study, focus group interviews were conducted based on the date and time of their availability. Interview locations were also chosen by the participants themselves, with the assumption that they will be more honest and comfortable in a familiar environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898010112462066">de Guzman et al., 2009</xref>). It also aims to establish better rapport and to create an emotionally stimulating environment between the participants and the researchers. A semistructured interview was enforced in order to create a free-flowing conversation without any alterations in the focus and direction of the interview. Although most key questions are in the <italic>aide memoir</italic>, follow-up questions were also raised to further probe into the participants’ responses during the interview. Each interview was video-recorded and lasted for 1 to2 hours. Respondents were assured of their confidentiality and were reminded of their right not to answer any question or to stop the interview at any time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0898010112462066">
<title>Mode of Analysis</title>
<p>In this investigation, data and information yielded from the <italic>robotfoto</italic> were analyzed descriptively. Data from the focus group interviews were transcribed <italic>verbatim</italic> into field text for the purpose of undergoing analyses required for grounded theory research. Field texts were intensively read and reread to facilitate identification of significant statements or anchors through the process of cutting and sorting. These significant statements then were subjected into the Glaserian method of ground theory analysis. It involves the inductive grouping of related codes via a dendrogram to facilitate theory <italic>development</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898010112462066">Glaser, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898010112462066">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0898010112462066">2004</xref>). Common statements were clustered into categories, wherein 4 phases with 10 substages emerged from the various categories. These phases established a deeper understanding of the process of survivorship being experienced by cancer survivors. These phases were further subjected into a series of member checking and correspondence procedures to establish the trustworthiness of the data collected, leading to the unfolding of the <italic>lebenswelt</italic> of the process of cancer survivorship among Filipinos.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0898010112462066">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>From the richness and thickness of the descriptions given by the respondents, a distinct and interesting set of phases has emerged, dubbed as the <italic>Ribbon of Cancer Survivorship</italic>. It describes the process of <italic>trifling, transfusing, transforming</italic>, and <italic>transcending</italic> among Filipino cancer survivors, as seen in their individual and collective experiences and discernments.</p>
<sec id="section7-0898010112462066">
<title>Trifling Phase: Living Before Cancer</title>
<p>Looking back, participants reflected on their earlier lives before they were diagnosed of having cancer, termed as the <italic>trifling</italic> phase of cancer survivorship. It encompasses their moments of indifference and negligence toward their health before they were diagnosed. Life for them was easy and some have even verbalized that the only thing that preoccupied them back then was work. As one participant enunciated, “Life for me was easy; I was busy with my work.” Another one articulated, “Our lives were just normal. We’re working on our jobs.” Some of the participants have also recalled that they used to be hyperactive in a sense that they indulge themselves into their work too much. Majority of the participants have also described their former selves as someone who was healthy and cheerful, while one participant put it as being a happy-go-lucky person. On the other hand, some have admitted that they are negligent in terms of their health as one participant verbalized,
<disp-quote>
<p>I was abusive when it comes to my body. I was a drunkard, I was a driver then I would work for about 24 hours driving a taxi. I would drink myself to sleep and then I would eat barbeques. I didn’t even know that was bad for my health.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another participant also shared, “Formerly,I used to go against the flow” in a sense that she does not even follow advice from other people in terms of her health.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0898010112462066">
<title>Transfusing Phase: Accepting the Reality of Cancer</title>
<p>The process of acceptance in one’s journey toward cancer survivorship is marked as the <italic>transfusing</italic> phase in the <italic>Ribbon of Cancer Survivorship</italic>. A person is said to be experiencing a so-called “transfusion” once the unfortunate event of being diagnosed with cancer happens, resulting to an overwhelming amount of stress and emotional upset dealt on the person. One can be observed to be instilled with shock, denial, and negativity in the initial stages of finding out about their condition, but then struck with sanguinity, as they slowly move toward acceptance.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that the participants had undergone different stages in the process of accepting the reality that they indeed were suffering from cancer. They had never thought that they would ever be diagnosed with the disease, so they were all very shocked at first. Some participants shared their initial responses:
<disp-quote>
<p>When I heard that it was cancer, of course your initial reaction, you would be crying.</p>
<p>I couldn’t get up from bed, and I used to lie all the time. Then, I suddenly lost hope in life.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Each day that passes, they experienced certain bodily changes, reflecting the severity of the disease condition. As one participant expressed, “I was terrified, and I couldn’t even feel any sensation. Why was it like that?” This period in the process of acceptance, known as the <italic>tainting</italic> stage, binds the participants together in their journey through cancer. One respondent had mentioned, “It was as if heaven and Earth collided unto me.” During these trying times, dark clouds always seem to hover above their heads while being blanketed by sorrow and hopelessness. Some of them responded,
<disp-quote>
<p>It was more than “Ondoy” [a strong typhoon in the Philippines]. It was devastating.</p>
<p>We were sure we’re going to die.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>After surpassing this gloomy moment in their lives, the participants gradually moved on to the next state called the <italic>desolating</italic> stage. In this stage, they portray a depressing disengagement. In the beginning, they keep to themselves, not uttering words that might hint to others that they had cancer, as one of the survivors expressed, “At first, I just kept it to myself, and before, I was hesitant to join others.” For most participants, it was not very easy to accept the reality, and they felt an overwhelming uproar of thoughts and emotions. Most of them turned to prayer and completely submitted themselves to God. They had asked Him why such thing happened to them, and when all their efforts seemed to have gone to waste, they resorted to bargaining, as reflected by their responses:
<disp-quote>
<p>I’m still too young to die.</p>
<p>It is hard to accept. Actually, I asked the Lord, “Why me?”</p>
<p>I bargained and said, “Lord, I want to believe that my mission is already done, but I’m still young; I can still do a lot of things. Give me another chance to serve You.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>After some time, wallowing in their sadness, the participants transitioned into a somehow, more accepting state of mind called the <italic>disrupting</italic> state. This took place when they experienced bothersome alterations in their everyday lives, and had to learn how to deal with their insecurities. As most of them verbalized,
<disp-quote>
<p>I really felt incomplete deep inside.</p>
<p>Let’s say I have a meeting at 1 p.m. I have to prepare while it’s still early because I have to tend to this [colostomy].</p>
<p>It’s like there’s an abnormality with your movements.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Finally, the <italic>embracing</italic> stage defines the last step of the participants’ experience of acceptance, where their openness to disclose their condition to their loved ones became more apparent and learned to accept facts and face the truth that they have cancer. While developing an optimistic perspective along the way, their readiness to embark on a new chapter was typified by their tendency to share their strategies in overcoming this overwhelming battle against the disease with others. As shared by the participants:
<disp-quote>
<p>If you have a positive outlook, healing process will hasten.</p>
<p>We just believe that we’re already healed. Then you’ll find yourself very happy and contented.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Interestingly, almost all the participants developed a kind of vigilance and awareness of the other aspects of their lives. They found themselves taking more risks and becoming more appreciative of life.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We don’t take ourselves for granted anymore. We don’t think we’re Superman.</p>
<p>We eventually learned to accept it, and we feel that we’re better people. We’re better women, because we look at other things like, our love for our children, our love for our spouses, and all the better things in life. We realized that we should be thankful for so many things.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As shown, spirituality has become integral in the growing of ease of the participants. They turned to prayer and surrendered their lives to God, thanking Him for each day that they are alive and for the opportunity to fulfill their mission in life.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I lift it all up to the Lord. I lift up everything to Him.</p>
<p>It’s prayer, what’s most important. Pray to Him because He will really guide you and the ultimate pillar is God.</p>
<p>We still have a mission on this Earth. Why doI believe in that? It’s because He’s keeping me alive.</p>
<p>I asked God, “Is it time to go?” And if it’s not time to go, that means You have something for me to do. And if You want me to do something, I am deaf and blind. You drop it on my lap. That’s what He did, exactly.</p>

<title>Transforming Phase: Being Strong in the Midst of Cancer</title>
<p>Eventually, one progresses from a state of denial, fear, and hopelessness to a state of acceptance and positivity. This phase is represented in the <italic>Ribbon of Cancer Survivorship</italic> as the <italic>transforming</italic> phase. A cancer patient is assumed to be in the process of “transformation” when he goes through a variety of changes in his attitude toward cancer and life. This phase takes into account four substages, namely <italic>tormenting, distressing, awakening</italic>, and <italic>transfiguring</italic>.</p>
<p>In the process of facing cancer, one of the most crucial stages one experiences is the overwhelming sense of emotional torture. This burden was described to be unbearable and painful, as other aspects of their existence were affected by the drastic changes that their condition has brought on them as well as their families and friends. This point in the process typifies the <italic>tormenting</italic> stage, for it lumbered down the lives of these unsuspecting individuals.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It is very hard for me to have this!</p>
<p>I am shouting because of pain!</p>
<p>I really refused chemotherapy. I don’t want to feel miserable with how you feel.</p>
<p>When I was in the dark, thick walled room, I imagined that I was already dead, and I was 6 feet under the ground.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As a consequence of the tormenting phase, one undergoes a state of isolation from society, mostly because of the social stigma that comes with cancer. Since most of the participants had external indicators of their disease (mastectomies, colostomies), they had a hard time accepting the fact that they are now incomplete, disrupting their body image, relationship with society, and overall self-esteem. This can be described as the <italic>distressing</italic> stage of cancer survivorship because of the emotional and psychological struggles that these people encounter. As shown in their articulations,
<disp-quote>
<p>Imagine having only one breast! We feel we are not females anymore. The only visible identity of women is having breasts!</p>
<p>Imagine you cannot wear fashion clothes anymore! No more plunging necklines!</p>
<p>A lot of people are saying, ‘That’s gross!</p>
<p>Imagine their insults! It is a very big shame for us!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Over time, when one has imbibed the essence of this painful experience, the distressing stage forwards itself into an increasingly positive view toward the experience. The participants were enlightened in a way that they have risen from their misery and began reconnecting with others. They started to change for the better as well as making amends with their Creator. Thus, these moments in their lives are collectively termed as the <italic>awakening</italic> stage. This described how they were struck with enlightenment, and how it urged them to face their most challenging hurdle head-on. They bravely shared,
<disp-quote>
<p>I believe that God forgave me and this is when I felt at peace, when I accepted its totality.</p>
<p>As if God whispered to me and said, “Go back to who you used to be!”</p>
<p>I noticed that my one breast was bigger than the other one, but that’s it. Life went on, and I still continued running my business!</p>
<p>I cherished every minute that I spend with them [my family and friends]</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Indeed, through faith, as one submits himself to God, one’s strength as a person is being boosted; sooner or later, one develops a more positive outlook in life; and eventually, rebuilds oneself into a faithfully strong person. This process may be described as the transfiguring phase, wherein one undergoes metamorphosis, from a confused person to a completely ideal strong person. As some of the participants verbalized,
<disp-quote>
<p>I did not take any medicine, I only took daily prayers! I started to rebuild myself! I became very happy again! I forgot being materialistic! In fact, it was very easy for me to accept and let go when lots of my expensive jewelries were stolen!</p>
<p>When I was operated I did not think that that would be my last. It was nothing to me. I was not scared. It didn’t enter my thoughts, that when I get home from the hospital I might end up somewhere else. My faith was in God, I believed that when I get out I’d be healthy!</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<sec id="section10-0898010112462066">
<title>Transcending Phase:Living Beyond Cancer</title>
<p>The last facet of the <italic>Ribbon of Cancer Survivorship</italic> is the <italic>transcending</italic> phase, which speaks of the extension of the person’s consciousness onto others, gathering their experiences about cancer and going beyond themselves to help and inspire other people currently suffering the condition. The participants also shared the process that they have undergone after learning about their full recovery from cancer. Though they were assured that they were fully healed, the thought of possible recurrence was always present in their minds, to the point that they feel they still suffer the condition. This is termed as the <italic>trembling</italic> stage of cancer survivorship. While it can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0898010112462066">Figure 1</xref> that this stage is part of the transcending phase, it is also interesting to note its placement in the model. It was positioned near the transfusing phase because of the cyclical nature of cancer. A possible recurrence predisposes the person to “fall back” to the earlier stages of tainting, desolating, disrupting, and embracing. Some respondents, for instance, shared the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>Even though I’m a survivor now, my doctor reminded me that there is always a possibility of recurrence. On other cases, I was told that it might attack a different organ the next time around. It’s a scary thought.</p>
<p>Not only am I scared of experiencing the physical pain, but I can’t stand the fact that we’ll have to spend a lot of money again.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, it is also important to understand that because a person has already gone through the whole experience of having cancer, he will more likely be at ease toward facing the disease the second or third time around. As one respondent exemplified,
<disp-quote>
<p>When I had my recurrence, of course I was scared, but not as scared as before. I was surprised, butI was more equipped with knowledge the second time around. Plus, I have my family, my friends, and my support group with me, so it was definitely easier for me to accept and survive once again.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, if one does not have a recurrence of his cancer, he eventually reaches the <italic>enlivening</italic> stage, which talks about the extension of one’s life beyond the cancer experience. Most of the respondents shared their joy in making new friends and forming strong bonds with them. They consider it as a “blessing in disguise” because it made their lives worth living for, not just during the disease process, but most important, beyond the horrors of cancer. For example, they fondly said thus:
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s just the same. It’s as if nothing happened. I had more friends though, like in the cancer association. It’s a good feeling to have more acquaintances.</p>
<p>It’s so nice to bond with your fellow survivors. We know each other, we laugh together, we cry together. We understand each other, and we share so much.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some of them also expressed the desire to share their experiences with other cancer sufferers. As they pointed out, one can truly become empathetic if he has actually experienced the condition already. They hope that through their stories and advices, they can somehow touch the lives of these people, as reflected in these statements:
<disp-quote>
<p>For us survivors, the only people that can fully understand what we’ve gone through are our co-survivors.</p>
<p>All of us have experienced the disease already. There may be slight differences, but it’s essentially the same.</p>
<p>We compare notes, we compare what medicine that we took, and what is the reaction that we had. So we empower them and make them understand that they are not alone in their fight.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, it should also be noted that while they were cancer free, all of them showed their determination to stay that way through healthy lifestyle modifications. Cancer, as they say, made them a better person physically, very much unlike the person that they were before the diagnosis. Some of their responses include the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>We’re very vigilant now. That why we’re careful with what we eat. We avoid stress, if we can.</p>
<p>We’re now more health conscious, especially when it comes to food. If we feel something, we go to the doctor immediately.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Last, it is also interesting to note that most of them shared a positive change in their outlook in life. As they journey to life beyond cancer, they feel that it is important to learn from that experience in order to blossom into a new person. Because of this “new life” God has given them, they now accept this mission to guide those suffering from cancer in travelling the road to recovery. These realizations from them include,
<disp-quote>
<p>What I can say about cancer is that you can easily fight it off, especially if you are not alone. That is why I’ll always be available to help them.</p>
<p>Don’t postpone anymore; do what you can do now. Do not take things for granted.</p>
<p>I’ll forever thank God for giving me another chance to live. I know that He gave me this opportunity to inspire other people who are currently suffering just like me before, and I’m very much willing to accept that mission.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Considering the dearth of nursing literature encompassing the entire cancer experience, this study explores the process of cancer survivorship among a select group of Filipinos in a holistic lens. This resulted to the surfacing of the <italic>Ribbon of Cancer Survivorship</italic> that consisted of 4 phases and 10 subphases pertaining to the experiences cancer survivors undergo as they journey toward accomplishing remission and survival. The said model has successfully provided a rich description of what commences on each phase. For instance, the <italic>trifling</italic> phase serves as a starting point for these survivors, unlike past studies concerning the process of cancer survivorship that only starts from the point at which the participants only started to learn about their diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898010112462066">Eliott &amp; Oliver, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0898010112462066">Walton, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0898010112462066">Walton &amp; Sullivan, 2004</xref>). It is integral in the study of cancer patients and survivors alike that their premorbid states be clearly defined, for it may have crucial implications to their prognosis, coping, and overall quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0898010112462066">Klastersky, Schimpff, &amp; Senn, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>It is also interesting to note that one’s attitude changed drastically from the moment they found out they have cancer. The process of acceptance in a cancer survivor’s journey toward cancer survivorship then starts, and is represented by the <italic>transfusing</italic> phase. From the initial moments of learning about their diagnosis, it was found that the participants had experienced astonishment and disbelief, followed by extreme sadness and anxiety. This stage is termed as such because the participants seemed like they are being instilled with this burden they never asked for. In this study, several accounts from the participants’ shared stories were deemed significant as they revealed stressful moments that lead them to describe their lives to be “falling into pieces.” As defined by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0898010112462066">National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2008)</xref> of the United States, distress is a multifactorial unpleasant emotional experience of a psychological, social, and spiritual nature that may interfere with the ability to cope effectively with cancer.</p>
<p>As their condition progresses, they then move to the next stage wherein they experience the consequences of cancer dampening their spirits, which runs parallel with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0898010112462066">Zabora, BrintzenhofeSzoc, Curbow, Hooker, and Piantadosi’s (2001)</xref> findings that about 29% to 43% of cancer survivors have manifestations of clinical depression. Furthermore, the study also agrees with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0898010112462066">Passik and Grummon (1998)</xref> that experiences after medical procedures and related activities associated with the treatment of cancer have significant effects on the memories and feelings of a survivor, especially toward the development of fear of relapse when he achieves remission. In response to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, a considerable number of cancer patients also show symptoms of psychological distress, such as embarrassment, fear, sadness, anger, depression, and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898010112462066">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). The respondents attest to this as they shared stories wherein they encountered moments of anxiety, insecurity, and difficulty in dealing with life as a cancer patient.</p>
<p>It was also suggested by the findings as well as previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0898010112462066">Schilling, 1993</xref>) that ending up alone, living with illness, or an altered health status, can “leave people alone with their body.” Several participants even felt abandoned and helpless as they faced this sad plight in their life in solitude. They chose to keep this predicament to themselves, feeling that they were the only ones having this encounter, and that no one else could possibly save them from this dreadful occurrence. Moreover, the participants opted to hide their condition from society with fear of being treated differently, the end product of which is isolation from being singled out as different from the rest. This observation is in accordance with other findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898010112462066">Kelly, Pearce, &amp; Mullhall, 2004</xref>) that stress the tendency of newly diagnosed cancer patients to withdraw themselves from society.</p>
<p>Survivors are often left with the physical reminders as a result of cancer and its treatment, such as pain, fatigue, sterility, and loss of sexual function. Indeed, the aftermath of treatment has been described as worse than the disease itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898010112462066">Doyle, 2008</xref>). They became aware of the changes they went through, and thus, surfaced a sense of insecurity with their bodies. Counterintuitively, these individuals were imparted with a ray of hope and started to finally blossom their way out of that abyss. Amidst their fears and hardships, they got back on their feet and chose to live anew. They eventually shared their resentment, instead of facing their challenges alone. They learned to accept reality and did not just bear it in silence.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it is in the <italic>transforming</italic> phase where cancer patients experience transference of their attitude toward cancer from a negative to a positive light. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0898010112462066">Lewis, Mooney-Somers, and Kerridge (2010)</xref> associated cancer to a transformative experience, a promoter of change in one’s outlook in life, and a provider of much-needed wisdom and insight. In a similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898010112462066">Doyle (2008)</xref> also mentioned that the opportunity to redefine oneself does not occur often in life, but a cancer diagnosis may be one of those occasions that this opportunity comes up. This notion is unanimously backed up by a wealth of literature attesting to the transformative potential of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898010112462066">Breaden, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898010112462066">DeMarco, Picard, &amp; Agretelis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0898010112462066">Leigh &amp; Logan, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0898010112462066">Meraviglia, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0898010112462066">Vachon, Cerhan, Vierkant, &amp; Sellers, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0898010112462066">Wallwork &amp; Richardson, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>In line with the <italic>tormenting</italic> and <italic>distressing</italic> substages in the study, wherein one experiences physical and emotional agony as a response to the disease process, numerous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898010112462066">Aziz &amp; Rowland, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898010112462066">Cheng, Thompson, Ling, &amp; Chan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898010112462066">Dow, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0898010112462066">Mellon, Northouse, &amp; Weiss, 2006</xref>) agree that the negative aspects of being diagnosed with cancer are usually associated with biomedical issues, such as depression, fatigue, pain, dyspnea, cognitive impairment, sterility, and loss of sexual function. Moreover, fear of social isolation and loss of significant relationships or roles can have a great impact on a person’s chances of surviving cancer, as affirmed by past research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898010112462066">Deimling, Sterns, Bowman, &amp; Kahana, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0898010112462066">Mellon et al., Weiss, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0898010112462066">Vachon et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Notably, as one surpasses the course of treatment and endures the fight for survival, he experiences an adjustment in his attitude and outlook in life. As evinced in the study, participants were driven from their wretchedness and began relating with others. Getting support from the people around them and with a substantial faith in God, they develop a more positive viewpoint and, in due course, transfiguring into a more resilient personality. This is embodied in the <italic>Ribbon of Cancer Survivorship</italic> as the <italic>awakening</italic> and <italic>transfiguring</italic> subphases. This metamorphosis is termed as <italic>biological revisioning</italic>, which speaks of the process of identity reconstruction undertaken in response to the experience of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0898010112462066">Lewis et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>One final feature of the theoretical model that warrants discussion is the emergence of the <italic>transcending</italic> phase of cancer survivorship. To “transcend,” in colloquial terminology, means to “go beyond,” and it is further described by Immanuel Kant as knowing how to experience things as they were meant to be experienced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0898010112462066">Powell, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0898010112462066">Wood, 2005</xref>). To achieve transcendence, according to him, one must develop a synthesis between his experience <italic>per se</italic> and his self-consciousness of the experience. It can also be seen in a phenomenological sense by examining one’s collection of <italic>noema</italic> and the formed <italic>noesis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0898010112462066">Solomon, 1977</xref>). The entire transcending phase exemplifies these establishing, for it serves both as a <italic>culmination</italic> and a <italic>pinnacle</italic> of the entire survivorship process.</p>
<p>To have a better grasp of how transcendence develops in a cancer survivor, a deeper analysis of the entire process must be done first. As the participants start from the trifling phase, they advance to the process of accepting their situation, fulfilling the “experience” requirement. A clearer understanding occurs within them as they go through the desolating and disrupting phases of accepting their situation. Finally, they reach the embracing stage, where they integrate their past experiences of acceptance with their personhood in order to achieve self-consciousness. This “subprocess” then repeats itself during the transforming phase, ultimately leading to these cancer survivors not only achieving self-consciousness of what has transpired, but also consciousness <italic>beyond</italic> their own, which is transcendence in its purest form.</p>
<p>Interestingly, a substage termed as the <italic>trembling</italic> stage surfaced as a part of the transcending phase, primarily dealing with the most common fear among cancer survivors: the fear toward recurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0898010112462066">Passik &amp; Grummon, 1998</xref>). It is important to note that, as implied in the findings, this stage has a two-way path. Its proximity with the transfusing phase emphasizes the potential of cancer survivorship to become a <italic>cyclical</italic> process, should recurrences occur. However, it is also an imperative to understand that because of the awareness and support systems formed during the first encounter with cancer, those suffering from recurrences will generally have an easier time when dealing with the demands of their disease condition. Another point to remember as health care providers when taking care of these people is that this fear toward recurrence is usually permanent in nature, coinciding with the notion that survivorship is a lifelong process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0898010112462066">Rasmussen et al., 2010</xref>). Whether they were warned by their physicians about the possibility of recurrence or not, recurring thoughts about their past bouts with cancer nevertheless prevail.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if ever recurrence does not occur, a cancer survivor will eventually reach the <italic>enlivening</italic> phase of survivorship, wherein one uses his newfound strength and awareness in inspiring others who are currently battling the disease. The participants themselves emphasized the major role of support systems in one’s coping with cancer. It is very much natural for Filipinos to be social people, and this is especially evident during times of need or crises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0898010112462066">Licuanan, 1988</xref>). They value the presence of their support system as their “emotional sounding board,” especially when they know that these people have already experienced what they are currently going through. That is the reason most of the respondents expressed their desire to fulfill their mission of inspiring others through their own experiences. They believe that having concerned people to be with as one journeys through cancer can be beneficial in lessening the burden of the individual. This is backed up by past international studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898010112462066">Ell, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0898010112462066">Quittner, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0898010112462066">Wortman, 1984</xref>) stressing that meaningful cancer support systems has its place in cancer management.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Corollary to the different issues concerning the worldwide increase in the number of cancer survivors and its implications in cancer research, this qualitative undertaking purported to describe the process toward cancer survivorship among Filipinos. Four main phases emerged from the interviews done with the participants, namely, the <italic>trifling, transfusing, transforming</italic>, and <italic>transcending</italic> stages, providing a greater understanding of how Filipino cancer survivors go through the whole cancer experience, from their lives before the disease to the point that they grow beyond the confines of their condition. This study introduces a theoretical model that will prove to be integral in the development of nursing theory, research, and practice. The <italic>Ribbon of Cancer Survivorship</italic> has its implications in future cancer survivorship studies by serving as a comprehensive theoretical model in the field. Nurse educators, students, and practitioners will also benefit from the study, because they can now identify the process of recovery among their cancer patients in a <italic>holistic</italic> manner, and not just the biomedical cancer staging that nurses are more familiar with. A more empathetic nursing care will then be provided because of their clearer understanding of their patients’ experiences. The utilization of the Glaserian grounded theory method allowed the researchers to inductively and creatively explore for phases of cancer survivorship. This, in combination with the adequacy of the participants, accounts for the richer description of the <italic>lebenswelt</italic> of Filipino cancer survivorship.</p>
<p>As there was a preponderance of female participants in the study, the researchers call for future grounded theory studies on cancer survivorship that feature a more diverse gender mix in order to adequately capture the experiences of male respondents as well. It is also suggested that further research be carried out covering other cancer types, as most of the participants in this study either had breast or colon cancer. Last, it is recommended that applications of this qualitative study be implemented on a variety of demographic and cultural populations in order to explore for additions or alterations in the emerged theoretical model. Through these suggestions, the researchers hope that this will all lead to a better appreciation of the experiences of acceptance, resilience, growth, and inspiration among cancer survivors.</p>
