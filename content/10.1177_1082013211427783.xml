<abstract>
<p>The average of standard plate count and coliforms, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Salmonella</italic> counts for three home-made jameed samples, a traditional fermented dairy product, before applying hazard analysis critical control point system were 2.1 × 10<sup>3</sup>, 8.9 × 10<sup>1</sup>, 4 × 10<sup>1</sup> and less than 10 cfu/g, respectively. The developed hazard analysis critical control point plan resulted in identifying ten critical control points in the flow chart of jameed production. The critical control points included fresh milk receiving, pasteurization, addition of starter, water and salt, straining, personnel hygiene, drying and packaging. After applying hazard analysis critical control point system, there was significant improvement in the microbiological quality of the home-made jameed. The standard plate count was reduced to 3.1 × 10<sup>2</sup> cfu/g whereas coliform and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> counts were less than 10 cfu/g and <italic>Salmonella</italic> was not detected. Sensory evaluation results of color and flavor of sauce prepared from jameed showed a significant increase in the average scores given after hazard analysis critical control point application.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1082013211427783" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Many studies had been conducted in the last few years regarding the application of hazard analysis critical control point (HACCP) system for many dairy products in order to improve their safety and quality aspects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1082013211427783">Aiad, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1082013211427783">Azer and Nejad, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1082013211427783">Dalgc and Belibagl, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1082013211427783">Noordhuizen and Metz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1082013211427783">Valeeva et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1082013211427783">WHO, 2008</xref>). Control of food-borne Salmonellosis by applying HACCP system was conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1082013211427783">Simensen et al. (1987)</xref>. The authors choose the more hazardous foods, like those of animal origin, and identified the critical control points (CCPs), monitoring, and corrective actions. It was found that the HACCP system succeeded in reducing, or eliminating, salmonella. The food industry and government regulatory agencies are paying more attention to the HACCP system to provide greater assurance of food safety.</p>
<p>Jameed is a dried fermented milk product widely used as a common traditional food in several Mediterranean countries including Jordan, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Egypt. Several names are being given to jameed, i.e. oggott in Arab Gulf States, jameed in Jordan and Syria and kishk in Egypt. Jameed is used mainly in the preparation of the popular traditional dish called “mansaf”. “Mansaf” is made from rice and meat and sauce. The sauce is made by adding cooked meat to dissolving jameed (reconstituted with warm water) then boiling the mixture for about 15 min, the produced sauce is named “sharap”.</p>
<p>Jameed is produced in many areas in Jordan where the most famous one is Karak. It has a high nutritive value, with a protein content of about (48–54%), fat (18–22%) and ash (12–13%) and characterized with its long shelf life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1082013211427783">Al-Omari et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1082013211427783">Mazahreh et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Several sources of milk can also be used in jameed preparation, i.e. sheep, goat and cow. The effect of source of milk, season, and location, on the chemical composition of the produced jameed was investigated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1082013211427783">Abu-Lehia (1987)</xref>. Jameed produced from goat milk in Ma′adba area in Jordan was compared with another dried fermented dairy product “madeer” produced in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Several techniques were used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1082013211427783">Quasem et al. (2009)</xref> to improve the solubility of solar-dried jameed by addition of additives and application of heat treatment for buttermilk. It was reported that best results could be achieved by heating the buttermilk for 3 min at 55 °C, and addition of carrageenan (0.15%) as additive. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1082013211427783">Tawalbeh (1991)</xref> studied the chemical composition and microbial content of sheep and goat jameed produced in different areas in Jordan and reported that large variations could be observed in the protein and fat content. Jameed powder produced by spray-drying technique was studied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1082013211427783">Shaker et al. (2007)</xref> using concentrated partially defatted yogurt “makheed”. The physico-chemical composition and microbial status of jameed (oggott) produced in Saudi Arabia were studied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1082013211427783">Al-Mashhadi et al. (1987)</xref>.</p>
<p>Most of the above-mentioned studies regarding jameed covered the composition as well as microbial quality of this product; however, studies about applying HACCP in jameed processing have not been reported yet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1082013211427783">Al-Saed, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Both locally produced or imported jameed is produced using traditional methods, which encounter several sanitary limitations. Accordingly, this study aimed to improve jammed production by implementation of HACCP.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1082013211427783"><title>Milk samples and jameed samples before and after drying</title>
<p>A questionnaire was prepared to collect information on jameed making. Twenty houses were visited and accordingly three of them having the minimum variations were selected to apply HACCP system. The production of each house is around 100 kg jameed/week.</p>
<p>Triplicate samples of milk and jameed cones before and after drying were collected from Karak area (the selected three houses) using sterilized gloves, placed in sterilized bags and transferred to Jordan University using ice-box. The samples were also analyzed on the same day. Jameed samples were ground using sterilized mortar. Ten grams of each sample was taken for microbiological, physical and chemical analysis. Collection samples of milk, jameed before drying and final product of jameed were made before and after applying HACCP system.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1082013211427783"><title>Chemical analysis</title>
<p>Fat, moisture, protein and ash content were determined according to the standard methods of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1082013211427783">AOAC, 1995</xref>). Crude protein value was based on Kjeldahl nitrogen with a conversion factor of 6.38. Water activity of final product (jameed) was measured using Novasina instrument (Novatron Scientific Co., UK), the method given in the manual of the instrument was followed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1082013211427783"><title>Microbiological analysis</title>
<p>The counts of total mesophilic bacteria (Plate count Agar, Himedia-India) at 37 °C for 48 h, total coliforms (Violet Red Bile Agar, Himedia-India) at 37 °C for 48 h, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (Baird-Parker Agar, Himedia-India) at 37 °C for 48 h were conducted according to ICMSF methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1082013211427783">ICMSF, 1988</xref>. Enumeration of <italic>Salmonella</italic> was carried out using non-selective and selective enrichment and 13 streaking were used to isolate the colonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1082013211427783">ICMSF, 1988</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1082013211427783"><title>Sensory analysis</title>
<p>Hedonic scale test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1082013211427783">Larmond 1982</xref>) was used to investigate the degree of preference to six jameed samples with the two different treatments. Each panelist expressed the degree of preference by filling the specific questionnaire. Twenty semi-trained panelists were selected from the students at the Department of Nutrition and Food Technology, Faculty of Agriculture, the University of Jordan, to conduct the sensory evaluation. Representative samples of jameed before and after applying HACCP system were reconstituted by soaking in water for 24 h in the refrigerator then blended with an electrical mixer.</p>
<p>The reconstituted jameed was strained through a fine sieve strainer. One kg of lamb meat was boiled in water, with onion and spices, for 30 min. The jameed dispersion and meat broth were mixed in a ratio of 1:1 and cooked for 10–15 min and served hot in glass cup to the panelist.</p>
<p>Sensory evaluation test was done in 2 days, the first day the panelist evaluated six samples of jameed representing the three houses (three before HACCP and three after HACCP application) for flavor. On the second day, the same samples were judged for color.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1082013211427783"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The obtained results were analyzed by analysis of variance using the statistical analysis system package (SAS) available at the Computer Center in the University of Jordan. Values for all parameters were presented as means where completely randomized design with equal sub-samples was used. Three samples were taken for each of the two treatments (before and after HACCP application) from the three selected houses.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1082013211427783" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title>
<p>Visiting houses producing jameed revealed the presence of variations in the methods of jameed processing. Deficiencies in both cleaning and hygiene as well as in the practices applied in jameed making were all observed. Three houses were selected out of those all houses in one village with the minimum variations to apply HACCP system.</p>

<sec id="sec12-1082013211427783"><title>Development of HACCP plan</title>
<p>HACCP plan was developed for jameed production as recommended by Codex Alimentarius Commission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1082013211427783">Codex Alimentarius Commission, 1997</xref>). The development process includes the following:
<list id="list1-1082013211427783" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Assembling of HACCP team: HACCP team was assembled from the graduated student and the manager of Ader plant, maintenance technician of Ader plant and three female employees.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Description and identification of jameed and its intended use: Jameed is the sun-dried fermented milk product. According to the Jordanian standard, jameed should be free of starch, flour, added fat, preservatives, metals, glass and food-borne pathogens or their toxins, insects (earth-warms, crickets and flies), feces of animal. Jameed should contain less than 0.05% of hair and wool, not more than 0.75% of stones, husks and soil. In addition, the moisture content should not exceed 20% w/w. Jameed should be packaged and stored under good hygienic conditions, including proper ventilation, humidity and unsusceptible for contamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1082013211427783">JSS, 1997</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Developing the flow chart: In the flow chart, ten CCPs were determined i.e. fresh milk, pasteurization, starter culture, incubation, addition water, straining in cloth bag, salting, shaping, personal hygiene and drying and packaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1082013211427783">Figure 2</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Application of the seven HACCP principles: HACCP principles were applied in jameed production. Hazard and risk in jameed production from raw milk to final product were assessed and analyzed as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1082013211427783">Table 1</xref>. Identification of existing prevention measures was also conducted. CCPs in jameed production were determined by applying the HACCP decision tree for each step in jameed production as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1082013211427783">Figure 2</xref>. For each CCP, critical limits, monitoring system, corrective action procedures, verification procedures and document control system were established.</p></list-item>

<p>The HACCP system was applied for duration of 4 months (January–April) in three houses producing jameed in Karak area. The application of HACCP system depends on hazard analysis, the determination of CCPs, the determination of control limits, monitoring and documentation. In jameed production, microbiological, physical and chemical hazards are being expected. The presence of many CCPs in this industry which deals with a sensitive food like milk is also expected.</p>

<p>In fresh milk before applying HACCP system, food-borne pathogens like coliforms and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> were detected. Application of HACCP system resulted in a significant reduction (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in SPC. Coliforms and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> were also reduced and their detected values were less than 10 cfu/mL. Such results are being expected due to the hygienic practices followed in this stage, i.e. cleaning of animal breast, properly cleaning of hands and using cleaned containers. However, results of microbial analysis in the two treatments (before and after applying HACCP system) were a special case because number of SPC, coliforms, <italic>Salmonella</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> were very low, and these results are being expected due to environmental condition that prevailed during conducting this work. However, after the samples were collected, they were carried in ice box and analyzed after 2 h from collection, a condition which aid in minimizing the microbial load.</p>
<p>Receiving fresh milk was considered as a CCP since it may have physical hazard like solid impurities. Filtering the milk before pasteurization by using clean cloth eliminates this hazard. The pasteurization step was considered as an important CCP because milk may also contain food-borne pathogens (<italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, coliforms, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, <italic>Salmonella</italic>). Pathogens were eliminated by using pasteurization temperature of 90 °C for 5 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1082013211427783">Abdul-Salam, 1998</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-1082013211427783"><title>Microbiological analysis of jameed</title>
<p>It can be seen that the SPC before applying HACCP ranged between 2.2 × 10<sup>5</sup> and 2.4 × 10<sup>5</sup> cfu/g, while coliform 30–40 cfu/g (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1082013211427783">Table 2</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> was less than 10 cfu/g, whereas <italic>Salmonella</italic> was not detected. After applying HACCP system, the microbial status was improved and the SPC counts ranged between 1.1 × 10<sup>4</sup> and 1.4 × 10<sup>4</sup> cfu/g. Coliform and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> were less than 10 cfu/g, whereas <italic>Salmonella</italic> wasn’t detected in the final product (jameed) after applying HACCP system.</p>
<p>Microbiological analysis during jameed production included SPC, Coliform, <italic>Salmonella,</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus.</italic> SPC was included to indicate the aerobic microbial load, while Coliform indicates fecal contamination and it is facultative anaerobic and ferment lactose, they are established as indicator for food sanitary conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1082013211427783">ICMSF, 1988</xref>). The main source of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> is human nose and hands; it produces enterotoxin in processed food. Contamination with it may result from human, animal or environmental source and usually indicates cross contamination from skin, mouth or nose of food handlers; for these reasons, it was included in this study. On the other hand, <italic>Salmonella</italic> was studied to find its presence or absence. The main source of <italic>Salmonella</italic> is human or animal, cross contamination of <italic>Salmonella</italic> may occur due to unsanitary practices. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1082013211427783">ICMSF, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1082013211427783">Forsythe and Hayes, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Starter culture (yogurt) may have unacceptable taste and odor, which affect jameed, and as a result, fresh yogurt should be used. The incubation step was considered as a CCP because incubation should not exceed more than 4 h at correct incubation temperature for rapid acid production in order to prevent growth of pathogens. The formed curd should be cooled since it may act as a carrier of either pathogens or toxins. By its nature, fermented milk at pH 3.9–4.2 held in chill does not permit growth of pathogens.</p>
<p>Water used in churning step may have microbiological hazard like food-borne pathogens and insects. So, sources of water as well as water itself should be monitored to achieve minimum contamination.</p>
<p>Cloth bags are used to separate whey from the churned yogurt. These bags may have molds and pathogens, and they may attract some insects. Accordingly, proper cleaning of cloth bags by using detergent and an automatic washing machine should be applied and immersion bags in boiling water just before using should be practiced. The clean cloth bags having the curd should be placed in a hygienic and cool place. Additionally, screens should be placed on windows to control the insects.</p>
<p>Food salt is used as a preservative material with jameed paste; it may have physical hazard like impurities; thus, the good quality salt i.e. salt with minimum impurities and conforming with standard should be used.</p>
<p>Shaping of jameed is usually done manually without dressing gloves or head covers; such practice may impart biological or physical hazards (jewelry, hair and nails). For instance, personal hygiene and dressing of head cover, mask and gloves should be considered. In case gloves are not available, repeated thoroughly washing of hands should be practiced.</p>
<p>Places of drying jameed may be a source of physical and biological hazards, so a specially designed room far from any source of contamination like insects, dust and dirt and having a sun exposure for suitable duration should be selected. Water activity and moisture content are important parameters at the drying step of jameed before it is packaged or stored. The variations in water activity and moisture content affect the storage duration and conditions. Refrigerated storage may be recommended when water activity exceeds 0.6. At water activity of 0.6 or more, the mold can grow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1082013211427783">Forsythe and Hayes, 1998</xref>). Water activity and moisture content were measured for final product (jameed) before and after applying HACCP system. The obtained water activity values ranged between 0.32 and 0.34 before applying of HACCP system and 0.30 and 0.40 after HACCP application. Moisture content on the other hand ranged between 22% and 26% for jameed before HACCP application and it was 19% and 32% after HACCP application. Preliminary storage studies for samples of jameed (before and after HACCP application) at 35 °C for 5 days did not show any signs of mold growth. Such results are expected since the water activity is relatively low.</p>
<p>Personal hygiene was considered as CCP because it is a source of microbiological hazards like <italic>Salmonella</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> or coliform when there is a situation of poor personal hygiene. It has been estimated that approximately 1 in 50 employees is shedding 10<sup>9</sup> pathogens per gram feces without showing any clinical symptoms. Subsequently, poor personal hygiene such as failing to wash hands after going to the toilet can leave 10<sup>7</sup> pathogens under the finger nails. The movement of personnel in a processing area needs to be controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1082013211427783">Forsythe, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Three products i.e. yogurt, skimmed yogurt and concentrated skimmed yogurt (jameed paste) are considered intermediate products of jameed production. These products are sometimes consumed as such. As a result, the safety of these products is important. Application of HACCP will aid in improving the safety of these products especially through pasteurization of milk, because it is the most important CCP, and through personnel hygiene to eliminate cross and post contamination.</p>

<sec id="sec17-1082013211427783"><title>Chemical analysis of jameed before and after applying HACCP system</title>
<p>Before applying HACCP, crude protein content ranged between 52.86% and 53.12%, fat content was within the range of 17.98% and 18.22%, whereas ash content ranged between 12.76 and 13.1% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1082013211427783">Table 3</xref>). Applying of HACCP had a slight significant effect (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) on the ash content of jameed. Ash content for jameed obtained in this study (13%) is similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1082013211427783">Tawalbeh (1991)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1082013211427783">Abu-Lehia (1987)</xref> (13–14%). On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1082013211427783">Quasem (1996)</xref> reported higher values (17%) for ash of jameed. Addition of different levels and different types of salt during jameed processing may explain the variation of ash content of jameed.

<p>Data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1082013211427783">Table 3</xref> revealed that protein content of jameed before and after application of HACCP showed no significant difference (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Low variability could also be observed in the literature that reported protein content of jameed, which ranged between 50% and 54% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1082013211427783">Abu-Lehia, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1082013211427783">Shaker et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1082013211427783">Tawalbeh, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1082013211427783">Quasem, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The reduced level of jameed fat after application of HACCP system might be ascribed to the improvement in churning process since low churning temperature (10 °C or less) was used. These findings agree with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1082013211427783">Scott (1981)</xref> who found that using low temperature for churning of sheep milk increased the butter yield and produced fat granules of big size (8–20 micron). From the previous literature for the fat content of jameed, it can be noticed that it ranged from 9.5% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1082013211427783">Quasem, 1996</xref>) to 20% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1082013211427783">Abu-Lehia, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1082013211427783">Tawalbeh, 1991</xref>). Moderate fat levels 12–17% was also reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1082013211427783">Shaker et al. (1996</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1082013211427783">El-zraiy (1999</xref>). The large variability in the fat content of jameed which was reported by the above researchers might be explained on the basis of variation in churning process as well as in milk composition.</p>

<sec id="sec18-1082013211427783"><title>Sensory evaluation of jameed</title>
<p>Results of sensory evaluation of jameed before and after applying HACCP system are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1082013211427783">Table 4</xref>. The application of HACCP system leads to improve the sensory evaluation scores of jameed samples produced under the conditions of this investigation. Flavor and color scores were significantly increased (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) from 7.0 to 8.7 and 5.5 to 8.6, respectively. Such improvement might be attributed to several reasons including: (a) Jameed produced after applying HACCP was characteristic of low acidity as compared with that produced before HACCP application. (b) Jameed produced after HACCP application had better flavor compared with that produced before HACCP application. (c) Following sanitary and hygienic practices led to production of jameed of attractive white color and with better characteristics.

<p>The sensory results obtained under the conditions of this study agree with these obtained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1082013211427783">Quasem (1996)</xref>, who investigated three techniques to improve the dispersability of jameed and observed the same trend for sensory results of jameed.</p>

<p>The application of hazard analysis CCPs during jameed production has a greater effect on reduction of the SPC, coliforms and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> compared with jameed production under uncontrolled conditions. Large and statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) reduction was observed in the SPC after application of HACCP system in the selected two steps (fresh milk and final product). Slight although statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) variations were observed in the chemical properties (protein, fat and ash) of final product before and after applying HACCP system.</p>
<p>Color and flavor evaluation showed that jameed sauce (reconstituted jameed) after HACCP application was preferred and was given higher scores which were more statistically different (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) than scores given for jameed sauce before HACCP application. This study confirms the need for the application of HACCP system during food processing to achieve the safety and high quality of food products.</p>
