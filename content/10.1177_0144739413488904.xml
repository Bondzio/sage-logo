<abstract>
<p>A big challenge to wise administrative reform is to ensure that reform does not threaten the organizational stability needed to ensure effective policy implementation and service delivery. There are of course many challenges, but this a vitally important one, and it is a main aim of this article to emphasize it. The article first presents a brief survey of the rise over the past 40 years of what is here called the “administrative reform industry”. It then looks at several recent contributions to the discourse about administrative reform, and in that connection notes some worthwhile suggestions about reform strategies, and some warnings about things to avoid. While the treatment is primarily reflective, a few practical illustrations are included.</p>

<p>This article began life as a presentation to the Annual Conference of the Eastern Regional Organization for Public Administration (EROPA) on ‘Challenges to Administrative Reform: Learning from the Past and in Search of Excellence in the Future’, held in Jakarta, 28 October to 1 November 2012. In a conference on this subject, it was appropriate to reflect on the explosive growth of interest in administrative reform over the past 40 years or so. The idea of reform drives so many conferences, inquiries, research projects, reports and legislation today that it is not too much to suggest that administrative reform has become the dominating concern of the discipline and the practice of modern public administration. There is, indeed, an implication that, if we are not engaged in administrative reform, we are deficient in some way. We shout about it as though it is the way to enlightenment in governance. In their important comparative survey of public management reform over ten countries, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0144739413488904">Pollitt and Bouckaert (2000</xref>: 1–2) could thus draw attention to the “noise” reformers in the Anglophone countries have made when they boast about the reforms they have been undertaking.<sup>

</p>
<p>This 40-year period corresponds roughly with my own involvement in practising, teaching and researching public administration. Much of this involvement has related to specific activities, including much empirical research. This article is not, however, empirically based; rather it offers reflections on the “administrative reform industry” as I have experienced it. The article begins by commenting on the literature and related aspects of the study of administrative reform. Then, drawing on this literature and my own experience, it reflects on both the reasons why pressure for reform will always be with us and the problems that come when we focus so heavily on reform that we forget that there can be associated negatives. One of these is the danger that all thought that stability is an important value in the operating of the administrative machine disappears – it is too easy to forget that unstable organizations will often undo all the good that otherwise well-thought-out reform is intended to achieve.</p>
<p>How to achieve wise administrative reform is a problem countless people in government and countless academic analysts continue to wrestle with.</p>

<title>The rise of the administrative reform industry</title>
<sec id="section2-0144739413488904">
<title>A path-breaking work</title>
<p>Gerald Caiden probably did more than any other scholar to register that administrative reform had become a central and commanding concept in our discipline. In his path-breaking book with the simple title <italic>Administrative Reform </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0144739413488904">Caiden, 1969</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0144739413488904">2007</xref>),<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0144739413488904">2</xref>
</sup> he charted and assessed the various movements that led to this outcome. Nine propositions that come from this survey are worthy of noting here, and they offer a valuable foundation for the argument in this article:<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Administrative reform ‘has existed ever since men conceived better ways of organizing their social activities’ – but (up to the time Caiden was writing) it had ‘not received any systematic analysis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0144739413488904">Caiden, 1969</xref>: 1).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The need for it ‘arises from the malfunctioning of the natural processes of administrative change’ (p. 65).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>It rests on the belief ‘that there is always a better alternative to the status quo’ (p. 23).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>‘No aspect of administration is incapable of reform or has not been reformed at some time’. BUT this does not mean that reform is necessarily ‘good, desirable, preferable, successful, workable or necessary’ (p. 36).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Serious interest in administrative reform as a topic in its own right was stimulated by developments of the early post–World War II period (reconstruction, decolonization, et cetera), and especially the rise, within the discipline of public administration, of the sub-disciplines of development administration and comparative administration (pp. 37, 40).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Indiscriminate use of the term was leading to ‘confusion and to difficulties in setting parameters for research and theorizing’, and the absence of a universally accepted definition was handicapping the study (p. 43).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Caiden proposed his own definition: ‘administrative reform is the artificial inducement of administrative transformation, against resistance’ (p. 65).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>When resistance is generated but overcome, ’change gives way to reform’ (p. 59).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>BUT – and it is a big BUT – ‘resistance to change is indispensable for stability’ and, if ‘people were willing to change whenever an alternative presented itself, there would be chaos’ (p. 60).</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>Why was it so easy for the idea of administrative reform to capture such wide attention at this time? Put simply, the belief was widespread that administrative organizations suffer from hardening of the bureaucratic arteries, so that constant effort is needed to counter that tendency. Factors attracting dissatisfaction included closeness of the public service leadership to despotic governance regimes, social distance from communities being served, and a general failure to adapt to changing circumstances such as technological advances and rising democratic spirit. Many strands of such dissatisfaction came together, and Caiden was able to capture the mood with his broad recognition of the basic idea.</p>
<p>Of course there was another set of circumstances at work, apparent when major administrative change accompanied revolutionary political change. As Caiden pointed out elsewhere (1981: 181): ‘administrative reform has had its best opportunity whenever a country has experienced some kind of social crisis, such as invasion, civil war, military defeat, political upheaval or cultural strife’.</p>
<p>Caiden was in much demand as a consultant and conference leader, and contributed in many ways to the explosive growth of interest that followed publication of his path-breaking book. And he followed it two decades later with another book celebrating what he described as the ‘coming of age’ (i.e. 21st birthday) of administrative reform as a subject of study in its own right (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0144739413488904">Caiden, 1991</xref>). In this book he<list list-type="bullet">

</p>
<p>He registered the massive growth in the literature and general discourse on administrative reform over this 20-year period with this telling chapter heading: ‘Administrative Reform Breaks Loose’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0144739413488904">Caiden, 1991</xref>: ch. 5, p. 73).</p>

<title>The administrative reform issue attracts wide attention, but is it too much?</title>
<p>So many public administration scholars have contributed in one way or another to this literature. John Halligan of the University of Canberra has done important work comparing reform initiatives and outcomes in OECD countries (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0144739413488904">Halligan, 2001a</xref>), and has compiled a progressive record of these initiatives and outcomes in the Commonwealth of Australia jurisdiction over a period of around 20 years (most recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0144739413488904">Halligan, 2010</xref>). In more conceptual vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0144739413488904">Halligan (2001a</xref>: 1–15) has identified the main types of administrative reform as focusing on the following aspects of administrative life, many of which have strong NPM connections:<list list-type="bullet">

<p>Many others would add tackling corruption and encouraging ethical practice. Each of these aspects has attracted its own large literature, and undoubtedly the work of public administration worldwide has benefited positively and in major ways from their efforts. What is striking, however, is that scholars who have chosen rather to focus on the overarching issue of the administrative reform process itself have tended to adopt a more critical tone. Thus, in a festschrift prepared to honour all the important contributions of Caiden (including his work on administrative reform but much more), frequent UN consultant Argyriades notes another Caiden observation that ‘Public Service reform never goes out of style’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0144739413488904">Caiden and Sundaram, 2004</xref>: 373)<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0144739413488904">5</xref>
</sup> and adds his own comment:<disp-quote>
<p>In almost every country, it has featured prominently on government agendas and the political platforms of the opposition parties competing for attention. Considering the risks, complexities and costs of most reform agendas, their slow implementation and very mixed results, we may be justified in pondering the frequency, utility and undiminished appeal of public service reform. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0144739413488904">Argyriades, 2007</xref>: 1)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Similarly, an important book on <italic>Tides of Reform</italic> in the U.S. opens with this explanation:<disp-quote>
<p>This book is based on the notion that there is not too little management reform in government, but too much. Contrary to conventional wisdom, Congress and the presidency have had little trouble passing reform measures over the years, moving almost effortlessly from one reform philosophy to another and back again, rarely questioning the contradictions and consequences of each separate act. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0144739413488904">Light, 1997</xref>: 1)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Again, a Maltese practitioner–scholar begins a serious treatment of the subject with the simple declaration that ‘most reforms in government fail’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0144739413488904">Polidano, 2001</xref>: 346).</p>
<p>In another work not so far cited, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0144739413488904">Caiden (1982</xref>: ch. 7) distinguished between administrative reform as change ‘imposed on reluctant organizations and protesting administrations’, and ‘revitalization’ (or ‘bureaucratic revitalization’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0144739413488904">Caiden, 1981</xref>: 191) as change generated from within – less adventurous, less idealistic and so on, but probably with more chance of success in the long run because the organization is committed to it. A group of British analysts saw the distinction in terms of deliberateness: for them, public management reform was ‘deliberate change in the arrangements for the design and delivery of public services’, involving planning and direction from above – something more than accidental or spontaneous movement, even though the latter might contribute significantly to the improvement of administrative processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0144739413488904">Boyne et al., 2003</xref>: 3).<sup>

</sup>
</p>
<p>Dealing with a related area – the drive for new initiatives in public policy and administration – another group of British writers has suggested that there has been so much poorly thought out activity that we are succumbing to the disease of ‘initiativitis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0144739413488904">Perry 6 et al., 1999</xref>: 24; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0144739413488904">Stoker, 2002</xref>: 427).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0144739413488904">7</xref> </sup>Perhaps we are now in danger of succumbing to the disease of ‘reformitis’?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0144739413488904">
<title>“Third world” applications</title>
<p>For a conference in Indonesia, it was appropriate to point out that Asia and the so-called Third World in general are quite as much a party to the love affair with administrative reform and the doubts many have expressed about it as the European and North American countries. Earlier EROPA conferences and resulting publications had focused on administrative reform.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0144739413488904">8</xref>
</sup> Japan has had its Minister for Administrative Reform, India its Administrative Reform Commission, Malta its Public Sector Reform Commission. As reactions at least in part to World Bank, IMF and OECD pressures, manifestations of the drive for administrative reform emerged in many other countries; and, as recorded in a publication of the Arab Organization of Administrative Sciences, the Arab states were by no means exempt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0144739413488904">Al-Saigh, 1986</xref>).<disp-quote>
<p>In the Indian case, leading scholar SR Maheshwari has written: `My involvement in administrative reform is as old as my teaching career.' I started teaching in 1955, when the time was thick with talk about innovations in the country's public administration… Later, I joined the Indian Institute of Public Administration, where my explicit responsibility was to look after administrative reform… My professional life has thus been devoted to the study of the theory and practice of administrative reform' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0144739413488904">Maheshwari, 2002</xref>: vii).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Item 5 in the list of Caiden propositions recorded above notes the impact of the rise of the sub-disciplines of development administration and comparative administration. Illustrative of these influences was Professor JD Montgomery’s broad survey of the development of the administrative reform paradigm for the Comparative Administration Group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0144739413488904">Montgomery, 1967</xref>). Caiden followed the first edition of his book with a working paper to an International Seminar on Major Administrative Reforms in Developing Countries at the University of Sussex in Britain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0144739413488904">Caiden, 1971</xref>). There were plenty of global extensions, such as the Global Forum on Reinventing Government initiated in the U.S. in 1999 (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0144739413488904">Kim et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Not long afterwards, writing for a Philippines journal, Singapore academic Jon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0144739413488904">Quah (1976</xref>) presented a conceptual review of the administrative reform movement, and was critical of many attempts to define such reform – including Caiden’s – because they failed to identify the goals it is intended to achieve. Measurement of effectiveness, Quah argued, needed to be based on the matter of goal achievement, and this was obviously impossible if goals were not stipulated. Quah observed that there were both institutional and attitudinal (behavioural) aspects of reform, and the first alone (recently described graphically as constituting a ‘restructuring fetish’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0144739413488904">Boston and Douglas, 2011</xref>: 102, on which see more below) was unlikely to produce positive results. Also, he suggested, it was necessary to recognize and contrast comprehensive and narrower (incremental) approaches: the latter were more likely to be effective because they attempted less and were more likely to have clear goals. Offering a checklist of risks and obstacles, Quah argued further that success was most likely where the attempted administrative reform could be associated with simultaneous changes in the political system, especially where a competent political leadership was promoting implementation of the reform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0144739413488904">Quah, 1976</xref>).<sup>

</p>
<p>In the Australian case, a 2007 election promise to reform federal (Commonwealth–state) relations led to the creation under the Rudd government of a so-called COAG Reform Council (where COAG stands for Council of Australian Governments: see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0144739413488904">O’Loughlin, 2011</xref>). The same government established a “blueprint”-type review that looked towards substantial and on-going reform of the federal public service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0144739413488904">Moran, 2010</xref>), this seeming to surprise no one notwithstanding that there had been dozens of earlier reform inquiries at both federal and state levels. A recently published Australian book is of particular interest here because the title of one of its parts comes so close to that of the EROPA conference where this article began life: <italic>The Reform Challenge</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0144739413488904">Lindquist et al., 2011</xref>). Another recent Australian book describes the period from the early 1980s as ‘the reform era’, and divides this period into three main phases: ‘managerialism’, ‘new public management’ and ‘integrated government’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0144739413488904">Edwards et al., 2012</xref>: 35–36). What went before is seen as traditional public administration, often associated with the formulations of the great German sociologist Max Weber.</p>

<title>Recent contributions to the discourse about administrative reform</title>

<title>The industry runs on</title>
<p>There has been no slowing down in the administrative reform industry, either in its practical or scholarly (research, publishing, conference, et cetera) sides. Reviewing the just-mentioned recent book, an Australian analyst writes: ‘we live in an age of reform’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0144739413488904">Nethercote, 2011</xref>: 6). An explanation, again with warnings about over-use, appears in that book:<disp-quote>
<p>History tends to look most kindly on reforming leaders – those who are credited with the transformation of old orders into new ones. The growing awareness of this reality has led to every government and every minister compulsively talking up their reformist credentials. Reform has become, in other words, a political must for leaders. No self-respecting new CEO can afford not to announce grand plans for reorganisation; no self-respecting government can avoid employing the rhetoric of reform. The risk is that even the most timid, technical and trivial policy changes are talked up as “reforms”. This gives reform a bad name.</p>
<p>The term “reform” ought to be reserved for methodological attempts to achieve far-reaching changes in key beliefs and behaviours within a community and the governance structures underpinning them. Marginal adjustment of existing practices – however defensible – is not reform; it is public policy as usual. To oversell it as reform sets you up as an emperor who has no clothes. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0144739413488904">‘t Hart, 2011</xref>: 204)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The areas regarded as requiring reform attention – again, in scholarship as well as in practising government – are many and varied, and any summary treatment such as this can merely touch the surface. This section notes particularly the rising effort to focus on the special area of policy reform and its implications for administrative reform in general, efforts to measure whether reforms have been successful or unsuccessful, and efforts to identify strategies to be followed in achieving best reform results. The concern for stability will be apparent in much of this treatment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0144739413488904">
<title>A special concern for policy reform</title>
<p>In one sense, the effort to focus on policy reform represents a narrowing down of the field. A leading research innovator here has been Eric Patashnik, Professor of Politics and Public Policy at the Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy at the University of Virginia: his prize-winning book on <italic>Reforms at Risk</italic> (2008) has been widely noted and influential in promoting relevant discussion in many places.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0144739413488904">10</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The narrowing is immediately noticeable in Patashnik’s definition: reform is ‘a deliberate non-incremental change in an existing line of policy, intended to impart institutional rationality on governmental activity to make it more rational, or to distribute benefits to some broad constituency’. Thus it changes something that previously existed in another form. But of course some policies are ‘breakthrough’ ones, bringing government into fields it has not previously occupied – whether that is actually reform is debatable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0144739413488904">Patashnik, 2011</xref>: 30). Either way, the big problem is to make any such policy change stick – to make it sustainable. There are enactment and implementation phases. The determination, skill and persistence of the political-system leaders are major factors. But so is the capacity of the administrative system – its machinery and processes – to carry through the reform.</p>
<p>Once this is factored in, policy reform comes to seem like the peak of the reform mountain, providing direction and energy for the broader process of administrative reform. And of course, while policy concerns often do focus on issues that lie well away from simply tending the administrative machinery, often enough too they have a much more direct connection. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0144739413488904">Patashnik (2008</xref>) presents US case studies that illustrate both types: for example, airline deregulation, agricultural subsidies and welfare state reform on one hand, and reform of the government procurement system on the other. For many outside the US, ridding ourselves of corrupt practices would seem a major policy reform issue, but it is one firmly located within the administrative machinery itself.</p>
<p>There is a large literature that discusses a great range of policy issues, with many texts on the policy process itself as well as a massive number of case studies of particular policies being designed, enacted and implemented.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0144739413488904">11</xref>
</sup> But a caveat is needed: as Polidano has pointed out, what many studies have shown is that the context of reform (i.e. the policy setting) ‘makes little difference to the success rate, in the sense that different kinds of reforms – decentralization, new public management, capacity building however defined – have shown themselves to be equally prone to failure’. For him, they mostly fail ‘because they never get past the implementation stage’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0144739413488904">Polidano, 2001</xref>: 346).</p>
<p>Identifying distinct stages is of course an oversimplification. In so far as enactment is concerned, in so many cases the policy has to be massaged into acceptance, involving many compromises as it passes through the political processes of the jurisdiction concerned. Policies that looked pure enough as they began their journey through these processes get pulled and pushed into shapes that often do not have too much correspondence with the original intentions, so that the resulting “reforms” may lack clarity, invite on-going debate and dissent, and confound attempts at neat and quick implementation. This is all the more so in democratic parliamentary systems, where political parties with conflicting ideologies and policy agendas compete for power, each one committed to pulling down many of the policies of the other if elected to government.</p>

<title>Successful or unsuccessful: how to measure?</title>
<p>Whether we think of policy reform or of the more general administrative reform, the search for reform strategies is important and will always go on. But it labours under the huge disadvantage that the outlines of a reform are often obscure for reasons that may have little to do with all the planning that has taken place to get them started in good order. We want to know whether the reforms “have worked”, have led to improvements in the fields of activity they are concerned with, have generally been successful. But the fuzziness that so often surrounds the outcomes – in part because the origins so often become compromised – makes judgments of that sort very difficult to make. It is not so surprising that reform measurement has become another important topic for analytical inquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0144739413488904">de Bruijn, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0144739413488904">Boyne et al., 2003</xref>; Pastashnik, 2008).</p>
<p>Around 10 years ago Boyne and his British associates observed that, while administrative reform studies continued to proliferate, few of them concerned themselves with reform impacts and outputs. They sought to do this with their analysis of British healthcare, housing and education reforms, but their study mostly showed how difficult it was to make judgments about success and failure, contributed to also because of methodological problems such as the absence of firm “before and after” data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0144739413488904">Boyne et al., 2003</xref>: 1-2, 155).</p>
<p>Britain’s National Health Service (NHS) has been subject to much reform action over the past few decades, and in a classic study Christopher Pollitt has shown how, from about 1974 to well into the Blair government period, it experienced a virtually continuous process of structural change in the name of reform. Before the turn of the century its own official historian commented that ‘the time intervals between structural reforms have progressively diminished to the point that the NHS risks becoming caught up in a vortex of permanent upheaval’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0144739413488904">Webster, 1998</xref>, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0144739413488904">Pollitt, 2007</xref>: 530). But that did not slow the process of ‘serial re-structuring’, which Pollitt (p. 531) described as ‘pathological’, and which another observer said turned NHS managers into ‘change junkies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0144739413488904">Hunter, 2006</xref>: 209). Pollitt was writing at the end of the Blair government period, but it is likely that the ‘upheaval’ has continued.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0144739413488904">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Pollitt noted that there was massive reform action in some (not all) other UK governance sectors, and noted also that, for constitutional reasons, UK governments have more freedom to move than most comparable democratic government systems. For this reason, the UK experience taught some valuable lessons. He attributed the great volume of reform action in part to ‘the rise of the managerial reform community’, with ‘change management experts’ everywhere, in the public service, in the big consultancy firms, and so on.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0144739413488904">13</xref> </sup>And, compared with other things they might be doing, they and the political leaders they advised saw that ‘reorganization can be undertaken rather quickly’; doing it conferred on them ‘a badge of modernity’, and was a kind of ‘virility symbol’. But it was also a ‘beautifully clear example’ of the lack of any stable, scientific basis ‘for the long-term organizational redesign of complex public services’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0144739413488904">Pollitt, 2007</xref>: 532–534, 536, 538).</p>
<p>What the reform designers did not do anywhere near adequately was to consider the consequences of what they were doing. The rate of change – the state of ‘permanent revolution’ – made it impossible to find out which designs worked well and which did not. And the transition costs were minimized if not neglected altogether: as well as the costs of office redesign and so on, they included the disruption of staffing and relationship patterns and routine housekeeping systems that had worked well enough in the past, the loss of organizational memory, and ‘a general loss of faith in stability and an accompanying diminution of willingness fully to commit oneself to a particular organization’. The ‘dark side of reform’ was thus well illustrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0144739413488904">Pollitt, 2007</xref>: 538–540).</p>
<p>Britain may be a hard case. But how many of us contemplating reform action in other countries with somewhat softer experiences do not recognize that we share some of the same problems? One fairly simplistic example shows that Australians are no strangers to the ‘restructuring fetish’ that marked the British NHS case and was commented on also by observers of the New Zealand situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0144739413488904">Boston and Douglas, 2011</xref>: 102). Back in 1983 a reform-oriented review of Australian Commonwealth government administration urged that there should be some continuity in the names and functions of departments across changes of government in order to minimize the sorts of problems that come from too-frequent restructuring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0144739413488904">Reid, 1983</xref>: 29–30). But – despite one fairly noble attempt in 1987 to create a set of seemingly more sustainable departmental arrangements<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0144739413488904">14</xref>
</sup> – this has not happened. Clients, politicians, journalists, even their own officers today (as well as the suppliers of stationery, notice boards and the like) have to cope with departmental titles as awkward (and eminently changeable) as the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Populations and Communities (or DSEWPaC)!<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0144739413488904">15</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Moving back to broader reform issues, there is inevitably a time element in judgments about effectiveness. Short-term, medium-term and long-term perspectives need to be considered. As time passes, what may seem to be effective in the short term is capable of being unravelled, whereas what may seem to provide just a small gain in the short term may gather more support and grow into bigger and better things. A recent study, already quoted above, portrays the development of the European Union as ‘an outstanding saga of cascading institutional reform against all odds’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0144739413488904">‘t Hart, 2011</xref>: 208–209); but current problems with its southern members must surely be casting some doubt on that verdict, and if the Eurozone does collapse it will come to be seen in more negative terms. New Zealand’s bold NPM-style revolution of the 1980s has been widely interpreted as an example of heroic reform; but before long there was some retreat from it in New Zealand itself, and we were being told that it was not suitable for emulation in developing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0144739413488904">Schick, 1998</xref>). What is success and what failure here? At the policy level and using a very long-term perspective, it may be that the on-going multi-country campaign to reduce the level of smoking for public health reasons is proving to be one of the best examples of sustainable, conscious and deliberate reform the world has known: it too has generated a big literature, but it is not a literature that has so far shown much concern to explore the public administration reform characteristics of the anti-smoking movement (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0144739413488904">’t Hart, 2011</xref>: 210).</p>
<p>Obviously some reforms stick better than others. Why is this? What is there about them that builds in the capacity to be sustained? Given all these problems of reform design and measurement, what advice can we offer those planning new reform programs? There have been some efforts to construct rules that, if followed, are likely to contribute to better outcomes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0144739413488904">
<title>Strategies for sustainable reform design</title>
<p>Begin as a lead author of a symposium on administrative reform sponsored by the well-known Dutch development administration centre, the Institute of Social Studies in The Hague, reminded us a long time ago, the implementation of the Northcote–Trevelyan reforms over several generations from the 1850s must stand as one of the most successful pieces of administrative reform the world has known: it turned the British Civil Service away from patronage and into the merit-based system that has had wide model value throughout the world. But it was a lengthy process that required continuity of effort over two or three generations by supporters, against strong resistance by defenders of the status quo. This was, of course, before administrative reform as we now understand it became a subject of conscious practical and scholarly activity. But awareness of it provided one of the foundation stones for this early exercise in administrative reform strategy-building (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0144739413488904">Leemans, 1970</xref>–71: 15).</p>
<p>Few reforms can claim to be as conclusive or sustaining in the long term as that one. But there are other examples. Thus some jurisdictions have been far more successful than others in their war against corruption, with Hong Kong and Singapore being cases in good standing. For many generations after the 1880s, the introduction of the public (or statutory) corporation in Australia, Canada, Britain and many other countries as a managerial instrument for establishing sound governance in state-owned enterprises also registered as an effective and sustainable administrative reform – eventually defeated by changing political circumstances and an external rather than internal opposing force, the worldwide privatization movement. Caiden expressed these positives and negatives well in <italic>Administrative Reform Comes of Age </italic>(1991: 309): in many countries the battle to attain healthy public organizations ‘has been successfully fought over many generations’, and the problem is rather one of maintaining those successes in the ‘vastly different circumstances and altered conditions’ that are sooner or later likely to arise.</p>
<p>Together Leemans and Dror warn that administrative reform should never be an end in itself, and that reform programs need to be developed in relation to specific identifiable needs, which reflect unique situations requiring ‘careful and detailed analysis on the basis of elaborate data’. And, they also warn, for that program development there are some important requirements, including clear choices between a range of identified alternatives, availability of the necessary resources, enough elasticity to permit adjustments when the need is demonstrated, recognition that there will always be costs in maintaining political and organizational supports, and a high-quality staff. The paradox<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0144739413488904">16</xref> </sup>is that the last ‘is usually absent exactly when reform is most urgently needed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0144739413488904">Dror, 1970</xref>–71: 23; and generally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0144739413488904">Leemans, 1970</xref>–71: 16–17; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0144739413488904">Dror 1970</xref>–71: 20–33).</p>
<p>There have been many other efforts to portray risks and identify strategies. A generation ago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0144739413488904">Caiden (1982</xref>: xiv) was optimistic that progress was being made, but the search continues and there is nothing like finality. This is still a fuzzy area of practical experimentation and academic inquiry, and with political, social and organizational life remaining ever changeable and unpredictable it is likely to remain so.</p>
<p>Recently Dutch-Australian academic Paul ‘t Hart compiled his own set of rules for reformers, and insights from that compilation offer a useful way of drawing this discussion to a close. Some items are by now familiar ones; some perhaps not so and may surprise. The essential argument would be that proposers of reform activity are more likely to achieve some success if they take note of these rules and seek, as far as possible, to follow them. What follows paraphrases ‘t Hart’s treatment (‘t Hart, 2011: 203–210):<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Don’t overdo the rhetoric of reform, and concentrate on areas of greatest need.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Don’t let a ‘good crisis’ go to waste, for it may provide the best opportunity for serious change.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>‘Keep the bottom drawer well stocked’ with developed reform proposals, so that you are ready to run when an opportunity presents itself.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>You should invest in an ongoing ‘brains trust’ to be constantly thinking about such matters, and don’t ignore knowledge available outside government circles.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Be prepared for ‘push-backs’, and find ways of talking meaningfully to reform opponents.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Impeccable analysis is crucial to the power to persuade.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Know the system you propose to change inside out, so that you are prepared to cope with resistance from within.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Give careful attention to implementation and long-term management.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Create behavioural incentives to encourage those operating the new or changed system to conform.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Be sure to incorporate mechanisms that make the reforms self-sustaining.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>The last three items relate to the need for stability. It is part of the reform paradox – here’s that notion of paradox again! – that, while we need reform in so many areas, and that involves serious change, we also need stability to keep the system – the reformed system – operating in the ways intended by the reformers. Without it, as the British NHS case discussed above illustrates so well, all is topsy-turvy and there is no gain. Then the very idea of reform gets a bad name, and we should try to prevent that at all costs. Let’s have a worthwhile reform, but then give it the time and the supports needed to ensure that it sticks!</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section10-0144739413488904">
<title>Final word</title>
<p>This article has argued that is a challenge to wise administrative reform to ensure that reform does not threaten the organizational stability needed for effective policy implementation and service delivery. Administrative organizations are said to suffer from hardening of bureaucratic arteries, so that constant effort is needed to counter that tendency. While there is truth in that, the drive for reform needs to be accompanied by recognition that organizations subjected to frequent change – in the name of reform – are also unlikely to work well. There will always be tension between the need for stability and the need for reform, and this should be understood by the architects of reform programs. This is an important message for all concerned with challenges to administrative reform.</p>
<p>The article has reviewed the burgeoning literature on administrative reform, including policy reform which has emerged as a branch of the broader subject. It has noted that the idea of reform drives many public administration conferences, inquiries, reports and legislation today, so that it is with us as a seemingly inevitable and interminable issue to be debated. How to “do” reform better seems to be a constant puzzle. However, as we undertake the case studies and wrestle with the more theoretical side of the subject, we learn more about it. It does have a rational side, and that should be exploited wherever possible. Shorn of the politics, we could by now be very good at reform. Of course it won’t be shorn of the politics, and of course political activity has its own rationality. Perhaps the challenge now, at both theoretical and practical levels, is to see whether we can’t bring these rationalities together? That would certainly constitute a major advance in our understanding of the processes of administrative reform!</p>

<p>I thank an anonymous referee for challenging me to offer an explanation for the rise of NPM to the point where it came close to monopolizing conceptual discussion in the field; almost, indeed, replacing administrative reform. NPM took elements from most of the others and put them together in a way that suggested for a time that something new and original had emerged, the most powerful driving force probably being the commitment of its adherents to the small-government value system.</p>

<p>Halligan has also joined with Norwegian colleagues in identifying ‘instrumental’, ‘cultural’ and ‘myth’ perspectives that have been influential in driving reform programs, and in classifying jurisdictions in terms of the enthusiasms they have shown for reform – ‘reluctant reformers’ (like Norway), ‘specialist reformers’ (most countries have had reform programs directed at particular issues from time to time), ‘ambivalent reformers’ (like Sweden, committed to general reform but an uneven effort to implement), and ‘comprehensive reformers’ (Britain, Australia and New Zealand during the heyday of NPM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0144739413488904">Christensen et al., 2007</xref>: ch.7; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0144739413488904">Halligan, 2001b</xref>).</p>

<p>The terms “public service reform” and “public sector reform” often seem to be used almost interchangeably in this literature. A careful approach would, however, distinguish between “public service” as the apparatus of central departments and civil service, and “public sector” as the totality of that central core and all the non-departmental bodies, local governments and so on that surround it in the operations of government in most countries.</p>
