<p>Milosz Kucharski has recently been awarded a Ph.D. by the University of California, Davis. His current work focuses on soft balancing in international relations. Specifically, his research deals with the causes of soft balancing and the circumstances under which it is most likely to occur. More broadly, he is interested in international security, great power competition and the politics of unipolarity.</p>

<abstract>
<p>Recent literature on soft balancing predicts an increased occurrence of soft balancing against Washington at times when the United States acts unilaterally in foreign policy. At the same time, realist literature in IR suggests that interest violations should trigger opposition by states whose interests are being violated, unless there are unacceptable costs associated with soft balancing. In contrast to these views, this article demonstrates that interest violation and unilateralism, both individually and together, are weak predictors of soft balancing. Instead, based on the cases analyzed, I argue that soft balancing is most likely to occur when interest violations go hand in hand with perceptions of predatory intentions.</p>

<p>Balance of power theory is one of the oldest and most influential ideas in international relations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0047117811420893">1</xref></sup> It posits that states will balance against any nation that threatens to become strong enough to be able to impose its will on other states. Regardless of whether we consider today’s international system to be unipolar or post-unipolar, balance of power theory leads us to expect strong balancing against Washington as the United States enjoys the preeminent position in the international arena. Yet, contrary to the view that internal balancing, especially by China, is already taking place,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0047117811420893">2</xref></sup> the last two decades have witnessed only minor changes in alliance patterns, as well as a lack of assertive and ambitious military buildups. This, together with the great powers’ unwillingness to use their latent capabilities to offset American power, ‘disappoints expectations of traditional forms of balancing’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0047117811420893">3</xref></sup> Given the lack of traditional balancing against the US, a new concept emerged in international relations theory – soft balancing.</p>
<p>Soft balancing is a non-military form of balancing, which aims to frustrate and impose additional costs on the dominant state that, due to its preponderance of power, cannot be opposed in a traditional way. With the emergence of soft balancing as an idea in IR theory, a discussion about its determinants opened up. Some scholars suggested that unilateralism is the leading cause of soft balancing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0047117811420893">4</xref></sup> However, as Pape pointed out, there is nothing about unilateralism that makes it inherently threatening or provocative, and, therefore, unilateralism should not be seen as the sole cause of soft balancing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0047117811420893">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>A realist explanation of soft balancing argues that states soft-balance when doing so is in their best interests. This means that states will not automatically engage in soft balancing in a non-equilibrium international system or when their national interests are violated. Instead, before opposing the hegemon, states will consider the consequences of their actions and engage in a cost−benefit analysis. If the costs of soft balancing do not override its benefits, then soft balancing will take place. If states consider the costs intolerable, then they will not soft-balance.</p>
<p>Despite all the work on soft balancing, research of this phenomenon has not moved beyond its theoretical stage. We still do not know under what circumstances soft balancing takes place. The first explanation – of the link between unilateralism and soft balancing − is theoretically problematic and can hardly be considered a theory, while the realist explanation has not yet been evaluated. So this article attempts to test the realist argument against a competing theory, which argues that soft balancing takes place when the United States violates other states’ national interests in a way that is seen as predatory.</p>
<sec id="section1-0047117811420893">
<title>Theory and research design</title>
<p>This article tries to uncover the determinants of Chinese opposition toward American actions by testing two theories. The first is the realist explanation of soft balancing, which posits that states act in self-interest and it is the pursuit of self-interest that determines whether soft balancing takes place. This theory suggests that we can expect states whose interests are violated by the United States to oppose the perpetrator in all instances, except for cases when opposition is deemed too costly.</p>
<p>At the same time, this article tests a new theory, which argues that soft balancing takes place only when interest violation goes hand in hand with the perception of American intentions as predatory. This theory posits that when American actions violate the national interests of another state and when they are seen as predatory, the ‘victim state’ will soft-balance against the US. This argument does not challenge the idea that the pursuit of national interests matters. It only argues that realist approaches, which look at soft balancing only through the prism of tangible national interests, provide us with an incomplete picture of why states resort to soft balancing and are inferior to hybrid theories that focus on both material and ideational aspects of foreign policymaking.</p>
<sec id="section2-0047117811420893">
<title>Soft balancing</title>
<p>This article deals with soft balancing because there has been virtually no hard balancing against the US thus far. Soft balancing involves ‘limited, tacit, or indirect balancing strategies largely through coalition building and diplomatic bargaining within international institutions’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0047117811420893">6</xref></sup> It represents a non-military form of opposition, occurring when weaker states decide that the influence and actions of a stronger state are unacceptable; this form of balancing is undertaken to frustrate, undermine and impose costs on the actions of the dominant state. States undertake soft balancing to make it more difficult for the stronger party to use its power against them, to ‘equalize the odds in a contest between the strong and the weak’, and to deter the more powerful side from pursuing objectives that violate their core national interests.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0047117811420893">7</xref></sup> Although some skeptics maintain that soft balancing is indistinguishable from diplomatic friction,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0047117811420893">8</xref></sup> it produces very real effects by making the superpower somewhat less capable of imposing its will on the rest of the international community, and by leading to ‘outcomes contrary to US preferences – outcomes that could not be obtained’ otherwise.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0047117811420893">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>This article relies on four indicators of soft balancing, three of which were developed by Robert Pape. These include: (1) territorial denial, (2) entangling diplomacy, (3) economic statecraft, and (4) signaling the resolve to balance. Territorial denial involves denying the superpower access to territory. Territorial denial is used during military operations when the superpower can benefit from using third-party territories as either a staging or a transit area for its forces.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0047117811420893">10</xref></sup> Territorial denial can augment the costs of a given operation by increasing logistical expenses, by making power projection more difficult and by making certain strategies non-feasible. All of this effectively reduces the chances of a swift victory.</p>
<p>Entangling diplomacy involves the ‘use of international institutions and ad hoc diplomatic maneuvers’ to thwart the plans of the dominant power.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0047117811420893">11</xref></sup> This strategy is pursued by states when the behavior and intentions of the dominant state are seen as incompatible with their interests and when a hegemon’s actions are considered out of line. Soft balancing of this kind is effective because even the strongest states cannot ignore the rules of international conduct without losing legitimacy and support for their causes. Consequently, diplomatic entanglement can be used to increase costs to the superpower and decrease the legitimacy of its actions.</p>
<p>Economic statecraft is the art of using economic means to influence other states in the international system.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0047117811420893">12</xref></sup> Positive economic statecraft, which is not of interest to this article, involves the use of positive sanctions to provide rewards. On the other hand, negative economic statecraft, which is used here as an indicator of soft balancing, is associated with attempts to punish, frustrate, or threaten a third party (in this case, the United States). This form of economic statecraft relies on the use of negative sanctions such as embargos, boycotts, quotas, dumping, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0047117811420893">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally, signaling the resolve to balance has to do with demonstrating ‘resolve in a manner that signals a commitment to resist the superpower’s future ambitions’. Since challenging a hegemon either individually or collectively is extremely difficult under unipolarity, signaling the resolve to balance is the first step towards trying to actively oppose the superpower. Signaling the resolve to balance aims not only to frustrate and restrain the hegemon, but also to increase states’ trust in each other’s willingness to resist the unipole, thereby helping states to overcome collective action problems by creating expectations of balancing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0047117811420893">14</xref></sup></p>

<title>National interests</title>
<p>National interest, although central to the study of foreign policy, is an ever-debated concept in international relations. Conventional perspectives usually equate national interest with the pursuit of security, defined as physical survival and territorial integrity. This stems from the belief that the international system is anarchic and that interstate conflict is both endemic and inevitable. Critical perspectives tend to view national interests as derivatives of the private interests of those who control the state, while liberal approaches remain ambiguous about national interests, often suggesting that they reflect sectional interests. Finally, progressive perspectives such as constructivism maintain that national interests are intersubjective and ideationally based, and emphasize the ideational context in which interests are forged.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0047117811420893">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The concept of national interest is, therefore, variously understood in the scholarly community, and more often than not policymakers themselves disagree about its exact meaning. This indicates that there may exist significant cross-country differences in how national interests are defined. This is because national interests are derivatives of states’ positions in the world community, the security threats that they encounter, the states’ political ideologies and traditions, past experiences, special interests, and other factors. As such, instead of favoring one school of thought at the expense of another, and adopting a specific definition of national interest, this article looks into how China defines its national interests and tries to objectively operationalize this variable. More specifically, I identify the main national interests of the People’s Republic based on official government documents delineating national policies, interests, and goals.</p>
<p>Chinese national interests are identified based on the following: <italic>Analysis of China’s National Interest</italic> by Xuetong, <italic>China’s National Defense</italic>, the white paper <italic>China’s National Defense in 2004</italic>, and the white paper <italic>China’s National Defense in 2006</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0047117811420893">16</xref></sup> Based on these sources, we can identify the four key national interests of the People’s Republic: (1) promoting economic development, (2) upholding national security and unity, (3) maintaining a steady increase in China’s overall strength and status, and (4) fostering Chinese national identity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0047117811420893">
<title>Predation</title>
<p>Although this article agrees with the mainstream thought that violations of national interests often induce the victim states to soft-balance, I argue that not all interest violations are equal − they come in two flavors. In most instances, states violate one another’s interests not for reasons of containment or relative gains, but because of their overlapping national goals. On the other hand, some violations are seen as intentional, premeditated, and designed to contain – these violations are considered predatory and are likely to induce opposition.</p>
<p>I consider a given action as predatory when it is seen either as aiming to change the status quo at the other state’s expense or as challenging its authority as a great power. In other words, there are two reasons an American foreign policy decision can be seen as predatory. First, a major power such as China will see an action as predatory when it produces adverse consequences and when the harm that this action entails is not seen as accidental. If a given American action is perceived as aiming to harm Chinese interests, then it will be considered predatory and opposition will be voiced. If, on the other hand, a US foreign policy decision clashes with China’s national interests, but the harm is seen as unintended, then American intentions will not be viewed as predatory and no soft balancing will take place.</p>
<p>Second, building on Lowenheim,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0047117811420893">17</xref></sup> I argue that with great power comes great power authority. This authority can be seen as a set of special rights and duties. For example, great powers ‘play a part in determining [the] issues that affect the peace and security of the international system’ and regulate the institutions of transborder violence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0047117811420893">18</xref></sup> When this authority is challenged, a great power will soft-balance against the challenger. In other words, when a given American action is ‘overtly advancing alternative or opposing basic concepts of authority’, a state whose authority is being abused will oppose the United States with regard to that action.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0047117811420893">19</xref></sup> In this article, I consider China’s great power authority as being challenged when US behavior defies the UN-based international system in which China is accorded great power status.</p>
<p>The distinction between predatory and non-predatory interest violations is an important one as it is the perception of American intentions that determines whether soft balancing takes place. Since soft balancing involves such costs as the deterioration of relations with the US, diplomatic friction, communication problems, and an increased likelihood of conflict, states are unlikely to soft-balance in the absence of serious violations of their national interests. Major powers will not soft-balance against non-predatory interest violations because such violations constitute a commonplace occurrence in the international arena. Since great powers have interests in many regions of the world and in numerous areas of political life, their interests are likely to clash, but soft balancing against each and every violation is neither a feasible nor a desirable strategy.</p>
<p>Predatory interest violations are different from their non-predatory counterparts in that they are much more serious, which affects the cost−benefit analysis that the victim states engage in. Simply put, states whose interests were violated in a manner perceived as predatory will pay less attention to the potential costs of soft balancing. That is, when an interest violation is seen as predatory by virtue of being intentional, it will be opposed as states will not express silent consent for actions that aim to contain them. Similarly, states whose authority is challenged are likely to oppose the challenger because great power authority and status are indivisible. States will, therefore, defend their authority even when the defense is costly.</p>

<title>Structured and focused comparison</title>
<p>This article aims to tests two arguments regarding the determinants of soft balancing – the realist explanation and a new theory that soft balancing only takes place when interest violation goes hand in hand with perceptions of American intentions as predatory. This is done by analyzing three cases: two in which China strongly opposed American actions and one in which no soft balancing took place. These two sets of events are then compared in order to isolate the likely determinants of Chinese soft balancing.</p>
<p>The research strategy employed here is a structured and focused comparison developed by George and Bennett. This study compares events or cases in which soft balancing took place with those where it did not. The comparison is structured so that it asks a series of general questions of each case in order to standardize the data collection and make systematic analysis possible. These questions reflect the theoretical framework described above, and in answering them I rely on the definitions of soft balancing, predation, and national interests mentioned above. This method is also focused, in that I only look at certain aspects of historical events, and the case studies themselves are embarked on with specific research objectives in mind.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0047117811420893">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>This article focuses on events that present a potential for soft balancing: that is, events that violate China’s national interests. I analyze events that took place between 26 December 1991 (the dissolution of the Soviet Union) and 31 December 2009. The cases, however, are not chosen randomly as the universe of cases is not specified. Instead, I select cases that present a potential for soft balancing and, at the same time, represent events in which the US violated the sovereignty of another state by forcefully intervening in its domestic affairs. Given these criteria, this article analyzes the Iraq War, the war in Afghanistan, and the intervention in Kosovo.</p>
<p>In researching these events I do not address all of the interesting aspects of each case. Instead, I focus only on those variables that are theoretically relevant. This research design allows for a more nuanced analysis than one that can be achieved in statistically oriented research. At the same time, I am well aware that focusing on only three cases may not allow me to conclusively answer the question of what causes soft balancing. However, this article is a good starting point given the fact that research on soft balancing has not yet tested any explanations for the phenomenon.</p>

<title>The intervention in Kosovo (1999)</title>
<p>With the end of the Cold War, the issue of humanitarian intervention appeared on the agenda of policymakers worldwide. Nonetheless, there was no consensus as to whether and under what circumstances humanitarian interventions could be conducted. China belonged to the group of states that argued that the principle of sovereignty supersedes humanitarian considerations and that opposed the intervention in Kosovo. Beijing’s opposition, however, was not rooted in China’s geopolitical interests because Kosovo was a very distant place, and what happened in Yugoslavia had little or no bearing on the PRC’s security and material interests.</p>
<p>Although the intervention in Kosovo in itself did not endanger China’s security, the precedent that it established did. While this precedent may not seem to be something that could truly jeopardize the security of a great power, the Chinese took it seriously. For the PRC, the Kosovo precedent endangered China’s national interest of upholding its national security and unity for two reasons. First, Beijing felt uneasy about Kosovo because of its belief that NATO’s behavior could encourage separatist groups anywhere on earth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0047117811420893">21</xref></sup> Given the existing separatist movements within China, actions that embolden minorities go against China’s goal of maintaining its unity. Second, the fact that NATO − a foreign military alliance – tried to assume moral superiority and used a humanitarian rationale to justify the intervention in Kosovo was worrisome for the PRC because humanitarianism could be used to justify interventions everywhere. Since China has a dismal human rights record, international attempts to add humanitarian considerations to the list of legal motivators of armed intervention violates China’s security almost by definition.</p>
<p>Although upholding national security and unity was the only one of Chinese interests that the intervention in Kosovo violated, it provided a sufficient stimulus for the PRC to respond. China, whenever an opportunity arose, argued that the intervention constituted a flagrant violation of international law as it lacked the UN Security Council’s authorization and violated the Charter of the United Nations. Similarly, Chinese sources rejected humanitarian rationales, arguing that they were ‘simply fig leaves used to cover larger American geopolitical purposes’ such as reducing Russia’s sphere of influence and removing obstacles to further NATO expansion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0047117811420893">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Moreover, the United States and NATO were accused of other, far more elaborate, conspiracies. For example, some Chinese journalists and scholars suggested that NATO was aiming to open up the Balkans to Western political, military, and economic influence in order to allow for easy transfers of oil and gas from the Caucasus and Central Asia. Others claimed that the US planned to control Eurasia by keeping Russia weak and to contain China by using military alliances. Still others believed that Kosovo was an important preemptive chess move that would allow Washington to strategically prepare for a future conflict with China.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0047117811420893">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Though some of these theories exhibit traits of paranoia, the predominant belief held by Chinese journalists, political analysts, and scholars was that the intervention in Kosovo was directed against Russia. In addition to emphasizing Washington’s ulterior motives and pointing out that the intervention was unwarranted and illegal, the official Chinese press accused NATO of using barbaric force. Chinese media tended to present the Serbian account of events; they considered Albanian actions to be illegal. Meanwhile, the military actions of NATO were compared to the atrocities perpetrated by Nazi Germany during WWII, and Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav president, was portrayed as an anti-imperialist hero.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0047117811420893">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Chinese criticism of Washington reached its peak on 7 May 1999, when five US bombs hit the PRC’s embassy in Belgrade, killing three journalists and injuring 20 Chinese citizens. At the time, Chinese political analysts raved that the bombing was not accidental; they argued that it constituted American punishment for Beijing’s unwillingness to bandwagon with NATO. After the incident, political rhetoric in the PRC reached a completely new level. For example, Li Peng declared that ‘the whole Chinese people is united in hatred of the common enemy’ − the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0047117811420893">25</xref></sup> Others denounced the act as a barbaric violation of Chinese sovereignty and demanded official apologies and punishment for those responsible.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0047117811420893">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Domestically, the Chinese government did not restrain the public, inflaming the protests that took place shortly after the bombing. The Chinese authorities granted approval for mass demonstrations and allowed for extensive coverage of the Serbian rescue operation and of the return of dead bodies to China. What is more, the PRC even provided transportation for students who expressed their willingness to protest in front of the American embassy in Beijing. These same students would later throw bricks, eggs, paint bombs, and Molotov cocktails at the embassy building and vehicles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0047117811420893">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the foreign policy realm, the PRC suspended almost all bilateral exchanges with the United States, including trade negotiations, nonproliferation and human rights talks, and military exchanges.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0047117811420893">28</xref></sup> China forbade US military aircraft from using its airports in Hong Kong and stopped authorizing the presence of American warships in Chinese ports.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0047117811420893">29</xref></sup> Additionally, shortly after – and even during – the intervention in Kosovo, Beijing attempted to strengthen its military ties with Moscow. The two powers even coordinated their reaction to the Chinese embassy bombing, which suggests that Kosovo brought them closer together.</p>
<p>Overall, China led an anti-American campaign to deprive the US of any legitimacy. Chinese behavior constitutes soft balancing, as it aimed to impose additional costs on the United States. Of the indicators of soft balancing that I employ, the PRC’s response to NATO’s attack on Yugoslavia is an example of both entangling diplomacy and territorial denial. Beijing’s reaction constitutes an attempt to entangle the US diplomatically because: (1) in its rhetoric, China emphasized that the intervention was unwarranted and illegal in order to make it more difficult for the United States to justify it and to gain international support; and (2) China, together with Russia, made it impossible for the UN Security Council to authorize the use of force by threatening to use its veto power. Finally, the People’s Republic forbade the US military from using some of its airports and seaports, which is a clear instance of territorial denial.</p>
<p>In retrospect, Chinese reaction to the intervention in Kosovo clashed with realist explanations of soft balancing. Such explanations argue that states soft-balance whenever it is in their interests unless there are unacceptable costs associated with it. Given the realist emphasis on states’ pursuit of national interest and security, China should not have soft-balanced against the United States and NATO because the PRC possessed no interests in the Balkans. Simply put, Kosovo is too tiny, lacks natural resources and is too far away from China to be an object of importance to Beijing.</p>
<p>However, one can stretch the realist perspective a little and argue that the PRC soft-balanced against the precedent that the intervention created. Yet even if we assume this to be the case, realist explanations of Chinese behavior fail miserably, as it was simply not in the interests of China to soft-balance. This is because soft balancing created significant costs with regards to maintaining good relations with China’s most important partner – the United States. China could not count on influencing American behavior, and even when cooperating with Russia the two powers could not prevent NATO from intervening. Consequently, opposing the United States carried mostly costs and few, if any, benefits.</p>
<p>Most importantly, Chinese soft balancing led to a suspension of trade negotiations with Washington, which represented a major cost to the PRC. Since the legitimacy of the Chinese regime depends primarily on the PRC’s economic performance, by deciding to soft-balance its leaders put their country’s economic development in jeopardy. This means that soft balancing, by weakening economic relations with the West, represented a substantial cost for China, which dwarfed any benefits that China might have derived from opposing the US. As such, the PRC’s opposition seems to be a product of emotional and ideational forces rather than rational calculation, and for that reason it is inconsistent with realist explanations of soft balancing.</p>
<p>However, China’s behavior is consistent with this article’s primary theory that soft balancing takes place when interest violations go hand in hand with perceptions of predatory intentions. Although the Chinese leadership most likely did not believe that the intervention in Kosovo was aimed at their country, they perceived the intervention as a predatory attack on China’s great power authority. This is because, by intervening in the Balkans without the authorization of the UN Security Council, the United States and NATO defied the rules of the post-WWII security system in which the PRC enjoys great power status.</p>
<p>For China it is only natural to emphasize the role of the UN Security Council as the only institution that can authorize the use of force in international relations. When the United States and NATO intervened in Kosovo without a mandate from the Security Council, their actions undermined China’s position as a great power. This was considered to be a predatory attack on China’s authority, and together with the violation of the PRC’s national interests led to anti-American soft balancing.</p>

<title>The war in Afghanistan (2001)</title>
<p>Since its very beginning, the war in Afghanistan has been expected to lead to great power rivalry between the US and the PRC and the US and Russia. For the People’s Republic the region is especially important given China’s growing population and energy needs. Although America’s presence in the region offered hope that Afghanistan might one day become stable, Beijing felt uneasy about the war, suspecting that the US would choose to maintain a permanent presence in south-central Asia. Consequently, the war endangered China’s energy security as it created a situation in which the United States could cut off the PRC’s oil supplies almost entirely, since it maintained military control over both Middle Eastern and Central Asian oil.</p>
<p>In addition to constituting a threat to China’s economic development, the American presence in Afghanistan was seen by some Chinese analysts as a severe challenge to the PRC’s security. There are two reasons for this. First, the presence of US troops in Afghanistan, as well as in some states in Central Asia, exacerbated Chinese fears of encirclement.</p>
<p>Chinese security analysts worry that America seeks to surround China with bases and military relationships that stretch from South Korea, through Japan and Taiwan, down to Australia, through the subcontinent, and up to Central Asia. Adding new forces along China’s northwestern flank would nearly complete the circle.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0047117811420893">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>From this point of view, the US presence in Afghanistan, and in wider Central Asia, constituted a threat to China’s vital interest – its security.</p>
<p>The second reason why the war endangered China’s interests had to do with Afghanistan’s significance for ensuring Pakistan’s security. Pakistan, which is China’s most important ally, is said to lack strategic depth. Islamabad, to a large extent, is able to minimize this disadvantage by maintaining good relations with Afghanistan, which helps to compensate for Pakistan’s geographical inadequacy. However, America’s invasion of Afghanistan, and its attempt to overthrow the ‘friendly’ Taliban in Kabul, threatened to deprive Pakistan of its geographic depth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0047117811420893">31</xref></sup> This is because Washington and its allies were expected to replace the Taliban with a radically different regime − one which would be less willing to see Afghanistan as the backyard of its southern neighbor. Consequently, the war was likely to endanger China’s security by weakening its most important ally – Pakistan – and by changing the relative balance of power in South Asia in favor of China’s enemy – India.</p>
<p>Despite all this, China chose not to soft-balance against the US. Instead, it decided to provide meaningful assistance in the war on terrorism. To start with, the PRC voted in favor of UN Security Council Resolution 1368, which called for the combating of those threats to international peace and security that were caused by terrorism, as well as in favor of Resolution 1373, which dealt with placing barriers to the fund raising activities of terrorist groups. Beijing’s support of these resolutions represents strong bandwagoning. This is especially the case with Resolution 1368, which happens to be the only resolution thus far in which the PRC indirectly authorized the use of force in international relations.</p>
<p>In addition to supporting the United States in the UN, Beijing commenced a counterterrorism dialogue with Washington, shared valuable intelligence, took steps to crack down on terrorist financing, and even allowed the FBI to open a liaison office in its Beijing embassy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0047117811420893">32</xref></sup> Later on, China contributed 150 million dollars in bilateral assistance to Afghanistan’s reconstruction, sent aid and medical supplies to Kabul, cancelled Afghanistan’s previous debts, and raised $250,000 to fund education in Afghanistan. This aid, while not enormous, is quite substantial by Chinese aid standards and should be understood in terms of both China’s support of the US and its desire to appear to be a compassionate neighbor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0047117811420893">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, the PRC closed its borders to prevent the fleeing Taliban from entering China, worked to improve the anti-terrorist capabilities of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and arrested over 100 foreign-trained terrorists in the region of Xinjiang. Beijing also cooperated with Washington on the Container Security Initiative in order to increase the security of container cargo shipped to the US.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0047117811420893">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally, the PRC proved to be a key player in the war on terrorism by encouraging Pakistan to cooperate with Washington. Since Islamabad was Beijing’s closest ally and an actor critical to America’s success in the Afghanistan war, China’s encouragement and support turned out to be an invaluable contribution. In fact, according to Lampton and Ewing, ‘by all accounts (Chinese, American and Pakistani), Beijing encouraged Musharraf to cooperate with Washington’ and it is this encouragement that was ‘a galvanizing factor in Islamabad’s calculations’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0047117811420893">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thus, despite the fact that the war in Afghanistan clashed with some of the PRC’s economic and security interests, Beijing chose not to oppose the United States. There is nothing in China’s behavior that resembles soft balancing, and while Beijing is not at the center of the war on terrorism, its behavior can only be classified as bandwagoning. This, however, does not mean that China behaved irrationally by not defending its interests. On the contrary, the PRC’s reaction is fully consistent with realist explanations of soft balancing because the war in Afghanistan served some of China’s interests, while at the same time it clashed with other, previously described, priorities.</p>
<p>To begin with, it was in the interest of the People’s Republic to support the US in its war against terrorism, or at the very least not to balance against it, because China perceived terrorism as a threat to its own security. Although China had not been a victim of terrorism to the same extent as the US, it nonetheless saw terrorism as a major problem. Historically, terrorism in China was primarily committed by Muslim separatist militants in the province of Xinjiang, which borders Afghanistan. Consequently, Beijing benefited when the United States defeated the Taliban and prevented its members from crossing over into the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.</p>
<p>Moreover, China sees separatism, fundamentalism, and terrorism as threats to its national security and unity, and given that these three ‘isms’ are often interrelated, Beijing shed no tears over the US decision to fight the Taliban. Besides, since America’s war on terrorism turned out to be a global campaign, China could now use anti-terrorist rhetoric to serve its domestic purposes. In fact, following in Washington’s footsteps, Beijing launched its own domestic ‘war on terrorism’ by reframing its fight with the Uyghur separatists as part the global anti-terrorist campaign. This, as Uyghur sources reported, allowed the Chinese government to resort to ‘arbitrary arrest, torture, detention without public trial, and summary execution’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0047117811420893">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, America’s fight against terrorism promoted China’s economic interests. This is because international terrorism threatens trade and global economic performance in general.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0047117811420893">37</xref></sup> This means that had terrorist activities increased in scope, the PRC’s access to foreign markets could have been limited, which would have then endangered China’s national interest of maintaining its economic growth. Thus, by deciding not to soft-balance against the US, China could reap the benefits of America’s involvement in Afghanistan while avoiding the costs associated with the war.</p>
<p>Beijing’s decision to bandwagon with Washington was also rational in the sense that the costs of opposing the US were prohibitive. Simply put, the Chinese government knew better than to alienate the strongest and most important state in the international system and its number one export market. Given the fact that China’s foreign policies are largely subordinate to its domestic goal of achieving satisfactory levels of economic growth, Beijing’s lack of soft balancing does not come as a surprise, as the costs of opposing the United States would have exceeded the benefits.</p>
<p>In addition to being consistent with the realist explanation of soft balancing, China’s reaction to the war in Afghanistan provides support for the ideational theory offered in this article: namely, that soft balancing depends not only on interest violation, but also on whether the interests were violated in a way perceived to be predatory. In the case of the Afghanistan war, China did not consider American actions to be predatory since they neither defied Beijing’s great power authority nor aimed to contain the PRC. Washington’s decision to fight terrorism in Afghanistan was not seen as defying China’s great power authority in any way. This is because the war in Afghanistan was a multilateral effort in which over 40 countries participated and which was endorsed by the UN Security Council. Although the Security Council did not authorize the use of force, its members agreed that such an authorization was unnecessary as the war constituted an act of self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter. Consequently, the American invasion of Afghanistan did not defy China’s great power authority because it did not challenge the UN-based security system in which the PRC enjoys great power status.</p>
<p>Finally, the US war on terrorism was not perceived by China to be a predatory attempt to contain it. Chinese officials never condemned the US and its actions in Afghanistan, and they tended to emphasize the fact that China was also a victim of terrorism. Moreover, the American invasion of Afghanistan coincided with a time when US−China relations improved dramatically, which indicates that the Chinese did not perceive Washington’s actions as predatory. This improvement is reflected in multiple analyses by both Chinese and American experts, and even in the number and frequency of high-level meetings between Chinese and American officials. In fact, President Bush himself, during his two terms in office, participated in 12 official meetings with the residing Chinese president − a frequency that could be envied by some of Washington’s closest allies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0047117811420893">38</xref></sup> Lastly, Beijing’s reaction and the level of support that Washington received from China provide us with the greatest indication that the Chinese did not perceive the war as predatory. After all, we cannot expect them to be self-destructive. Thus, given that the PRC did not see the war in Afghanistan as directed against their country, and that the war did not defy China’s authority as a great power, we can only assume that America’s campaign in the ‘pivot of Asia’ was seen as non-predatory. Therefore, Beijing’s reaction to Operation Enduring Freedom is consistent with this article’s primary theory that perceptions of predatory intentions are necessary for soft balancing to take place.</p>

<title>The war in Iraq (2003)</title>
<p>The Iraq War has constituted the most unrestrained use of American power in recent decades. This is because the United States attacked the sovereign state of Iraq, and in doing so it acted both without UN authorization and against UN recommendations. Although at the time of the US invasion Iraq did not rank highly on China’s priority list, the war threatened Chinese national interests in at least three ways. First, the war strengthened America’s presence in the Middle East, which in turn made China’s energy supplies more vulnerable to US power. Therefore, one can imagine a situation in which, in the event of a military conflict between the US and the PRC, Washington could cut off China’s energy supplies. This ability to hold Beijing’s oil hostage increased once American troops were sent to the world’s most important ‘choke point’ – the Middle East. Consequently, the war in Iraq threatened one of the most central national interests of the People’s Republic – maintaining its national security.</p>
<p>The second way in which the Iraq War endangered Chinese interests had to do with its expected consequences. For example, the war threatened to further destabilize the already unstable Middle East, which could disrupt China’s oil supplies, creating enormous problems for the Chinese economy. Furthermore, the war entailed a risk of spikes in the price of oil as well as the possible radicalization of Islam. Although at the time it was impossible to predict whether these outcomes would materialize, the list of possible developments that could follow the American invasion of Iraq painted an overwhelmingly gloomy picture of the future. As a result, the war in Iraq was likely to clash with China’s economic and security interests, although it was unclear <italic>ex ante</italic> to what extent and how.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0047117811420893">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally, the war in Iraq threatened China’s national interest of maintaining a steady increase in the PRC’s strength and status. Although the war did not alter the material capabilities of the Middle Kingdom, it did challenge China’s prestige and authority. By acting both unilaterally and against the UN Security Council, Washington challenged the post-WWII security system in which China enjoys great power status. In other words, the American decision to go to war against Iraq undermined the role of the UN in international relations and, in doing so, it limited the benefits that China derived from being a permanent member of the Security Council. One of the most important of these benefits was the ability to constrain the United States itself.</p>
<p>Thus, the Iraq War threatened three of China’s most important national interests: (1) promoting the PRC’s economic growth; (2) upholding its security; and (3) maintaining a steady increase in China’s strength and status. Despite this, Beijing’s reaction was not as decisive and unyielding as that of France, Russia, or Germany. Instead, in the months leading up to the war, Beijing expressed its desires for a peaceful solution and emphasized that no military action could be taken without UN authorization. This rhetoric was not as harsh as that of the Europeans. In fact, the Chinese did not even indicate that they would veto resolutions authorizing the use of force.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Beijing sided with Paris and Moscow when it maintained that Resolution 1441 ‘excludes any automacity in the use of force’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0047117811420893">40</xref></sup> Also, China officially stated that its position was ‘extremely close’ to that of France, which argued that ‘all possible action must be taken to avoid conflict’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0047117811420893">41</xref></sup> Similarly, the PRC supported the memorandum proposed by Germany, France, and Russia, in addition to other joint statements that the three countries issued. On several other occasions, China advocated a peaceful solution and urged the United States ‘to continue working with the United Nations and use “every possible method to avoid war”’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0047117811420893">42</xref></sup> Once the war started, Beijing appealed to the US to stop the use of military force and tried to ‘push the Iraqi question back to the track of political settlement within the UN framework’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0047117811420893">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition to repeatedly speaking in support of a diplomatic solution to the Iraq War, the People’s Republic was very critical of the conduct of the American intervention. Chinese journalists, foreign policy analysts, and scholars, as well as officials in Beijing, expressed their concerns over civilian casualties and the rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation in Iraq. At the same time, Chinese media outlets criticized American ‘cocksureness and arrogance’, while some officials in Beijing, such as former foreign minister Qian Qichen, lamented the fact that the ‘Iraq War has destroyed the hard-won global anti-terror coalition’ and that the US desired to ‘rule over the whole world’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0047117811420893">44</xref></sup> This rhetoric, although strong, was not as blunt as that of the Europeans. Nonetheless, it did constitute an act of opposition that deprived the United States of any legitimacy that it might have possessed.</p>
<p>Finally, the Chinese were very worried about American unilateralism and wanted to protect the authority of the UN Security Council. On many occasions the PRC emphasized the need for multilateral action, while disapproving of US desires to go it alone. What is more, the People’s Republic pushed for multilateralism both in its rhetoric and in its actual foreign policy. For example, China supported the establishment of the ASEAN+3 forum, took the lead in strengthening the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and even normalized its relations with India.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0047117811420893">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>Given all of this, Chinese behavior does constitute soft balancing. The PRC’s reaction represents diplomatic entanglement, which is one of the indicators of soft balancing employed in this article. Specifically, Beijing relied on diplomacy to constrain and frustrate the United States. To use Nye’s terminology, the PRC balanced ‘American soft power by depriving the United States of the legitimacy that might have been bestowed by a second UN resolution’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0047117811420893">46</xref></sup> This behavior imposed substantial costs on the United States without challenging American power in a direct manner, and therefore constitutes soft balancing by definition.</p>
<p>However, at this point it is important to note that Chinese soft balancing was not as strong as the soft balancing of either France or Germany. Although Beijing soft-balanced against the US and the Iraq War, it did so in a way that would not alienate Washington. The PRC engaged in what I call ‘smart balancing’, which is a form of balancing that aims to impose significant costs on the United States while minimizing the direct and opportunity costs that the soft-balancer has to pay. To quote Pomfret, China ‘adopted a traditional strategy of using barbarians, in this case Europeans, to fight the barbarians, in this case Americans’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0047117811420893">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>This behavior is consistent with realist explanations of soft balancing. This is because Beijing, while being concerned about the unrestrained use of American power, considered economic development to be its top priority. Economic development, in turn, was dependent to a large extent on maintaining proper relations with Washington. The PRC was, therefore, torn between defending the interests that the war violated, on the one hand, and maintaining economic growth and rising living standards, on the other. As such, China’s decision to soft-balance somewhat less decisively speaks to its long-term thinking and represents a highly pragmatic foreign policy decision, providing strong backing to the realist account of soft balancing.</p>
<p>Lastly, Beijing’s response to the Iraq War provides support to the ideational theory offered here: namely, that soft balancing takes place when a given country’s national interests are violated in a predatory manner. Although Beijing did not perceive American actions to be purposefully directed against the PRC, it nonetheless considered them to be predatory as they challenged China’s great power authority. That is, the United States, by acting without UN authorization and against the preferences of three permanent members of the UN Security Council, undermined the legitimacy of the United Nations. In fact, China, Russia, and France argued that Washington defied international law by intervening in Iraq, whereas the US and the UK held that their actions were legal. China, as a bearer of great power authority under the UN-based system, has interests in strengthening the role of the United Nations. As such, Beijing considered the Iraq War, which undermined the role of the UN, as a predatory attack on China’s great power authority. This, together with the violation of the PRC’s national interests, led to anti-American soft balancing.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>International relations scholars seem to agree that China is the only country that could challenge America’s hegemony in the twenty-first century. Unsurprisingly, experts devote thousands of pages to the discussion of ‘emerging’ China. Even a recent issue of <italic>Foreign Affairs</italic> was entitled ‘The China Challenge’, which highlights the importance of the PRC and its transformation into a global power.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0047117811420893">48</xref></sup> At the same time, some of the most prominent theories of international relations, especially power transition theory, suggest that the rise of China should be accompanied by an increased probability of conflict between Beijing and Washington.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0047117811420893">49</xref></sup> Although power transitions tend to be rare and can occur peacefully, as Lebow and Valentino point out, China’s size and its latent power makes the study of Sino-American relations timely and pertinent to any discussion of global security.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0047117811420893">50</xref></sup></p>

<p>Of the three cases analyzed here, only two can be explained by the realist arguments that emphasize the materialist pursuit of self-interest. These arguments posit that states act in self-interest and suggest that a state such as China, whose interests were violated by the United States, would defend these interests unless the defense was considered too costly. In two out of the three cases included here, China behaved in a way that furthered its self-interest. That is, Beijing soft-balanced against American actions, which hurt its national interests, only when balancing itself did not carry excessively high costs.</p>
<p>In fact, just as realists would have us believe, costs seem to have played a very important role in China’s calculations of whether or not to resort to soft balancing. More specifically, economic costs appear to be the single most important factor constraining the PRC. This is because the legitimacy of China’s regime depends upon maintaining high economic growth rates and because the PRC’s economic growth depends largely upon good relations with the US – China’s second largest trading partner.</p>
<p>Despite this, realist explanations of China’s behavior towards the United States do not fully account for the cases under consideration. More specifically, the case of the Kosovo intervention and Beijing’s response to it is inconsistent with realist explanations of soft balancing. This is because Chinese soft balancing against the US/NATO intervention in Kosovo was a product of emotions and ideational forces rather than of rational calculation. In fact, China’s reaction appears to be completely irrational as Beijing’s soft balancing produced, and could have only been expected to produce, costs to China and no benefits whatsoever.</p>
<p>On the other hand, China’s behavior is consistent with this article’s primary theory: namely, that soft balancing takes place when interest violations go hand in hand with perceptions of predatory intentions. This ideational explanation is able to account for Chinese behavior in all of the three cases analyzed here. That is, in the events examined, China soft-balanced against the United States only when it perceived Washington’s intentions to be predatory. These perceptions of predatory intentions were formed either when interest violations were seen as intentional or when Washington challenged Beijing’s great power authority.</p>
<p>In fact, perceptions of predatory intent seem to be the most important determinant of Chinese soft balancing. Interest violation in itself, although certainly important, does not fully account for the PRC’s behavior. This is because violating China’s most important national interests – economic growth and national security – did not necessarily induce soft balancing. Conversely, China’s reaction to the intervention in Kosovo shows that Beijing can sometimes act in ways that hurt Chinese national interests, which runs contrary to realist explanations of soft balancing. This means that realist explanations of Chinese behavior are inadequate to fully account for the way the PRC reacts to American foreign policy moves. Instead, hybrid theories, such as the one offered here, which emphasize both material and non-material considerations, are better suited to explain China’s opposition or indifference to the United States.</p>
<p>However, the fact that perceptions of US intentions are the most important determinant of Chinese behavior does not necessarily bode well for future Sino-American relations. This is because being more transparent may not be enough to prevent Chinese−American clashes. This conclusion stems from an examination of several cases, such as the intervention in Kosovo, the Iraq War, or the accidental bombing of the PRC embassy in Belgrade, which show that Chinese experts and officials are quite paranoid and ever-ready to believe in conspiratorial explanations of events. In fact, ‘in Chinese analyses most incidents, mishaps and mistakes between Washington and Beijing tend to take on the characteristics of ominous strategic calculation on the part of the Americans’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0047117811420893">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>This is not to say that the People’s Republic and the United Sates will be each other’s competitors in the new millennium. On the contrary, the cases presented above indicate that China tries at all costs to avoid confrontation with the United States, as it wants to become a global power thorough non-military means. This behavior has its roots in China’s priority of maintaining high levels of economic growth, as well as in a high degree of economic interdependence between Washington and Beijing. Moreover, bilateral relations between the People’s Republic and the United States are not a zero-sum game. Both parties share common interests, which they do not want to endanger. Furthermore, China is not interested in exporting its ideology, as the Soviet Union did, and no cultural conflicts exist between the two countries. All of these characteristics of Sino-American relations are very promising and indicate the possibility of a non-confrontational future between the People’s Republic and the United States.</p>
