<title>Objective:</title>
<p>Indian-Australians represent a distinct immigrant group both demographically and culturally. Yet, despite an expanding body of research on transcultural mental health in Australia, there is a paucity of studies regarding mental health of Indian-Australians. This paper explores the extent of psychological morbidity and related service use in a representative sample of Indian-Australians. It further examines the association of mental health with social participation and networking in this ethnic community.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1039856212458980">
<title>Method:</title>
<p>Measures to assess current levels of psychological distress, functional disability, service use, and social capital were administered in a random sample of 71 Indian-Australian family groups living in Sydney.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1039856212458980">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Amongst participants, 15% reported high to very high levels of psychological distress. Psychological distress was associated with increased days of functional disability and higher levels of functional impairment, and an increased likelihood of a GP consultation. However, 91% of participants with identifiable mental health needs did not seek any mental health consultation. Social capital was not found to be a significant predictor of psychological health or service use in this sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1039856212458980">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Psychological morbidity in the Indian-Australian community is associated with high levels of functional disability, both in number of days and extent of severity, but only a small proportion seeks mental health help.</p>

<body>
<p>Australia is a multicultural society with about 27% of its population born overseas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212458980">1</xref></sup> Recent immigration to Australia has seen an increase in groups born in New Zealand, China, and India.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212458980">1</xref></sup> The Indian population in particular has seen on average a 13.5% per year increase between 2000–2010.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212458980">1</xref></sup> However, there is a dearth of research investigating the mental health of Indian-Australians. This study provides a preliminary report on the psychological morbidity, the mental health service use, and any association with social capital in a sample of Indian-Australians living in Sydney.</p>
<p>Indian-Australians make the fourth largest migrant community in Australia. At the end of June 2009 there were about 308,540 Indian born people living in Australia (1.4% of the total Australian population).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856212458980">2</xref></sup> The median age was 30.2 years,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856212458980">2</xref></sup> with the majority having migrated under the skilled migration program.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856212458980">3</xref></sup> In addition in 2009, there were an estimated 120,913 overseas students from India (19.1% of the total number of international students studying in Australia).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856212458980">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are four major categories of permanent immigrant entry to Australia: refugee and humanitarian, skilled migration, family reunion, and special eligibility. By far the economic (skilled) migrants (Indian-Australians amongst them) make up the largest permanent immigrant group,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856212458980">5</xref></sup> but not much is known about the mental health status of these communities. The Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing (henceforth referred as NSMHWB) in 1997 and 2007 provided a population estimate of mental health and service use, but failed to inform us about specific migrant communities or Australians of non-English speaking backgrounds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856212458980">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856212458980">7</xref></sup> The quandary is that even though migration is widely regarded as an extraordinarily stressful process, it is not related to an increase in psychological morbidity to the same extent across all migrant groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856212458980">8</xref></sup> The self-selective nature of economic migrant communities, like Indian-Australians, suggests that a certain personal resourcefulness and perhaps a degree of physical and psychological robustness are necessary to fulfil the extraordinary challenges of present day immigration requirements. However, whether those challenges also endow people with a higher resilience to psychological stress is yet to be critically examined in the empirical literature. This study partly addresses this perceived knowledge gap with regards to the Indian-Australian community.</p>
<p>This study also explored the construct of social capital, as a general index of social participation and networking within and among groups, for its links to individual and community wellbeing. Social capital is conceived of as a resource available to individuals and communities in terms of norms, networks and associations that facilitate cooperative action.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856212458980">9</xref></sup> Greater levels of community participation, social support and trust in others in the community have been shown to have association with low levels of perceived psychological distress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856212458980">10</xref></sup> and improved mental health outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856212458980">11</xref></sup> while poor social connectedness may contribute towards higher levels of anxiety,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856212458980">12</xref></sup> depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856212458980">13</xref></sup> and mortality from any cause.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856212458980">14</xref></sup> Difficulties in cultural adaptation and social integration in the host society have been identified as significant risk factors for increased psychological stress in immigrant Indian communities in England,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856212458980">15</xref></sup> United States<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856212458980">16</xref></sup> and Canada.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1039856212458980">17</xref></sup> A recent qualitative study amongst the Indian and Bangladeshi communities in metropolitan Melbourne highlighted cultural incongruity and social alienation as significant contributory factors to psychological distress, while socio-cultural integration in the broader community, retention of religio-cultural norms and social support were elicited as the key protective factors against psychological distress in migrants from the Indian subcontinent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1039856212458980">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>The primary objective of the current study was to estimate the prevalence of psychological morbidity in a representative sample of the Indian-Australian community. We also aimed to examine service use, and any association of psychological morbidity or service use with the social capital in this community. We hypothesized that Indian migrants may have a lower level of psychological morbidity than the general community due to the self-selective nature of immigration, and their level of service use will not be consistent with their identified mental health needs.</p>

<sec id="section6-1039856212458980">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>A time location-sampling frame was used to randomly select members of Indian-Australian family groups attending an Indian grocery and spice shop located in Parramatta, a western suburb of Sydney known for its large cohort of Indian immigrants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1039856212458980">19</xref></sup> The population in scope for selection included anyone living in Australia, above 15 years of age and with a birth or ancestral link with India. We included international students but excluded other short-term visa-categories such as those on tourist visit visas.</p>
<p>The time location sampling was undertaken between May and July 2009. This approach takes advantage of the fact that some hidden populations tend to congregate at certain types of locations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1039856212458980">20</xref></sup> Survey time slots were selected by documenting customer patronage by time and using a probability proportional to size sampling frame to select sampling time units. The first author approached all customers entering the shop during the selected one-hour time slots. A total of 111 people meeting the study inclusion criteria entered the Indian grocery and spice shop during the selected sampling periods. Two people refused to take part in the survey on being initially approached. For the remaining respondents, a Kish grid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1039856212458980">21</xref></sup> was used to randomly select an eligible (above 15 years of age) member of the customer’s household to complete the study questionnaire. A survey copy with a reply paid envelope was provided for the selected household member. Eight of the selected respondents did not return the survey and did not provide contact details for follow-up. Fifteen participants did not return the survey after three follow up reminders; 15 participants indicated that they had posted their completed survey, but these were not received. The final sample comprised 71 respondents who returned the completed survey, with a study wide response rate of 64%.</p>

<sec id="section7-1039856212458980">
<title>Survey measures</title>
<p>Measures included the Kessler-10 (K10), which has been established as a valid screening tool to monitor the population prevalence of non-specific psychological distress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1039856212458980">22</xref></sup> in international and Australian surveys.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1039856212458980">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1039856212458980">24</xref></sup> The K10 consists of 10 items assessing psychological distress on a 5-item response scale, ranging from ‘none of the time’ to ‘all of the time’, with a maximum score of 50 and minimum of 10. Participants with low (0–15) or moderate (16–21) scores were deemed not to be suffering psychological distress while those with high (22–29) or very high (&gt;29) scores identified as having clinically significant psychological distress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1039856212458980">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Disability was assessed using the survey items developed for the NSMHWB 1997 and 2007 surveys,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1039856212458980">26</xref></sup> that documented the number of days in the previous 30 days that a respondent was unable to perform their role duties and the number of days that a respondent had to cut down on their normal activities due to health problems. A combined index of disability was calculated by summing the response on the two items and stratifying according to three levels: no days of disability; 1–4 days of disability; and 4+ days of disability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1039856212458980">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Use of the health service was assessed by estimating the number of general practitioner (GP) consultations in the previous 12 months, the number of consultations with a GP for emotional problems, and the number of consultations with other mental health professionals for emotional problems. For this study, psychological service use was defined as at least one consultation with a GP or a mental health professional for emotional problems within the previous 12 months.</p>
<p>To assess social capital, we used a 36-item questionnaire<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1039856212458980">28</xref></sup> developed by Bullen and Onyx,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1039856212458980">29</xref></sup> which was standardized in a study with 1200 adults in five selected Australian communities. The responses in that study identified eight distinct elements associated with social capital – participation in local community (not culture specific), pro-activity in social context (sense of personal and collective efficacy, and willing engagement with the general community), feelings of trust and safety, neighborhood connections (networks of relationship with friends and neighbors), family and friends connections, tolerance of diversity, value of life and work connections. The Cronbach’s alpha for these 36 items was 0.84 and the item-total correlations were in the range of 0.25–0.45. We chose Bullen and Onyx’s model because it offered an opportunity for comparison with general Australian population data.</p>

<sec id="section8-1039856212458980">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Exploratory and summary statistics were obtained for all variables within the dataset. The independent measures <italic>t</italic>-test was used to compare mean scores where appropriate. Pearson’s χ<sup>2</sup> analysis was used to examine association between different variables. A multiple simultaneous logistic regression analysis was used to test the role of possible predictor variables that might be associated with service use.</p>

<title>Sample description</title>
<p>Altogether 111 questionnaires were distributed and 71 participants of Indian-Australian background returned the survey (66.2% males, 33.8% females) from 26 suburbs in and around Sydney (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1039856212458980">Table 1</xref>). The age ranged from 15–66 years (Mean=33.46, SD=10.3). The majority were born in India (90.1%) and Fiji (4%). The duration of Australian residency ranged from 1–34 years (Mean=7.69, SD=7.66). A majority of the participants arrived after finishing graduate level studies (54.9%) or after completing formal education (35.2%). The primary residency categories were full citizenship (43.7%), permanent resident (31%), and temporary student (18.3%). Sixty-nine percent were married and fifty-two percent had one or more children. The most common languages spoken at home were Hindi (38.8%), English (21.1%), and Punjabi (9.90%). The majority were from the Hindu (73.2%) religion, and sixty-seven percent reported at least monthly religious observance. About eighty-six percent were employed and about forty-one percent had professional qualifications. Except for being primarily overseas born,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1039856212458980">30</xref></sup> this sample was broadly comparable to the Indian-ancestry community profile of the 2006 Australian census.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856212458980">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1039856212458980">31</xref></sup></p>

<title>Prevalence of non-specific psychological distress</title>
<p>An estimated 15.4% of respondents scored high to very high psychological distress on K10 scores, with 4.2% in the most severe range (score 30 or above). The average K10 score for the study sample was 15.5 (95% confidence interval (CI)=14.0–17.0), which did not differ significantly from the Australian general population mean of 14.47 (one sample <italic>t</italic> test =1.35, df=70, <italic>P</italic>&gt;0.05), as recorded within NSMHWB 2007. Indian-Australian respondents on permanent visas and student visas scored higher on K10 than the respondents who had Australian citizenship (<italic>f</italic>=4.72, df=1,64, <italic>P</italic>=0.03). We also noted that the respondents who had been in Australia for five or more years reported significantly less psychological distress than the ones who had been in Australia for less than 5 years (<italic>f</italic>=6.25, df=1,66, <italic>P</italic>=0.01). We did not find any gender (<italic>t</italic>=0.14, df=69, <italic>P</italic> &gt;0.05) or age (<italic>f</italic>=0.63, df=2,68, <italic>P</italic>&gt;0.05) difference on K10 in this sample.</p>

<title>Disability</title>
<p>Disability was assessed as the number of days in the previous month when respondents were either totally unable to engage in or had to cut down on their usual activities. The majority of respondents (74%) reported no days of impairment while 19.7% (<italic>n</italic>=14) reported between 1–4 days, and 5.6% reported 5 or more days of impairment. Those reporting 5 or more days of disability had an average K10 score of 24.5 (SD=12.1), which was significantly higher (<italic>P</italic>=0.009) than respondents with 1–4 days (mean 15.6, SD=4.2) or no disability (mean=14.8, SD=5.7).

<sec id="section13-1039856212458980">
<title>Service use</title>
<p>Two-thirds (66%; <italic>n</italic>=47) of respondents visited a GP for health related reasons in the past 12 months, which increased to 72% for respondents recording high–very high levels of psychological distress. A minority (12%; <italic>n</italic>=9) reported five or more primary care consultations but with a 2-fold increase in multiple consultations (defined as five or more) across each of the K10 categories from mild to severe (odds ratio (OR)=2.2, 95% CI=1.1–4.2). Mental health consultations were also rarely reported (9%; <italic>n</italic>=6) either with their GP or another mental health professional in the previous 12 months. There was a strong association between service use and disability, respondents reporting one or more days of functional impairment displaying a 16 times greater odds of a GP consultation (OR=16.2, 95% CI=2.9–88.9).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Approximately one in six Indian-Australians in the current study scored high to very high on the K10 psychological distress scale, a level comparable to the general Australian population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1039856212458980">32</xref></sup> This finding contradicts our initial hypothesis that Indian-Australian migrants may be less likely to experience psychological distress as a correlate of the self-selected nature of the population. However, this study elicited the finding that the presence of heightened psychological distress was associated with increased days out of role amongst Indian-Australians. Although this study did not look into the causal relationship between psychological distress and functional disability, this finding underscores the social and potential economic impact of untreated psychological morbidity in this community.</p>
<p>Seventy-two percent of respondents with high to very high levels of psychological distress accessed the services of a health care professional in the past 12 months. However, only 9% of respondents with psychological distress sought a psychological consultation with a GP or other mental health professional. This, when compared to the Australian NSMHWB 2007,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1039856212458980">33</xref></sup> which reported 35% people in the general population with mental disorder using mental health services, suggests a large unmet mental health need in the Indian-Australian community. The higher rates of GP consultation in response to disability and psychological distress emphasize the reliance on the primary health system in providing initial services to this community. Studies from the UK have reported that South-Asians tend to remain avoidant of mental health services in the host countries due to pre-conceived apprehensions associated with discrimination and stigma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1039856212458980">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1039856212458980">35</xref></sup> Bhugra and Desai have suggested a high prevalence of somatization in the Indian and other Asian migrant communities where it often accounts for common presenting features of depression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1039856212458980">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Indian-Australian community demonstrated similar overall levels of social capital to the general Australian community. However, the differential scores suggested higher levels of self and collective efficacy, alongside a lower emphasis on local participation and neighborhood connections. The absence of any significant association between social capital and psychological distress identified in this study is inconsistent with the literature,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856212458980">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856212458980"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856212458980"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856212458980"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856212458980"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856212458980"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856212458980"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1039856212458980"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1039856212458980">18</xref></sup> and may be due to the lack of enough variability in social capital between respondents to elicit meaningful psychological correlates.</p>
<p>A number of limitations of the current research need to be acknowledged. We considered ‘Indian-Australians’ as a single group without any distinction based on languages, religions, dietary practices, migration histories or socio-demographic background. Although our sample was representative of the community profile from the 2006 Australian census, the small sample size and resricted geographical coverage limit the generalizability of the findings. The recruitment strategy may have excluded sections of the community who do not access the spice shop. This was addressed to some extent by ensuring that interviews were undertaken with a randomly selected member of the customer’s family group and not just the person accessing the spice shop. Self-report measures were chosen due to logistical reasons and to minimize social desirability bias.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1039856212458980">37</xref></sup> Another limitation of this study was the low response rate of 64%, raising doubts about possible non-response bias. At the same time, a review by Lebrow of 63 studies using self-report questionnaires found the average response rate of 40%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1039856212458980">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>In conclusion, we found that Indian-Australians have similar levels of psychological morbidity to the general Australian population. Psychological morbidity is associated with high levels of functional disability in this migrant community. High K10 scores and functional disability were the most significant predictors of use of GP consultation services. However, most people with mental health concerns do not seek psychological help. Instead, a large proportion sought GP consultation for other health-related concerns. While the overall level of social capital in the Indian-Australian community is equivalent to the general Australian population, we did not find any meaningful relationship with their mental health. Further studies to explore the causal beliefs for mental health problems and help-seeking behaviors among Indian-Australians are needed.</p>
