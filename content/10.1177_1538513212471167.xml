<abstract>
<p>In 1966, an interdisciplinary team led by architect and planners replanned a freeway system of Baltimore to meet “the social, economic, and esthetic needs.” But staying true to their mission, they had to side with the affected residents and clash with their client in the court of public opinions, through behind-the-scenes lobbying, and with sober debates about technical details. They fought the road war on behalf of fragmented freeway opposition groups and bought them valuable time to join together. Some architect–planners violated client–consultant obligations and conducted subversive actions such as leaking information, coaching the highway fighters, and ultimately, making them strong enough to form a powerful antiroad coalition.</p>

<body>
<p>Ten years after the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 passed, Baltimore was still working on how to apply for federal funding. Political conflict, limited city resources and expertise, objection from the planning commission, and neighborhood opposition had stalled a 1961 freeway proposal that would cut through the Inner Harbor, and such neighborhoods as Fells Point, Federal Hill, Canton in East Baltimore; and black neighborhoods along Franklin and Mulberry corridor and the middle-class Rosemont community in West Baltimore. As the funding deadline in 1971 was approaching, Baltimore’s civic leaders were gravely concerned that Baltimore might fail to obtain the federal funding. Although in 1966 a freeway revolt like that in San Francisco had yet to emerge in Baltimore, the profreeway civic leaders realized that they needed a more acceptable campaign to convince the public.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1538513212471167">1</xref>
</sup> Archibald Rogers, a nationally influential architect in Baltimore persuaded the city and the state of Maryland to commission Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill (SOM) to restudy the entire freeway system. SOM would lead a joint venture known as the Urban Design Concept Team (UDCT), a collaboration of architects, planners, engineers, economists, and sociologists charged to develop a freeway that would be integrated into the urban fabric with high-quality design, minimum disruption, and maximum social and economic benefits.</p>
<p>The UDCT was hailed as a major innovation in freeway planning, urban redevelopment, and even government reorganization.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1538513212471167">2</xref>
</sup> It inspired the hope that comprehensive planning might be possible nationwide. It was the biggest experiment ever in holistic urban design and ultimately cost $66 million (in 2012 dollars). It left behind volumes of well-prepared planning studies, design reports, and joint-development recommendations for space on top of and along the freeway. The SOM architects and planners in the UDCT did not pay lip service to their mission of designing a less intrusive freeway system. They understood that the neighborhoods with the least resources were hardest hit and sought to provide mitigation measures and even alter the alignment when necessary. They brought leading experts to examine social and environmental impacts, study displacement effects, generate options for public comments, listen to community inputs, and devise mitigation measures. However, the SOM architect–planners were up against a client who wanted to preserve the 1961 proposal. To circumvent it, they shaped public opinion by revealing sensitive findings, released damaging impact-assessment reports, and lobbied hard for alternative alignments. The SOM team tried to repudiate the freeway proposal favored by the engineers when Baltimore did not have an effective antifreeway organization. Its community relations arm heard the voices of opposition and expanded opportunities for community involvement when citizen participation was in its infancy. Some planners privately coached the activists and joined the freeway revolt movement. The UDCT was instrumental to the formation of the Movement Against Destruction (MAD) that became a formidable antiroad organization in the country. Despite its “subversive” planning activities and the role in the Baltimore freeway revolt, the UDCT was largely forgotten as studies on the Baltimore Road War have focused on the grassroots resistance, the rise of the MAD, and the social injustice caused by the construction of the freeway.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1538513212471167">3</xref>
</sup> Since the mid-1970s, no article in highway literature has been devoted entirely to the UDCT. When the UDCT has been mentioned, it has been commonly characterized as feeble, insignificant, or even worse, as the efforts of the freeway engineers to placate the public.</p>
<p>This article traces the creation of the UDCT and how it related to the formation of the legendary MAD. It discusses UDCT's evolution, innovation in freeway planning, and SOM’s architect–planners attempts to confront the highway engineers. It highlights issues relating to conflict of interest and the legitimacy of the client. It narrates the stories of some UDCT community relations staff who privately worked with antiroad activists and eventually joined the movement after they saw that their responsibility should rest with the wider public who would be harmed by the destructive results of the proposed freeway. This study joins a few others in taking a renewed sociological interest in the UDCT.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1538513212471167">4</xref>
</sup> It builds on many well-conducted studies that combed through the MAD archive and its newspaper clippings to look at that information through the lens of the UDCT. More importantly, this study is based on new sources such as additional newspaper articles, the UDCT documents and reports stored at Morgan State University in Baltimore, the Bridwell Files at the National Archives, the Parsons Papers at Cornell University, and the Greater Baltimore Committee (GBC) Collection at the University of Baltimore.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1538513212471167">5</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, this study is grounded in in-depth interviews conducted with a number of persons who were involved with the UDCT and the Baltimore Road War, and who provided additional information and documents not covered in other studies.</p>
<sec id="section1-1538513212471167">
<title>Freeway Planning before the Formation of the UDCT</title>
<p>In 1944, Robert Moses proposed to Baltimore a 400-feet wide sunken highway along the Orleans Street and Franklin-Mulberry corridor, essentially cutting the city into halves.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1538513212471167">6</xref>
</sup> The proposal would have displaced 19,000 people and replaced the entire commercial corridor of Route 40 with linear parks and recreational facilities alongside the highway. Baltimore eventually abandoned this controversial project because during its postwar economic decline, it could not raise enough funding in the bond market. In 1948, Maryland passed a law to transfer the responsibility of the design, planning, and construction of “controlled access” facilities within Biltmore from the state to the city.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1538513212471167">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Since then, several freeway alignments had been proposed but the city lacked the resources to move forward. To prepare for applying for federal highway funding, in 1960, Baltimore’s planning department released a report summarizing all previous proposals and J. E. Greiner, a politically connected engineering firm, was hired to evaluate these proposals and suggest a recommended route.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1538513212471167">8</xref>
</sup> In October 1961, the Greiner team recommended the 10-D system that contained an elevated structure passing through ethnic neighborhoods in Federal Hills and Fells Point, Baltimore’s birthplace (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538513212471167">Figure 1</xref>). A fourteen-lane low-level bridge would cross the Inner Harbor, the same harbor that Fort McHenry defended against the British armada in 1812—the event that inspired Francis Scott Key to write “The Defense of Fort M’Henry,” the poem that became the country’s national anthem.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1538513212471167">9</xref>
</sup> Another leg of the expressway would go westward to join the Jones Fall expressway through a massive interchange near downtown and go through West Baltimore in a wide trough along the Franklin-Mulberry corridor. Then, it would pass through the middle-class black Rosemont neighborhood and the Olmsted-designed Leakin Park. A commentator described the proposed freeway as a “massive, multipronged concrete shaft aimed straight at the city’s heart.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1538513212471167">10</xref>
</sup> The 10-D proposal stirred up neighborhood opposition, particularly in East Baltimore, but an effective and coordinated opposition movement still took years to form. What held this proposal back was that some city agencies did not support it. On one side was Baltimore’s Department of Public Works (DPW) who championed for the 10-D system. The staff of DPW, related engineering firms and contractors had formed a solid voting bloc. Being the director of the city’s most influential department, Bernard Werner, was a strong individual who would not answer to mayors easily. On the other side were the City’s planners, housing and redevelopment officials, and other departments who found the 10-D, causing massive relocation, the loss of the harbor, and the disruption on scheduled renewal projects.<sup>

</fig>
<p>In early 1964, Mayor McKeldin invited GBC, an assembly of prominent business leaders, to study how to realign the functions between DPW and the planning commission.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1538513212471167">12</xref>
</sup> While the reform failed, McKeldin appointed thirty-nine-year-old David Barton to chair the planning commission. Barton did not object the freeway in principle, but what separated him from the engineers was that he considered that the freeway should be carefully planned as part of an integrated transportation system to minimize the intrusion into neighborhoods. For many years to come, Barton was a strong voice inside the government for sensible planning. His view was shared by GBC staff, who was concerned of the damage of the 10-D proposal their redevelopment projects in the Inner Harbor (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538513212471167">Figure 2</xref>).<sup>

</fig>
<p>Realizing that Baltimore city alone could not carry on the freeway project, McKeldin struck an agreement with Maryland State Roads Commission (SRC) in early 1966 to create a joint city–state freeway planning agency called Interstate Division for Baltimore City (IDBC). He formed the Policy Advisory Board (PAB), a steering panel chaired by him to supervise the IDBC. Under this new arrangement, IDBC divided the 10-D system into four pieces, each to be designed by a different firm. The Baltimore chapter of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) objected to this uncoordinated planning effort and invited civic leaders and officials from three levels of government to a luncheon meeting to discuss their concerns. Under the pressure of the professional circles, GBC, other civic groups, and the redevelopment agency, the IDBC appointed an advisory committee to review the four submissions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1538513212471167">14</xref>
</sup> It was the chair of this committee, the forty-nine-year-old Archibald Rogers, who raised the idea of planning the whole freeway system anew.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1538513212471167">
<title>The Brainchild of Archibald Rogers</title>
<p>Rogers founded an architecture firm in Annapolis in 1946 that later became the internationally famed RTKL that designed the Harundale Mall, the first enclosed mall in the East Coast. He had a successful career as an architect, urban designer, researcher, and advocate.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1538513212471167">15</xref>
</sup> In the early 1960s, he pioneered a four-step design process in Cincinnati that attracted a young editor from <italic>Architectural Record</italic> to write a special report.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1538513212471167">16</xref>
</sup> Rogers was a key player of the Charles Center project headed by GBC and had collaborated with James Rouse, the builder of planned communities like Columbia, Maryland. Rogers served as the first GBC executive director and assisted McKeldin to strengthen Baltimore’s planning functions. After leaving GBC, he worked closely with his successor, William Boucher. In 1966, Rogers was heading AIA’s Urban Design Subcommittee in pursuing a national urban design policy. He had advanced his four-step process for Cincinnati into a design process that involved “many levels of decision making that determine the course of urbanization.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1538513212471167">17</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>For Rogers, 10-D violated the very principles of good design that he had advocated. He viewed the freeway as one component of an integrated transportation system. He saw the potential of redevelopment projects using the freeway’s air rights and adjoining land parcels. Rogers spelled out several goals, including that design should be respectful of the proximate neighborhoods, the freeway structure should receive appropriate screening, and planners should aspire to make the freeway as beautiful as the city’s public monuments.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1538513212471167">18</xref>
</sup> To achieve these goals, Rogers rejected all four submissions on the grounds of poor aesthetics. He proposed to SRC a multidisciplinary team called the UDCT to restudy the entire freeway system. Baltimore’s civic leaders supported the idea as they knew that a more acceptable plan was important to quell opposition. Roger’s idea also received wide support from local and national professional communities of architects and planners. However, Rogers’ proposal would not go ahead without substantial funding from the federal government and the year 1966 provided a narrow window of opportunity for the UDCT.</p></sec>
<sec id="section3-1538513212471167">
<title>Federal Support of Comprehensive Planning</title>
<p>A number of cumulating events had prepared the federal freeway engineers to support the UDCT.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1538513212471167">19</xref>
</sup> As the destructive effects of urban freeway caused more protests, engineers attending the 1957 <italic>Hartford Conference on New Highways</italic> on national highway had raised the issues of mitigating the destructions to cities.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1538513212471167">20</xref>
</sup> Meanwhile, President Eisenhower’s coordinator of public works planning, John Bragdon, was pushing for comprehensive transportation planning and finally got the approval to set up a committee to review the Congress’s intention on urban routing.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1538513212471167">21</xref>
</sup> Although the attempt to move interstate freeway from cities failed, Bragdon’s idea of integrated transportation planning was incorporated in the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1962. The <italic>Hershey Conference on Urban Freeways</italic> in the same year concluded that the planning of urban freeway should be performed through team effort and “extend to the entire sector of the city within the environs of the freeway.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1538513212471167">22</xref>
</sup> Such understanding was again recognized in the <italic>White House Conference on Natural Beauty</italic> and the <italic>Williamsburg Conference on Highways and Urban Development</italic> in 1965. To achieve these goals, the Federal Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) established an eight-person expert committee, which included Lawrence Halprin, a well-respected landscape architect and the author of <italic>Freeways</italic>, to examine aesthetics and human values in freeway planning.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1538513212471167">23</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Johnson administration was facing urban riots, the civil rights movement, and protests against urban renewal and freeway construction. It initiated programs such as the Model City to implement the Great Society agenda to resolve these issues. Two new departments would be created in 1967 to better coordinate urban housing and transportation programs: the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Department of Transportation (USDOT). The soon-to-be Federal Highway Administrator, Lowell Bridwell, was reorienting BPR in transition from the Department of Commerce to the USDOT.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1538513212471167">24</xref>
</sup> As the first nonengineer BPR chief, Bridwell had a broader vision and was ready to carry forward the suggestions by Bragdon and the expert committee. For him, the UDCT proposal in Baltimore was an ideal pilot project to demonstrate how the three requirements in the 1962 Highway Act—cooperative, comprehensive, and continuing—could be achieved. Thus, BPR agreed to provide 90 percent of the UDCT cost. On October 26, 1966, the SRC announced the formation of the UDCT led by SOM with a transit consultant (Parsons, Brinckerhaff, Quade and Douglas) and a traffic engineering firm (Wilbur Smith &amp; Associates). During contract negotiation, a pilot task was commissioned for SOM to study the southwest leg of the Baltimore freeway system.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1538513212471167">
<title>The “Unwarranted” Optimism of Nathaniel Owings</title>
<p>Rogers considered SOM’s founding partner, Nathaniel Owings the most suitable person to deliver a new freeway that Baltimore deserved and secured SOM’s leading role in the UDCT. SOM was founded thirty years before and had grown to be an architectural powerhouse. It had designed successful corporate towers like the Chase Manhattan Bank in New York and the John Hancock Center in Chicago; and it had handled such large projects as the master plan for the US Air Force Academy in Colorado and the Lake Meadows development on Chicago’s South Side.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1538513212471167">25</xref>
</sup> More importantly, Owings had chaired the President’s Advisory Council on Pennsylvania Avenue since 1962 to prepare for the Washington Mall Master Plan.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1538513212471167">26</xref>
</sup> Owings’s political ties include Adlai Stevenson, the former Illinois governor and two-time Democratic presidential nominee, who was Owing’s daughter’s father-in-law. Owings also had access to the first lady, Lady Bird Johnson and other Washington political heavyweights.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1538513212471167">27</xref>
</sup> Rogers needed a reliable hand to exercise his decision-oriented design process to plan a freeway in his hometown. He pronounced later that Owings could not resist the “remarkable chance to develop new highway concepts for a major city in way that had never been tried before,” and said, “I called him up and he went for it like a salmon goes for a fly.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1538513212471167">28</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>For Owings, the UDCT would give him an opportunity to build a collaborative team to explore design and development potentials of a freeway corridor. This multidisciplinary study would allow him to experiment with design processes and planning technologies that might bear fruit elsewhere.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1538513212471167">29</xref>
</sup> Still, Owings realized that “the optimism could turn out to be unwarranted” because freeway had ruined many urban neighborhoods in its “inexorable march through whatever stood in the way.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1538513212471167">30</xref>
</sup> The Interstate program had yet to produce a humane, functional, and aesthetically freeway in a contested urban environment. If he succeeded, Owings would be remembered as a great planner. Believing that “everyone knew that the real client was the multifaceted body politic of the numerous neighborhoods and communities lying within the city limits,” Owings set out to convince the Baltimoreans that the social benefits of this new freeway would outweigh the costs because he would carefully make this freeway “an instrument of basic corrective surgery and do good to the community pattern.” With such conviction, Owings came to Baltimore “to lace tubes of traffic through vital parts without unduly disturbing the living organism of the city” and to “produce a unity of knowledge and wisdom much greater than the mere sum of these separate parts.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1538513212471167">31</xref>
</sup> </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1538513212471167">
<title>The Engineers’ Pushing Back</title>
<p>Ahead of Owings in Baltimore lay more than the welcome of Rogers, the planners, the architects, the civic leaders, and the doubtful public; but also the vehement opposition from a group of close-knit engineers who shared a common professional bond.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1538513212471167">32</xref>
</sup> Rogers’s recommendation to exclude local engineering firms had laid the seeds of troubles. Greiner’s ally and client, Baltimore’s DPW director Werner detested the idea of an outside architectural firm amending the 10-D system. The UDCT replanning of the whole system would cause delays and cost overruns and disturb tacit contract arrangements. As one of the three members on PAB that oversaw the IDBC, Werner was in a strong position to stop the UDCT project from happening. He orchestrated the coming back of Greiner with the change in the SRC leadership. Two weeks after the UDCT announcement in late October 1966, Maryland voters elected Spiro Agnew as its new governor. The UDCT contract negotiations stopped, pending new SRC appointments. Rogers was concerned because Agnew had close ties with engineers, so he mobilized GBC and his Republican contacts to appeal to the governor-elect on behalf of the UDCT.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1538513212471167">33</xref>
</sup> Agnew ignored them and appointed his confidant, Jerome Wolff to head SRC. Wolff had collected bribes from engineering firms and contractors for Agnew in Hartford County.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1538513212471167">34</xref>
</sup> Once Wolff’s appointment was announced, Werner openly questioned SOM’s qualifications and criticized its findings on the southwest leg of the expressway.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1538513212471167">35</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The contract negotiation stalled as Wolff indicated that he was not bound by the letter of intent signed between his predecessor and SOM. Werner and Wolff knew that if he could delay the contract after the city passed condemnation ordinance based on the 10-D alignment, SOM would have little means to modify the freeway system. In March, Werner prepared a draft contract for Wolff that would give Greiner equal if not greater authority than SOM. The draft was leaked to the public and the Baltimore chapter of AIA protested.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1538513212471167">36</xref>
</sup> Owings wrote to the Alan Boyd, the first secretary of the newly formed USDOT, for clarification and suggested to Bridwell for a meeting.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1538513212471167">37</xref>
</sup> On April 19, 1967, Owings spoke to 200 persons in a design seminar organized by the Committee for Downtown and promised that Baltimore’s “priceless tapestry” should not be destroyed by “conventional engineering,” and he guaranteed that the UDCT would not perform “window dressing” work. Wolff and Werner responded strongly on the same day and told the press that Owings had to “accept our dicta … or we don’t think he can properly be a part of the expressway program.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1538513212471167">38</xref>
</sup> Next day, Wolff announced, “We are [Owings’s] clients. If he won’t accept that fact, he won’t be our architect.” He remarked, “Mr. Owings is not the one to go to the national level. We are.” He added, “I don’t care if he knows Lady Bird, or the President himself.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1538513212471167">39</xref>
</sup> Even though Owings had the support from Rogers, David Barton, GBC, AIA and the energized public; yet, the coalition among engineers in SRC, IDBC, and DPW was too strong to break. A meeting in Washington at BPR office on April 27 did not resolve the stalemate. Owings never obtained an intervention to his favor from Bridwell or Boyd.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1538513212471167">40</xref>
</sup> On May 25, Owings agreed to a memorandum of understanding based on Werner’s draft because three days before he lost his last leverage when the city council, in a vote of twenty to one, approved a condemnation legislation that would take property along the 10-D corridor.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1538513212471167">41</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In this joint venture with Greiner, SOM would be responsible for neighborhood analysis and urban design. With Greiner it would jointly conduct basic planning and design, and Greiner would take over engineering and detailed drawing. Werner and Wolff won a preemptive battle to prevent SOM from correcting the 10-D system. The contract would confine SOM’s responsibilities to beautification, design guidelines, landscaping, and economic and community projects within the parameter of 10-D. The UDCT would perform six tasks, earmarked as study points: Points I and II focused on reconnaissance and data collection. The results would be subject to public review and then incorporated into a Point III report on problems, opportunities, and initial concept. These would follow by Point IV of alignment design and joint-development feasibility studies. After the proposals were adopted and incorporated into the City’s master plan, a Point V report on joint development and roadway design would be prepared. The last phase, Point VI, would involve preliminary engineering drawings for contracting and construction. The contract would expire in twenty-four months and be subject to extension.<sup>

<title>SOM in Action</title>
<p>Owings named John Weese as the project manager to finalize the contract negotiations, so that he would focus on strategic responsibilities. Weese and his associate, the MIT-educated Norman Klein, SOM’s director of urban design, started working in the DC office.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-1538513212471167">44</xref>
</sup> In 1967, Klein started forming a technical team of aspiring graduates from prominent architecture and planning schools attracted to the UDCT’s reputation as an innovative experiment of comprehensive urban planning. Klein fostered an intellectual culture in the office and encouraged younger professionals to think outside the box. However, the soul of the technical team was the twenty-nine year old Howard McKee.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-1538513212471167">45</xref>
</sup> After obtaining three degrees, including economics, architecture, and urban design all at Columbia University, McKee joined SOM and was recognized for his ability to connect a project site with its surrounding environment. </p>
<p>As an outsider, SOM needed someone in the team who had knowledge of Baltimore, so they hired Stewart Bryant who had been in Baltimore researching the housing advocacy agency, Citizen Planning and Housing Association (CPHA) for an undergraduate project at Berkeley. Bryant had other local contacts. His planning classmate at Harvard, Larry Reich, was now Baltimore’s planning director. Another Bryant’s former colleague, Robert Young, was the executive director of the Baltimore Regional Planning Council. Bryant was also especially appropriate to establish community relations for the UDCT with a credential of the nation’s first highway community planner. Bryant was a self-proclaimed radical and a follower of Paul Davidoff’s advocacy planning ideas. When he worked in the state highway agency in Illinois, he also served as the acting president of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in Springfield. He stood up on behalf of an African American teenager in a police brutality case and thereafter suffered from a smear campaign that cost his job. He later returned to California and took various planning positions including one at Berkeley where he participated in the Free Speech Movement. Holding the ideal of citizen participation, Bryant was eager to give a voice to those who were seldom heard in Baltimore.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-1538513212471167">46</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In December 1966, the forty-one-year-old Bryant toured Baltimore to establish community contacts. He consulted with Rogers and Rouse. Bryant reconnected with Reich and Young; visited CPHA, Baltimore Neighborhoods, and the Catholic archdiocese.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-1538513212471167">47</xref>
</sup> In June 1967, Bryant moved to Baltimore and set up a one-person office in the city’s planning department; and for several months, he was the sole SOM resident representative in Baltimore. He visited neighborhood organizations to solicit their input, conducted research of the corridor communities, built relationship with resident leaders and the media, and attended intergovernmental coordinating meetings on the freeway. In late 1967, Bryant expanded his community relations team and established the UDCT office at 1001 Cathedral Street in Baltimore. <sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-1538513212471167">48</xref>
</sup> Afterward, McKee’s much bigger technical team moved in from Washington DC. His gentle spirit and humor endeared him to the fresh graduates he recruited. Being not much older himself, he and his wife became part of the active social circle of these young professionals. He divided his staff into small groups, each taking care of a piece of the fourteen corridor segments and working on survey of conditions, land-use analysis, impact assessment, opportunity and issue identification, and design-parameter development. The technical team was structured like a graduate design studio, but the project was bigger, wider in scope, and longer in duration.<sup>

<title>Competing in the Court of Public Opinion</title>
<p>Owings knew that he needed more than technical reasoning to modify the 10-D proposal. Since he could not openly defy his client to risk the consequences of a breach of contract, he needed outside support. He believed that “given the facts, the people will make the right decision.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-1538513212471167">50</xref>
</sup> One strategy he took was behind-the-door lobbying with Baltimore’s civic leaders. Another strategy was to galvanize the public to envision a freeway that would provide the city with beauty and pride. Owings would fly to Baltimore to meet supporters and give speeches before major PAB decisions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-1538513212471167">51</xref>
</sup> Owings’s third strategy was to reveal the flaws in the 10-D system by feeding sober analysis to the public. After his staff had identified critical issues in the corridor neighborhoods, they retained nationally known experts such as Charles Abrams to study relocation compensation, the Real Estate Corporation to conduct economic and fiscal analyses, and George Grier to examine social impacts.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-1538513212471167">52</xref>
</sup> By early 1968, SOM had generated a number of draft reports covering housing, community facilities, industrial and port facilities, recreation and open-space needs, downtown redevelopment, fiscal and tax revenue analysis. In future years, these reports became a rich reservoir of knowledge for the antiroad groups to put to full use.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-1538513212471167">53</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Three cases illustrate how these reports were used in key decisions. The first case involved the Rosemont neighborhood. With data showing Rosemont a solid middle-class community of high homeownership, SOM convinced PAB that a freeway might cause net fiscal loss to the city and obtained a one-time authorization to study alternative bypasses.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-1538513212471167">54</xref>
</sup> These findings were passed to the West Baltimore neighborhood organizations that Bryant and his staff had closely worked with. In the following months, these organizations used these studies to oppose the freeway.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-1538513212471167">55</xref>
</sup> The second case concerned a report on condemnation compensation. Abrams published the report in May 1968 and documented that expressway construction disproportionately affected black neighborhoods.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-1538513212471167">56</xref>
</sup> He showed that the federal government consistently paid less to residents displaced in highway programs than in renewal programs, and that Maryland law unfairly used the lower market value to determine compensation. This report was used to show civil rights violations and eventually pressure Maryland to pass a legislation to allow condemnation compensation be assessed by replacement value. In the third case, SOM used a traffic study prepared by Wilbur Smith to show the detrimental effects of putting a massive freeway structure near downtown.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-1538513212471167">57</xref>
</sup> The study projected that 47 percent of the interstate traffic would pass through Baltimore and merely one-sixth would choose the downtown area as its destination. Armed with these difficult-to-dispute data, SOM proposed a southern bypass to relieve the traffic pressure in the downtown. With the support from the planning commission, PAB granted a second exception to UDCT to study the southern bypass feasibility.</p>

<title>Stopping the 10-D System</title>
<p>The election of the liberal-leaning Thomas D’Alesandro III as Baltimore’s mayor in late 1967 brought new hope to the SOM architect–planners. Recognizing the growing political power of African Americans, D’Alesandro had campaigned as the mayor of all races and promised to address pressing issues in the black communities. Once in office, he allowed the UDCT to study the Rosemont bypass. The six-day riot in April 1968 in response to the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. forever changed Baltimore’s political landscape. The controversy around Rosemont had galvanized the black communities and the UDCT community relations staff had informed affected residents the study findings. They were waiting for how the government would make the decision on the alternative bypass.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-1538513212471167">58</xref>
</sup> Exactly one week after the riot, PAB rejected all these alternatives. The engineers argued that the tunneling cost through the Western Cemetery was prohibitive. Other alternatives realigning the freeway at grade through the corner of the cemetery were rejected on the grounds that the city had no authority of taking cemetery land.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-1538513212471167">59</xref>
</sup> For the Rosemont residents, this decision suggested that even dead white bodies were more important than living blacks. The uproar about racism caused various West Baltimore neighborhood associations to form an antiroad coalition, the antecedent of MAD.</p>
<p>In August 1968, sensing the public behind them and based on the Rosemont and southern bypass studies, the SOM architect–planners put forward the 3-A system that incorporated a longstanding planning commission's proposal for a boulevard system in the downtown. 3-A would move the freeway out of Rosemont, replace the bridge in the Inner Harbor with a crossing near Fort McHenry, and reduce the number of lanes in the Fells Point segment of the elevated freeway. Around the same time, Joseph Axelrod, Werner’s confidant became the chief of IDBC. As the guardian of the 10-D system, the trio of Wolff, Werner, and Axelrod rejected 3-A.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-1538513212471167">60</xref>
</sup> Greiner counter-proposed a 3-C system that essentially added a southern bypass to the 10-D system.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-1538513212471167">61</xref>
</sup> In the following months, Owings was under tremendous pressure fall in line with Greiner. After Owings’s public objection of the 10-D in the CPHA event in September, Axelrod shut down the UDCT community relations program and withheld a $700,000 payment. In a turbulent closed-door PAB meeting on October 18, the 3-C alternative prevailed. A week later, at the USDOT office in Washington DC, the mayor announced that the 3-C plan was endorsed. Planning commission chair David Barton protested that proper consultation was not conducted with other government agencies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-1538513212471167">62</xref>
</sup> This stirred public outcries because the decision was against a broad consensus of getting rid of the Inner Harbor bridge. This backlash created tremendous pressure on mayor D’Alesandro, especially after the influential city council president William Schaefer indicated his preference for the 3-A scheme.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-1538513212471167">63</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>It was believed that Owings had launched a behind-the-scenes campaign for 3-A with the mayor and civic leaders.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-1538513212471167">64</xref>
</sup> On December 23, D’Alesandro reversed his position and adopted the 3-A scheme. Werner resigned in protest, and resurfaced in a patronage job for Wolff.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-1538513212471167">65</xref>
</sup> There were many reasons that D’Alesandro acted against powerful counsel. One was that he wanted to keep his promise with the African American communities who had been politically mobilized. Being the only PAB member who lived inside the city, he might have shared the perspective of other citizens who saw that similar disruption would come from the freeway. In addition, a public consensus had arrived that the Inner Harbor and Rosemont should be spared from freeway destruction under the newly formed MAD. Based on a 1968 estimation, this decision would add $216 million to the original scheme (equivalent to $1.4 billion in 2012 dollars). The proposed Fort McHenry crossing in the 3-A system was objected by the National Park Service and Locust Point residents, who soon formed the Southeastern Council Against the Road (SCAR).<sup>

<title>Professionals Siding with the “Enemies”</title>
<p>In 1969, Axelrod complained about the SOM architect–planners colluding with the antiroad activists, “You just don’t give information to the enemy.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-1538513212471167">67</xref>
</sup> This allegation underscored the intertwined relationship between the UDCT community relations team and the Baltimore’s antiroad organizations.</p>
<p>By early 1968, the team established by Bryant consisted of four core staff members: residents and activists June Ross, Thomas Fiorello, Charles Curtis Jr.; and a planning professional Steve Zecher. <sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-1538513212471167">68</xref>
</sup> They had established ties of over fifty organizations to solicit residents’ concerns through a series Progress Review Committee. Privately, they had been providing these organizations with study findings and technical advice. At this point, the Relocation Action Movement (RAM), Baltimore’s first organization established in late 1966 in response to the 10-D was pushing for a limited agenda of obtaining fair compensation for black homeowners. Baltimore’s first real antiroad group, the Society for the Preservation of Federal Hill, Montgomery Street and Fells Point (Preservation Society), formed in February 1967 was focusing of getting rid of the bridge at Inner Harbor and the elevated structure along Fells Point.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-1538513212471167">69</xref>
</sup> After PAB’s rejection of the Rosemont bypass in April 1968, RAM and eleven West Baltimore neighborhood groups formed the Expressway Coalition of Neighborhood Improvement Associations.

<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-1538513212471167">70</xref>

However, four days after its opening in September 1968, Axelrod closed Progress Review Committee meetings and told the press that some UDCT members “forgot their professional assignments … and got emotionally involved with the people,” and that they were “not here for an organized opposition.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-1538513212471167">73</xref>

</p>
<p>In October 1968, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) proposed new regulations that required a corridor and a design hearing on freeway approval. Werner objected vehemently, alleging that “adequate opportunity already is available for full public participation in decisions affecting highway projects, and in our opinion the adoption of these regulations will impose an unnecessary and excessive burden on our operations.” Related consultation documents were passed to MAD and Fiorello announced them in a letter to the <italic>Baltimore Sun</italic>.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-1538513212471167">76</xref>

<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-1538513212471167">77</xref>
</sup> To prevent further information leak, Axelrod ordered that all announcements, statements, and reports had to be authorized by him before given to the public.

In December 1968, UDCT community relations team published a newsletter that promised to provide the “public all relevant information about Baltimore’s proposed East-West Expressway.” It listed the contact information for government officials and urged readers to write to them.

<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-1538513212471167">83</xref>

<p>For several months before the hearing, the UDCT field office had become a “training ground” for activists where they planned their protest actions and strategies for the Rosemont hearing scheduled on August 6, 7, and 11, 1969. Fiorello stated that they had been secretly coached by the SOM staff, saying, “We’ve been prompted by the best in the business” and “these young engineers come around at night … and then we go to their bosses the next day.”<sup>

<p>The UDCT community relations staff might indeed cross the established ethical boundaries governing client–consultant relationships. Eventually, they all left in frustration as they saw how the condemnation corridor caused a downward spiral of blight and disinvestment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-1538513212471167">89</xref>
</sup> They had taken to heart the worries and complaints from the affected residents. They believed their mandate was to “provide for the social, economic, and esthetic needs of the city’s environment.” However, their client was not interested in these words; rather it wanted to prevent such goals from being pursued. They questioned what benefits the joint development projects could bring when the freeway was so destructive. This ethical dilemma can be illustrated by the resignation of Steve Zecher, the acting field office director after Bryant was forced to go. At the Rosemont hearing, Zecher alleged that IDBC had violated PPM 20-8 by failing to provide genuine consultations. He then argued that Baltimore needed a comprehensive transit system rather than a freeway, and said the joint development projects were hoaxes designed to buy freeway support.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-1538513212471167">90</xref>
</sup> On August 25, he made a public resignation and explained to a reporter that he was forbidden to give an “honest, objective view of Baltimore’s overall transportation needs” in front of the public. He was asked to sell the idea of joint development, which he found trivial. While he respected certain individuals inside the UDCT, he believed that despite its initial good intentions, the UDCT had “prostituted” itself to serve the interests of the highway lobby.

<p>At the Rosemont hearing, armed with the professional help from former UDCT members, MAD launched a spectacular frontal attack against all proposed Rosemont alternatives. They were no longer content with saving Rosemont but asked for the termination of the whole freeway system. A MAD representative made a passionate speech supported by a fourteen-page paper including twenty-six exhibits. He questioned whether Baltimore really needed a freeway, and if so, at what human cost. Apart from attacking the social impact of the freeway, he found the process lacking in transparency.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-1538513212471167">92</xref>

<title>The Uneventful Years</title>
<p>After the Rosemont hearing, the national limelight of UDCT faded as an architectural commentator openly questioned its utility.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-1538513212471167">93</xref>
</sup> Its community relations team had closed, but the technical team would wrap up its Point III reports moving to the Point IV and V assignments on design parameters, preliminary drawings, and development project proposals. Once a supporter, GBC had lost confidence in the UDCT and suggested bringing in outside management to supervise SOM and Greiner.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-1538513212471167">94</xref>
</sup> The year 1970 was relatively uneventful, as the engineers had successfully tightened their grip on the architect–planners, forbade them to study environmental impacts, and confined them to working on the details on the adopted 3-A corridor. They were happy to place the UDCT as a buffer for mounting public opposition and let it sell the development projects. As Howard McKee’s technical team shifted to working on joint development proposals and addressing their economic development issues, he pushed his teams to prepare for joint and collateral development projects to show that it was impossible not causing harm even with the best professional work. For example, the Fells Point reports included well-conducted neighborhood analyses, a detailed historic buildings survey, a comprehensive market and fiscal study, a variety of feasibility studies on relocation scenarios, and structurally complex joint development projects; but it subtly demonstrates the extreme costs and the absurdity of these proposals beneath their mile-long elevated structure.<sup>

</p>
<p>On January 18, 1971, Owings addressed the Baltimoreans one last time at a turnover ceremony, saying that the UDCT work as a “proposal for a whole new set of communities.” In handing over the thirteen major reports, he remarked, “We have stood together in presenting a common purpose and concern in our conclusions” and, “To a city and a state famous for ingenuity in clipper ships … I entrusted the concept team’s unfinished symphony.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn96-1538513212471167">96</xref>
</sup> A witness to the event, James Dilts, observed an air of anticlimax, as everyone just wanted to move on. Four years before, Owings had come to Baltimore as a white knight, but he left under a different public mood. The freeway was further behind schedule and burdened with cost overruns. The bureaucratic divisions that the UDCT was supposed to reduce remained intransigent. The interdisciplinary collaboration was partially successful because the highway engineers pursued a different agenda. Owings had won some battles and even critical ones but lost the war to his client. The people Owings pledged to serve with the best freeway proposal possible had been ungrateful. Despite these setbacks, Dilts gave some credits to the UDCT, such as fairer compensation for displaced homeowners, the preservation of the Inner Harbor, a less intrusive freeway along Fells Point, and a better-designed and more environmentally sensitive freeway facility.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn97-1538513212471167">97</xref>
</sup> Archibald Rogers, the grandfather of the UDCT, provided a more upbeat assessment that the UDCT had encouraged similar experimentation in other cities and reshaped the decision-making process in the USDOT. He blamed the negative UDCT image on the uncooperative engineers and the controversy over whether or not Baltimore needed a freeway. Rogers insisted “the final judgment of success or failure lies on the future.”<sup>

<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn99-1538513212471167">99</xref>
</sup> It is goal of designing a new type of freeway with true community involvement was not given a fair chance to start. The engineer client limited the SOM team to operate within a fixed corridor but the architect–planners pushed back by swaying public opinion through behind-the-scenes lobbying, sober technical debate, and subversive actions. They broke the rules of traditional client-consultant obligations. Fairly speaking, the colossal UDCT interdisciplinary efforts along with community input generated a large number of high-quality products. The freeway system that the UDCT designed was probably the most elaborate one that had ever been prepared. However, the freeway system it recommended was extremely costly. The engineers and the architect–planners had always contested of the issue of cost control—the pragmatists versus the idealists. The UDCT itself was a $66 million experiment (in 2012 dollars) and the 3-A system would cost $700 million ($4.5 billion in 2012 dollars) based on a 1970 GBC report. A 1977 estimate by Dilts put it at almost 2 billion dollars ($7.7 billion in 2012 dollars).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn100-1538513212471167">100</xref>
</sup> These estimates do not include the costs of the seventy-seven joint and collateral development projects of schools, community centers, recreational and shopping facilities—critical components to offset the freeway’s social costs. As elegantly designed as they were, no one knew who was going to pay for them and almost none of them were developed.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn101-1538513212471167">101</xref>
</sup> Eventually, the freeway segment along Fells Point, the interchange joining I-95 and I-83 near downtown, and the Leakin Park segment connecting the Franklin-Mulberry corridor to I-70 were not built. Apart from the MAD opposition, one often-ignored deciding factor was that Baltimore could not afford even its portion during the postoil crisis recession.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The SOM architect–planners played a much more active role in the Baltimore Road War than history has tended to credit them. They were initially brought in to design a new type of freeway—aesthetically and functionally integrated with the city, through an expanded participatory process—that did not interest their client, the IDBC and its engineers. They competed in the court of public opinion, debated the plan’s merits in closed-door meetings, challenged the engineers’ grip on public access to information, and committed subversive actions against their client. In the end, they lost the road war, because their client overpowered them with gag orders, restrictions, and contract-violation actions. However, the SOM architect–planners had achieved some unlikely victories: they spared Rosemont, introduced a boulevard system, eliminated an enormous interchange and the bridge in the Inner Harbor, and reduced the number of freeway lanes along Fells Point. They had contested against the freeway supporters on three levels: in Owings’s lobbying with Baltimore elites, in debates over technical issues among the professional ranks, and in subversive planning actions at the grassroots level. The information leaks were committed not just by a “rogue element” of SOM but were more likely orchestrated by SOM high-ranking principals. This situation illustrates the long-standing professional differences and the unequal balance of power between highway engineers and designers. The SOM architect–planner team had to use multiple ways to counter their stronger engineering opponents—whom they considered unreasonable, arrogant, and corrupt. Some self-righteous architect–planners crossed the boundaries of traditional client–consultant relations and worked privately, and ultimately, openly with the antiroad movement.</p>
<p>The UDCT infighting in its fifty months of existence demonstrates that all planning takes place within its political and institutional environment. Rogers’s attempt to exclude Greiner from the UDCT backfired because the powerful highway lobby successfully brought back Greiner. However, one may argue in a counterfactual manner that had it not been done, without the SOM intervention between 1967 and 1968, Baltimore’s fragmented freeway opposition forces would not have been strong enough to stop a highway with a worse configuration. The high-profile UDCT strategy built enough support from the elites to enabled SOM to endure the attacks from the engineers and, most significantly, bought time for the grassroots groups to mobilize. Without SOM stepping into the vacuum, IDBC would have successfully forced the highway construction after the condemnation ordinance passed in early 1967. But the architect–planners, who raised objections to the plan and helped with the formation of the MAD, stopped the momentum freeway engineers were gaining. By the time the Rosemont hearings were held in August 1969, MAD had grown to be a powerful adversary. Ironically, the UDCT was caught in the middle of the Road War in the end, as the highway fighters whom UDCT had nurtured turned against their mentor.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn102-1538513212471167">102</xref>
</sup> When the public decided not to accept the proposition that Baltimore needed a freeway, the UDCT lost its reason for being. </p>

<p>During postwar infrastructure development, highway and the civil engineering had become powerful professions. The rapidly expanding members were bonded with intricate organizations, contractors, and lobbying groups. Through vigorous licensing requirements, highway engineers went through standard training of how to design and construct highway facilities. They shared similar value of finding cost-effective means to meet geometric requirements and safety standards under a tight schedule. In contrast, the training of architects and city planners was more broad based. The conflict between cost control and aesthetic appreciation was always a source of contention between these two profession groups.</p>

<p>From November 1966 to October 1967, SOM conducted the project on its own expenses. Weese was trained at Chicago’s Illinois Institute of Technology and was a partner at SOM. Klein was a soft-spoken designer who had revised the State University of New York Stony Brook Master Plan prepared by Smith, Smith, Haines, Lundberg &amp; Waehler.

<p>In April 1967, Owings told the audience at a Downtown Committee event, “Now, unless Madison Avenue boys have completely brainwashed us, then we know that running a conventional freeway system through a city—using conventional methods of interposing it—is comparable to running a pair of shears through the warp and woof of a priceless tapestry.” In front of 500 guests of a CPHA diner in 1968, Owings remarked, “If you believe in miracles as I do, then you can hope that a more ideal system than that has been proposed to date will be devised.” He criticized the 10-D route, saying it “fails as an efficient transportation system,” and “everyone sensed that it was wrong, but did not know what to do about it.” Similarly, Owings announced few days before the Rosemont hearing in 1969, “I’d put my body across the tracks and say [the road] should not go through” if the original 10-D route cutting through Rosemont was adopted; see “Owings Vows to Bar Road,” <italic>Baltimore Sun</italic>, July 30, 1969, A10. </p>

<p>Though the Greiner engineers and SOM architect–planners shared the same building, they did not socialize or work together as a team. Each group worked on its assignments separately and in different floors, and if needed, they were called to a conference. The communication was formal, though professional. This characterization is based on Lewis, telephone interview, February 1, 2011; and Chan, personal interview, January 13, 2011. GBC director Boucher felt that SOM could not reasonably act as an effective manager when Axelrod worked closely with Greiner and undermined SOM’s authority. He suggested bringing in an outside management team; see GBC Highways Subcommittee Meeting Minutes, November 5, 1969, 3, GBC Collection, Series IV-K, Box 1, Folder “1969.”</p>

The spillover projects include the Cross-Town Project in Chicago and the Linear City in New York. While neither was successful, some SOM architect planners from the UDCT moved on to other cities to design or press for more humane and better freeways. For example, McKee had his influence in Portland and Chicago. The USDOT did change its funding criteria and incorporated more public participation.</p>

<p>“GBC Highways Subcommittee Report,” January 5, 1970, 3, in GBC Collection, Series IV-K, Box 1, Folder “1970.” Baltimore City Council Office of Financial Review and CPHA had a debate on the fiscal implications of the 3-A plan; see GBC Collection, Series 14, Box 12-8, Folders 1 and 2. This affordability problem was later effectively used by MAD to show that Baltimore should not build the freeway. Dilts put the cost at $1.97 billion; see Dilts, “History of Baltimore’s Interstate System.”</p>

<p>Esther Redd of RAM commented on the joint development, “They said that there was no money for it … They’re still trying to dupe us.” Robert Embry, the housing commissioner, called joint development “a cruel hoax,” a term Zecher used in his earlier Rosemont-hearing testimony.
