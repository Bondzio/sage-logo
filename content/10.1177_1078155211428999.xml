<abstract>
<p>Both acute and chronic neurotoxicities are well-described with the use of oxaliplatin. We describe the case of a 50-year-old man with Dukes C colon carcinoma being treated with an adjuvant FOLFOX4 (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin and oxaliplatin (85 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per cycle)) who developed a widespread acute pain 5 min after commencing his twelfth cycle of chemotherapy. The pain was disabling and distressing, and remained for 16 h despite multimodality analgesia. The patient was not rechallenged with oxaliplatin. We believe this presentation represents an acute neurological phenomenon relating to oxaliplatin. Of note, this acute reaction occurred after 11 cycles of treatment, significantly later in the treatment course than other reports of atypical acute reactions.</p>

<p>Oxaliplatin is a third-generation platinum compound whose major clinical application is in the management of metastatic colorectal cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078155211428999">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078155211428999">4</xref></sup> and adjuvant treatment in resected colon cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078155211428999">5</xref></sup> in combination with fluropyrimidines. Indications for oxaliplatin are expanding and include the use in metastatic gastric and oesophageal cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078155211428999">6</xref></sup> and pancreatic cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155211428999">7</xref></sup> We report the case of a man receiving an adjuvant modified FOLFOX4 (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin and oxaliplatin (85 mg/m<sup>2</sup>)) who developed an acute pain syndrome during infusion of oxaliplatin. Previous cases of atypical reactions to oxaliplatin have been reported early in the treatment course. This case is notable for its occurence during the twelfth cycle of treatment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1078155211428999" sec-type="cases"><title>Case report</title>
<p>A 50-year-old man presented to the Medical Oncology Clinic of our hospital for management of a Dukes C adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon. His medical history was remarkable only for an appendicectomy. He consumed 100 to 150 g of alcohol per day at presentation and had a 30-pack year history of smoking. He presented with an acute abdomen and underwent a laparotomy and Hartmann’s procedure. The pathological specimen showed a perforated T3 sigmoid primary with three out of 36 lymph nodes containing metastatic disease. A staging computerized tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) scan showed no evidence of distant metastases.</p>
<p>The patient was reviewed by the Medical Oncology service and treated with modified FOLFOX4. The first 11 cycles were completed without major incidents. Granisetron was removed from the anti-emetic regimen due to headache. The patient received 160 mg of oxaliplatin per cycle, and by the end of the eleventh cycle had received a cumulative dose of 1760 mg of oxaliplatin (935 mg/m<sup>2</sup>).</p>
<p>Prior to the final cycle physical examination was unremarkable, and laboratory parameters were acceptable. Oxaliplatin administration is given in our institution over a period of 2 h (unless there has been prior acute neurotoxicity – in this case the infusion time is extended to 4 h). The patient developed pain over the shoulders and behind the knees, consisting of a dull ache, 5 min after the commencement of this infusion. The infusion was stopped. Over a 2 to 3 min period, the pain migrated to involve the thighs, hips, and lower back. Pain in the pelvic and shoulder girdles was discribed as being dull, while the back pain was described as being sharp. There was no evidence of anaphylaxis. An abdominal CT scan showed no cause for his pain. The level of pain was disabling and distressing to the patient. For the first 6 h the patient rated the pain as 10 on a scale of 0–10, where zero represents freedom from pain and 10 represents the highest subjective level of pain. Over a further 4 h, the pain scores varied from as low as 3 to a peak of 6. The patient was recorded as being pain free 16 h after the initial reaction. Multiple medications were trialed over this period, including opioids, tramadol, hydrocortisone, promethazine, diazepam, non-steroid anti-inflammatories and hyoscine. No specific agent provided appeared to be effective in reducing the patients’ pain. As the pain was receeding by the evening review, neuromodulatory agents such as carbamazepine and pregabalin were not trialed. The patient was observed in the hospital for a total of 48 h prior to discharge home.</p>
<p>The medical record showed that the patient had previously had ‘typical cold dysaesthsia,’ however, he did not recall this at interview after his acute episode. His symptoms had not been severe enough to warrant extending his infusion time. As the patient had completed 11 cycles with an adjuvant intent, no repeat attempts were made to deliver the twelfth cycle. The patient subsequently remained well other than an episode of sepsis related to a central access device.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1078155211428999" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Oxaliplatin is generally well-tolerated. The major classes of side effects seen with oxaliplatin include hamatological, gastrointestinal, and neurological side effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078155211428999">8</xref></sup> Neurotoxicity occurs with oxaliplatin use as both an acute reversible form and a late-onset chronic sensory neuropathy. The acute form is common (between 85% and 95% of patients) and is generally transient in nature. The symptoms include paresthesias and dysesthesias, laryngopharyngeal dysesthesias (in 1−2%), and occasionally involuntary cramps. Symptoms are often triggered by cold stimuli, such as ingesting cold food or fluid or handling cold objects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078155211428999">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078155211428999">10</xref></sup> The chronic form is of a peripheral sensory neuropathy that initially presents as paraesthesias and dysesthesias of the hands and feet. It may progress with on-going administration of oxaliplatin, eventually leading to functional impairment due to interference with sensory-motor coordination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078155211428999">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078155211428999">10</xref></sup> The onset of chronic neurotoxicity is related to the cumulative dose of oxaliplatin administered.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078155211428999">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078155211428999">5</xref></sup> This form of neuropathy usually improves over months to years after cessation of treatment, but for a portion of patients may never recover to normal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078155211428999">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several studies have been undertaken in preclinical models to demonstrate the mechanism of acute oxaliplatin neurotoxicity. Grolleau et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078155211428999">11</xref></sup> examined the effect of platinum-based compound on the electrophysiology of a cockroach CNS neuron. They showed that oxaliplatin had a marked inhibition on voltage-gated sodium channels, which was not seen with carboplatin or cisplatin. In another study, Webster et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078155211428999">12</xref></sup> confirmed the effects of oxaliplatin on sodium channels in mouse diaphragm and vas deferens. They showed oxaliplatin increased neurotransmitter release in the motor nerve terminal of the phrenic nerve and therefore hyperexacitability. Blockage of the voltage-gated sodium channel with tetrodotoxin prevented hyperexcitability. The authors noted that this finding ‘implies that oxaliplatin acts on nerve conduction.’ Adelsberger et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078155211428999">13</xref></sup> used three rat nervous tissues – sensory nerves, dorsal root ganglia (DRG), and hippocampal neurons. The effects on sodium channel function were seen in sensory nerves and DRG but not hippocampal neurons, suggesting that the effects of oxaliplatin are limited to particular channel types.</p>
<p>Neurophysiological studies undertaken in patients treated with oxaliplatin confirm the acute changes in peripheral nerves. In a Phase I study of oxaliplatin in combination with capecitabine, Wilson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078155211428999">14</xref></sup> demonstrated motor nerve hyperexcitability on needle electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCS). A further study by Park et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078155211428999">15</xref></sup> assessed sensory axonal excitability in addition to NCS in patients receiving oxaliplatin in adjuvant or metastatic treatment of colon carcinoma. Changes in axonal excitability were related to the measures of axonal sodium channel function (refractoriness and superexcitability). These changes pre and postinfusion became less pronounced in later cycles.</p>
<p>As noted above, the most common acute neurological changes are well-known to clinicians who use oxaliplatin. Our case adds to several others of atypical acute reactions associated with this drug that have been self-limiting. Saadati and Saif<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078155211428999">16</xref></sup> and Saif and Hashmi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078155211428999">17</xref></sup> have reported two cases of acute hyperexcitability syndromes in patients with pancreatic cancer treated with oxaliplatin. The reactions occured at Cycle 2 and Cycle 4. These patients had muscular cramping with clinical features similar to neuromyotonia. Una<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078155211428999">18</xref></sup> described a 62-year-old patient being treated for metastatic colon cancer who developed right-sided sensory and motor symptoms after her first cycle. Winquist et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1078155211428999">19</xref></sup> describe a case of acute bilateral abducens paralysis after the first cycle of oxaliplatin in a 68-year-old man being treated for metastatic renal carcinoma.</p>
<p>Our patient developed an acute pain syndrome immediately after commencement of oxaliplatin. We believe that the most likely mechanism is neurologically mediated, due to the rapid onset of symptoms with a normal physicial exam, no structural changes on imaging, and in the absence of another plausible pathophysiological explanation. On the scale described by Naranjo et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1078155211428999">20</xref></sup> this case scores 2−4, which is consistent with a possible adverse drug reaction. Unlike the cases mentioned above, the reaction occurred late in the course of treatment after 11 prior cycles. While the reaction was transient, lasting less than 24 h, it did cause acute distress to the patient. A number of modalities failed to provide symptomatic relief.</p>
<p>A further challenge for patients requiring treatment with oxaliplatin depends on the clinical indication of treatment as well as the severity of the reaction sustained. Increasing the duration of oxaliplatin infusion from the conventional 2-h period to as long as 6 h decreases the likelihood of further reactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078155211428999">21</xref></sup> Calcium and magnesium infusions have also been used as a neuroprotectant. Concerns arose after an interim review of the CONcePT trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1078155211428999">22</xref></sup> showed that these infusions reduced response rates to FOLFOX in patients treated for metastatic colon cancer based on investigator assessed response. This review resulted in termination of the trial. Subsequent blinded assessment overturned the results of the interim review.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078155211428999">23</xref></sup> Kurniali et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1078155211428999">24</xref></sup> provide a contemporary review on this topic. Neuromodulatory drugs such as carbamazepine may provide relief for patients suffered from chronic neuropathies, but they have not been found to have a neuroprotective effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078155211428999">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1078155211428999">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our case shows that atypical reactions to oxaliplatin can occur later in the treatment course than previously reported. Clinicians should be aware of the occurrence of unexpected atypical reactions.</p>
