<p><italic>Background</italic>: Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube insertion is an uncomfortable procedure that has traditionally required sedation. In some patients, PEG tube insertion can be postponed or is not possible due to the risk of sedation. This article is a retrospective case series of 10 patients who have undergone unsedated peroral PEG tube insertion in the past 4 years at Stafford Hospital in the United Kingdom. <italic>Methods</italic>: Between 2006 and 2010, 10 patients who were identified by the nutrition team as needing a PEG tube underwent unsedated peroral PEG tube insertion. Patients were given pharyngeal anesthesia (lidocaine 1%), and the PEG tubes were inserted using the push-pull technique and local anesthesia. The procedures were performed without complications. <italic>Results</italic>: Those patients who were able to respond stated they would be willing to have the procedure performed again using this method. It was acceptable to them and not as unpleasant as they had expected. <italic>Conclusions</italic>: This case series demonstrates that gastroenterology units without specialized equipment are able to safely insert PEGs in patients who are at increased risk for intravenous sedation.</p>

<title>Clinical Relevancy Statement</title>
<p>This case series documents the evolution of a variation of the traditional percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube insertion technique, enabling placement in some patients who otherwise may have not had the procedure because of their poor fitness for sedation.</p>

<sec id="section2-0148607111410433" sec-type="intro">
<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A confidential national inquiry into patient outcomes and mortality following PEG tube insertion in the United Kingdom found that 70% of deaths within 30 days of the procedure were due to respiratory disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607111410433">1</xref></sup> The procedure is uncomfortable and has traditionally required sedation. In some patients, PEG tube insertion is postponed or not possible because of the risk of sedation associated with the medical conditions, which themselves may lead to the need for PEG insertion (eg, cerebrovascular accident) or other comorbidities such as pneumonia or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</p>
<p>As an alternative, some units are able to place radiologically inserted gastrostomy (RIG) tubes, with overall 30-day and 1-year mortality rates similar to those observed with PEG tubes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607111410433">2</xref></sup> However, this option is not available in many hospitals, and in some units, sedation may still be required. There can be a significant incidence of technical problems with RIG tubes, with up to 40% of RIG tubes placed requiring replacement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607111410433">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607111410433">4</xref></sup> Several studies have been published about unsedated transnasal PEG insertion using the Gauderer-Ponsky pull technique, which is performed in patients without peroral access.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607111410433">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607111410433">6</xref></sup> In one study, over the course of 27 months, 12 of 155 patients (8%) had no oral access to the esophagus and, therefore, were deemed to require a pernasal technique, for which they did not require sedation for successful placement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607111410433">5</xref></sup> A second study placed 21 of 23 PEGs (91%) using a pernasal unsedated technique, but the failures were related to inability to transilluminate, not the unsedated technique itself.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607111410433">6</xref></sup></p>

<title>Patients</title>
<p>Between 2006 and 2010, 10 patients underwent unsedated peroral PEG tube placement. These were patients with an overriding clinical need for PEG placement but who were unable or unwilling to undergo the procedure with sedation. When possible, patients gave their written informed consent for an unsedated surgical procedure before undergoing the operation. For those patients who were unable to consent personally, approval was obtained in accordance with UK guidelines on consent for adults with incapacity. A clinical nurse specialist verbally prepared those patients who could understand and consent for themselves about the procedure and what to expect. And if available, the procedure was discussed with the patient’s next of kin. According to UK guidelines, Research Ethics Committee review was not required for this study.</p>
<p>Patient demographic data were collected prospectively. As part of our routine clinical care, a clinical nurse specialist interviewed or contacted patients following the procedure.</p>
<p>At the first planned review, patient comments were recorded regarding the acceptability of the procedure performed using this method. Case notes were analyzed retrospectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0148607111410433">
<title>Surgical Procedure</title>
<p>Patients were given 10 sprays of lidocaine 1% (AstraZeneca, Luton, UK) pharyngeal anesthesia. The procedure was performed in the traditional prone position, and patients were intubated orally using a gastroscope (9.2 mm external diameter, 103 cm length; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). A basic diagnostic endoscopy was performed before inflating the stomach and locating a suitable site for tube placement using a combination of finger indentation and transillumination. A local anesthetic, lidocaine 2% (5 mL; Braun, Melsungen, Germany), was administered by creating a subcutaneous bleb and then infiltrating lidocaine along the axis of proposed PEG insertion to the depth of the stomach. The PEG tube was inserted using the push-pull technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607111410433">7</xref></sup> Pulse rate and oxygen saturation were monitored using a pulse oximeter. Patients did not receive any analgesia.</p>

<p>In terms of tolerability, patients who were able to respond to questions regarding the acceptability of the procedure indicated that although it was uncomfortable, they would be willing to have a PEG inserted using this method again. When patients were unable to respond, the nurse’s observations were recorded. All patients were described as calm and settled throughout the procedure.</p>
<p>No endoscopy-related complications were observed in those patients who were unable to respond. Oxygen saturation remained at acceptable levels compared with preprocedure values. Four patients were discharged directly from the endoscopy department, without a 24-hour admission for observation. Refeeding syndrome was seen in 2 patients, who required electrolyte correction. The 30-day mortality rate was 30%, and no deaths were attributable to the endoscopic procedure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0148607111410433" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This small case series is limited by the inability of several patients to communicate their experience of the procedure. However, it is the first study in the literature to demonstrate that unsedated PEG insertion in general medical patients using standard upper-gastrointestinal (GI) equipment is technically possible and appears to be well tolerated.</p>
<p>In particular, patients with significant comorbidities and respiratory disease are at increased risk of morbidity or mortality when they undergo sedated upper-GI endoscopic procedures. For diagnostic procedures, sedation can be avoided by using pharyngeal anesthesia; however, therapeutic upper-GI endoscopy, including PEG insertion, traditionally requires sedation. For some patients who require PEG placement, severe respiratory comorbidity can preclude sedation and cause delays in tube placement or even mean that placement of a PEG tube will never be possible. Delays in beginning enteral nutrition (EN) may then occur in these patients whose malnutrition may already be critically severe. In those patients for whom sedation would otherwise preclude or substantially delay PEG placement, unsedated peroral PEG placement should be considered.</p>
<p>In this case series, 3 patients died within 30 days of the procedure. This is higher than both the national average and the unit’s auditable average for overall PEG tube insertions. None of these deaths was attributable to the endoscopic procedure, and all 3 patients who died had significant respiratory and comorbid diseases. In fact, in 2 of these patients, the cause of death was related to preexisting complex aspiration pneumonias.</p>
<p>In some specialized units, noninvasive techniques may be employed in patients with motor neuron diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607111410433">8</xref></sup> These patients had their respiratory function assessed using vital capacity measurements, sniff nasal inspiratory pressure, capillary blood gases, and overnight oxygen saturation levels to determine whether PEG insertion was appropriate. This process is costly, time-consuming, and only available in specialty centers. The use of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil has been studied post-PEG insertion to reverse sedation, which could be particularly beneficial in patients with respiratory comorbidities; however, in routine clinical practice, its use has not been proven effective in reducing post-PEG insertion mortality rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607111410433">9</xref></sup> Another report suggested that in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, unsedated percutaneous radiological gastrostomy is as effective as sedated PEG insertion,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607111410433">10</xref></sup> but again, this procedure has limited availability. In a recent review, Wilhelm et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607111410433">11</xref></sup> studied the successful placement of PEG tubes in the outpatient setting in selected patients.</p>
<p>Some reports in the literature describe the advancing skill and technique developing in the management of patients who require PEG insertion for EN. Unsedated PEG insertion offers an inexpensive alternative method of PEG insertion that enables patients to attend their local center rather than requiring a tertiary referral.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0148607111410433" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In a select group of patients, unsedated PEG insertion is safe, well tolerated, and acceptable to patients. An unsedated approach to PEG insertion would be appropriate only in a select group of patients who are carefully chosen and prepared for the procedure in advance using a multidisciplinary approach.</p>
<p>This case series demonstrates that gastroenterology units without specialized equipment can place PEG tubes in patients who are at increased risk from intravenous sedation and that in some patients, there may be no need to delay PEG insertion and, more important, no need to delay nutrition supplementation.</p>
