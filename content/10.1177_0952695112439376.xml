        <p>Largely unacknowledged by historians of the human sciences, late-19th-century psychical
          researchers were actively involved in the making of fledgling academic psychology.
          Moreover, with few exceptions historians have failed to discuss the wider implications of
          the fact that the founder of academic psychology in America, William James, considered
          himself a psychical researcher and sought to integrate the scientific study of mediumship,
          telepathy and other controversial topics into the nascent discipline. Analysing the
          celebrated exposure of the medium Eusapia Palladino by German-born Harvard psychologist
          Hugo Münsterberg as a representative example, this article discusses strategies employed
          by psychologists in the United States to expel psychical research from the agenda of
          scientific psychology. It is argued that the traditional historiography of psychical
          research, dominated by accounts deeply averse to its very subject matter, has been part of
          an ongoing form of ‘boundary-work’ to bolster the scientific status of psychology.</p>

      <title>Introduction: psychical research and the ‘new psychology’</title>
      <p>At the end of the 19th century, psychical researchers such as Frederic and Arthur Myers,
        Edmund Gurney, Julian Ochorowicz, Charles Richet, Max Dessoir, Albert von Schrenck-Notzing,
        Richard Hodgson and Henry and Eleanor Sidgwick were actively involved in the making of the
        fledgling science of psychology. Psychical researchers initiated and organized the
        International Congresses of Physiological/Experimental Psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0952695112439376">Alvarado, forthcoming</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0952695112439376">Nicolas and Söderlund, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0952695112439376">Plas, 2000</xref>), and they devised methodological
        innovations such as randomized study designs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0952695112439376">Hacking, 1988</xref>). They contributed important empirical
        findings by conducting the first experiments investigating the psychology of eyewitness
        testimony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0952695112439376">Hodgson and Davey,
          1887</xref>), empirical and conceptual studies illuminating mechanisms of dissociation and
        hypnotism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0952695112439376">Alvarado, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0952695112439376">Ellenberger, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0952695112439376">Gauld, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0952695112439376">Shamdasani, 1993</xref>) and experiments and large-scale
        surveys undermining the notion of dissociation and hallucinations as intrinsically
        pathological phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0952695112439376">Sommer,
          2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0952695112439376">Williams, 1985</xref>).
        While rooted in attempts to test controversial claims of telepathy, clairvoyance and
        survival of death, these contributions enriched early psychological knowledge quite
        independently of the still hotly debated evidence for ‘supernormal’ phenomena.</p>
      <p>Nothing epitomizes the ambivalent relationship of academic psychology to psychical research
        clearer than two figures generally considered as the very founders of modern psychology,
        William James and Wilhelm Wundt. Whereas Wundt had publicly and programmatically rejected
        psychical research as intrinsically unscientific in the same year he established German
        experimental psychology in Leipzig (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0952695112439376">Wundt, 1879</xref>), James sought to integrate it into nascent American psychology. James
        made original contributions to psychical research and regularly collaborated and
        corresponded with British and French psychical researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0952695112439376">Skrupskelis and Berkeley, 1992</xref>–2004; James, 1986). In
        1884, he became a founding member of the American Society for Psychical Research (ASPR) and,
        in 1894 and 1895, a president of the British Society for Psychical Research (SPR), and he
        reviewed and defended the work of the SPR in psychology and science periodicals like
          <italic>Mind</italic>, the <italic>Psychological Review</italic>, <italic>Nature</italic>
        and <italic>Science</italic>.<sup>
          <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0952695112439376">2</xref>
        </sup>
      </p>
      <p>In the United States, several of Wundt’s students, such as Hugo Münsterberg, Stanley G.
        Hall, Edward Titchener and James McKeen Cattell (along with other leading US psychologists
        not trained by Wundt), ruthlessly combated the father of American psychology in his attempts
        to integrate psychical research into nascent psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0952695112439376">Bjork, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0952695112439376">Bordogna, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0952695112439376">Coon, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0952695112439376">Taylor, 1996</xref>). Divided by epistemological,
        methodological and political disagreements as well as by personal animosities (see, for
        example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0952695112439376">Sokal, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0952695112439376">Taylor, 1994</xref>), leading US
        psychologists found themselves in rare unison agreeing that psychical research was not to be
        associated with the ‘new psychology’. Hence, the aggressive rejection of psychical research
        as the ‘unscientific Other’ of academic psychology, which James’ opponents perceived as a
        threat to rationality and the scientific and social order, was a vital unifying principle
        aiding early psychologists to achieve something like a scientific identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0952695112439376">Leary, 1987</xref>). </p>
      <p>Joseph Jastrow, one of the most active popularizers of the ‘new psychology’ in America,
        identified vital boundary issues of psychology when reminiscing about the problem of
        psychical research, ‘which in the closing decades of the nineteenth century was so prominent
        that in many circles a psychologist meant a “spook hunter”’ (Jastrow,
          <italic>Autobiography</italic>, in Carl Murchison [ed.] <italic>A History of Psychology in
          Autobiography</italic>, vol. 1 [Worcester, MA: Clark University Press, 1930], pp. 135–62,
        cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0952695112439376">Moore, 1977</xref>: 166–7). One
        can thus easily imagine how James must have embarrassed many colleagues by stating, for
        example, in his <italic>Science</italic> review of an early SPR study of telepathic
        hallucinations that the scholarship displayed therein comprised a combination of outstanding
        intellectual virtues ‘not found in every bit of so-called scientific research that is
        published in our day’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0952695112439376">James,
          1887</xref>: 18). ‘Enlightened’ psychologists were also hardly amused by the founder of
        American psychology exclaiming in the <italic>Psychological Review</italic> that ‘the
        concrete evidence for most of the “psychic” phenomena under discussion is good enough to
        hang a man twenty times over’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0952695112439376">James,
          1896</xref>: 650). </p>
      <p>Among those who felt driven to protest against James’ lack of epistemological squeamishness
        was James McKeen Cattell. As the editor of <italic>Science</italic>, Cattell concluded a
        series of heated discussions with James about a recent SPR report on the medium Leonora
        Piper in the pages of his journal by stating that he had attacked James<disp-quote>
          <p>… only because I believe that the Society for Psychical Research is doing much to
            injure psychology. The authority of Professor James is such that he involves other
            students of psychology in his opinions unless they protest. We all acknowledge his
            leadership, but we cannot follow him into the quagmires. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0952695112439376">Cattell, 1898</xref>: 642)<sup>
              <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0952695112439376">3</xref>

          </p>
        </disp-quote>
      </p>
      <p>It is on the backdrop of these boundary disputes that certain historical episodes which
        have been celebrated as victories of American scientific psychology over psychical research
        deserve a reassessment. Among the most widely promulgated success stories of psychology
        expelling its unloved sibling from academia were the public ‘exposures’ by two leading US
        psychologists, Hugo Münsterberg and G. Stanley Hall, of two subjects most extensively
        investigated by psychical researchers of the time: the Italian ‘physical medium’ Eusapia
        Palladino in 1909 and the American ‘mental medium’ Leonora Piper in 1910. While the
        Hall–Piper episode will be reserved for a separate study, this article analyses
        Münsterberg’s celebrated exposure of Eusapia Palladino. </p>

        <p>Whereas traditional standard accounts of psychical research have portrayed proponents of
          the controversial discipline as gullible victims of a desperate will to believe or as
          otherwise intellectually or morally impaired (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0952695112439376">Alcock, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0952695112439376">Hall, 1962</xref>), less ideologically committed
          historical research has revealed a wide range of epistemic and metaphysical positions
          within the controversial discipline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0952695112439376">Gauld, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0952695112439376">Mauskopf and
            McVaugh, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0952695112439376">Noakes,
            2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0952695112439376">Oppenheim, 1985</xref>;

          favouring superficial mono-causal attributions, by, for example, explaining interest in
          psychical research in terms of a ‘flight from reason’ and irrational obsession with the
          ‘occult’, these studies have shown that scholars had not only differing motivations
          leading to their involvement in psychical research, but – not unlike early academic
          psychologists – they were also divided by competing research programmes and epistemic presuppositions.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0952695112439376">4</xref>
          </sup>
        </p>
        <p>Crude axes around which to allocate research activities within the psychical research
          community were, for example, the question of post-mortem survival versus telepathy and
          clairvoyance among the living, and the study of physical versus mental phenomena. Focal
          points of research differed nationally as well. For instance, while the British SPR –
          especially under the leadership of Henry Sidgwick – favoured the study of mental rather
          than physical phenomena, French and Italian researchers like Charles Richet and Cesare
          Lombroso investigated both areas. As Heather <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0952695112439376">Wolffram (2009</xref>) has shown, early-20th-century
          German psychical research was heavily dominated by studies in physical mediumship through
          the influence of the wealthy physician and former pioneer of hypnotism and sexology,
          Albert von Schrenck-Notzing. While the automatic speaking and writing of the American
          trance medium Leonora Piper – discovered and introduced to the psychical research
          community by William James in the late 1880s – became the most thoroughly studied mental
          mediumistic phenomena of all time, the Neapolitan Eusapia Palladino (1854–1918, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0952695112439376">Figure 1</xref>) was the undisputed queen of
          physical mediumship, puzzling some of the leading scientists and philosophers of her time.<sup>

        <p>According to her main investigators, such as the Polish philosopher-psychologist Julian
          Ochorowicz, the French physiologist Charles Richet, the British physicist Oliver Lodge and
          the Italian psychiatrist Enrico Morselli, Palladino’s performances were a strange mixture
          of blatant fraud and genuine ‘supernormal’ phenomena. While Eusapia<sup>
            <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0952695112439376">6</xref>
          </sup> would cheat shamelessly whenever she got the opportunity, she was also reported to
          have produced, sometimes in bright light and under good conditions of observation and
          experimental control, levitations and remote manipulations of objects, materializations of
          human forms and the development of bizarre pseudopodia. Many sceptical scientists who came
          to investigate her left as believers. For example, Cesare Lombroso, one of the
          arch-enemies of psychical research and spiritualism in Italy, attended sittings with
          Palladino in the 1890s to expose her tricks, but left completely converted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0952695112439376">Lombroso, 1909</xref>). While Lombroso not
          only came to believe in the reality of Eusapia’s phenomena but also embraced the spirit
          hypothesis to explain some of them, most other investigators of Palladino and other
          mediums, such as Charles Richet, Enrico Morselli, Théodore Flournoy and Albert von
          Schrenck-Notzing, rejected the spirit hypothesis and favoured a psychodynamic explanation
          in terms of ‘teleplasty’ or ‘ideoplasty’, describing the grotesque phenomena as
          ‘externalized dreams’ of physical mediums. </p>
        <p>Not exactly conforming to the Victorian stereotype of the etheric spiritual medium,
          Palladino, an uneducated peasant woman, was notorious for her erratic and vulgar behaviour
          inside and outside her seances and trance states. For example, apart from displaying a
          diva-like behaviour, she would, apparently merely to entertain herself, tell obvious lies
          and openly flirt with some of her distinguished male investigators, sometimes jumping on
          the horrified savants’ laps. In a comprehensive treatise on the psychology and physical

          hysteria, a verdict shared by other researchers who had openly reported instances of fraud
          in Eusapia and other physical mediums while claiming a robust residue of genuine
          phenomena. Rather than reducing the phenomena of physical mediumship to fraud, these
          investigators tried to distinguish between deliberate malicious fraud, quasi-pathological
          trickery outside the trance state, unconscious fraud in the trance state (where
          ‘dissociated streams’ of a medium’s unconscious were believed to act out auto-hypnotic
          suggestions to produce phenomena no matter how) and the alleged supernormal phenomena not
          thus explicable. These researchers viewed mediumistic fraud of a certain order not only as
          relatively easy to control in an experimental setting, but also as a field of
          psychological study in its own right.<sup>

          the experimenters, expert conjurors and enjoying a reputation as debunkers of fraudulent
          mediums, came to Naples to expose Palladino, but after a series of 11 experimental
          sittings concluded that among the usual obvious trickery there was a range of apparently
          genuine phenomena defying explanation. After Naples, Carrington, a freelance researcher
          and science journalist with little if any regular income, arranged for Palladino to travel
          to the USA and be investigated by committees of scientists to bolster the scientific
          status of psychical research and, although he repeatedly denied this, probably also to
          secure some financial gain for himself.<sup>

        <title>Hugo Münsterberg and psychical research</title>
        <p>Münsterberg was one of several students of Wilhelm Wundt who were to become pillars of
          American psychology.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0952695112439376">12</xref>
          </sup> In 1893, responding to competition from other universities, William James persuaded
          the gifted experimentalist to come to America and run the laboratory of experimental
          psychology at Harvard. In Germany, like Wundt, Wilhelm Preyer and other early German
          psychologists, Münsterberg had recognized the importance of popularizing the nascent
          science by publicly demarcating the ‘new psychology’ from psychical research. Still in
          Freiburg, Münsterberg had given a popular lecture, ‘<italic>Gedankenübertragung</italic>’
          [Thought-transference], which was published in the <italic>Berichte der Naturforschenden
            Gesellschaft zu Freiburg</italic> and subsequently as a pamphlet. He attacked the work
          of the psychological societies in Munich and Berlin in psychical research, which, he
          warned, fatally reinforced the popular view of the identity of psychology and spiritualism
          and other superstitions posing serious threats to modern science and civilization.<sup>

          </sup> Without naming them, he also scolded certain eminent scientists who had stated that
          psychic phenomena were not yet confirmed sufficiently, whereas, he complained, it would
          have been their scientific duty to state ‘in plain language: they are impossible!’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0952695112439376">Münsterberg, 1889</xref>: 3; my
          translation). As in later writings on psychical research, Münsterberg tried to stress the
          essential difference between scientific psychology and psychical research on the one hand,
          and between psychical research, which he constantly conflated with vulgar spiritualistic
          belief systems, and true religion on the other.<sup>

        <p>Ten years after his Freiburg talk, Münsterberg, now in charge of experimental psychology
          at Harvard, published the essay ‘Psychology and Mysticism’ in the popular <italic>Atlantic
            Monthly</italic>. Essentially repeating the basic themes of
            ‘<italic>Gedankenübertragung</italic>’, the gist of the article was that science had
          explained all reported supernormal phenomena in terms of hypnotism, hysteria, muscle
          reading, hyperaesthesia, dissociation, hallucinations and illusions ‘and other mental
          states which psychology understands just as well as it does the normal associations and
          feelings’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0952695112439376">Münsterberg, 1899</xref>:
          75), neglecting to mention that it was psychical researchers rather than experimental
          psychologists who had made major contributions to these areas. Münsterberg admitted that
          he had ‘never taken part in a telepathic experiment or in a spiritualistic séance’,
          justifying his reluctance to gain first-hand experience by referring to ‘experiences of
          some friends’, who ‘had spent much energy and time and money on such mysteries, and had
          come to the conviction that all was humbug’ (ibid.: 77). Münsterberg claimed that the only
          time he wavered was when he had<disp-quote>
            <p>… received a telegram from two telepathists [<italic>sic</italic>] in Europe, asking
              me to come immediately to a small town where they had discovered a medium of
              extraordinary powers. It required fifteen hours’ traveling, and I hesitated; but the
              report was so inspiring that I finally packed my trunks. Just then came a second
              message with the laconic words, ‘All fraud’. Since that time I do not take the trouble
              to pack. I wait quietly for the second message. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0952695112439376">ibid.</xref>: 77) </p>

        <p>James was hardly impressed by the <italic>ex cathedra</italic> pronouncements of his
          colleague, which, in a letter to Harry N. Gardiner on 19 January 1899, he described as
          strategically ‘clever’ but ‘essentially childish’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0952695112439376">Skrupskelis and Berkeley, 1992</xref>–2004: VIII, 484).
          Viewing Münsterberg’s article as yet another example of rhetorical trickery he had decried
          previously in colleagues like Hall, Titchener, Cattell and Jastrow, James wrote: ‘The
          insolence of these fellows, sure of the applause of Scientism, whatever they may say, is
          amusing’ (ibid.). Moreover, regarding Münsterberg’s self-professed eagerness to
          investigate alleged supernormal phenomena, James revealed to Edward Titchener on 21 May
          1899: <disp-quote>
            <p>My colleagues for the most part, when invited, have simply refused to see Mrs. Piper
              [whom James had hosted to conduct a series of experiments]. [Josiah] Royce, e.g., who
              had only to step from the next door but one into my house. Munsterberg said it was no
              use; if he got such results, he would know himself to have been hypnotized. I said
              ‘bring your wife, sit in the corner &amp; observe, and see if your accounts agree’. He
              replied ‘I should never allow my wife to visit such a performance’. I call that real
              sportsmanlike keenness for new facts! (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0952695112439376">Skrupskelis and Berkeley, 1992</xref>–2004: VIII, 532)<sup>

        <p>For whatever reasons, Münsterberg apparently changed his mind at the end of the same year
          and asked for sittings with Mrs Piper. In a letter to James’ fellow pragmatist, the
          German-born Oxford philosopher Ferdinand Canning Schiller, James wrote on 11 October 1899:
          ‘He certainly ought not to be allowed to see Mrs. Piper. He will be hypnotized, if he gets
          anything – if not, he will have exploded the phenomenon. It is too late!’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0952695112439376">Skrupskelis and Berkeley,

          English) of his compatriot’s <italic>Psychology and Life</italic> in the journal
            <italic>Mind</italic>. Münsterberg complained to James about Schiller and asked for
          support. In his reply on 17 November 1899, James agreed that Schiller’s ridicule of
          Münsterberg’s English was below the belt and reassured him that he had scolded Schiller accordingly.<sup>

              candour, seems to me a monumentally foolish performance. The time is passed for
              metaphysical dogmatism about natural phenomena and I think it was a great compliment
              that he should have discussed your paper at all. If discussed, how could it be
              discussed but in a comic vein? Pardon these sentiments, my dear colleague; you can
              easily understand them; brevity forces me to be blunt. (Skrupskelis and Berkeley,

          committee investigating the phenomena of Eusapia Palladino. Münsterberg was quoted thus:
          ‘I will willingly serve with a committee of scientists to determine the limitations of the
          medium Paladino’. This was because he was ‘intensely interested … in psychologic phenomena
          of all descriptions, and if this woman is all she is accounted, I think I as well as my
          fellow-scientists will know our time well spent in watching her powers’.<sup>

        <p>Carrington had also invited James to participate in the media spectacle. In his reply on
          15 June 1909, James declined the invitation: <disp-quote>
            <p>My small remaining energy has to go elsewhere. You’ll think me a mollycoddle (or

              Eusapia has had the good luck so far to follow that line of success. After reading
              Courtier’s report, it seemed to me that it was quite unnecessary for duffers like

          stated that if they ‘would investigate seriously, it would be a fine thing for you to get
          her here for them. But I have very little faith in the candor of such men’, doubting any
          useful results forthcoming from such a cooperation. Based on his previous experiences,
          James concluded his letter by stating that he did not ‘wish to take any trouble to
          convince such men as Münsterberg and Jastrow’, and, uncharacteristically harsh, he advised
          Carrington: ‘Let them perish in their ignorance and conceit.’<sup>

        <p>Aware of his immense popularity and visibility in the American press, Münsterberg must
          have known that his verdict on any controversial matter related to the study of the human
          mind would be snapped up by the media and accepted as the official verdict of scientific psychology.<sup>

          </sup> Hence, like Münsterberg’s previous writings on psychical research, his Palladino
          article, written after attending two sittings on 13 and 18 December 1909, revealed his
          determination to cleanse academic psychology from any occult connotations at all costs and
          to promote psychology as an applied and thus useful science at the same time. Commenting
          on his previous refusals to actively investigate psychic claimants, Münsterberg wrote
          that, daily ‘urgent requests’ notwithstanding, he had ‘remained loyal to my program and
          refused consistently all contact with the mystical phenomena’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0952695112439376">Münsterberg, 1912</xref>: 119). Explaining his sudden
          change of mind, wrote: It is the duty of a psychologist to examine the totality of mental
          occurrences, and he has no right to close his eyes on that which seems to transcend our
          present powers of explanation. I heard this so often and so impressively that I finally
          yielded. I simply said: ‘Madame Palladino is your best case. She is the one woman who has
          convinced some world-famous men. I never was afraid of ghosts; let them come!’ (ibid.:
          120).</p>
        <p>Münsterberg claimed that his scientific training, which, he stressed, entirely rested on
          trust, would render him incapable of discovering Palladino’s cunning tricks, an
          explanation he offered for the conversion of other scientists who had declared Palladino’s
          phenomena real. Again blurring the distinction between empirical research and ideological
          spiritualism, and neglecting to acknowledge experimental conditions in previous series of
          experiments reported by non-spiritualists such as Morselli, Richet, Flournoy and the
          Curies, Münsterberg characterized the Palladino sittings uniformly: <disp-quote>
            <p>Always the same silly, freakish, senseless pranks repeated on thousands of nights
              before small groups of more or less superstitious people under conditions of her own
              arrangement, conditions entirely different from ordinary life, with poor illumination
              and with complete freedom to do just what she pleases. (ibid.: 135–6)</p>
          </disp-quote>
        </p>
        <p>Later the reader finds an admission regarding investigators’ attempts to automatize
          control and thus obtain results independent of the pitfalls of human observation,
          contradicting Münsterberg’s previous statement. But Münsterberg had ‘no sympathy with the
          efforts to raise the level of the investigation by introducing subtle physical
          instruments. That gives to the manifestations an undeserved dignity and withdraws the
          attention from the center of the field’ (ibid.: 140). After speculating about how
          Palladino might fake her phenomena, Münsterberg wrote: <disp-quote>
            <p>Of course, there will be some who in reply will fall back on their old outcry that
              all this is dogmatism and that instead of mere theories of explanations they want
              actual proof. I am afraid I must be still clearer there. I must report what happened
              at the last meeting which I attended. (ibid.: 141)</p>

        <p>Münsterberg then related how he and other sitters controlled Palladino’s hands and feet, <disp-quote>
            <p>… and yet the table three feet behind her began to scratch the floor and we expected
              it to be lifted. But instead, there suddenly came a wild, yelling scream. It was such

              from her body and he looked out for them. What a surprise when he saw that she had
              simply freed her foot from her shoe and with an athletic backward movement of the leg

        <p>Münsterberg’s conclusion, to be readily promulgated in academic and popular channels of
          information alike, was therefore: ‘Her greatest wonders are absolutely nothing but fraud
          and humbug; this is no longer a theory but a proven fact’ (ibid.: 144). </p>
        <p>At the same time, however, he proposed that Eusapia might not be held fully responsible
          for her cheating. For Münsterberg explained that it was ‘improbable that Madame Palladino,
          in her normal state is fully conscious of this fraud. I rather suppose it to be a case of
          complex hysteria in which a splitting of the personality has set in’ (ibid.: 144). Hence,
          what previous researchers of physical mediumship had long come to view as a psychological
          problem that deserved to be studied in its own right, Münsterberg falsely claimed as his
          original contribution to psychology: the discovery of ‘unconscious’ mediumistic trickery.
          Rather than viewing ‘unconscious fraud' as a confounding but controllable variable,
          however, Münsterberg proposed it as a sufficient explanation for the whole complex of
          phenomena studied by investigators of physical mediumship.</p>
        <p>On 22 January 1910, William James sent a copy of Münsterberg’s article to Oliver Lodge in
          England, commenting on<disp-quote>
            <p>… the depth to which the ‘scientific’ mind can descend, in the person of my impudent
              colleague Munsterberg. It is a buffoon article, as if written by a bagman. The worst
              of it is that I can imagine no process by which he could possibly be made ashamed of
              it. So essentially dogmatic is his mind that he will remain convinced to the end that
              he has ‘exposed’ Eusapia and be proud of the literary performance. Absolutely the
                <italic>only</italic> ‘observation’ was the catching of the foot by the man on the
              floor. M——g insinuates that this was done in consequence of his advice, but in point

        <p>Prior to the publication of Münsterberg's <italic>Metropolitan Magazine</italic> article,
          rumours of the impending publication had reached Hereward Carrington, who wrote to
          Münsterberg on 6 January 1910, asking him to withhold publication before a fuller record
          of the series was published:<disp-quote>
            <p>… your remarks at the time, as shown in the stenographic notes, and your subsequent
              utterances to Mrs. Carrington, myself and other sitters at the conclusion of the
              séance, indicated clearly enough that you believed and, in fact, stated at the time
              that the case was of great interest, scientifically, and that the phenomena were, in a
              large part, at least, not due to fraud on the part of the medium. If your opinions
              have since changed, this must be due to some cause or causes which I think you should state.<sup>

            </p>
          </disp-quote>
        </p>
        <p>Years later, Carrington concluded his final published analysis of the
          Münsterberg–Palladino affair thus: ‘Inasmuch as I wrote a letter to Professor Münsterberg,
          at the time, accusing him of willful falsehood, I can see no reason to refrain from
          repeating that assertion here. His own dictated statement to the stenographer refutes his
          claim’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0952695112439376">Carrington, 1957</xref>: 246).<sup>
            <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0952695112439376">26</xref>
          </sup>
        </p>
        <p>In fact, if we were to believe the published minutes of the sittings, there were more
          problems with Münsterberg’s ‘exposure’ than those identified by James. For example,
          contrary to what Münsterberg’s article implied, nobody except Eusapia herself had claimed
          that her foot was grabbed, and all sitters at the time denied such action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0952695112439376">Carrington, 1954</xref>: 113, 117).
          Furthermore, while Münsterberg implied that Eusapia’s scream marked the cessation of the
          sitting on 18 December, the experiment not only continued uninterrupted for another 17
          minutes (ibid.: 114), he also neglected to mention that the cry following the alleged
          foot-grabbing incident at 11.44 (‘E. screams sharply. Reason not known’, ibid.: 113) was
          not the first one. According to the minutes, at 11.01 Eusapia had cried ‘as if in pain’
          and wept ‘as if physically hurt’ (ibid.: 111).<sup>
            <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0952695112439376">27</xref>
          </sup> The minutes also state that at the time of the alleged exposure, Münsterberg, who
          controlled Palladino’s hands, and Professor Bumpus (a friend of Münsterberg), controlling
          both of her feet, explicitly stated: ‘control is all right’ (ibid.: 113).</p>
        <p>Physical mediumship in general, and the Palladino case in particular, posed a complex
          enough problem to trained scientists and clinicians open to the possibility of the
          genuineness of Eusapia’s feats. Obviously, mediums and their investigators were
          particularly easy prey for determined debunkers such as Münsterberg, Jastrow and others,
          who could be sure that the popular and academic press alike would accept their verdicts as
          scientifically authoritative. Hence, James, who commented on Palladino’s behaviour in
          America to Flournoy that ‘Eusapia’s type of performance is <italic>detestable</italic> –
          if it be not fraud simulating reality, it is reality simulating fraud!’ (9 April 1910,
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0952695112439376">Skrupskelis and Berkeley,
            1992</xref>–2004: XII, 466) was not the only psychical researcher who had doubts
          regarding the value of Carrington’s project. The philosopher and psychical researcher
          James Hyslop exemplified disagreements in the psychical research community over the
          scientific merit of physical mediumship in general and Palladino in particular when he
          wrote: <disp-quote>
            <p>The Palladino case, as it has been managed, is not calculated to influence
              intelligent people who have no time to spend years and fortunes on it. It only excites
              dispute and many of the facts asserted of it are so closely related to fraud that even
              the apology of hysteria has little effect. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0952695112439376">Hyslop, 1910</xref>: 182–3)<sup>

        <p>After James’ death, Münsterberg continued his crusade to expel psychic phenomena from the
          epistemological and professional territories of psychology. His last debunking exercise in
          the name of scientific psychology was another <italic>Metropolitan Magazine</italic>
          article in 1913, an enlarged version of which he incorporated in <italic>Psychology and
            Social Sanity</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0952695112439376">Münsterberg,
            1914</xref>), which outlines his investigations of Beulah Miller, a 10-year-old girl in
          Warren, Rhode Island. Newspaper reports had claimed that the girl was able to read minds
          and perceive remote or hidden objects. After rejoicing that ‘organizations for
          antilogical, psychical research eke out a pitiable existence nowadays’, Münsterberg
          related that he had undertaken his investigation of Beulah Miller from the same ‘feeling
          of social responsibility’ in which he had ‘approached the hysterical trickster, Madame
          Palladino, who had so much inflamed the mystical imagination of the country’ (ibid.: 143).
          Münsterberg proposed that Bleulah's feats were to be explained by a pathological
          hypersensitivity, which enabled her to unconsciously perceive and decode subtle sensory
          clues by members of her family and other persons in possession of the information Beulah
          was to present. Though not a fraud, Münsterberg explained, the girl’s ‘mental makeup in
          this respect constantly reminds the psychologist of the traits of a hysteric woman’
          (ibid.: 172). </p>

      <title>Conclusion: historiography as boundary-work</title>
      <p>Pointing, for a change, the spotlight that orthodox critics have put on scientific deviants
        back on the critics themselves, a large can of worms threatens to explode in the historian’s
        face. For not only does the Münsterberg–Palladino episode fail to stand out as particularly
        ‘juicy’; problematic strategies employed by Münsterberg seemed moreover the norm rather than
        the exception in other examples of ‘boundary-work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0952695112439376">Gieryn, 1983</xref>) not restricted to American history

        </sup> Historical debunking exercises of psychical research have regularly involved
        intellectual ‘virtues’ that would quickly cost the critic his or her job if employed in the
        treatment of respectable fields of study. Moreover, far from marking a discrete or closed
        historical chapter in sociological studies of the rejection of modern parapsychology (the
        quantitative study of alleged extra-sensory perception and psychokinesis) by psychologists
        and mainstream scientists have shown that these strategies continue to be employed (see, for
        example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0952695112439376">Collins and Pinch, 1979</xref>;

      <p>Apart from the significance of such episodes for academic and scientific core values we
        usually take for granted (such as intellectual integrity and academic freedom), fostering
        the taboo of the ‘occult’ has disastrous consequences for historical scholarship. Just to
        remain with William James studies: whereas the first select compilation of James’ psychical
        research writings was published in French about two and a half decades after his death
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0952695112439376">James, 1924</xref>), it took almost
        another four decades for an English compilation to appear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0952695112439376">Murphy and Ballou, 1961</xref>), and another two and a half
        for the most recent and comprehensive collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0952695112439376">James, 1986</xref>). These ‘apocryphal’ works are obviously
        necessary additions to the corpus of James studies, but their separate issuing documents the
        artificial divide that scholars have created between the man’s unorthodox and ‘respectable’
        works and achievements, which has enormously complicated a coherent understanding of James.
        This has been documented, for example, by Marcus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0952695112439376">Ford (1998</xref>), who published an analysis of the James
        literature up to the late 1990s with regard to the implications of James’ interest and
        involvement in psychical research. He found that most James scholars have been reluctant
        even to address James’ active and lasting involvement in psychical research and his
        conviction of the reality of certain psychic phenomena, let alone discuss the importance of
        his unorthodox interests for an understanding of his psychological and philosophical
        writings. Shortly before Ford addressed this problem, Eugene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0952695112439376">Taylor (1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0952695112439376">1996</xref>) had started to demonstrate the immense
        significance of James’ involvement in psychical research for his work in psychology and
        psychopathology, particularly in the period between <italic>The Principles of
          Psychology</italic> (1890) and <italic>The Varieties of Religious Experience</italic>
        (1902). <sup>

      </p>
      <p>In fact, prior to authors like Ellenberger and Taylor, professional historians of
        psychology – the majority of who were and still are trained psychologists – were simply not
        interested in these issues. Edward Titchener, another contemporary of James vehemently
        opposing the latter’s advocacy of psychical research, had concluded his assessment of the
        scientific status of psychical research with a statement that could qualify as a tacit yet
        powerful epistemological prescription underlying the academic curriculum of modern
        psychology – and its historiography – up to the present day: ‘No scientifically-minded
        psychologist believes in telepathy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0952695112439376">Titchener, 1898</xref>: 897). Titchener’s pupil Edwin Boring, the eminent historian of
        psychology, continued this tradition and even went so far as  retroactively to censor James
        in a preface to a debunking study by the psychologist Charles E. M. Hansel, whose
        ‘historical’ part, incidentally, relies on Münsterberg’s Palladino account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0952695112439376">Hansel, 1966</xref>: 42, 213–14).
        Selectively quoting from James’ last public statement on psychical research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0952695112439376">James, 1909a</xref>), where James admitted
        his inability to account for psychic phenomena with a specific theory, Boring sweepingly
        disqualified any belief in psychic phenomena by reference to the ubiquitous ‘need to
        believe’ theory. Surprisingly, he then also praised as exemplary ‘James’s own suspended
        judgement on psychic research’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0952695112439376">Boring,
          1966</xref>: xvii), neglecting to mention James’ emphatic statements to the contrary in
        the same article and elsewhere as far as the very facts in question are concerned.<sup>
          <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0952695112439376">32</xref>
        </sup>
      </p>
      <p>While pre-1990s James scholarship is perhaps the most conspicuous example of what might be
        called passive or boundary-work <italic>pace</italic> the historiography of psychology, the
        visible interest and involvement of other renowned psychologists in the study of psychic
        phenomena following James (William McDougall, Alfred von Winterstein, J. C. Flügel, Cyril
        Burt, Constance Long, Gardner Murphy, Hans Eysenck and others) and psychotherapists
        discussing the occurrence and significance of psychic phenomena in the therapeutic setting
        (e.g. S. Freud, S. Ferenczy, N. Fodor, J. Ehrenwald, J. Eisenbud, E. Servadio) has also
        largely failed to be appropriately reflected by historians.<sup>
          <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0952695112439376">33</xref>
        </sup> These examples clearly show that interest in alleged psychic phenomena has never been
        limited to an eccentric or let alone intellectually inferior minority in the psychological
        community. This also suggest that the unloved sibling of modern psychology has been
        dissociated from its history mainly by editorial fiat. </p>
      <p>The very vehemence and affectivity of attacks, and the thinly veiled academic contempt
        towards ‘the Other’ of modern psychology, suggest that what was (and apparently still is) at
        stake is more than merely intellectual disagreements or problems of professionalization. The
        traditional historiography of psychical research, dominated by the ‘winners’ of the race for
        ‘the science of the soul’, reveals fascinating epistemological incommensurabilities and a
        complex set of interplays between scientific and metaphysical presuppositions in the making
        and keeping alive of the scientific status of psychology. Thus, revised histories of
        psychical research and its relationship to psychology with a critical thrust not limited to
        that which has been viewed with suspicion anyway, offer both a challenge and a promise to
        historians, the discussion of which the present article hopes to stimulate.<sup>

            Resurrection as facts, and that, as ‘the Academy would not reject the greatest
            psychologist in the world on the ground that he was a Methodist or a Catholic … William
            James should not be rejected no matter what his views on telepathy and spiritualism’

          <p>Compare, for example, the opposing views regarding alleged psychic phenomena in two
            leading psychical researchers, Charles Richet and Frederic Myers. Richet, viewing
            psychic phenomena as challenging scientific anomalies, strictly adhered to scientific
            materialism and held that supernormal phenomena would eventually become comprehensible
            in terms of a physiological theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0952695112439376">Wolf, 1993</xref>). The research of Myers, on the other hand, was driven by a
            personal need to find empirical evidence for the spiritual nature of mind and its
            survival of death, though this did not lead Richet, James, Flournoy and other eminent
            contemporaries of Myers to dismiss his research as intrinsically flawed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0952695112439376">Hamilton, 2009</xref>).</p>

          <p>This is of course not to say that psychical research and modern parapsychology stand
            out as the only disciplines that have received unfair treatment (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0952695112439376">Mauskopf, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0952695112439376">Wallis, 1979</xref>). The case of
            psychical research, unlike other stereotypical ‘pseudo-sciences’ such as astrology,
            alchemy, phrenology, UFOlogy, crypto-zoology and cold fusion research, derives its

            fields modern parapsychology is (apart, perhaps, from alternative medicine) the only –

          <p>One of the anonymous reviewers raised the concern that my claim regarding the
            contributions by psychical researchers to fledgling psychology (see Introduction) was
            lacking in originality, since it was believed this constituted common ‘working
            knowledge’ among current historians of psychology. This may well be the case; however,
            to my knowledge no historian of psychology has ever provided a summary of these
            contributions or delivered a concise positive claim to this effect <italic>in
              print</italic>, or revealed and problematized in detail methods commonly employed to
            marginalize certain kinds of epistemic deviance. These lacunae are at least compatible
            with – if not in support of – my broader thesis of historiography as passive
            boundary-work.</p>
          <p>In a similar vein, the same reviewer was also concerned that I overstate the case by
            inflating the apparently extreme example of Münsterberg as representative of the kind of
            boundary-work exercised by psychologists, and the belief was expressed that such
            behaviour would surely be sanctioned nowadays. Both the historical and sociological
            literature which I cite in support of my claims to the contrary clearly shows otherwise.
            Moreover, and as mentioned in the Introduction, to make a stronger case this article had
            originally intended to include and discuss the historical relevance of a similar
            episode, G. Stanley Hall’s and Amy Tanner’s staged ‘exposure’ of Leonora Piper (which
            even involved physical abuse) shortly after James’ death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0952695112439376">Tanner, 1910</xref>), as well as its overall positive
            reception in the psychological press, which space limitations forced me to reserve for a
            separate occasion. Finally, regarding ongoing boundary-work by psychologists, complaints
            very similar to those which James, Schiller, Flournoy, Sidgwick, W. F. Prince and other
            psychical researchers had levelled against Münsterberg, Hall, Jastrow, Titchener,
            Cattell, etc., continue to be made against certain present-day professional debunkers
            and self-styled media experts of science and parapsychology, many of whom are
            psychologists, and whose work is widely cited as authoritative and supported by other
            psychologists and scientists. The relevant sociology of science literature from the late
            1970s, which I partially cite, demonstrates a clear continuity of ethically problematic
            boundary-work, and more recent works suggest that very little has changed in the last
            few decades (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0952695112439376">Carter, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0952695112439376">2010</xref>;
              <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0952695112439376">McLuhan, 2010</xref>). Even though
            these accusations of intellectual dishonesty continue to be serious, appear
            well-substantiated and have in essence remained unanswered by the targets of criticism,
            their reception is limited to circles outside the scientific and psychological
            establishment, and they continuously fail to be acknowledged or discussed in the
            mainstream science and psychology literature.</p>
