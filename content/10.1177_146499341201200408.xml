<p>Drawing on a wealth of material on wars in the Global South, Leatherman’s book provides an overview of sexual violence in conflict situations worldwide; conflicts that have been exploited, she suggests, by transnational corporations looking for access to diamonds or gold as well as commercially important minerals such as copper or coltan. While females are not mentioned in the title, the book reflects mainly on violence against women and girls; violence against men being remarked upon but not systematically addressed. This is unfortunate as current findings suggest men in wartime have been abused at a rate not much less than women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-146499341201200408">Stemple, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Thematically, the book’s main argument is that sexual violence has been historically central to the pursuit of armed conflict/war, and that it is inseparable from both the patriarchal relations that produce sexual and other kinds of gender-based violence, and from the global political economy in which all armed conflict is deeply embedded. In other words, sexual violence is not an aberration, but a norm, despite the fact that until quite recently it has been a taboo to speak about the topic. The suggestion is that wartime rape is the outcome of a global gender ideology rather than of purely localized struggles and a significant consequence of neo-colonial economic relationships constructed via globalizing capitalism. Conceptually, the book’s central argument is that in times of war the most fundamental socio-cultural taboos are broken, as ‘runaway norms’ take over and justify violence, exploitation and even genocide.</p>
<p>The book puts particular emphasis on a few conflicts, particularly those in former Yugoslavia (the setting with which the author is most familiar), Congo, and northern Uganda, with a lesser focus on civil wars in South Asia and West Africa. Rather than providing a systematic account of these conflicts to present the reader with an overview of the issues and the role played by the global political economy, gender and sexual violence, snippets of information on each conflict are spread throughout the book as Leatherman demonstrates the destructive force of this kind of violence practised on young and old, healthy and sick, male and female as an intrinsic element in the competition for access to resources. When mineral resources run out, the last thing left to exploit, she suggests, is the bodies of the subaltern—women, children and subordinate men. Hence, conflict becomes an intrinsic element in human trafficking.</p>
<p>Reference to case after case of sexual and related violence conveys the seriousness of this issue, of the importance of understanding it as underpinning political as well as human relations in conflict zones, and as central to, rather than merely a by-product of, war. However, the relentless and often insufficiently nuanced belabouring of example after example, constantly jumping between conflicts, is tiring, somewhat repetitious, and at times muddled. For example, basic information about UN Security Council Resolution 1325, on women’s roles in the post-conflict situation, is presented after, rather than before, the discussion on it; the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) alone is blamed for sexual violence in northern Uganda with no attention paid to the high levels of similar abuse carried out on males as well as females by the Ugandan army (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-146499341201200408">Dolan, 2009</xref>). It is also unfortunate that throughout most of the book men are treated as the enemy when, without excusing anyone’s violent practices, a more balanced analysis would show the systematic exploitation of subaltern men both sexually and in other ways.</p>
<p>Conceptually, the book makes use of different theories never quite shaped into a coherent framework, despite claims to the contrary. The lack of a systematic political analysis can be seen in the contradictory approach to the international community, which on the one hand is portrayed quite paternalistically as a beneficial force consisting mainly of Westerners whose role it is to restrain the Global South from barbarity through political protection, peacekeeping, and humanitarian aid. On the other hand, it is also described as complicit in the conflicts, for instance, in exploiting mineral extraction in the Congo. Nor has the fundamental involvement of major companies and governments of the north in creating the environment that produced many of the conflicts concerned been clearly acknowledged. Recent literature that implicates humanitarian aid and aid workers in the economy of war is ignored, while Leatherman accepts, apparently unquestioningly, the views of the media and of much mainstream scholarship in labelling contemporary intra-state wars as fundamentally barbaric, incorrectly suggesting, for instance, that the war in northern Uganda was devoid of (political) ideology. A more critical view suggests that this conflict, as most others in the global south and especially in Africa, has been exploited by the international community and its leaders portrayed as uncivilized in order to justify the position of the international community/great powers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-146499341201200408">Branch, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-146499341201200408">Dolan, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>While giving a reasonably comprehensive overview of sexual violence against women in wartime, this book is a missed opportunity towards providing a truly sophisticated analysis of such violence, which includes an investigation of the positioning of men of distinct power groups in relation to it. A more systematic study of how the great powers misuse their political and economic position to sustain a certain gender ideology and thereby exploit the disadvantaged of both sexes through structural violence and policies likely to end in violent conflict could usefully have been included, as also a more subtle and less West-centric view of armed violence in the Global South.</p>
<p>The issue of sexual violence is a complex one in any context. When this is coupled with a war situation, this is multiplied many times over. It needs studying both on the ground (<italic>e.g.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-146499341201200408">Dolan, 2010</xref>), and in relation to political analyses of the kinds carried out by Cynthia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-146499341201200408">Enloe (2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-146499341201200408">2004</xref>). It could have considerably improved the present volume for this to have been done here.</p>
