            <p>The following article presents the results of a survey carried out by the German Association of Research-Based Pharmaceutical Companies (Verband Forschender Arznemittelhersteller; vfa) on the experience of applicants to the competent authorities in Germany with regard to the authorization of clinical trials. Overall the authorization process is assessed positively by the applicants. As in previous years the overall course of the approval procedure in Germany is described as a well-functioning system that is scientifically based and ensures that the assessment is readily comprehensible to the applicant. The ongoing constructive dialogue and exchange of views with the BfArM and the PEI should be used to further improve and harmonize the approval procedure, so that the conditions for trials in Germany may continue at this high level. Furthermore, the article addresses the first experience by German pharmaceutical companies with the so-called "Voluntary Harmonization Procedure" (VHP) on the European level.</p>

         <title>Summary</title>
         <p>An appropriate and efficient approval procedure for clinical trials is an important factor for the competitiveness of Germany as a location for research. Since the implementation of Directive 2001/20/EU<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861511429281">1</xref>
            </sup> as part of the 12th Amendment of the German Medicines Act (12th AMG Amendment)<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861511429281">2</xref>
            </sup> in August 2004, approval by the German Federal Higher Authorities—the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM) and the Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI)—is a crucial step before a clinical trial can start in Germany. Hence, the experience of applicants with the approval procedure has a key role in terms of the competitiveness of Germany as a clinical research location. Surveys of the experiences of research-based pharmaceutical companies were carried out and published in 2005, 2006, and 2007.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092861511429281">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092861511429281">4</xref>
            </sup> On the basis of these experiences with the regulatory approval procedure, an updated survey was undertaken in 2009 to record the qualitative changes in the approval procedure by the 2 German Federal Higher Authorities and the time it took to obtain approval. Questions were asked not only about the number of trial applications but also about the nature and frequency of deficiencies or objections regarding the applications.</p>
         <p>Twenty-seven of 46 member companies (59%) of the Association of Research-Based Pharmaceutical Companies e.V. (vfa) took part in the survey, which related exclusively to trial applications submitted in 2009. Three of the responding companies had not carried out any clinical trials in Germany during the period covered by the survey. The time taken to obtain approval could be recorded for 305 trial applications to the BfArM (29% of all 1048 BfArM applications in 2009<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092861511429281">5</xref>
            </sup>). Qualitative aspects of the application process and processing could also be recorded in 415 trial applications to the BfArM (40% of all trial applications in 2009). On the other hand, for the PEI, approval times were recorded for 61 trial applications (28% of the total 219 applications submitted in 2009<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0092861511429281">6</xref>
            </sup>). The survey documented the qualitative aspects of the application process and the processing of 69 trial applications to the PEI (32% of all those submitted in 2009).</p>
         <p>On the applicant’s part, a further reduction in the number of formal (administrative) objections was seen compared with the surveys of 2006 and 2007.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092861511429281">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092861511429281">4</xref>
            </sup> The frequency of objections relating to the actual content of the application remained roughly the same (35%-60% of applications). However, in contrast to the trend seen for the other phases of clinical testing, there was a noteworthy accumulation of formal objections (33% by the BfArM and 40% by the PEI) and objections with respect to content (55% by the BfArM and 66% by the PEI) in connection with phase IV trials. This was despite the fact that the number of applications for phase IV trials has remained relatively constant over the past 3 years.</p>
         <p>Evaluation of the comments in this survey shows that the work of the 2 Federal Higher Authorities in Germany is assessed positively by the applicant. As in previous years, the overall course of the approval procedure in Germany is described as a well-functioning system that is scientifically based and ensures that the assessment is readily comprehensible to the applicant. The ongoing constructive dialogue and exchange of views with the BfArM and the PEI should be used to further improve and harmonize the approval procedure, so that the conditions for trials in Germany may continue at this high level.</p>
         <p>In general, with regard to the overall time taken to obtain approval, it can be said that the time limits are adhered to or that the procedure is even completed ahead of schedule. However, in comparison with the results of the 2006<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092861511429281">3</xref>
            </sup> surveys, no significant shortenings/changes in the approval deadlines were seen. The somewhat longer timelines set out in the German Medicines Act are expressly not regarded as a disadvantage compared to other national authorities in the European Union (EU). This is because only about 1% of applications are refused, as a result of the constructive, scientifically based discussion of applications in the approval procedure. Once again, this demonstrates the good, professional exchange between applicants and the Federal Higher Authorities. In contrast, in other EU countries (such as the United Kingdom), applications sometimes have to be withdrawn/refused and resubmitted to meet the shorter deadlines prescribed by law. This causes these procedures to be altogether longer and more expensive for the applicant. The vfa members expressly confirmed this in the survey and regard this aspect as an important reason for the strong competitiveness of Germany as a trials location.</p>
         <p>This contributes to the fact that Germany holds a good position in the European comparison and, since 2007, has taken the top place for industry-sponsored clinical trials with regard to the number of clinical trials in Europe.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0092861511429281">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092861511429281">8</xref>
            </sup> Also, in terms of the number of trial centers, Germany takes second place worldwide after the United States<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0092861511429281">9</xref>
            </sup>; in the European comparison, the ratio of clinical trials per inhabitant is nevertheless capable of improvement. In view of the decreasing number of clinical trial projects in the EU as a whole, the competitiveness of Germany as a trials location requires further enhancement<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0092861511429281">10</xref>
            </sup> because in the competition between European research locations, as the number of studies in this region declines, a strong “performance” is of great importance. The good position of Germany as a trials location must therefore be maintained and further extended if possible. All those involved can play their part. For example, an adaptation of the German Medicines Act (AMG) and the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) regulations (eg, in the definition of the investigator, suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction [SUSAR] reports, and standardization of the requirements of ethics committees) would be desirable. Further harmonization of the framework conditions, such as the differing requirements of the European authorities for clinical trials within the meaning of the EU-GCP directive, with which this goal was actually meant to be achieved, is also important for the significance of clinical research in Europe.</p>
         <p>A step in this direction is the Voluntary Harmonisation Procedure (VHP),<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0092861511429281">11</xref>
            </sup> which has been available since March 2009 for multinational drug trials in various EU countries. A single application submitted in English to the Clinical Trials Facilitation Group (CTFG) for approval of a clinical trial is examined jointly by the national regulatory authorities affected. Scientific questions about the trial protocol and the investigational product are clarified jointly by the authorities of the EU member states in which the clinical trial is to be held. This is then followed by the national approval of the clinical trial by the authorities of each member state—generally with a short total timeline of 10 days. This aspect was also recorded in the survey, but because of the low feedback (only 4 applications were recorded in this survey), a qualified assessment cannot be given at this point. Nevertheless, the reports on these 4 applications reveal the real advantages of this procedure (eg, standard application, rapid implementation of amendments in the EU). Use of this procedure can certainly point the way for the future design of framework conditions at the EU level.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>The statutory duty to obtain approval and requirements concerning the conduct of clinical trials in Germany is set out in §§ 40 to 42b of the AMG.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861511429281">2</xref>
            </sup> The timetable of the approval procedure, deadlines (§ 9 GCP-V), and documents to be submitted (§ 7 GCP-V) are specified in more detail in the GCP regulations.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0092861511429281">12</xref>
            </sup> The latter were newly introduced and/or amended as part of the 12th Amendment of the German Medicines Act (AMG) on the implementation of Directive 2001/20/EC<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861511429281">1</xref>
            </sup> into national law, effective August 6, 2004. Further changes resulting from this and requirements of the later Directive 2005/28/EU<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0092861511429281">13</xref>
            </sup> were realized in the German GCP regulations (GCP-V) and/or implemented in the AMG.</p>
         <p>Implementation of the GCP guidelines has caused fundamental changes in the preparation and conduct of clinical trials in Europe and Germany. For example, approval by a Federal Higher Authority (BfArM or PEI), as well as the issuance of a positive opinion by the relevant ethics committee(s), is required in order for a clinical trial to proceed (for experiences with the procedure with ethics committees, see Russ et al<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0092861511429281">14</xref>
            </sup>).</p>
         <p>In Germany, 2 Federal Higher Authorities perform the tasks in connection with the approval of clinical trials. Their respective areas of competence are defined in §§ 77 AMG.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861511429281">2</xref>
            </sup> Thus, the PEI is responsible for sera, vaccines, blood preparations, bone marrow preparations, tissue preparations, allergens, test sera, test antigens, gene transfer drugs, somatic cell therapies, xenogenic cell therapies, and blood constituents produced using genetic engineering. All other medicinal products, also including active substances based on proteins, peptides, or nucleotides (eg, RNAi, oligonucleotides, Spiegelmers) for use in humans, come under the responsibility of the BfArM. In individual cases, the distinction still leads to uncertainties on the part of the applicant, but the Federal Higher Authorities are helpful in the context of this classification.</p>
         <p>Current qualitative experience with the official approval procedures in Germany in 2009 is presented below.</p>

         <title>Aims</title>
         <p>The aim of the survey was to record current qualitative experience with the approval of clinical trials according to § 42 Subsection 2 AMG<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861511429281">1</xref>
            </sup> by the German Federal Higher Authorities and the processing times by the respective Federal Higher Authority and the applicants. In addition, experience with the amendment procedure pursuant to § 10 Subsection 1 GCP-V<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0092861511429281">12</xref>
            </sup> following a granted approval was recorded, as well as with the nature and frequency of formal (administrative) objections and those relating to the actual content of the application.</p>

      <sec id="section4-0092861511429281">
         <title>Methods</title>
         <p>The results presented in this article are based on a survey of member companies of the Association of Research-Based Pharmaceutical Companies e.V. (vfa) about their experiences in the course of first approval and/or amendment procedures for clinical trials with the German Federal Higher Authorities (FHAs) in 2009. To that end, all 46 member companies of the vfa were sent a questionnaire with 14 questions and an Excel table for recording the time taken to obtain approval, with separate parts to complete for the BfArM and the PEI, respectively. Details of all times (by date) of the course of the respective BfArM and PEI approval procedures were recorded separately in the Excel table.</p>
         <p>The replies from the companies were originally to be sent back to the vfa by July 30, 2010, but the deadline was extended to August 15, 2010 to increase the response rate. This response rate was eventually 58.7%—that is, 27 of 46 member companies replied, with 3 of them reporting that they had not submitted any applications during the period covered by the survey.</p>

               <p>The first step in the processing of approval applications by the BfArM is to check the formal completeness of the application according to GCP-V requirements. If applications are incomplete in terms of GCP-V, then an additional 10-day formal checking deadline comes into force.

                  </sup> such as details of the clinical research organization (CRO) involved (in addition to details of the sponsor), EudraCT number, or telephone number of the sponsor/CRO. All companies expressed the view that the details of both the sponsor and the CRO on the label constituted an additional difficulty. In the case of multinational trials, it is not possible to print the address of all local branches of the sponsor on the blister if national branches are to be given as sponsors on the labels rather than the company’s head office. The amount of space needed for this additional marking also often causes problems, especially with small containers.</p>
               <p>The BfArM requirement of UV spectra to assess phototoxicity of the investigational drug continues to arouse criticism because many applicants believe a standard template is not always logical. Nevertheless, they have largely conformed to this BfArM requirement. If the UV spectrum for the investigational drug shows absorption in the region &gt;290 nm, then the applicants have to submit a statement on the “photosafety” of the investigational drug in accordance with the above-mentioned “Note for Guidance.”<sup>

               </fig>
               <p>In terms of the trial protocol, the most common BfArM requests were to widen or specify inclusion/exclusion criteria or stopping rules (eg, to set clear limits for the inclusion/exclusion or discontinuation in the case of renal or cardiac function disorders). If a licensed comparator is to be used as the investigational product, then the BfArM requires its contraindications and, if applicable, also its precautions to be explicitly taken into account in the exclusion criteria of the trial protocol. In addition, the BfArM requested more frequent medical and/or laboratory checks during the course of the clinical trial.</p>
               <p>In addition, queries were raised concerning dosage or the planned increase in dosage, and not uncommonly, the BfArM asked for the presentation of safety data before the next dose could be started.</p>
               <p>Together with the trial protocol, the IMPD is an essential part of the approval application to the Federal Higher Authorities; this document, therefore, was also affected by queries. In this case, the additional documents most often requested concerned the assessment of phototoxicity or the impairment of fertility. As regards pharmaceutical quality, the objections relating to content principally concerned documents about stability and/or the shelf life derived from stability data or the specifications of the investigational product (see also Guideline CHMP/QWP/185401/2004 final).<sup>
                     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0092861511429281">17</xref>
                  </sup> With regard to IMPD documents on clinical aspects, in rare cases, further results and information about other clinical trials with the investigational product were requested. As expected, in the case of applications for phase IV trials, qualitative aspects of the IMPD were not the subject of objections to content or amendments.</p>
               <p>Objections relating to the content of the labeling were more common with phase I and IV trials than with the other phases.</p>
               <p>The focusing of the objections on the content (compare Fig. 6) of the trial protocol as a document directly affecting the safety of subjects or patients is also proof that assessment of the safety of participants in a clinical trial is central to the approval procedure by the authorities. This is highly valued by all participants.</p>
               <p>Overall, the answers to this survey show again that the approval procedure and associated assessment are scientifically well based and, therefore, easy for the applicant to follow. In view of the scientific nature of the assessment, many applicants regard the objections relating to content as helpful for the trial project and/or for future applications to the BfArM.</p>

This is an important factor of great significance for the competitiveness of Germany as a trials location compared to other European countries.</p>
               <p>The implicit processing time limit of 30 days in the AMG applies to most investigational products. Approval for a clinical trial is considered granted if the sponsor is not informed of any reasoned objections by the Federal Higher Authority within a maximum of 30 days after receipt of the complete application documents. However, in some trials (eg, those with genetically modified organisms, gene transfer, and somatic cell therapy products), approval must be explicitly granted. Longer processing deadlines apply in these cases. The survey covering the BfArM focused on approval within the implicit AMG deadline of 30 days. Irrespective of this, the BfArM always notifies the applicant in writing; this is seen as a great benefit with regard to legal certainty for the applicant.</p>

               <p>It must be pointed out that not all steps actually take place in every procedure. For instance, the proportion of formal objections has already been referred to earlier (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0092861511429281">Figure 1</xref>). The time limit for the preliminary check on formal aspects of the application only applies if the original submission has formal deficiencies. The partial steps of the formal check shown in the figure and the resulting response by the applicant affect only about 20% of all applications (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0092861511429281">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
               <p>According to the survey, the average BfArM processing time for phase I trials was 25 days (range, 15-33 days). The sponsor needed an average of 26 days to respond to objections relating to content (range, 3 to a maximum of 60 days). The survey data showed that the legally regulated maximum processing time of 30 days by the BfArM was always adhered to; in most cases, it was far less. Receipt of the written approval by the applicant was taken as a benchmark. The named maximum of 33 days, which is theoretically over the legal deadline of 30 days, is because statutory holidays (Easter/Christmas) intervened in a few cases, which meant that the written notification was not received by the sponsor until after the 30-day time limit. However, this was not associated with an actual overshoot of the deadline.</p>
               <p>In the last survey,<sup>
                     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092861511429281">3</xref>
                  </sup> the values for phases II to IV were combined. In the current survey for 2009, the values for all phases of trials were recorded separately, and the average was about 28 days. Hence, the legally specified maximum processing time of 30 days was always met by the BfArM.</p>
               <p>In the current survey, the legally stipulated shortened processing time (14 instead of 30 days) according to § 9 Para. 3 GCP-V was registered for 4 phase I trials. However, these trials were given as little consideration in the assessment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0092861511429281">Figure 6</xref> for the 30-day procedure) as possibly longer procedures with legally specified processing deadlines of 60 and 90 days because only a small proportion of the BfArM procedures fall into these categories.</p>
               <p>In summary, the deadlines were observed and, through issuance of the written approval (even for implicit procedures), a highly reliable process that was easy to plan was implemented.</p>
               <p>In international comparison, various analyses of other countries (eg, Great Britain) report some considerably shorter processing timelines than for Germany. But these analyses represent only part of the overall process. The procedures defined in the AMG and GCP-V ensure an exchange between applicant and authorities. This is not the case in other countries, where a greater proportion of applications thus have to be refused by the authorities to enable the applicant to provide the required aspects via a new application. This is better regulated in Germany because the procedure allows the authorities to grant the applicant a single period of 90 days to clarify objections relating to the content of the application. A new application because of a rejection is therefore not required, which altogether contributes to a clear advantage in terms of time when clinical trials are carried out in Germany. This also reflects the refusal rate cited by the BfArM of 1% for commercial sponsors and of 1.9% for noncommercial sponsors.<sup>

               <p>Likewise, in comparison with previous surveys, objections on the subject of phototoxicity of the investigational product have decreased. In terms of the number of objections regarding content, a direct comparison with previous surveys shows only a slight change in relation to the different phases of clinical trials.</p>
               <p>The largest reduction from 65% to 56% was seen for phase IV trials, which brings the figure recorded for phase IV more in line with that for the other phases. In the previous years, there was a particularly high incidence of formal objections in the case of phase IV trials. A small reduction of about 1% to 2% was also seen for the other phases.</p>
               <p>In 2007, 52% of the objections concerning the content of the application were still addressed via local amendments for Germany. This proportion has currently risen to 58%. On the other hand, the percentage of global amendments of 24% (2007) fell to about only 18%. The figure of 24% of applications to deal with these objections by other documents did not alter between 2007 and 2009. In terms of approval deadlines, there were hardly any further reductions/changes compared with the earlier vfa survey from 2005.<sup>

Once again, the implicit procedure with a processing time of 30 days defined in the AMG applied to the majority of applications. Fourteen trials with a 60-day procedure were also recorded in the survey.

               <p>A more detailed examination of the formal objections shows that the reasons for them are largely identical within the different survey periods.</p>
               <p>Compared to the earlier survey, analysis of the objections regarding content of the application relative to phase II to IV trials revealed clear shifts, although the general trend remained the same. In 2007, objections regarding content were raised in 59% of the applications for phase II, in 16% for phase III, and in 25% for phase IV trials. The number of applications recorded in the 2 surveys was of a similar order (57 applications in 2007; 69 in 2009).</p>
               <p>The nature of the PEI objections regarding content in 2009 did not differ from that in 2007 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0092861511429281">Figure 10</xref>).</p>

            <title>Comparison of BfArM and PEI</title>
            <p>Comparison of the procedures in the 2 FHAs shows that there are only a few differences between them.</p>
            <p>The proportion of applications for phase I and II trials that are formally incomplete is comparable between the 2 FHAs. However, the figures for formal completeness of phase III and IV trial applications to the PEI were higher than those for the BfArM. Applicants also mentioned that the PEI even informed them of initial comments/requirements concerning content during the formal review of the application. In the case of more complex questions, on one hand this was regarded as positive because it gave the companies a “forewarning” of objections relating to content and/or more time to respond to them. On the other hand, it was criticized that the deadline for the formal preliminary examination was taken up only because of such actual content aspects.</p>
            <p>The nature of the formal objections, however, hardly varied at all between the 2 FHAs, and thus an almost identical picture emerged. In summary, the formal objections raised by both the BfArM and the PEI showed a continued decrease in comparison with previous surveys.</p>
            <p>There is no difference between the BfArM and the PEI in terms of the application documents affected by objections regarding content. In both cases, it was the trial protocol and the IMPD that were the most frequent documents requiring amendment. It was noteworthy that, when the objections regarding content were compared, it was the PEI that placed particular importance on the area of additional medical investigations and laboratory tests (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0092861511429281">Figure 10</xref>). This is surely because the institute’s orientation toward biological drugs means that it authorizes trials with especially complex investigational products, for example, vaccines, allergens, drugs for gene therapy, somatic cell therapy, or xenogenic cell therapy. In assessing these trials, aspects concerning the safety of trial participants play a particularly large role, which explains the focus on the area of additional medical investigations and laboratory tests. In the case of the BfArM, the question of contraception is, on the other hand, of greater interest than with the PEI. This is clearly because of the nature of the medicinal products for which the PEI is responsible since teratogenicity plays a subordinate role in the case of antibodies and blood products.</p>
            <p>Compared to the BfArM, “other documents” are mentioned more often in relation to the implementation of amendments to the trial protocol (31%). The proportion of implementations through global amendments is also higher with the PEI than with the BfArM (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0092861511429281">Figures 12</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0092861511429281">5</xref>).</p>
            <p>There are only minor differences between the 2 authorities with respect to processing times. On the other hand, the response time of companies to objections relating to content is far longer on average—38 days in the case of the PEI compared to about 30 days for the BfArM. The range is greater with the PEI, extending from 5 to a maximum of 89 days compared with the range of 3 to a maximum of 60 days with the BfArM. However, because of the smaller number of applications to the PEI, the few long response times of the companies could have influenced this figure.</p>
            <p>One interesting observation of the evaluation was that in the subjective judgment of the questionnaire responder, processing by the PEI was felt to be much faster than with applications to the BfArM. Evaluation of the survey for phases II to IV did not really confirm this view; for phase I, the calculated average time was just slightly above the time for the BfArM.</p>

            <title>The VHP</title>
            <p>Important for the location of clinical research in Europe is a harmonization of the requirements of the European authorities for clinical trials as per the EU-GCP guideline. One step in this direction is the VHP,<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0092861511429281">11</xref>
               </sup> which has been offered since 2009 for multinational clinical drug trials in various EU countries.</p>
            <p>A single application submitted in English to the CTFG for authorization of a clinical trial is examined jointly by the relevant national approval authorities, with scientific questions about the trial protocol and on the investigational medicinal product being clarified jointly. The assessment is made on a voluntary basis both for the sponsor and also for the countries involved. The procedure consists of 4 phases: application for the VHP, validation of the approval documents (formal check), the first assessment phase, and the response of the applicant up to the second assessment phase. Then follows the national approval of the clinical trial by the authorities of each individual member state, generally with a short overall timeline of 10 days.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0092861511429281">11</xref>
               </sup>
            </p>
            <p>Experiences with the VHP were also elicited in the survey. However, only 4 trial applications had been filed in which 6 to 14 EU member states were involved. Because of the limited feedback, a qualified assessment is not possible.</p>
            <p>Taken as a whole, the VHP was regarded positively by the companies. The individual phases of the process are rated as good to very good, and the exchange with the approval authorities via the CTFG was also described as very positive.</p>
            <p>The first feedback about the experiences shows the advantages of this procedure (eg, standardized application, rapid implementation of amendments in the EU). Use of this procedure will surely pave the way for the future design of the framework conditions at the EU level.</p>
            <p>The important benefit for the sponsor is that, after conclusion of the VHP, the clinical trial is based on a single dossier that all participating countries have found acceptable. As a general rule, country-specific changes to the dossier will therefore not be necessary. In addition, after successful conclusion of the VHP, the applicant profits from an accelerated national process. In addition, this represents a central process that renders national implementation of amendments unnecessary—and this is also possible centrally via the CTFG.</p>

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>The results of this survey confirm, from the viewpoint of research-based pharmaceutical manufacturers, the good overall impression when submitting an application for the approval of clinical trials and the processing times by the Federal Higher Authorities. The survey clearly shows that these positive experiences in the trials location of Germany make a significant contribution to its competitiveness in Europe and internationally.</p>
         <p>It should also be stressed that before the Federal Higher Authorities refuse an application, they make contact with the applicant to clarify points of uncertainty. Thus, by addressing the objections regarding content, the applicant is given the opportunity to avoid a rejection in the procedure. Overall, the good, scientifically based, and reliable exchange between applicants and the Federal Higher Authorities is an important aspect of the work for both sides. For the applicant, this constructive, pragmatic, and practice-oriented partner in the course of applications is of high importance. An important point is also that the requirements of the Federal Higher Authorities are clearly understandable to the applicant in the discussion. In this way, the Federal Higher Authorities are also making a contribution to the trial, which is valued internationally too.</p>
         <p>Another highly positive feature is that, despite the high workload, both Federal Higher Authorities consistently meet the regulated deadlines and in some cases undercut them considerably. Therefore, the somewhat longer approval timelines in the German Medicines Act compared to other national authorities in the EU are expressly not felt to be a disadvantage. This is because, thanks to the constructive, scientifically based discussion of applications in the approval procedure, only 1% of applications are rejected. In contrast, in other EU countries, applications sometimes have to be submitted several times in order for the shorter legal timelines to be met. This makes these procedures much longer altogether and more time-consuming and costly for the applicant. The vfa member companies expressly confirm as much in the survey and regard this aspect as an important reason for the strong competitiveness of Germany as a trials location. The prompt and scientific efficient workings of the Federal Higher Authorities have thereby contributed to Germany taking the top position for clinical research in Europe and have also enabled it to hold onto this position for some years. This is of great significance with respect to the competitiveness of the location.</p>
         <p>When describing the experiences with the BfArM, it was pointed out that in 2009, the institute always confirmed approval in writing, even with the actually implicit approval procedure. Independent of this survey, a few applicants nevertheless reported that for the first 6 months of 2010, the BfArM no longer appeared to be carrying out this practice consistently. In some procedures without any deficiencies with regard to content, no written confirmation was sent. Approval therefore took place through expiry of the deadline (ie, implicitly after exactly 30 days). Applicants regretted this point because written notifications of approval represent a higher legal certainty and were therefore always described as an advantage of the location. The BfArM should check whether the proven practice should be continued in the future as well and whether a written approval should always be issued.</p>
         <p>Although, as this evaluation has shown, the overall approval procedure generally runs well and smoothly, a few points could be further improved in the interest of increasing efficiency. These need to be jointly discussed and acted upon. To this end, the industry and the Federal Higher Authorities are engaged in a constructive dialogue to enable further improvement to be achieved, particularly with respect to the formal objections.</p>
         <p>The VHP is a procedure that shows how the future for clinical trial applications in Europe might look. Therefore, the current VHP should be explicitly anchored in European law in the revision of Directive 2001/20/EU, planned to start in 2012. The VHP ensures the involvement of national authorities and thus enables the established exchange with the national authorities to continue even during the VHP. Against the background of the initial experiences with the VHP, we do not believe that a single European Approval Authority (eg, in the European Medicines Agency) for all multicenter trials in several EU member states would be of benefit. Therefore, in our view, it is important that this instrument is used intensively in the next 1 to 2 years to collect further experience with the VHP. This is because the latter will also need to be taken into account in the revision of Directive 2001/20/EU that may start in 2012.</p>

         <title>Conclusions</title>
         <p>The present survey shows that the approval procedure for clinical trials in Germany with the 2 Federal Higher Authorities (BfArM and PEI) is regarded as largely free of problems by research-based pharmaceutical companies. Applications submitted to them are assessed appropriately and on a proper scientific basis. The required deadlines for processing are adhered to or met considerably in advance of schedule. The overall approval process is therefore evaluated positively by the applicants. The work of the Federal Higher Authorities is thus a good and important precondition for the competitiveness of Germany as a location for clinical research.</p>
         <p>A possible further way of improving this approval procedure requires a change in the legal requirements. Since the 12th Amendment to the AMG in August 2004, all sides have gained much experience, which must now be used by the Federal Health Ministry in a further amendment to the AMG and especially in the long-announced revision of GCP-V. This will ensure that Germany remains competitive as a location for clinical research in the future and can increase its attractiveness still further. In the applicants’ view, clarifications and/or changes in the area of SUSAR reports, definition of the investigator, and the approval of clinical trials that fall within the scope of the Radiological and X-ray Protection Regulations are particularly needed. In addition, a further harmonization of the framework conditions at the European level would be desirable. However, this should take proper account of the good work of the Federal Higher Authorities.</p>
         <p>The VHP is also of importance in this connection. The applicant benefits from this central approval procedure in various ways and from the associated acceleration in the national process. In view of the limited feedback, it remains to be seen how the VHP is accepted by applicants generally. The first impression is overwhelmingly positive and points the way to proper harmonization of the requirements of the authorities in the approval of clinical trials in Europe.</p>
