<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> There are numerous reports on hamstring tendon regeneration after harvest for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. However, few studies have evaluated the relationships among the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of hamstring regeneration, muscle strength, and functional results.</p>
<p><bold>Purpose:</bold> This study evaluates the correlations among the hamstring regeneration on MRI, flexor strength, and functional performance after hamstring tendon harvesting in ACL reconstruction.</p>
<p><bold>Study Design:</bold> Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> We enrolled 45 patients who underwent primary ACL reconstruction using hamstring tendon autografts and in whom flexor strength, functional performance, and preoperative and postoperative MRI results were evaluated at least 2 years postoperatively. Isokinetic flexion strength was tested in the standard and prone positions. We evaluated the differences in flexor strength and functional performance according to the number of regenerated tendons. The correlation between the MRI findings (the number of regenerated hamstring tendons and proximal shift of the musculotendinous junction) and the functional performance and flexor strength was analyzed.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The patients were divided into 3 groups according to the regeneration of the hamstring tendons on MRI: both semitendinosus and gracilis tendons regenerated (group SG), only 1 tendon regenerated (group O), and no tendon regenerated (group N). Significant differences were found in the flexor deficit between group N and groups SG and O on the standard and prone position isokinetic tests. There was a significant correlation (ρ = –.472) between the number of regenerated hamstring tendons and the carioca test result. The proximal shift significantly correlated with the flexor deficit in the prone position isokinetic test (semitendinosus, <italic>r</italic> = .449; gracilis, <italic>r</italic> = .366).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Hamstring tendons regenerated after harvest for ACL reconstruction in a high proportion of the patients. The flexor strength with both the standard and prone position isokinetic tests differed in the 3 groups. The number of regenerated hamstring tendons was significantly correlated with performance on the carioca test. Proximal shifting of the musculotendinous junction was significantly correlated with flexor deficit on the hyperflexion isokinetic test.</p>

<p>Several studies have found evidence of considerable hamstring tendon regeneration after harvesting for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0363546511424134">¶</xref></sup> The regenerated hamstring tendon can function as a knee flexor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511424134">7</xref></sup> and has restored contractile capability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511424134">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511424134">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0363546511424134">43</xref></sup> However, the recovery of flexor strength after harvesting hamstring tendons is controversial. Although several studies have reported a significant decrease in the isokinetic knee flexion strength,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511424134">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546511424134">22</xref></sup> most studies have found no significant decrease postoperatively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511424134">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511424134">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511424134">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546511424134">25</xref></sup> However, these studies evaluated the strength of the knee flexors only by measuring the peak flexion torque, which usually occurs at between 20° and 30° of knee flexion. Several recent studies have indicated that the flexor deficit of the knee occurred at knee flexion angles greater than 60°.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546511424134">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0363546511424134">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although the flexor strength deficit after hamstring harvest has been well documented, none of these studies considered the extent of tissue regeneration at the harvest site. Tissue regeneration and the recovery of flexor strength have been investigated in separate studies. Very few studies have examined the relationship between tissue regeneration and the recovery of muscle strength. In addition, to our knowledge, no study has reported the correlation between the knee flexor deficit and functional performance according to the number of regenerated hamstring tendons after ACL reconstruction using the hamstring tendon.</p>
<p>This study investigated flexor strength and functional performance according to the number of regenerated hamstring tendons. We also investigated the relationship between flexor strength and functional performance in the operated knee and the magnitude of the proximal shift of the musculotendinous junction after hamstring regeneration. We hypothesized that the flexor strength and functional performance of the regenerated tendon would recover after hamstring harvest for ACL reconstruction and that the magnitude of the proximal shift of the musculotendinous junction after hamstring regeneration would influence this recovery.</p>

<title>Patient Selection and Study Design</title>
<p>The study population consisted of 359 patients who underwent primary single-bundle ACL reconstruction performed by an experienced knee surgeon at our clinic between March 2005 and March 2008. The inclusion criteria were a normal contralateral knee on clinical examination, the harvest of both the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons, and single-bundle ACL reconstruction with an ipsilateral hamstring tendon autograft. Moreover, patients had to be followed up for more than 2 years and had to agree to have isokinetic muscle strength testing, functional performance testing, and comprehensive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The exclusion criteria were an associated multiple ligamentous injury (except for medial collateral ligament injury), infection, revision surgery, prior surgery on the affected knee, and female gender. There were 65 female patients of a total 359 patients with autografts. All the included patients in this study were male patients because the gender differences can influence the outcome of the study with regard to muscle strength and functional performance tests.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511424134">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546511424134">38</xref></sup> Of 294 male patients, 62 patients who received allografts were excluded, and 187 patients without the required tests were excluded. Forty-five patients were followed for more than 2 years and underwent MRI both preoperatively and postoperatively and met the above criteria. The study enrolled all patients who met inclusion and exclusion criteria. The mean age of the participants was 32.7 ± 7.3 years, and the mean follow-up period was 36.4 ± 7.4 months. The postoperative MRI was performed at a mean of 28.4 ± 4.5 months. According to the KT-2000 arthrometer measurements, the mean side-to-side difference of the participants was 1.92 ± 1.38 mm. The pivot-shift test findings were graded as 0 (negative), 1 (glide), 2 (clunk), or 3 (gross). We recorded grade 0 in 38 patients and grade 1 in 7 patients; no participants had a pivot-shift test result greater than grade 1.</p>
<p>All patients underwent the same follow-up protocol. We regularly performed the muscle strength and functional tests at 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months after surgery. Functional performance tests were usually completed at 36 months after surgery. Additional functional performance tests after 36 months were done if the patients willingly consented to do so. We performed the MRI examination at 24 and 36 months according to follow-up protocol. We used the results of muscle strength and functional tests performed at the final follow-up.</p>

<title>Surgical Technique</title>
<p>All surgery was performed by the same surgeon. We flexed the knee joint at an angle of 90°. Then, after incising the skin longitudinally at 2 cm medial to the tibial tuberosity, we dissected the subcutaneous tissue to expose the sartorius fascia. After making a reverse L-shaped incision on the sartorius fascia, we dissected and freed the whole pes anserinus under the periosteum, and the flap was reflected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546511424134">Figure 1</xref>). The gracilis and semitendinosus tendons were divided from the conjoined tendon of the pes anserinus. We harvested the gracilis and semitendinosus tendons using a tendon stripper. We anatomically sutured the sartorius fascia again. The sartorius fascia was preserved to facilitate anatomic regeneration. Both semitendinosus and gracilis tendons were folded in half to produce a 4-stranded graft. For the transtibial ACL reconstruction technique, a commercial tibial ACL guide (Linvatec, Largo, Florida) was set at 45°. The intra-articular exit point of the guide was placed at the center of the outlined tibial footprint. The external starting point was placed at the anterior border of the medial collateral ligament insertional fibers in all cases to allow for oblique orientation. The femoral tunnel was made in the femoral notch positioned at 10 o’clock (right knee) or 2 o’clock (left knee) through a transtibial technique, and the femoral tunnel was drilled partway between the anteromedial and posterolateral attachments. Notchplasty was not used. We used the Rigid-Fix system (Mitek, Norwood, Massachusetts) for femoral fixation, and bioabsorbable interference screws (Smith &amp; Nephew, London, United Kingdom) and staples were used for tibial side fixation.</p>

<title>MRI and Measurements</title>
<p>Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on a 1.5-T instrument (Intera Achieva, Philips Medical Systems, Eindhoven, the Netherlands), and proton density images were obtained in the sagittal, axial, and coronal planes. The repetition time (TR) of all imaging studies was 4000 milliseconds, and the echo time (TE) was 36 milliseconds. The field of view was 170 × 170 mm, and the matrix size was 400 × 319 pixels. The slice thickness was 3.5 mm for the sagittal and axial planes and 3 mm for the coronal plane. The MRI findings were reviewed retrospectively together by one musculoskeletal radiologist with 14 years of experience and one orthopaedic surgeon with 5 years of experience without knowledge of the preoperative MRI. When there was disagreement on the radiographic findings, a consensus opinion was obtained. All magnetic resonance images were randomly selected and repeatedly measured by both radiologist and orthopaedic surgeon for an interobserver reliability analysis. In the axial plane, the images at the knee joint level and 3.5 cm above the knee joint line were checked using Maroview (version 5.4, Marotech, Seoul, Korea). The semitendinosus and gracilis tendons were identified on both images and classified according to the presence or absence of regeneration. If regenerating tendons could not be visualized in any view, it was considered regeneration failure.</p>
<p>All magnetic resonance images were measured with commercially available picture archiving and communication system (PACS) software (Maroview, Marotech). The shift in the musculotendinous junction was examined in the coronal, axial, and sagittal planes and was measured using the distal-most muscle signal intensity of the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons in all 3 planes. The distance was measured on preoperative and postoperative MRI, and proximal and distal shifts were indicated as “+” and “–”, respectively. The shift of the distal insertion of the regenerated tendon was measured on coronal images. On the upper end, both the original tendon insertion and regenerated tendon insertion were measured and compared. The cross-sectional area of the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons on preoperative and postoperative MRI was evaluated at the joint line in the transaxial sequence.</p>

<sec id="section5-0363546511424134">
<title>Isokinetic Test</title>
<p>Isokinetic muscle strength was measured using a Biodex System III dynamometer (Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, New York). Isokinetic muscular strength tests were performed at both the common angles and at deeper knee flexions, classified as 0° to 90° (standard isokinetic muscle strength test in the sitting position) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546511424134">Figure 2A</xref>) and 60° to 120° (prone position isokinetic muscle strength test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546511424134">Figure 2B</xref>). To evaluate the standard isokinetic muscle strength in the sitting position, the patients were seated on the Biodex testing device with the chest, pelvis, and thigh immobilized with straps. After the range of motion of the knee joint in flexion and extension was measured, the flexion angle of the knee joint was adjusted to 0° to 90°. To measure the isokinetic muscle strength in the prone position, the knee joint was aligned with the axis of rotation, and the angle was adjusted to 60° to 120°. After the patient had warmed up and become familiar with the procedure, the measurements were repeated 4 times with an angular velocity of 60 deg/s. First, the contralateral side was measured, and then the affected side treated with ACL reconstruction was examined. The peak torque (the maximum value during the 4 repetitions) of flexor muscles was assessed, and the values of both knees were compared.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511424134">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546511424134">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546511424134">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546511424134">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0363546511424134">45</xref></sup> The flexor deficit in the isokinetic test was calculated as follows: (involved knee strength/uninvolved knee strength) × 100.</p>

<title>Functional Performance Tests</title>
<p>Before starting the functional testing session, each patient completed a standardized stretching exercise program for approximately 10 minutes. Then, 2 warm-up repetitions were performed before measurement. After the patient was warmed up and familiarized with the procedure, the measurements were repeated 3 times. The best score was chosen among results. For each test, the patient was asked to move as quickly as he or she thought was safe. Lephart et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546511424134">16</xref></sup> established the validity and reliability of the co-contraction, carioca, and shuttle run tests as measures for return to functional level and of the patient’s perception of knee function.</p>
<sec id="section7-0363546511424134">
<title>One-Legged Hop Test for Distance</title>
<p>The one-legged hop test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511424134">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546511424134">29</xref></sup> was performed 3 times for each leg, and the longest distance was used.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0363546511424134">
<title>Co-contraction Test</title>
<p>The co-contraction test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511424134">18</xref></sup> was performed by securing a heavy Velcro<sup>®</sup> (Manchester, New Hampshire) belt around the patient’s waist and attaching it to a heavy 48-inch length of rubber tubing with an outer diameter of 1 inch. The tubing was then anchored to a metal loop secured to a wall 60 inches above the floor. A semicircle was painted on the floor with a radius of 96 inches with the metal loop at the center. The patient stood facing the wall with the toes of his or her feet on the semicircle, which stretched the tubing 48 inches beyond its recoil length. The co-contraction test required each patient to complete 5 wall-to-wall traverses of the 180° semicircle with tension applied to the overstretched rubber tubing. The patients began the test on the right side of the semicircle, moving in a sidestep or shuffle fashion, completing the 5 lengths (3 lengths right to left, and 2 lengths left to right) in the shortest amount of time possible. This test was designed to reproduce the rotational forces at the knee, necessitating control of tibial translation by the thigh musculature.</p>

<sec id="section9-0363546511424134">
<title>Carioca Test</title>
<p>The carioca test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511424134">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511424134">18</xref></sup> required the patients to move laterally with a crossover step. The patient began by moving from left to right and then reversed direction, covering the distance in the shortest possible time. The carioca step involved crossing the right leg over in front of the left leg, followed by bringing the left leg back in position parallel to the right leg. The right leg was then crossed behind the left leg, and the left leg was brought back to a position parallel to the right. The test was performed over 2 lengths at a distance of 40 ft. The patients began moving from left to right and then reversed direction, retracing the initial 40-ft path, thus moving a total of 80 ft in the shortest amount of time possible. Although tested in a controlled environment, this test, if performed at high speeds, may result in subluxation of the tibia, which re-creates the pivot-shift phenomenon in an unstable knee.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511424134">18</xref></sup></p>

Each patient ran 20 ft, touched a line on the floor with his or her foot, reversed direction, returned to the starting point, touched the line, and repeated the process. The complete test covered 80 ft, with 3 changes in direction. This test was designed to reproduce acceleration and deceleration forces, which are common in athletic activity.</p>

<title>Rehabilitation</title>
<p>All patients underwent the same standardized rehabilitation protocol as a home-based exercise. We have our own sports medical rehabilitation center and also standard rehabilitation protocols for ACL-reconstructed patients. All patients received supervised physical therapy weekly at our sports medical center by sports therapists for 3 to 9 months after surgery. We received informed consent from the patients after informing them of the importance of rehabilitation before the operation. The patients are usually discharged at postoperative day 5 to 7. We regularly followed the patients in the outpatient clinic and set up protocol for rehabilitation. Patients’ compliance with the protocols and progressions were checked weekly at our sports medical center by sports therapists. A few days before surgery, the patients were instructed with immediate postoperative treatment. The patients were allowed tolerable weightbearing in full extended position with a brace locked for immediately after surgery. The patients were allowed full weightbearing with a brace unlocked 2 weeks after surgery. The goal for the patients was to gain full range of motion at 2 to 6 weeks after surgery. Closed kinetic chain exercises were started the day after surgery, and open kinetic leg curl exercises were started at 6 weeks after surgery. Isolated hamstring strengthening exercises were begun at 6 weeks after surgery. The patients performed 10 repetitions for each set with 3 sets for hamstring curl. Training for neuromuscular control, such as weight shifting and single leg balance on stable and unstable platforms, was started the day after surgery. A perturbation training program was started at 6 weeks after surgery. Running and side-cutting activities were allowed at 3 months, and a return to sports activities was permitted at 6 months after surgery.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The mean differences in the flexor strength and functional performance in the operated knee were compared among the 3 groups with the Kruskal-Wallis test and Conover multiple comparison test as a post hoc analysis. Correlation analysis was used to evaluate the relationships among the flexor strength and the number of regenerated hamstring tendons and functional performance using Spearman rank correlation. In addition, the correlations between the functional performance and flexion strength in the operated knee and the shifts in the musculotendinous junction of the regenerated tendon were evaluated. The Spearman correlation coefficients (ρ) were interpreted as follows: &gt;.5 indicated a large association; .3 to .5, a moderate association; and .1 to .3, a small association. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (version 16.0, SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois) and MedCalc software (version 11.3.2, Mariakerke, Belgium) for the post hoc analysis. To determine the interobserver variability, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated. Significance was set at <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05.</p>

There were no differences in demographic data (age, sex, and body mass index) among the 3 groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546511424134">Table 1</xref>). The interobserver variability of the MRI measurements was excellent for the range of the proximal shift of the musculotendinous junction for the semitendinosus tendon, with an ICC of .91, and for the gracilis tendon, with an ICC of .89. Intraclass correlation coefficients also show an excellent level of reliability for the mean shift of distal insertion of the regenerated tendons (.87) and the average cross-sectional areas of the regenerated tissues (semitendinosus, .87; gracilis, .86).</p>

<p>The musculotendinous junction shifted proximally by a mean of 4.39 ± 2.24 cm for the semitendinosus tendon and 3.09 ± 2.22 cm for the gracilis tendon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0363546511424134">Figure 6</xref>). In both regenerated tendons, the magnitude of the proximal shift of the musculotendinous junction was not correlated with a flexor deficit in the standard isokinetic test in the sitting position but was significantly correlated with flexor deficit in the prone position isokinetic test (Appendix 3, available online). However, the magnitude of the proximal shift of the musculotendinous junction was not correlated with functional performance when both tendons were regenerated (Appendix 4, available online). The mean shift of distal insertion of the regenerated tendons was 0.43 ± 0.76 cm distally. The average cross-sectional areas of the regenerated tissues for the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons were 0.14 ± 0.07 cm<sup>2</sup> and 0.08 ± 0.03 cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively, and on the preoperative MRI were 0.13 ± 0.04 cm<sup>2</sup> and 0.07 ± 0.02 cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Thus, no significant difference in the measured cross-sectional area was observed between the preoperative and postoperative MRI. Therefore, we found that the regenerated tendon was similar to those of the preoperative knees regarding the size of the tendon. However, the tibial insertion of the regenerated tendon shifted distally, and the musculotendinous junction shifted proximally. The angle of flexion at which peak torque was generated decreased by 22.3° ± 7.5° to 21.0° ± 4.6° in the standard isokinetic test and by 75.0° ± 3.6° to 70.7° ± 3.8° in the prone position isokinetic test after semitendinosus and gracilis tendon harvest.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study investigated flexor strength and functional performance according to the number of regenerated hamstring tendons, the relationships between the flexor strength and functional performance in the operated knee, and the magnitude of the proximal shift of the musculotendinous junction after hamstring regeneration. We hypothesized that the flexor strength and functional performance of the regenerated tendon after hamstring harvest for ACL reconstruction could recover and that the magnitude of the proximal shift of the musculotendinous junction after hamstring regeneration influenced the recovery of flexor strength and functional performance.</p>
<p>The principal findings of this study were that the flexor strength differed according to the degree of regeneration in both the standard and prone position isokinetic tests. The number of regenerated hamstring tendons was correlated with the results of the standard isokinetic test. However, among the functional performance tests, the number of regenerated hamstring tendons was correlated with only carioca test results. The proximal shift of the musculotendinous junction correlated with the flexor deficit in the prone position isokinetic test.</p>
<p>Cross et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511424134">5</xref></sup> first reported the regeneration of the once-harvested semitendinosus and gracilis tendons in 1992. Tadokoro et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0363546511424134">42</xref></sup> observed regeneration of the semitendinosus tendon on MRI in 79% of cases, whereas that of the gracilis tendon was observed in 46% of cases. The regeneration rates in our study were 80% and 75.6% for the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons, respectively. In 2007, Nikolaou et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546511424134">28</xref></sup> reported that in the literature, regeneration of the hamstring tendons occurred in 146 of 164 patients (89%); this rate was similar to ours. Our regeneration rate for the gracilis tendon was higher than reported previously. This may have been because of the characteristics of our technique, involving a delicate reverse L-shaped incision and preservation of the sartorius fascia to protect the regenerating tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546511424134">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Several studies have reported that the regenerated semitendinosus and gracilis tendons were not denervated and could function as knee flexors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511424134">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511424134">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0363546511424134">43</xref></sup> Using electromyography (EMG), Cross et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511424134">5</xref></sup> studied the semitendinosus and gracilis muscles of 4 patients after harvesting their tendons and reported that the semitendinosus muscle in 3 patients and the gracilis muscle in all 4 patients showed no significant decrease in EMG activity. Recently, Takeda et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0363546511424134">43</xref></sup> evaluated hamstring muscle activation by measuring the increase in the T2 relaxation time using MRI. They reported that the contractile capability of the semitendinosus and gracilis muscles was maintained or restored after harvesting these tendons for ACL reconstruction, regardless of the degree of regeneration. These studies indicated that the regenerated semitendinosus and gracilis muscles are activated during knee flexion.</p>
<p>The majority of studies have shown the satisfactory recovery of isokinetic knee flexor strength after ACL reconstruction using the hamstring tendons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546511424134">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546511424134">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546511424134">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0363546511424134">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0363546511424134">46</xref></sup> However, more recent studies have indicated that harvesting the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons significantly reduced the strength profile of knee flexion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546511424134">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546511424134">31</xref></sup> In addition, studies found a more significant decrease in strength at positions of 70° or more of flexion, excluding compensation by the biceps femoris.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546511424134">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546511424134">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0363546511424134">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0363546511424134">44</xref></sup> In our study, the angle of flexion at which peak torque was generated decreased by 22.3° ± 7.5° to 21.0° ± 4.6° in the standard isokinetic test and by 75.0° ± 3.6° to 70.7° ± 3.8° in the prone position isokinetic test after semitendinosus and gracilis tendon harvest. We measured 85% flexor strength in the standard isokinetic test and 78% flexor torque in the prone position isokinetic test, which were similar to the 91.3% and 78.8%, respectively, reported by Nakamura et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546511424134">27</xref></sup> These findings represent significant knee flexion weakness after hamstring harvesting, especially in deep knee flexion.</p>
<p>The knee flexion weakness at greater flexion angles can be partly explained by the more proximal musculotendinous junction of the neotendon. Nakamae et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546511424134">25</xref></sup> reported that the musculotendinous junction of the semitendinosus tendon shifted 7.3 ± 2.0 cm proximally 6 months after surgery and 7.1 ± 1.9 cm proximally 12 months after surgery in comparison with the contralateral side based on the results of a 3-dimensional computed tomography analysis. A significant correlation was observed between the flexor deficit and the proximal shift of the musculotendinous junction 6 months postoperatively, whereas the proximal shift did not affect the peak torque ratio 12 months postoperatively. In our study, the musculotendinous junction of the semitendinosus tendon shifted 4.43 ± 2.68 cm proximally, and that of the gracilis tendon shifted 3.84 ± 3.10 cm proximally in comparison with the preoperative MRI. Interestingly, no significant correlations were found between flexion strength in the standard isokinetic test and the proximal shift of the musculotendinous junction of the semitendinosus or gracilis tendons and the knee. However, Nakamae et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546511424134">25</xref></sup> performed the knee flexion strength tests at an acute angle, where there is compensation by the biceps femoris or semimembranosus hypertrophy, making it difficult to evaluate the precise hamstring flexion deficit. Because the semitendinosus and gracilis muscles play greater roles at greater angles of flexion,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546511424134">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546511424134">33</xref></sup> Nakamae et al may have missed significant weakness at deeper knee flexion angles. Therefore, we examined the flexion deficit at angles over 75°, at which point the semitendinosus and gracilis muscles are strongly engaged, and found a significant correlation between the proximal shift of the musculotendinous junction and the flexor deficit in the prone position isokinetic test after hamstring harvesting.</p>
<p>Several previous studies indicated a proximal shift of the site of tibial insertion of the regenerated tendon,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511424134">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546511424134">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0363546511424134">40</xref></sup> and McFadyen and Carnahan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546511424134">24</xref></sup> suggested that this phenomenon may lead to a decrease in knee flexion strength because of shortening of the moment arm. However, in the present study, the insertion of the regenerating tendon had migrated to a location distal to the original site. In addition, no significant difference in the measured cross-sectional area was observed between the preoperative and postoperative MRI in our study. Tadokoro et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0363546511424134">42</xref></sup> reported that no significant difference in the measured cross-sectional area was observed between the operated and nonoperated knees. This result was similar to ours. In our study, we also found that the regenerated tendon was similar to those of the preoperative knees regarding the size of the tendon. However, the tibial insertion of the regenerated tendon shifted distally, and the musculotendinous junction shifted proximally. A few studies have examined the relationship between hamstring tendon regeneration and flexor strength. Eriksson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511424134">7</xref></sup> and Hioki et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511424134">11</xref></sup> compared strength in patients with regenerated and nonregenerated tendons and found no difference in the peak torque strength during isokinetic knee flexion. However, the peak torque is now known to be a less sensitive measure of semitendinosus and gracilis dysfunctions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546511424134">2</xref></sup> Tadokoro et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0363546511424134">42</xref></sup> reported no correlation between morphological regeneration and the recovery of hamstring strength, which was assessed in each of the 3 groups defined by the amount of regenerated tissue. Although a substantial deficit was seen in all patients who had undergone semitendinosus tendon harvest, no difference between regenerators and nonregenerators was observed. However, flexor strength and knee functional performance may differ according to the degree of hamstring tendon regeneration, as the regenerated hamstring tendon can function as a knee flexor and has restored contractile capability.</p>
<p>The relationship between flexor strength and the degree of tendon regeneration has not been defined fully. Unfortunately, most studies have reported the change in flexor strength after harvesting the hamstring tendons without considering hamstring regeneration. To our knowledge, ours is the first study to examine the differences in flexor strengths in an isokinetic test according to the number of regenerated hamstring tendons using MRI. We found that the flexor deficit was greater in the no-regenerated tendon group (N group) than in the groups in which both the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons (SG group) or only 1 tendon (group O) had regenerated. In the no-regeneration group (N group), considerable flexor deficits of 32.8% and 37.4% were observed in the standard and hyperflexion isokinetic tests, respectively. In the present study, a significant correlation was observed between the flexor deficit in the standard isokinetic test and the number of regenerated hamstring tendons. The function of the hamstring tendon is more important when the knee is flexed markedly or slightly,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511424134">6</xref></sup> and forceful contraction at a higher flexion angle is rarely required, with the exception of specific actions in athletic activities. The flexor deficit in the standard isokinetic test may affect the function of the hamstring tendons. Furthermore, we postulate that the number of regenerated hamstring tendons is associated with the function of the hamstring tendons.</p>
<p>Although flexor weakness was more prominent in deep flexion angle in our results, there was no correlation between the number of regenerated tendons and the prone position isokinetic test. We received informed consent about methods of isokinetic muscle strength testing, and patients performed 2 warm-up repetitions before measurement. However, they were not familiar with the isokinetic test, especially the prone position. Therefore, prone position isokinetic testing may have had more measurement error. Another reason for this discrepancy may be that the prone position isokinetic test has greater standard deviation than the standard isokinetic test. We also assume that the small sample size in O and N groups would have influenced the results.</p>
<p>Although the primary function of the hamstring muscles is to flex the knee or to decelerate extension of the knee, the hamstring muscles also regulate rotation of the tibia and, more importantly, control anterior translation of the tibia, sharing the stress with the ACL. To evaluate hamstring muscle function, we assessed functional performance using the co-contraction, carioca, shuttle run, and one-legged hop tests for distance. Lephart et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511424134">18</xref></sup> described 3 objective functional performance tests: the co-contraction, carioca, and shuttle run tests. They demonstrated that these tests were objective measures of the functional capabilities in ACL-insufficient athletes and provided a basis for determining an athlete’s readiness to return to sports activity. The co-contraction test is designed to reproduce the rotational forces at the knee, necessitating control of tibial translation. The shuttle run test reproduces the acceleration and deceleration forces that are common to athletic activities. The carioca test reproduces the pivot-shift phenomenon in the ACL-insufficient knee. The one-legged hop test for distance is designed to test strength as well as confidence in the tested leg,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546511424134">37</xref></sup> which correlates positively with muscular strength.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546511424134">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our results showed significant differences on the carioca test result among the 3 groups. Although functional performance increased with the number of regenerated hamstring tendons, the number of regenerated tendons was correlated only with the carioca test results. In our study, although KT-2000 arthrometer side-to-side difference was not significantly different among the 3 groups, difference of mean side-to-side difference was more than 1 mm between groups SG and N. Patel et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546511424134">35</xref></sup> reported that absolute knee laxity difference did not correlate with dynamic knee function as assessed by gait analysis. The other studies have shown no relationship between knee laxity and functional performance test or functional outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511424134">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546511424134">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0363546511424134">41</xref></sup> Therefore, we consider that mean side-to-side differences among the 3 groups have little effect on functional performance tests. In our patients, the pivot-shift test result was grade 0 in 38 and grade 1 in 7. There were no patients with a pivot-shift test result greater than grade 1. Although significant differences among the 3 groups with the carioca test were found, there were no significant differences with the pivot-shift test. The pivot-shift test is the only manual test that correlates with subjective knee function such as giving way, activity limitation, and patient satisfaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511424134">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546511424134">14</xref></sup> The pivot-shift test was performed in an unconstrained and muscle-relaxed state. However, the pivot shift in sports activity has a complex and dynamic nature. The functional performance test was done in a constrained, conditioned environment with dynamic muscle activity. The difference of results between the pivot-shift and carioca tests can be partly explained by these reasons.</p>
<p>All the patients in this study were male patients because the gender differences can influence the outcome of the study about muscle strength and functional performance tests. Lephart et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511424134">15</xref></sup> reported that female patients also had significantly less peak torque to body mass for the quadriceps and hamstring than male patients. Segawa et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546511424134">38</xref></sup> reported that the preoperative weakness of the involved limb in extension and internal rotation recovered in the male patients but not in the female patients after postoperative rehabilitation. Gobbi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511424134">8</xref></sup> reported that female athletes had significantly greater laxity, and isokinetic tests at 1 year revealed a significantly higher deficit of peak torque at 60 deg/s in flexion and extension. Therefore, we excluded female patients from our study.</p>
<p>Several limitations of this study should be noted. First, selection bias may have affected our study because we included only patients who underwent both MRI and functional performance testing. However, our study took into account all the patients satisfying inclusion and exclusion criteria. In addition, we analyzed the study group to show that it does not differ from the entire population. We believe this selection bias has little influence on the results. Second, we did not evaluate the differences between subgroups in which only one tendon regenerated, that is, only the semitendinosus or only the gracilis tendon. A third limitation is the personal variation in the rehabilitation status after ACL reconstruction despite our efforts to standardize the rehabilitation protocol. We found that flexor weakness occurred after hamstring harvesting, and it could have affected the pivot-shift phenomenon. In addition, if no tendon regenerated, the knee flexor strength would be decreased at both standard and prone position isokinetic tests. In light of our results, harvesting only the semitendinosus tendon is a surgical alternative to be considered that may preserve knee flexor strength and prevent adverse effects, such as the pivot-shift phenomenon, although this possibility was not directly investigated in this study.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>After harvesting for ACL reconstruction, the hamstring tendons regenerated in a high proportion of our patients. The flexor strength in both the standard and prone position isokinetic tests differed in the 3 groups. The number of regenerated hamstring tendons was significantly correlated with the carioca test results. Proximal shifting of the musculotendinous junction was significantly correlated with the flexor deficit in the prone position isokinetic test.</p>
