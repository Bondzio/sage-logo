<p>The authors of the article titled “Differentiating Low Performance of the Gifted Learner: Achieving, Underachieving, and Selective Consuming Students” investigated whether there were significant differences in academic self-perception and thinking styles across three groups of gifted learners. To do so, they relied heavily on a distinction put forward by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1932202X12438718">Delisle (1992)</xref> that gifted students fall into one of three groups: achievers, underachievers, or selective consumers. I was pleased to see this distinction applied because I believe it recognizes a key difference in students who have demonstrated high academic aptitude but who for different reasons do not perform equally high on measures of academic achievement (so-called underachievers).</p>
<p>The authors present a comprehensive and well-written review of the theory surrounding underachievement. In fact, I believe that the position and literature presented on this topic should be sufficient to make all researchers interested in underachievement think twice about how to classify these students as well as how to plan appropriate interventions. At the same time, I was surprised that the authors did not reference some of the work reflecting skepticism regarding the concept of learning styles. There has been substantial debate on this topic over the last decade (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1932202X12438718">Pashler, McDaniel, Rohrer, &amp; Bjork, 2008</xref>), and the potential limitations of learning styles or thinking styles may help explain the lack of significance found regarding group differences in the present study. This could also be due to the authors’ referenced deficiencies in the Thinking Styles Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1932202X12438718">Black &amp; McCoach, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1932202X12438718">McCoach &amp; Siegle, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1932202X12438718">Sternberg &amp; Wagner, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1932202X12438718">Zhang &amp; Sternberg, 2006</xref>). The moderate internal consistency estimates observed for this measure would make comparisons using the subscales (or summations of the subscales, for example, Type I, Type II, etc) difficult.</p>
<p>Regarding the authors’ analysis of thinking styles (Type I, Type II, Type III) across the three groups, I found myself continually wondering why we as educators or researchers should expect gifted individuals in general or in any of these three groups to have a consistent preference for Type I. Certainly, the characteristics cited regarding Type I styles do show some overlap with typical gifted characteristics, but I believe that this is a narrow perception of talent. As I read the piece, I found myself wondering whether the issue is that most gifted students are Type I whereas schools tend to be Type II or III, or if it is simply a matter of general disconnect or disharmony. I could imagine a very bright student who is more of a “Type II student” who has the bad luck of being in a classroom with a teacher who is more of a “Type I instructor.” Would this mismatch not be equally likely to cause underachievement? Perhaps the focus should be more on whether there is such a disconnect, as opposed to the particular kinds of thinking styles themselves—if they exist as measurable individual characteristics in the first place.</p>
<p>Such a disconnect could also exist with regard to either content or process (i.e., thinking style) in a given classroom. The term <italic>underachievement</italic> in general carries with it an implied assumption that the area in which a student is not achieving is worth achieving at in the first place. Although most educators would likely agree that typical academic content areas of math, science, and language arts are critical when it comes to academic achievement, a perceptual disconnect in this regard could also cause what is often termed underachievement. This seems to fit well with the authors’ discussion of selective consumerism. If a student in my classroom does not value what I am teaching (content) or see a reason to achieve in this particular area (relevance), then he or she is likely to underachieve regardless of my teaching style (process). This is the very heart of the expectancy-value theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1932202X12438718">Wigfield, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1932202X12438718">Wigfield &amp; Eccles, 2000</xref>). Although the authors of the present article discuss the academic self-efficacy component of this theory, I believe the value part of the equation is equally if not more important, especially in an age where so many different outlets are vying for students’ attention. This lack of value aimed toward academic areas does not inherently mean there is something wrong with the student—far from it. I believe we should encourage students to actively evaluate what they are being taught, even if it leads some of them to determine that what we are teaching is not as valuable as we would like. That being said, I fully concede that if my teaching style were more engaging, it is possible that the student could begin to value my content area. After all, part of teaching is being a used car salesman—establishing value where earlier none was perceived as being present.</p>
<p>This discussion of the value perceived by students regarding their education should not be taken lightly. As outlined in expectancy-value theory, even if a student believes he or she could do very well at a task (high expectancy), he or she is not likely to engage in that task unless there is some degree of value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1932202X12438718">Wigfield, 1994</xref>). Even if a student truly enjoys a given topic (say math), values it highly, and is very skilled at it, if that topic is presented at far lower levels than at which the student is ready, the perceived value is likely to be negligible. Still, because this student has potential but is not performing (why should he?), common definitions would call him an underachiever. Herein lies the rationale for the distinction between underachievers and selective consumers. In one sense, I would argue that some selective consumers are actually at higher levels of cognitive development (positive disintegration, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1932202X12438718">Dąbrowski, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1932202X12438718">Piechowski, 2006</xref>). They have higher or at least average levels of self-efficacy in a given domain, but have either made the conscious decision that the content is not worth “playing the game” for or made the cost-benefit analysis and decided that their time is better spent on alternate activities. Such action would also put them more in-line with Kohlberg’s postconventional stage of moral development where simply “playing the game” (or acting and performing according to social norms/what the teacher wants) is no longer what directs student behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1932202X12438718">Crain, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>I believe that the analysis and discussion of these disconnects and the underachievement distinction are the greatest takeaways from this article, even beyond the actual study results. I believe the data analysis used in the present study made perfect sense for the given research questions. I was happy to see the post hoc univariate comparisons with regard to both dependent variables, as the multivariate analyses would have provided few answers on their own. I believe the greatest weakness of the study relates to the sample. As the authors concede in their limitations, the sample was from a very narrow population and was especially small. This is not terribly unusual in education research (particularly in gifted education research), but I do agree with the authors that it does limit the generalizability and utility of their findings.</p>
<p>The only point of confusion I had dealt with the academic ranking. I understood why it was used as a variable, although I agree with the authors that it was not a perfect system. My confusion dealt with what this ranking was, how it was established, and whether it was domain specific. Given the emphasis on selective consumerism, I think that domain-specific talent and performance is even more important here than in studies that look more generally at underachievement as a single category or domain. If a student does not see the value in learning poetry in his or her language arts class, or just the same if there is a disconnect between the learning style of the student and the teaching style of the teacher, and this causes the particular student to underachieve (be a selective consumer) in poetry, this does not mean he or she is a global underachiever in all other areas. For this reason, using an academic ranking akin to class rank in American high schools would be inappropriate. Again a major take away from this article is that it brings to the discussion the issue of domain-specific underachievement, especially within the group of students called selective consumers.</p>
<p>I am afraid that I do not see major implications for K-12 school practice from this study. As a self-professed snob when it comes to research methods, I believe the sample used by the authors represents a fatal flaw. Yes, small-scale pilot studies are important, but I believe the results and discussion present in the article go beyond what the sample and methods support. I praise the authors for following-up on several consistent qualitative studies with a more-structured quantitative investigation, but because I was so interested in the topic and excited to see some distinction between traditional underachievers and selective consumers, I was disappointed that they did not use a larger, more diverse, and more geographically representative sample. I tend to think that studies conducted in other countries or with samples that inherently do not generalize easily to American schools, but are nonetheless published in American journals, have the added burden of needing to establish generalizability. I am afraid that I do not see the sample, due both in size and in make up, allowing for broad generalizations or implications for practice to American schools. However, I do believe that the theoretical structure of the piece, its distinction among groups of gifted students, and its desire to empirically test commonly held assumptions and previous qualitative findings are laudable and should be emulated by other researchers in the future.</p>
