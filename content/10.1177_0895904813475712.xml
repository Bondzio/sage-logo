<abstract>
<p>No Child Left Behind (NCLB) requires that two accountability strategies—raising standards and public pressure through publicizing performance data—be implemented simultaneously. However, when coupled, they may produce an inappropriate consequence for public opinion. The public may misunderstand the drop in achievement that occurs when the bar is raised and become dissatisfied with school performance. To examine this potential negative consequence, the authors analyze data from New York City. The authors find parent satisfaction declined when school performance grades dropped after the implementation of higher standards. This article contributes to our understanding of how the public responds to school accountability data. Because public support for sustained and successful reforms is key, understanding how accountability policies may erode support is critical.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>One need not look far to find criticism of our public education system. In response, schools and districts today are often a flurry with reform initiatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0895904813475712">Hess, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0895904813475712">Tyack &amp; Cuban, 1995</xref>). While previous works documented that the volume of reform activity can have negative consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0895904813475712">Bryk, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0895904813475712">Hess, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0895904813475712">Tyack &amp; Cuban, 1995</xref>), it is also important to examine whether specific combinations of reforms also result in perverse consequences. Spurred by No Child Left Behind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0895904813475712">NCLB, 2002</xref>), states today are often implementing multiple accountability reform strategies. In particular, two popular accountability reforms aimed at improving achievement are (a) disseminating accountability data to foster greater public oversight, and (b) raising the bar to spur continuous improvement. Whereas research indicates that these strategies can increase student test scores, less work has examined whether and how these strategies influence public opinion about school quality. Moreover, because these two strategies rest on fundamentally different theories of action, the potential for the strategies to collide and create perverse effects on public opinion of school quality seems to exist. In this article, we take up this issue to examine whether such a collision is a real possibility.</p>
<p>The first accountability strategy is to publicize school accountability data. Because education is a public good, the public holds its schools accountable for their performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0895904813475712">McDonnell, 2000</xref>) and seeks information regarding progress and performance in order to make a judgment about how well this public institution is performing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0895904813475712">Figlio &amp; Loeb, 2011</xref>). In order to improve the public’s ability to hold its schools accountable, policy makers have increasingly called for more public information on school performance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0895904813475712">Duncan, 2010</xref>). Report cards, which are regular efforts to collect and disseminate performance data to external audiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0895904813475712">Gormley &amp; Weimer, 1999</xref>, p. 3), have grown in popularity and are now mandated by NCLB. Research indicates that parents use data to select schools and to apply pressure on schools of choice by exit or threat of exit when school quality is poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0895904813475712">Hanushek, Kain, Rivkin, &amp; Branch, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0895904813475712">Hastings, VanWeelden, &amp; Weinstein, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The second accountability strategy involves setting rigorous achievement goals that are adjusted periodically. By raising the bar, schools that reach previously established targets must continue to strive for higher levels of achievement, thus fostering continuous improvement. This strategy to improve performance builds on a voluminous body of literature on motivation from industrial and organizational psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0895904813475712">Locke &amp; Latham, 2006</xref>). Education research suggests that when applied to schools, this strategy too leads to increased student achievement as measured by student test scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0895904813475712">Carnoy &amp; Loeb, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0895904813475712">Dee &amp; Jacob, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0895904813475712">Hanushek &amp; Raymond, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to influencing student achievement, it is plausible that the two above accountability strategies collide to produce a corrosive long-term consequence for public opinion. When the bar is raised, many schools experience a drop in achievement, as they are required to reach a new, higher standard. When both strategies are implemented together, this decline is made highly public through accountability report cards, and, quite possibly, the public may misunderstand the drop in achievement. The resulting public dissatisfaction with decreased achievement may wrongly erode public satisfaction with the public schools, ultimately hindering public support for future reform. Whether these policies, when implemented in combination, can have this negative feedback affect on public opinion is not well understood, despite calls to expand the field’s understanding of how accountability policies influence public perception of schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0895904813475712">Jacobsen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0895904813475712">McDonnell, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The identification of possible negative feedback is necessary because satisfaction is an important predictor of the public’s willingness to increase funding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0895904813475712">Glaser &amp; Hildreth, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0895904813475712">Simonsen &amp; Robbins, 2003</xref>) and remain engaged in democratic participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0895904813475712">Lyons &amp; Lowery, 1986</xref>). While both accountability strategies have proven effective when examined solely in terms of their impact on student achievement as measured by standardized test scores, we believe it is important to consider how accountability strategies may have broader influence, including altering public perceptions of school quality.</p>
<p>To examine whether our suggested concern is warranted, we first describe the underlying theories of action for school improvement for each accountability strategy and highlight key research findings for each strategy. We include details regarding the specific implementation of each strategy in New York City (NYC), which we use as an exemplar case study. Then, we explain the potential dilemma created by pursuing both strategies simultaneously by drawing upon public administration and political science literatures, which describe the unique role that public support plays in maintaining effective public institutions. Using data from NYC we examine how public opinion responds to these two strategies and find that when NYC raised the bar on schools, which resulted in a drop in the highly publicized letter grades assigned to schools, parent satisfaction with school quality declined. We conclude with a discussion of the potential implications for this finding and offer some suggestions for future research. In doing so, this article makes an important contribution to our understanding of how school accountability strategies affect not only test scores but also public perceptions of school performance.</p>

<title>Pursuing Multiple Accountability Strategies</title>
<p>Many school districts are working vigorously to respond to multiple accountability strategies aimed at improving student performance outcomes, often without consideration to how the strategies may have other consequences beyond the intended impact on school performance. The two strategies examined here are (a) the strategy of public pressure to making school accountability data highly visible to foster public accountability, and (b) the strategy of raising the bar or increasing target performance standards for schools to foster continuous improvement.</p>
<sec id="section3-0895904813475712">
<title>The Strategy of Public Pressure: Public Dissemination of Data</title>
<p>With U.S. school districts spending approximately US$500 billion annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0895904813475712">U.S. Department of Education, 2011</xref>), it is not surprising that the public wants to be informed about how effectively schools spend this money. Since public education is a democratically run public institution, the average citizen makes important decisions about whether, and to what degree, to support it. Successful school reform often requires broad public support not only from students and teachers but also taxpayers, employers, and parents. Without this public support, schools may be viewed as “institutions alien or hostile to local interests” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0895904813475712">Plank &amp; Boyd, 1994</xref>, p. 277). Therefore, as Plank and Boyd argue, in order to be successful, policy makers must seek to provide greater opportunities for the public to participate in school governance. To this end, publicly available school report cards have become a critical component of school accountability systems. NCLB requires schools to create and provide data because without such information the public often lacks the knowledge needed to make an informed judgment. Making school accountability data publicly available enables parents and other interested citizens to become engaged, ask pointed questions about school performance, and, if needed, pressure schools to improve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0895904813475712">McDonnell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0895904813475712">Mintrom, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0895904813475712">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0895904813475712">Weiss, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0895904813475712">Wong, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Today’s accountability policies along with technological advancements, have made school performance data widely available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0895904813475712">Manna, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0895904813475712">Peterson, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0895904813475712">Reese, 2005</xref>). Although school report cards have become widespread and can be quickly and easily googled by any interested citizen, we have limited research documenting their impact on public perception and behavior. A small, but growing, body of research on public response to public data demonstrates that data can shape public actions. For example, school accountability data positively influence housing valuations, pushing them higher in locations where measured school quality is high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0895904813475712">Black &amp; Machin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0895904813475712">Figlio &amp; Lucas, 2004</xref>). Furthermore, families are attracted to, and retained by, higher-performing districts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0895904813475712">Black &amp; Machin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0895904813475712">Figlio &amp; Lucas, 2004</xref>). People also use performance data when choosing schools for their children, often selecting schools with higher achievement levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0895904813475712">Hastings et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0895904813475712">Hausman &amp; Goldring, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0895904813475712">Holme, 2002</xref>). It appears that public data can influence public perception and action.</p>

<title>Implementing the strategy of public pressure in NYC</title>
<p>The NYC Board of Education reports each school’s performance every fall through the NYC Progress Reports, as they are known. Similar to letter grades that students receive to assess their performance, the NYC Progress Report provides letter grades—A through F—to evaluate each school’s performance. Schools receive an overall letter grade as well as an environment, student performance, and student progress grade. These progress reports are sent home with students and are available online through the NYC Department of Education website.</p>
<p>NYC’s Chancellor, Mayor, and Chief Accountability Officer have all been explicit about the “public information tool” role that progress reports play in their accountability system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0895904813475712">Medina &amp; Gebeloff, 2008</xref>, p. 39). Indeed, as James Liebman, former Chief Accountability Officer for NYC schools, stated when the first set of progress reports were released in 2007, “The purpose of grading these schools and making those grades public . . . is to generate pressure to get them [the schools] moving forward, to improve” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0895904813475712">Finn, 2007</xref>, p. 4).</p>

<title>The Strategy of Raising the Bar: Motivation and Goal Setting</title>
<p>In addition to the above strategy, NCLB also requires clear and rigorous goals for schools that are periodically updated to foster continuous improvement. This strategy is built upon a large body of research from the field of industrial and organizational psychology where researchers investigate influences on workplace productivity. Beginning in the late 1960s, researchers investigated the relationship between goal setting and increased productivity. “Developed over a 25-year period, based on some 400 laboratory and field studies” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0895904813475712">Locke &amp; Latham, 2006</xref>, p. 265), goal-setting theory is considered by many to be the dominant theory of employee motivation in the field of industrial and organizational psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0895904813475712">Perry, Mesch, &amp; Paarlberg, 2006</xref>). Quite simply, the theory posits that drawing attention to a stated goal when an employee is trying to complete a task affects one’s action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0895904813475712">Locke &amp; Latham, 2002</xref>). Research testing this theory in both experimental laboratory settings and in the field has demonstrated repeatedly the powerful, positive influence that goal setting has on motivation and productivity because goals direct the attention, effort, and actions of the worker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0895904813475712">Locke &amp; Latham, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In particular, research on goal-setting theory establishes the critical role that setting high (or challenging) goals can have on productivity and motivation. The primary finding highlighted in reviews of goal-setting research is that “the more difficult the goal, the greater the achievement” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0895904813475712">Locke, 1996</xref>). In experimental settings, participants who were told to “do their best” or those who were given no specific goal for a task were consistently outperformed by participants who were given specific and challenging goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0895904813475712">Perry et al., 2006</xref>). While there are certainly limits (goals must be reasonably attainable), the link between goals and performance becomes even more pronounced when goals are challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0895904813475712">Locke, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, research on school-level responses to accountability policies demonstrates that goal-setting policies changed organizational behaviors and resulted in higher levels of student performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0895904813475712">Linn, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, to promote continuous growth, districts and state leaders continue to raise expectations so that goals remain challenging. In response to this accountability strategy, schools increased funding directed toward instructional and curricular reform activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0895904813475712">Chiang, 2009</xref>), lengthened the time devoted to instruction in key performance areas, and focused specifically on low-achieving students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0895904813475712">Rouse, Hannaway, Goldhaber, &amp; Figlio, 2007</xref>). Individual teachers also responded to higher standards by aligning their curricular plans and focusing more heavily on activities (like tests) that would improve outcomes measured by accountability policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0895904813475712">Firestone, Mayrowetz, &amp; Fairman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0895904813475712">Louis, Febey, &amp; Schroeder, 2005</xref>). Cumulatively, research suggests school leaders and teachers focused their work in ways that increased student performance on measured outcomes because, as the theory suggests, individuals direct their efforts toward accomplishing the clear and challenging goal provided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0895904813475712">Carnoy &amp; Loeb, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0895904813475712">Chiang, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0895904813475712">Dee &amp; Jacob, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0895904813475712">Hanushek &amp; Raymond, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0895904813475712">Rouse et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section6-0895904813475712">
<title>Raising the bar in NYC</title>
<p>In NYC’s case, policy makers utilized goal-setting theory to set clear goals for schools by laying out the requirements for receiving an “A” on their progress reports. Moreover, both New York State and NYC continue to revise their standards and goals to ensure they remain challenging. Specifically, after 97% of schools earned top grades (an A or B) in 2009, then chancellor Klein announced that the city would raise the bar and revise their progress report grading formula to motivate schools to achieve even more. Thus far, education leaders in NYC have been pleased with the results of this strategy. As former chief accountability officer Mr. Lieberman noted in one press interview, “We’ve seen that the setting of targets or lines have a substantial effect on schools’ efforts to achieve outcomes with their students” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0895904813475712">Medina &amp; Gebeloff, 2008</xref>, p. 29).</p>

<sec id="section7-0895904813475712">
<title>Collision of Strategies: The Potential Erosion of Public Perception of Schools</title>
<p>In one review of goal-setting theory, the authors note that goal setting “may face unique challenges in the public sector” and that “limited application of goal setting theory exists in empirical research on employee motivation in public settings” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0895904813475712">Perry et al., 2006</xref>, p. 510). Reliance on public support is one unique challenge public institutions, such as education, face. Public institutions derive their legitimacy and funding from the electorate, making them particularly sensitive to public satisfaction. Unlike private settings where goal attainment data often remain internal to the organization, public education is accountable to the people; thus, publicizing these goal attainment data is a logical feature of accountability policies today.</p>
<p>Declining satisfaction is a major source of concern for the health of public institutions. Although some public skepticism is healthy in democratically controlled institutions, too much can be harmful. While low satisfaction may lead some to become more engaged in their local schools, it is also possible that declining satisfaction leads some to disengage and withdraw support, eventually placing public institutions at risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0895904813475712">Donahue &amp; Miller, 2006</xref>). Extant research, unfortunately, more often demonstrates the latter. In the field of public administration, research demonstrates that a high level of satisfaction with government is an important predictor of support for increased funding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0895904813475712">Glaser &amp; Hildreth, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0895904813475712">Simonsen &amp; Robbins, 2003</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0895904813475712">Figlio and Kenny (2009)</xref> found that schools receiving low performance evaluations risked losing public donations. Satisfaction with public services also forms a basis for citizen trust in government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0895904813475712">Van Ryzin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0895904813475712">Van Ryzin, Muzzio, Immerwahr, Gulick, &amp; Martinez, 2004</xref>). Lower levels of trust and satisfaction lead to negative consequences for democratic participation, such as individuals leaving a jurisdiction or feeling there is little point to participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0895904813475712">Lyons &amp; Lowery, 1986</xref>). While these issues in public education may unfold differently, the potential exists for declining satisfaction to have deleterious implications for schools’ ability, as a public institution, to build support both abstractly through citizen trust as well as in more concrete monetary ways for further reform and improvement.</p>
<p>In the following section, we utilize publicly available data from NYC to examine this concern. Using the letter grades assigned to public schools in 2009 and 2010 and corresponding parental satisfaction surveys, we examine whether colliding accountability reform strategies influenced reported parental satisfaction levels with school performance.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0895904813475712">
<title>Data</title>
<p>Data available for this analysis are at the school level. Thus, we are able to examine how parent perception at the school level is related to changes in the progress report grade. We restrict our analysis to elementary schools in NYC with at least two of the three upper elementary grades that are tested annually (third, fourth, and fifth). We excluded combined K-8 schools because satisfaction with middle schools may be fundamentally different than satisfaction with elementary schools and their curricula are more varied, thus potentially skewing the overall ratings of these schools. Furthermore, low response rates may be highly unrepresentative of actual school satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0895904813475712">Charbonneau &amp; Van Ryzin, 2011</xref>) in ways that are unpredictable. One can imagine a scenario where the most dissatisfied parents felt so disillusioned that they were <italic>less</italic> likely to complete the parental survey resulting in an inflated school-level satisfaction rating. However, it is equally plausible that the most dissatisfied parents welcomed the opportunity to voice their concerns and were thus <italic>more</italic> likely to complete the survey. This would result in a depressed school-level satisfaction rating. Because we cannot identify which of the two possibilities exists, we excluded schools with a response rate lower than 30% in both 2009 and 2010. The average response rate for all schools in 2010 was 49% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0895904813475712">NYC Department of Education, 2011c</xref>). These restrictions resulted in a final sample of 542 elementary schools (including traditional public schools and charter schools) with an average response rate of 66% in 2009 and 68% in 2010. For each elementary school in our sample, school-level data were collected from public sources and these data are detailed below.</p>
<sec id="section9-0895904813475712">
<title>Dependent Variable</title>
<p>Ideally, we would like to assess public satisfaction. However, existing public data are representative of the larger city, not each school. Therefore, analysis at the school level is not currently possible with public satisfaction data. The NYC Board of Education, however, began collecting parent, not public, satisfaction data on an annual basis in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0895904813475712">NYC Department of Education, 2011a</xref>). The NYC School Survey is administered annually in the spring to all parents in the NYC school system. Individual schools distribute the surveys, which can be completed either through a paper-and-pencil format or an online format. Surveys are coded with a unique ID to prevent duplicate responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0895904813475712">NYC Department of Education, 2011b</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0895904813475712">1</xref></sup> Parents complete the surveys between February and late April of each year, and school-level data are made public each summer. Because individual-level data are not available, our measure of parental satisfaction is an aggregate, school-level measure. This aggregation may mask important variation in parent opinion within each school. The focus of this study is an initial look at whether perceptions of school quality are related to the accountability reform changes that affected progress report grades, and therefore, school-level data are sufficient. Future work, however, should examine whether important differences exist between parents within the same school to better understand how variation in response may be related to individual characteristics. This question, however, is beyond the scope of this article.</p>
<p>We use the survey question, “How satisfied were you with the education your child has received this year” (4 = <italic>very satisfied</italic> to 1 = <italic>very unsatisfied</italic>) to assess parent satisfaction in 2009 and 2010 (for the full questionnaires, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0895904813475712">NYC Department of Education, 2011a</xref>). As different parents may hold different goals for education, we selected this broad question to maintain a focus on overall satisfaction with education rather than questions that focus on more specific school features such as the quality of school communication or a specific teacher.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that satisfaction serves an intermediary to the actions parents may take, which directly influences education support and potential for future reform (i.e., exiting the system, disengaging from PTA [Parent–Teacher Association] organizations, voting to block additional funding for school reform, etc.). Although the long-term impact is not yet measurable in NYC, we can observe the immediate impact the colliding accountability reforms had on parent opinion. However, because extant literature indicates that satisfaction is highly linked to the above actions, past research enables us to make empirically grounded claims about how any change in satisfaction may lead to these actions.</p>

<sec id="section10-0895904813475712">
<title>Independent Variables</title>
<p>In addition to our main variable of interest—progress report grades—we include several independent variables likely to affect parental satisfaction. We include variables known to affect parent satisfaction, but because this topic is generally understudied, we also include variables that are known to affect student achievement. Because we assume that student achievement influences parent satisfaction, including these additional variables that control for changes in student achievement are necessary as they serve as other potentially competing explanations. Independent variables were culled from the NYC Progress Reports and the New York State Report Cards (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0895904813475712">Table 1</xref> for a complete list of data and their source).</p>

<title>Variable of interest: NYC Progress Report letter grades</title>
<p>While the progress report provides four different grades, which represent different aspects of school performance, we use the overall grade in this analysis because it represents the summary performance measure, is the most prominently displayed grade on the report’s first page, and is larger than the other grades listed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0895904813475712">Figure 1</xref> for an example of NYC progress report format). Because of its prominence and summative nature, it is most likely to influence parental perceptions of school quality.</p>

</fig>
<p>We analyze the impact of the overall grade using two different specifications. In the first model we transform all grades into the common 4-point scale (A = 4, B = 3, C = 2, D = 1, F = 0) and treat it as a continuous variable. In the second, we created dummy variables to compare how receiving each grade differed from a school that received an A letter grade, our omitted category. We combined the letter grades D and F due to small number of schools in each of those categories.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0895904813475712">
<title>Teacher characteristics</title>
<p>Teacher characteristics are important predictors of student academic success (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0895904813475712">Beteille &amp; Loeb, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0895904813475712">Foorman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0895904813475712">Kennedy, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, teachers are the most visible aspect of schooling and may influence parental satisfaction as parents interact with them frequently. As a result, we include two proxy measures for teacher quality within a school: the percent of students who are not taught by a highly qualified teacher, and the percent of teachers with less than 3 years of experience teaching in the school. These characteristics are reported on the New York State Report Card.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0895904813475712">
<title>School demographic data</title>
<p>A vast amount of research documents the relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and academic performance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0895904813475712">Coleman et al., 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0895904813475712">Coleman, Hoffer, &amp; Kilgore, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0895904813475712">Rothstein, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0895904813475712">Schneider, Teske, Marschall, &amp; Roch, 1998</xref>), and therefore, we include several demographic variables in our analysis. New York State Report Cards report the percent of students who qualify for free or reduced-price lunch (FRPL), the percent of students who are limited English proficient (LEP), and the percent of students who are not White, for each schools. The percent of students who are labeled <italic>special education</italic> (SPED) are available through the State Department of Education.</p>
<p>Research on the relationship between school enrollment and student achievement is not conclusive. Studies in South Carolina found that elementary schools with larger enrollments perform better, on average, than schools with smaller enrollment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0895904813475712">Caldas, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0895904813475712">Stevenson, 1996</xref>). However, other empirical evidence suggests no significant relationship between enrollment and achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0895904813475712">McCathern, 2004</xref>). Thus, we included enrollment to investigate its relationship with parental satisfaction and control for any possible influence on satisfaction levels.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0895904813475712">
<title>Response rates</title>
<p>Because response rates may be related to reported parental satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0895904813475712">Charbonneau &amp; Van Ryzin, 2011</xref>), we included response rates in our model. As described previously, it is impossible to know whether the most satisfied parents or the most dissatisfied parents are more likely to respond to the survey. This potential bias that would result is acute for schools with a very low response rate. We therefore include only schools with a response rate of at least 30%. We examined our data to ensure that there were no systematic differences between schools with high and low response rates to ensure that we did not significantly skew our sample by dropping these schools. We found no significant relationships between any of our school demographics or satisfaction levels and response rates.</p>

<title>Empirical Method</title>
<p>Before determining whether implementing the two strategies simultaneously has a negative consequence on perceptions of school quality, we first examine descriptive changes in letter grades and satisfaction scores for 2009 and 2010. In Part 2 of our analysis, we use ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, with parental satisfaction as the dependent variable, to estimate whether progress report grades are significant predictors of satisfaction for each school year. We estimate the following three models for each year: (a) a controls-only model, (b) a 4-point grade scale combined model, and (c) a dummied grade model.

<p>In Part 3 of our analysis, we examine whether the change in parental satisfaction was influenced by grade changes using a first-difference model. This mitigates time-invariant aspects that bias coefficients while capturing the relationship between year-to-year changes in dependent and independent variables. The first-difference model follows the form described above but uses the year-to-year change in each variable. We again represent grades both as continuous and as a set of dummy variables representing schools whose grades rose, fell, or remain unchanged. In the model using dummy variables, the omitted category is schools whose grades remained unchanged year to year.</p>

<title>Descriptive Changes in NYC Accountability Letter Grades, Parental Satisfaction, and Student Achievement</title>
<p>After the policy change in 2009 that raised the bar, schools experienced dramatic changes in their progress report grades. In all, 71% of schools in our sample saw a decline of at least one letter grade; 34% of schools in our sample saw a decline of two or more grades. This dramatic decline in letter grades, which resulted from a policy to raise the bar, appears to have had a significant impact on parent satisfaction. Simply looking at the average change in satisfaction at the school level, we find an average decline between 2009 and 2010 of −0.15 or about a 4% decline. However, because this decline in satisfaction may have been due to actual declining achievement levels and not due simply to perceived change due to lower progress report grades, we examined the scale score changes over the same period of time for third-, fourth-, and fifth-grade math and English language arts (ELA).</p>
<p>The decline in grades assigned by the NYC accountability system and the corresponding decline in parent satisfaction contrasts the actual changes in achievement as measured by scale scores, which were more mixed; average fourth-grade mathematics, for example, did decline (5.1 points), but average fourth-grade ELA actually increased (2.9 points). Overall, tests scores increased in fourth- and fifth-grade ELA and third-grade math whereas third-grade ELA and fourth- and fifth-grade math decreased (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0895904813475712">Table 2</xref>). Because actual student achievement, as measured by test scores, was mixed, we have no evidence that there was widespread decline in actual school performance that could explain the observed decline in satisfaction. Thus, we test whether it was related to the perceived decline that resulted from the colliding accountability policies. If parents are paying attention to the actual changes in student achievement (at least as measured by test scores) and not the overall letter grades, we would expect that changes in letter grades would have no relationship to satisfaction levels, as there is not a one-to-one relationship.</p>

<title>Predictors of Satisfaction by Year</title>
<p>Before examining whether the colliding accountability policies predict the change in parental perception from year to year, we analyze whether grades were significant predictors of satisfaction for each year. Although previous research has found that grades were significant predictors of parent satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0895904813475712">Charbonneau &amp; Van Ryzin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0895904813475712">Jacobsen &amp; Saultz, 2013</xref>), the frequent criticism of overreliance on test scores for judging schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0895904813475712">Booher-Jennings, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0895904813475712">Ravitch, 2010</xref>) may cause the public to disregard these measures. In addition, we examine whether school-level demographic variables are significant predictors for each of the years examined here.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0895904813475712">Table 3</xref> presents the estimates from three models for each year. The baseline model shown in Column 1 and 2 includes only the controls for each year. Columns 3 and 4 include the accountability letter grades as a continuous variable, whereas Columns 5 and 6 specifies the accountability letter grade as a set of dummy variables. The estimates shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0895904813475712">Table 3</xref> indicate that our teacher characteristic variables are significant predictors of parent satisfaction in both 2008-2009 and 2009-2010. Of note, the teacher characteristics have an opposite relationship than one may anticipate. The higher the percent of students taught by a non–highly qualified teacher, the higher the parent satisfaction. Similarly, these models indicate that the higher the percent of teachers with less than 3 years of teaching experience, the higher the parent satisfaction. Although it is outside our study’s focus, this finding is curious given previous work documenting that teachers with more experience are often more effective; thus, we would have expected that parents would be more satisfied with more experienced teachers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0895904813475712">Clotfelter, Ladd &amp; Vigdor, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0895904813475712">Harris &amp; Sass, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0895904813475712">Kane, Rockoff, &amp; Staiger, 2006</xref>).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0895904813475712">Table 3</xref> also shows that the percent of LEP students in a school is also a significant predictor of parent satisfaction with an increase in the percent of students who are classified as LEP being inversely related to reported levels of parent satisfaction. Similarly, school size was a strong predictor of parent satisfaction; as enrollment increases, satisfaction declines. Finally, the response rate variable is a significant predictor but only in 2009-2010, with higher response rates predicting higher satisfaction levels. This may support the hypothesis that in schools with lower response rates, it was only the most dissatisfied parents who completed the survey. This further supports the need to include this variable in the model to control for this potential bias.</p>
<p>With regard to our main variable of interest, Model 2 (Columns 3 and 4) demonstrates that a school’s overall letter grade was a significant predictor of parent satisfaction, but for the 2009-2010 school year only. In 2009-2010, schools with lower overall grades also had lower levels of average parental satisfaction. Similarly, Model 3 examines whether specific grades affected parental satisfaction. For 2009-2010, individual letter grades had a significant and negative impact on parental satisfaction levels. A school receiving a letter grade of a B, C, or a D and F (combined) had significantly lower reported levels of parent satisfaction than schools that received an A. Furthermore, in the dummied model when all other factors are held constant, we see that the decline in satisfaction for schools that received a letter grade of C was larger than the decline in satisfaction for schools that received a letter grade of B.</p>
<p>While we find that grades were significant predictors in 2009-2010, our results suggest they were not in 2008-2009 (for further exploration of this finding, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0895904813475712">Jacobsen &amp; Saultz, 2013</xref>). However, because grades are predictive some of the time, we had reason to investigate whether the change in grades was also significant for the change in satisfaction.</p>

<sec id="section19-0895904813475712">
<title>Change in Satisfaction: First-Difference Models</title>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0895904813475712">Table 4</xref>, we present the findings from the first-difference models. Models 5 and 6 include our variable of interest—change in letter grade. When the change in letter grades is treated as a continuous variable (from −4 to +4) in Model 5, we find that it has significant and negative impact on satisfaction; as progress report grades declined from one year to the next, the change in average parental satisfaction was also negative. Furthermore, when the change in letter grades is modeled using three dummy variables (progress report grade increased, decreased, and remained the same), we find that a decrease in letter grade significantly and negatively influenced the change in satisfaction whereas a grade increase had no significant effect when compared to the omitted category (no change in progress report grade). This finding suggests that parents respond more powerfully to a drop in letter grade than to an increase. In both models, we find that the change in letter grades is a strongly significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) predictor, but the impact is substantively small, a point we discuss in greater detail below. Overall however, these findings suggest our hypothesis that the accountability strategies collided and negatively influenced satisfaction with school performance was correct.</p>

<p>As many schools and districts pursue the multiple accountability strategies for school improvement as mandated by NCLB, we must consider whether the policies influence more than just the intended outcome—school performance. Because NCLB requires that states set high standards and publicly disseminate data, the results in this exemplar case study likely apply to a number of locales that are also pursuing similar strategies simultaneously.</p>
<p>Although raising the bar has led to improved student test score performance in many cases (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0895904813475712">Carnoy &amp; Loeb, 2002</xref>), in the case of NYC it also led to publicized accountability data that implied widespread decline in school performance. Therefore, we must be concerned about the possible consequences for public perception of school performance when these accountability reform strategies collide. Whereas policy makers and educational elites might have been aware of the artificial nature of the decline in performance, the public, which is notoriously less informed than many would like (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0895904813475712">Berelson, Lazarsfeld &amp; McPhee, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0895904813475712">Converse, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0895904813475712">Delli Carpini &amp; Keeter, 1996</xref>), was likely less aware that the decline resulted from a change in policy that raised the bar for achievement. If the public was not aware or misunderstood the reason for the decline, its declining satisfaction may be an inappropriate and harmful response.</p>
<p>Due to the highly visible nature of the performance data and the fact people do pay attention, if at least intermittently, we hypothesized that parent satisfaction would be related to school report card grades. Our research suggests that this is the case. When the policy change altered grading criteria to raise the bar on schools, we find that NYC parent satisfaction declined slightly. Our further analysis showed that it was only a decline in letter grades that had a significant impact on parent satisfaction. Increased grades did not show a significant (and positive) change. This implies that the psychological effect of declining grades is a more significant and negative effect than seeing a school maintain its performance. This finding is important to note because the policy change by the NYC Board of Education, by design, caused many schools to see falling grades as a way to spur their improvement.</p>
<p>Moreover, this occurred despite the fact that achievement did not similarly decrease across the board but actually increased for several grades and in several subjects during the time period we examined. In our sample, for example, average scale scores in fourth-grade ELA actually increased from 664.3 to 667.2. But these scores were buried on Page 14 of the New York State Report Cards, and are rarely covered in the newspapers. The letter grades, however, which are prominently displayed on Page 1 of the progress reports (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0895904813475712">Figure 1</xref>) and released to the public through a well-covered press conference, implied a decline in performance.</p>
<p>This presents a complex dilemma for policy makers. Raising the bar has been shown to spur continuous academic achievement in schools and has a proven track record in other fields, making it an appealing policy initiative. However, raising the bar also means that schools receive lower scores after the policy change is implemented that may appear to the public as a decline in achievement, which affects its confidence in and satisfaction with the public education system. Although the long-term consequences of declining satisfaction in NYC remain to be seen, one result could be public withdrawal of support for future funding because the public (wrongly) believes the declining letter grades indicate ineffective use of previous reform funds. The catch 22 that results from the coupling of these improvement strategies suggests further inquiry is needed to hopefully prevent further erosion of public support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0895904813475712">Cohen &amp; Moffitt, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Although our results point to a potential dilemma for policy makers, there are limitations to our study that may mitigate this concern. First, long-term trend data are not available due to the recency of these reforms and parent satisfaction data collection. Trends would enable us to discern whether or not the changes in satisfaction levels is a brief shock that rebounds once performance rises or whether the effect is a prolonged period of low satisfaction. However, we did not find a corresponding significant and positive increase in parental satisfaction ratings for those schools that experienced an increase in their performance grades. This may be due to the small sample of schools that experienced increased grades or it may be that it is easier to shake public confidence than it is to build it through public data-reporting policies.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the actual decline in satisfaction we documented is quite small. If this very small decline were to be simply a short-term result, our concern may be mitigated. If however the decline we detect is simply the beginning of a downward trend, even small yearly declines could be cause for greater concern over time. Continuing to examine the trends in overall satisfaction should be a priority for researchers.</p>
<p>Second, proponents of making data publically available hope that data will spur some parents and the public to apply pressure on their schools to improve. The dissatisfaction some experience may be the very motivation needed to spur them to voice their concerns and demand improvement. Rather than experiencing negative consequences from dissatisfaction, such as withdrawing from the system or refusing to provide addition financial support for reforms, some individuals may respond exactly as proponents hope by becoming more involved in the school system. Thus, the declining satisfaction we document may have long-term positive results. Moreover, it could be that a certain amount of dissatisfaction is productive in mobilizing resources for school improvement, but should the decline grow beyond a certain threshold, dissatisfaction then serves to undermine improvement efforts. Whereas previous research often documents the negative consequences of declining satisfaction for other public systems (such as the police force), we can only speculate at this point that the decline in satisfaction for the public education system will result in similar negative consequences. Further research regarding the ways in which people act upon their declining satisfaction is needed to understand the actual political impact for the system.</p>
<p>Other limitations in the data, however, may actually have led us to underestimate the impact of these accountability policies for satisfaction. As we noted in the Data section, we cannot assess general public satisfaction with its specific public schools. By using a measure of satisfaction that includes only parents, we exclude important contributors to the education system. As has been previously found, parents often express more positive views of schools than nonparents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0895904813475712">Berkman &amp; Plutzer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0895904813475712">Bushaw &amp; Lopez, 2011</xref>). Because parents have more direct interaction with school (open-house events, parent–teacher meetings, etc.), they likely rely less heavily on the progress report grades to formulate their satisfaction. An example of this is the parents who protest heavily when their child’s school is slated for closure due to poor test score performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0895904813475712">Spencer, 2012</xref>). Parents often cite other reasons for supporting the school beyond just test scores, implying that progress report grades may have a minimal impact on parental satisfaction. The general public, however, is likely <italic>more</italic> reliant on these official measures, as it lacks access to these other indicators parent use. This may mean that our results actually underestimate the negative impact that the declining grades has on broader public opinion.</p>
<p>Furthermore, because the existing survey data asked parents to assess their satisfaction with <italic>their child’s</italic> education, our findings likely underestimate overall satisfaction with the whole school, as parents are more likely to express satisfaction with their own child’s education. Just as people express more positive satisfaction with their Congressional representative as compared to Congress as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0895904813475712">Cook, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0895904813475712">Parker &amp; Davidson, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0895904813475712">Patterson &amp; Magleby, 1992</xref>), it is likely that parents express higher levels of satisfaction with their child’s education than they would for the whole school or the entire school system. Thus, we again may be underestimating the impact on broader public satisfaction with the school system.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Empirical investigations of the ways in which policies, once implemented, can influence future political dynamics and support for particular policy have become a recent focus of political scientists and policy researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0895904813475712">Campbell, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0895904813475712">Mettler &amp; Soss, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0895904813475712">Reed, 2001</xref>). Building on this, education researchers have argued that we should work to understand how accountability policies shape public opinion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0895904813475712">Jacobsen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0895904813475712">McDonnell, 2009</xref>). By examining the impact implementing two specific accountability policies have on perceptions of school quality, we contribute to an understanding of how policies can constrain future policy possibilities by eroding public confidence in and satisfaction with its schools.</p>
<p>In addition, we contribute to the literature that has documented the perverse outcomes that have resulted from the current test-based accountability policies. Extant research has documented a number of ways that test-based accountability has resulted in multiple unconstructive outcomes for schooling, including curricular narrowing, shifting students into untested subgroups, and intentional cheating (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0895904813475712">Jacob, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0895904813475712">Jacob &amp; Levitt, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0895904813475712">Ladd &amp; Zelli, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0895904813475712">McDermott, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0895904813475712">Rothstein, Jacobsen, &amp; Wilder, 2008</xref>). But the potentially negative impact we document here has been not only less considered, it may ultimately prove to be the most damaging. If test-based accountability policies were altered or removed altogether, it is likely that cheating and teaching to the test would immediately stop; this perverse consequence could easily be reversed. However, reversing the erosion of public confidence may not be as quick to respond. Will those who have lost faith in the ability of the public education system quickly change their minds once these colliding policies are no longer in place? Thus, this undesirable outcome may be fundamentally different from those previously identified, as its impact may linger long after current policies are removed.</p>
<p>Whereas most conversations regarding education accountability data focus almost exclusively on the promises data hold for school improvement, this work reminds us that accountability data can also be used to threaten the system and hinder future efforts to support and sustain reform. Educational policy makers should tread carefully when enacting policies that influence public perception of schools. Calls for informing the public about the performance of its schools are certainly warranted. The public has made a large investment in its schools and deserves to know whether its public schools have used these funds wisely to produce adequate outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0895904813475712">Gormley &amp; Weimer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0895904813475712">McDonnell, 2000</xref>). But in our rush to produce data of all shapes and sizes and then reshape these data for policy or political purposes, we cannot forget to consider how the public is interpreting these data. As the case of NYC demonstrates, efforts to shape the data to spur continuous improvement can easily lead to public concern. Inadvertently, citizens may come to believe that there is little point in participating in or supporting the education system because they do not see positive returns for these previous investments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0895904813475712">Wichowsky &amp; Moynihan, 2008</xref>). Given our findings, we believe that concern is warranted for the development of a “vicious chain of low trust—declining resources—poor perceived government performance—lower trust” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0895904813475712">Holzer &amp; Zhang, 2004</xref>, p. 238). In the end, policy efforts that shape accountability data to improve schools may actually hinder long-term improvement possibilities, a possibility we should all pause to consider.</p>

<p>This does not prevent school leaders from failing to distribute surveys to all or some parents, nor does this prevent school leaders from completing surveys themselves. However, we have no evidence that such “cheating” exists, and communication with officials at the NYC Department of Education who oversee the survey administration provided us with no reasons to suspect that the above cheating is occurring.</p>
