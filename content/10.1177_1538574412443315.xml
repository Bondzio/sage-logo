<bold>Objective:</bold> To compare the gene expression profiles of the aorta specimens between patients with Stanford type B aortic dissection (AD) and controls. <bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> Samples of descending aorta were collected from patients with type B AD (n = 12) and from multiorgan donors as controls (n = 12). Phalanx whole genome microarray was used to analyze differential gene expression. <bold>Results:</bold> Of the 6375 probes validated, 623 genes were found to be differentially expressed between patients with type B AD and controls (fold change ≥2). Gene ontology analysis identified significantly enriched gene groups pertaining to cell–cell adhesion, extracellular matrix, cell–matrix adhesion, cytoskeleton, immune and inflammatory response, and apoptosis. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Genes encoding components related to integrity and strength of the aortic wall were downregulated, whereas those related to inflammatory response were upregulated in type B AD. The altered patterns of gene expression indicate preexisting structural defects that are probably a consequence of insufficient remodeling of the aortic wall.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Aortic dissection (AD) occurs when layers of the aortic walls get separated starting with a tear in the intima, causing blood flow within the aortic wall. Aortic dissection is a catastrophic cardiovascular event occurring without any warning.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574412443315">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574412443315">2</xref>
</sup> The overall outcome depends on the site of the initial tear, comorbidities, and subsequent complications. Modern diagnostic techniques such as contrast-enhanced computed or magnetic resonance tomography may reveal an aortic wall hematoma at the onset of the disease, which may progress into aortic wall dissection over time. It is proposed that bleeding of the vasa vasorum represents the first step of dissection process.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574412443315">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574412443315">4</xref>
</sup> The Stanford classification distinguishes AD into type A or type B, depending on whether the site of the initial tear is in the ascending or descending arms of the aorta, respectively. Almost 60% of reported cases of AD are type A and 40% type B.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574412443315">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Aortic dissection is an uncommon but a highly lethal disease, with an estimated incidence ranging from 3 to 8 cases per 100 000 persons.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574412443315">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574412443315"/>

</sup> Approximately, 0.5% of patients presenting at an emergency ward with chest or back pain may have AD or its precursors.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574412443315">9</xref>
</sup> Men are twice as often likely have acute AD than women.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574412443315">5</xref>
</sup> The historical data of untreated AD of the ascending aorta shows a mortality rate of 1% to 2% per hour within the first 24 hours, resulting in a mortality rate of up to 50% to 74% within the first 2 weeks.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574412443315">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574412443315">6</xref>
</sup> An uncomplicated, acute, type B dissection is less frequently fatal.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574412443315">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574412443315">9</xref>
</sup> However, patients with acute or late complications, including renal failure, visceral ischemia, or contained rupture, often require urgent repair, with a mortality rate mounting to 20% at day 2, and 25% to 50% within 1 month.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574412443315">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Several risk factors for AD have been identified, including smoking, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. While patients with heritable connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are known to develop AD very early in life,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538574412443315">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1538574412443315">11</xref>
</sup> little is known about the underlying defects of sporadic aortic AD. A better understanding of molecular mechanisms is an important step toward defining the pathophysiology of AD, the identification of genetic and molecular biomarkers, as well as for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptional profiling for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and type A AD have been reported earlier, however, similar studies on type B AD have not been reported yet.<sup>

<p>Here we have compared gene expression profiles in tissue samples of the aorta collected during surgery from patients with acute type B AD with aorta samples from controls to provide insights into the systemic pathophysiological processes involved in this disease.</p>

<title>Patients and Sample Collection</title>
<p>The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, where it was conducted. Inclusion in the study was voluntary and informed consent was obtained from all participants or their relatives. Twelve consecutive consenting patients who underwent emergency surgery for type B AD were recruited. Patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and other known connective tissue disorders were excluded. None of the patients had dissection induced by trauma or cardiovascular surgery. During operation, the tear site was identified and a strip of aortic wall including the tear site was carefully excised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574412443315">Figure 1</xref>). Aorta tissue specimens were collected from 12 multiorgan donors who were terminally ill or brain dead as control samples. The demographic information of patients and controls is listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1538574412443315">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Sample Processing and Total RNA Extraction</title>
<p>All tissue samples were processed within 1 hour after collection. First, each sample was washed with a solution of RNALater (Ambion, UK) to protect RNA. Then the adherent mural thrombus and excess adventitia were carefully removed from the aortic wall. Then the samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until further use. Additional tissue samples were fixed in formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin for microscopic evaluation. For extraction of total RNA, samples were cut into thin slices with freezing microtome (Leica CM1900, Germany) under RNAase-free conditions and extracted in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The quality of the extracted RNA was verified on RNA 6000 Nano LabChip Kit and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). The RNA preparation was considered usable if on gel electrophoresis it exhibited 1 major peak and 2 ribosomal (18s and 28s) peaks.</p>

<sec id="section5-1538574412443315">
<title>Gene Expression Profiling Using Microarray</title>
<p>Gene expression analysis was performed using the human whole genome DNA microarray, OneArray (Phalanx Biotech Group, Taiwan) that has a total of 39 200 individual spotted probes. OneArray chip processing was performed at the Fudan University Genome Laboratory (Shanghai, China), according to the users’ manual. Fold differences in gene expression levels were represented as the ratio of the mean expression values from the patient and control groups. Genes exhibiting a fold change of at least ±2 with a <italic>P</italic> value less than .05 were selected as the significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The data were normalized and filtered. Cluster 3.0 and Java TreeView version 1.15r2 were used to obtain gene cluster profiles. Hierarchical clustering algorithm, median centering, Euclidean distance correlation, and average linkage were performed for cluster analysis. Significance analysis of microarray (SAM) software<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1538574412443315">16</xref>
</sup> was used to identify significantly DEGs between patient and control samples.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1538574412443315">
<title>Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Pathway Analyses</title>
<p>In order to interpret the biological significance of the identified changes in gene expression, DEGs were categorized and mapped onto biological pathways through the use of Molecule Annotation System 2.0 (MAS 2.0; http://bioinfo.capitalbio.com/mas/) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway database (http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/pathway.html) in addition to the Entrez database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Biological pathways with <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01 were considered to be significantly modified. GeneCoDis software (http://genecodis.dacya.ucm.es/) was used to reveal significance of co-occurrence of gene annotations of the identified genes in different databases.</p>

<sec id="section7-1538574412443315">
<title>Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction–Based Gene Expression Analysis</title>
<p>To confirm the results obtained from microarray analysis, the expression of 12 selected genes was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction PCR (qRT-PCR), both in samples of participants used for microarray analysis and in 8 additional samples each from patients and controls. Total RNA was collected as mentioned above. Complementary DNA (cDNA) strand was synthesized by the SuperScript III First-Strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). To quantify gene expression, qRT-PCR was performed on an iCycler iQ instrument (Bio-Rad) using SYBR Green PCR Master mix (Takara Company, Japan). Reactions were performed in duplicate with 50 ng cDNA per reaction. The delta–delta Ct method was used for comparing relative gene expression. Relative gene expression levels were determined by subtracting the average delta Ct value of the target from the average delta Ct value of the calibrator. The amount of target gene expression was expressed as relative fold change after normalization to the expression of an endogenous reference gene, the <italic>GAPDH</italic> gene, and was given by 2_delta–delta Ct.

<title>Statistical Methods</title>
<p>For microarray analysis, genes were identified as differentially expressed based on the following criteria: (1) q value = 0, and (2) at least a 2-fold change between samples from patients with type B AD and from controls. <italic>T</italic> statistic algorithm was performed in SAM to identify DEGs. For gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analyses, <italic>P</italic> values were calculated through hypergeometric analysis and corrected for false discovery rate (FDR). The corrected <italic>P</italic> values less than .05 were considered to indicate a significant difference. Unpaired 2-tailed Student <italic>t</italic> test was applied to assess the qRT-PCR analysis of expression of selected DEGs between type B AD and normal control, where <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 was considered significant.</p>

<p>Demographic and clinical characteristics of the study population, patients with type B AD and controls, are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1538574412443315">Table 1</xref>. All included participants were male. The age of type B AD patient group (mean, 48.3 years; range, 33-58 years) and control group (mean, 39.8 years; 32-56 years) was comparable. The 2 groups were well matched also in terms of risk factors such as smoking and diabetes. Participants were classified into blood pressure categories of 0, 1 and 2. All the type B patients were in the acute stage. The time from onset (TFO) of AD in the patient group ranged from 1 to 8 days (median 5 days): 3 patients each with a TFO of 5 days, 2 patients each with a TFO of 8, 7, or 4 days, and 1 patient with a TFO of 6, 3, or 1 days.</p>

<title>Microarray Analysis</title>
<p>The human whole genome DNA microarray employed here, OneArray, has 39 200 spotted probes. After normalizing and filtering the raw data, 6375 genes were considered to be detectably expressed (details in Supplementary <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1538574412443315">Table 1</xref>). The data was processed by Cluster 3.0 and Java TreeView 1.15r2 to obtain gene expression profiles. The differential gene expression profiles between patients with type B AD and controls were visualized with a heat map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574412443315">Figure 2A</xref>). These data were analyzed using SAM software to select genes with expression level scores above the threshold value of delta of 1.700. With an FDR of 0 and by applying a minimal fold change of 2, the analyses revealed consistent patterns of differential gene expression. Thus, a total of 623 genes were found to show altered expression in patients with type B AD compared with controls, of which 220 genes were upregulated and 403 genes were downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574412443315">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>

<title>Gene Ontology and KEGG Pathway Analyses</title>
<p>Out of the 623 significant DEGs, 548 had an Entrez Gene ID. When these 548 DEGs were submitted to GeneCoDis, only 514 were recognized. Hence, GO and KEGG pathway analyses were done on these 514 genes (details in Supplementary Table 4). The DEGs in patients with type B AD and controls were assigned to different classes in 3 different GO categories: biological processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1538574412443315">Figure 3A</xref>), molecular functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1538574412443315">Figure 3B</xref>), or cellular location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1538574412443315">Figure 3C</xref>). The highest number of genes in each of the above 3 categories pertained to signal transduction (57 genes), protein binding (222 genes), and cytoplasmic (160 genes), respectively; while the number of genes in the unspecified class (others) for the 3 categories were 198, 79, and 342, respectively.</p>

<title>Quantitative Real-Time PCR Analysis of Gene Expression</title>
<p>To validate microarray data, qRT-PCR was employed to determine the transcript levels of 12 selected DEGs that are likely to be related to the pathology of AD. These genes encoded cellular components known to be required for the integrity of the aortic wall, including structural components such as collagens, biglycan, polycystins, and actin; signaling molecules such as S100A8 and Transforming Growth Factor (TGF)-beta; and the matrix metalloprotease 19 (MMP)-19, an enzyme involved in tissue remodeling (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1538574412443315">Table 2</xref>). The selected genes were <italic>PKD1</italic> and <italic>PKD2</italic>; <italic>COL1A1</italic>, <italic>COL3A1</italic>, <italic>COL5A2</italic>, <italic>COL6A2</italic>; <italic>COL6A3</italic>; <italic>ACTC</italic>, <italic>S100A8</italic>, <italic>TGF B3</italic>, <italic>BGN</italic>, <italic>MMP19</italic>. Results of both, qRT-PCR and microarray, showed the same trend of up- or downregulation of all the above genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1538574412443315">Table 2</xref>). The <italic>COL1A1</italic>, <italic>COL3A1</italic>, <italic>COL6A3</italic> were upregulated, while COL6A2 was downregulated. The COL5A2 was not significantly changed. The highest fold induction observed was for S100A8 (7.11-fold) that encodes a calcium-binding protein. The expression of genes encoding the polycystins, <italic>PKD1</italic> and <italic>PKD2</italic>, actin and biglycan was downregulated in patients with type B AD. Among these 12 genes, the highest downregulation observed was for TGF-beta (0.19-fold).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Gene expression profiling studied by microarray technologies is a particularly appropriate and useful tool to investigate the pathophysiology of complex genetic tracts such as cardiovascular diseases. Microarray analyses for comparing patients and controls have been reported earlier for AAA.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538574412443315">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538574412443315">13</xref>
</sup> Weis-Müller et al published 2 sequential reports based on microarray analysis to investigate the differences in gene expression between patients with type A AD and controls.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538574412443315">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538574412443315">15</xref>
</sup> These findings have dramatically improved our knowledge about the pathophysiology of such diseases. However, a microarray study comparing patients with type B AD and controls has not been reported yet. This may be due to the difficulty in collecting tissue samples from patients with type B AD as most of these patients receive endovascular therapy nowadays. In our clinical center, because a certain proportion of patients with type B AD are still treated by traditional open surgeries, we were able to collect surgical specimens for this study. Similarly, we could also collect sufficient number of samples from controls, mostly patients who were brain dead. Moreover, as we had a large specimen bank, we could choose the most suitable control samples so that specimens from patients and controls were matched for age, risk factors, and comorbidities. Thus, the bias introduced by these factors in the comparative analyses was significantly reduced.</p>
<sec id="section15-1538574412443315">
<title>Analysis of GO</title>
<p>Gene ontology is one of the most useful methods to analyze microarray data as it provides a common descriptive framework for genes and gene products. Analysis of GO of DEGs identified in this study could be categorized to the following 7 GO groups, which can be given in the order of representation as: cell–cell adhesion, extracellular matrix (ECM), cell–matrix adhesion, cytoskeleton, collagen, immune and inflammatory responses, and apoptosis. These categories are discussed in detail below.</p>
<p>The most overrepresented GO group pertained to cell–cell adhesion. Interestingly, most of the genes in this functional group were downregulated, for example, <italic>CELSR</italic>, <italic>DCHS1</italic>, <italic>PCDHB5</italic>, <italic>PKD1</italic>, <italic>ITGA7</italic>, <italic>STIM1</italic>, <italic>AMIGO2</italic>, <italic>SPON1</italic>, <italic>CD97</italic>, <italic>NEDD9</italic>, <italic>MLLT4</italic>, and <italic>LPP</italic>; whereas a few other genes, for example, <italic>ITGAE</italic> that encodes integrin alphaE, were upregulated. The second most enriched functional group was ECM. The ECM is a complex network of different combinations of collagens, elastin, proteoglycans, laminin, fibronectin, and many other glycoproteins, all of which are important for vascular integrity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1538574412443315">17</xref>
</sup> It plays an important structural and functional role in multicellular organisms and many of its components are engaged in processes mediating cell–cell interactions, including those in aortic development.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1538574412443315">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1538574412443315">18</xref>
</sup> The expression of some genes annotated in this category was upregulated in type B AD, for example, genes encoding <italic>LAMB1</italic>, <italic>SPOCK1</italic>, <italic>COL3A1</italic>, and <italic>COL1A1</italic> (also belong to GO group, collagen, see below). In contrast, expression level of other genes was downregulated in type B AD, for example, those encoding <italic>ASPN</italic>, <italic>COL6A2</italic>, <italic>DCN</italic>, <italic>COL16A1</italic>, and <italic>BGN</italic>. Collagen and elastin are the most abundant ECM proteins of the aortic wall and are responsible for the characteristic mechanical properties, providing tensile strength and elasticity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1538574412443315">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1538574412443315">19</xref>
</sup> In the present study, expression of the gene encoding elastin, an important connective tissue fiber, was undetectable in both patient and control samples. Either the expression level of elastin in these specimens was indeed too low or the sensitivity of the microarray for elastin was inadequate.</p>
<p>The third most enriched functional group in this study concerned cell–matrix adhesion. All the genes of this group that expressed on our microarrays were downregulated in the AD group. These genes included <italic>LAMA5</italic>, <italic>ITGA7</italic>, <italic>PKD1</italic>, and <italic>PKD2</italic>. The genes encoding <italic>PKD1</italic> and <italic>PKD2</italic> have been shown to be downregulated in patients with type A AD compared with controls.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538574412443315">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538574412443315">15</xref>
</sup> Both PKD1 and PKD2 encode polycystin-1 and polycystin-2, respectively, that function as matrix receptors to link ECM to the actin cytoskeleton via focal adhesion (FA) proteins.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1538574412443315">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1538574412443315">20</xref>
</sup> The <italic>PKD1</italic> is also a member of the cell–cell adhesion group. Mutations in the genes encoding polycystins cause autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). In patients with ADPDK, the incidence of vessel diseases like supra-aortal dissection and cerebral artery aneurysm has been reported to be higher.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1538574412443315">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1538574412443315">22</xref>
</sup> Both polycystin 1 and polycystin 2 are expressed in smooth muscle cells (SMCs), the most abundant cell type in the aortic media, and the main source of the ECM proteins.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1538574412443315">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1538574412443315">24</xref>
</sup> In SMCs, polycystin 1 is localized in the plasma membrane, whereas polycystin 2 is exclusively localized in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and intracellular structures. The close interaction between the plasmalemmal polycystin 1 and the sarcoplasmic reticulum polycystin 2 may be important in the regulation of intracellular calcium concentration and consequently of multiple intracellular processes, such as contractility, cellular differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and the production and secretion of ECM.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1538574412443315">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1538574412443315">23</xref>
</sup> Several studies in mice have highlighted the role of polycystin expression during development and in vascular diseases.<sup>

</sup> Polycystin 1 expressed in endothelium and SMC helps to stabilize adhesion of these cells to each other and to the ECM, thereby helping to maintain structural integrity of the vessel.</p>
<p>The fourth most enriched functional group was cytoskeleton. All the genes belonging to this group were downregulated in type B AD patient samples, including <italic>ACTC</italic>, <italic>ARMC8</italic>, <italic>ARVCF</italic>, <italic>TPM2</italic>, <italic>CFL2</italic>, <italic>KIAA0819</italic>, <italic>TPM1</italic>, and <italic>PFN1</italic>. A similar trend was reported in the studies conducted by Weis-Müller et al on type A AD.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538574412443315">15</xref>
</sup> They showed that the gene encoding calponin, a major cytoskeleton protein and an important molecular marker of contractile phenotype of SMC, was downregulated in the type A AD. In the present study calponin was found to be downregulated per SAM analysis but less than 2-fold compared with the controls. The major cytoskeletal protein in most cells is actin, which polymerizes to form actin filaments (microfilaments) that in turn form actin bundles. Actin also binds several cross-linking proteins. Along with calponin and other cytoskeletal proteins, actin plays an important role in developing mouse aorta.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1538574412443315">17</xref>
</sup> In this study, <italic>ACTC</italic> gene expression that encodes alpha actin of cardiac muscle was found to be decreased in patients with type B AD.</p>
<p>The fifth most enriched functional group was collagen. Out of the at least 25 different collagens, 13 are thought to be present in the blood vessel wall. <italic>COL3A1</italic> and <italic>COL1A1</italic> are the predominant fiber-forming species in the arterial wall and in general fulfill the mechanical function of imparting tensile strength and elastic resilience. These are therefore implicated in various vascular diseases.<sup>

</sup> Type I collagen is believed to impart arterial stiffness, whereas type III collagen is associated with extensibility of the vessel wall.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1538574412443315">28</xref>
</sup> Sariola et al found that the content of types I and III collagens was increased in AD, and particularly in atherosclerotic AD, compared with control.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1538574412443315">29</xref>
</sup> This observation was confirmed by Ishii and Asuwa who compared dissected and normal aortic wall by electron microscopy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1538574412443315">30</xref>
</sup> They observed that the medial layer at the entry site of the dissection and the adjacent intact aortic wall demonstrated spirally thickened collagen fibrils that were almost always colocalized with elastic lamellae. The latter often exhibited attenuation, fragmentation, or disruption.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1538574412443315">30</xref>
</sup> Wang et al also found that the expression of <italic>COL1A1</italic> and <italic>COL3A1</italic> was upregulated in surgical specimens of thoracic AD.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1538574412443315">27</xref>
</sup> In the present study, the transcript levels of several collagen-encoding genes were similar in type B AD and controls: <italic>COL4A1</italic>, <italic>COL4A2</italic>, <italic>COL4A5</italic>, <italic>COL5A1</italic>, <italic>COL5A2</italic>, <italic>COL5A3</italic>, <italic>COL6A1</italic>, <italic>COL6A3</italic>, <italic>COL7A2</italic>, <italic>COL8A1</italic>, <italic>COL8A2</italic>, <italic>COL12A1</italic>, <italic>COL16A1</italic>, <italic>COL13A1</italic>, <italic>COL13A2</italic>, <italic>COL15A1</italic>, and <italic>COL16A1</italic>. In contrast, genes encoding other collagens were downregulated: <italic>COL21A1</italic>, <italic>COL6A2</italic>, and <italic>COL16A1</italic>; while those encoding <italic>COL1A1</italic> and <italic>COL3A1</italic> were upregulated in type B AD. Expression of the several other collagen genes was undetectable in the microarray in this study: <italic>COL1A2</italic>, <italic>COL2A1</italic>, <italic>CO4A4</italic>, <italic>COL4A6</italic>, <italic>COL11A2</italic>, <italic>COL11A1</italic>, <italic>COL14A1</italic>, COL17A1, COL22A1, COL24A1, COL25A1, <italic>COL18A1</italic>, <italic>COL19A1</italic>, and <italic>COL27A1</italic>. The lower gene expression of <italic>COL6A2</italic> and the higher gene expression of <italic>COL1A1</italic> and <italic>COL3A1</italic> were also confirmed by qRT-PCR. The pattern of differential expression of collagen-encoding genes in type A AD in the study by Weis-Müller was different from that observed in the present study.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538574412443315">15</xref>
</sup> They used Affymetrix microarray to analyze differential expression and found that genes encoding <italic>COL1A1</italic>, <italic>COL3A1</italic>, <italic>COL4A1</italic>, <italic>COL5</italic>, and <italic>COL6</italic> were equally expressed in controls, while those encoding <italic>COL4A2</italic>, <italic>COL4A5</italic>, <italic>COL8A1</italic>, <italic>COL8A2</italic>, <italic>COL15</italic>, and <italic>COL18A1</italic> were downregulated. This disparity in the expression of the types of collagen between type A and type B AD may explain the different etiology of these 2 diseases.</p>
<p>The last 2 enriched functional groups were immune and inflammatory response and apoptosis. All the genes involved in the immune and inflammatory response group were upregulated in the type B AD group, for example, <italic>CFH</italic>, <italic>IL4R</italic>, <italic>BF</italic>, <italic>CD14</italic>, <italic>C4B</italic>, <italic>CCL2</italic>, and <italic>CHST1</italic>. This is the similar to the observations reported by Weis-Müller on patients with type A AD.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538574412443315">15</xref>
</sup> It is likely that the inflammatory reactions are induced by acute AD. In apoptosis group, almost half of the genes were downregulated, for example, <italic>VDAC1</italic>, <italic>CASP2</italic>, and <italic>FTS</italic>, while the other half were upregulated, such as, <italic>CARD6</italic>, <italic>GADD45B</italic>, and <italic>PAK1</italic>.</p>

<title>The KEGG Pathway</title>
<p>The KEGG pathway is a database that represents interacting networks of signaling molecules, including metabolic pathways, regulatory pathways, and molecular complexes. The KEGG pathway is another important method to interpret microarray data. The top 5 overrepresented KEGG pathways in the DEGs in type B AD concerned regulation of FA, regulation of actin cytoskeleton (RAC), ECM-receptor interaction (ERI), Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-signaling pathway (MAPK) and vascular smooth muscle contraction (VSMC; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1538574412443315">Table 2</xref>). Some of these are discussed below.</p>
<p>Focal adhesion pathway is known to play a key role in the SMC proliferation and migration. The gene encoding secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), also known as osteopontin (OPN) was found to be overexpressed in patients with type B AD. The SPP1 impairs re-endothelialization by interacting with integrin alpha V (ITGAV), contributing to restenosis and atherosclerosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1538574412443315">31</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1538574412443315"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1538574412443315">33</xref>
</sup> The SPP1 was reported to be upregulated in AAA and thoracic aortic aneurysms.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1538574412443315">34</xref>
</sup> Our study is the first to provide evidence of SPP1 overexpression in human type B AD. This is in contrast to its expression in type A AD.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538574412443315">15</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Our microarray data also showed DEGs related to cell communication (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1538574412443315">Table 3</xref>). Many of these genes overlap with genes in other pathways such as ECM and FA pathways. Lenk et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538574412443315">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1538574412443315">35</xref>
</sup> demonstrated that RAC, FA, and ECM-receptor pathway were involved in the pathogenesis of AAAs. Specific interactions between cells and the ECM are mediated by transmembrane molecules, mainly integrins, and some proteoglycans and other cell surface-associated components. These interactions lead to a direct or indirect control of cellular activities such as adhesion, migration, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Most of the DEGs belonging to the ECM-receptor interaction pathway were found to be downregulated in type B AD (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1538574412443315">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Alterations were also observed in the expression of genes in other pathways including dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), oocyte meiosis, p53-signaling pathway, circadian rhythm—mammal, Wnt-signaling pathway, cell cycle, and TGF-beta signaling (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1538574412443315">Table 3</xref>). There are certain DEGs in other functional categories, but there is no obvious relationship between their altered regulation and AD. These include FA (19 genes), ERI (11 genes), leukocyte transendothelial migration (13genes), cell adhesion molecules (11 genes), RAC (14 genes), and glycosaminoglycan degradation (3 genes; data not shown). The functional consequences of these changes have not been directly tested, but the pattern of these changes is appropriate to response to injury: increased collagen and fibrin, decreased cell–cell adhesion, increased motility, and increased permeability to inflammatory cells.</p>

<title>Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis</title>
<p>Out of the DEGs uncovered by the microarray analysis, 12 were selected for validation by qRT-PCR. The selection was based on the previously known involvement of these genes in maintaining integrity of aortic wall. All 12 genes showed the same trend of expression change in samples with type B AD in qRT-PCR as in microarray analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1538574412443315">Table 2</xref>). Among these 12 genes, the highest upregulation observed was for calcium-binding protein, S100A8, which is known to be associated with chronic and acute inflammatory conditions, including cystic fibrosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1538574412443315">36</xref>
</sup> Interestingly, among the qRT-PCR validated expression patterns, the highest downregulation observed was for TGF-beta (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1538574412443315">Table 2</xref>). The role of this growth factor in aortic aneurysms has been controversial.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1538574412443315">37</xref>
</sup> In the study on transcriptional profiling in type A AD, all the detectably expressed growth factors were found to be downregulated, but TGF-beta was not mentioned in that report.<sup>

<title>Limitations of this Study</title>
<p>The incompleteness of gene annotation is a limitation of this study. Out of 623 significantly DEGs, 548 had Entrez Gene IDs, and of these 514 could be identified by GeneCoDis. Thus, GO and KEGG pathway analyses were possible in 514 genes out of the initial 623 DEGs (details in Supplementary <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1538574412443315">Table 2</xref>). Enrichment of these genes was confirmed in both GO and KEGG annotations in order to assure consistency. Although restricting the analysis to genes that carry GO and KEGG annotations limits our analyses, it imparts a greater credibility to the functional interpretation.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Although the clinical significance of the present study cannot be conclusively estimated only on the basis of transcriptional profiling, the data presented here illustrate the underlying biological processes involved in AD formation. Aortic dissection seems to be the dramatic end point of a long process of degeneration and insufficient remodeling of the aortic wall. Expression profiling of AD has revealed biologically important changes in gene expression, some of which are probably associated exclusively with AD with excellent fidelity and also revealed important downstream effects of tissue remodeling and dysfunction of aortic structures that need to be investigated in-depth in future studies.</p>
