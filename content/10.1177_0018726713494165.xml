<p><bold>Invited commenter:</bold> Gareth Morgan, York University, Canada<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0018726713494165">1</xref></sup></p>
<p><bold>Submission deadline: 31 May 2014; please do not submit papers before 1 May 2014</bold></p>
<p><bold>What is the Special Issue about?</bold></p>
<p>In 2016 (i.e. the year when this special issue will be published), it will be 30 years since Gareth Morgan’s book ‘Images of Organization’ was originally published. The book has been seen as a seminal and ground-breaking contribution. It offered rich and evocative ways of seeing organizations and organizing. Moreover, it introduced the idea of multiple perspectives and that no image of organization is a neutral one. It still stands as an unusual and non-traditional textbook both in terms of style and content.</p>
<p>Some decades later, there is reason to wonder whether Morgan’s eight main images (they are still eight in the 2006 edition) are still relevant. Does Morgan’s work still have purchase in relation to contemporary organizational theorizing? Do his ideas resonate with new forms of organization and the processes of organizing? Are the metaphors provided able to catch images of organization, in a relevant way, for people outside of the Anglo-Saxon tradition to relate to? Is it that new metaphors need to be added? Is there even a need to rethink the whole set of metaphors and to construct an alternative set?</p>
<p>The objective of this Special Issue is to examine the substance of Morgan’s contribution in an exploratory, constructive and critically-engaged way, or that extends his work in terms of, for instance, suggesting additional metaphors or an alternative set of metaphors.</p>
<p>Expected implications are:</p>
<list id="list1-0018726713494165" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>an increased awareness of the limits that current organization theory possesses in terms of</p>
<list id="list2-0018726713494165" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>a propensity to use certain images,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the insensitivity to the context-dependency of these images, and</p></list-item></list></list-item>
<list-item><p>to encourage scholars and students to critically evaluate and extend the images used in current organization theory,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>a further development and an extension of current organization theory.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p><bold>What should your paper cover?</bold></p>
<p>Contributions are welcome that critically explore, but are not limited to, any of the following topics:</p>
<list id="list3-0018726713494165" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Can all existing images of organization be made sense of within Morgan’s conceptualization of metaphors and sub-metaphors?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Is there a need for new images of organization? Have recent developments in organizational theory led to new metaphors of organization?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Can the concepts of time, silence and voice/noise, gender, virtual worlds, and humour and irony be made sense of within Morgan’s set of eight metaphors or should they rather be regarded as new, additional metaphors in their own right?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0018726713494165">2</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Could other fields of inquiry (e.g. astronomy, astrology, physics, anthropology, biology, archaeology, geography, literary studies, religion) provide new insights and/or new metaphors for organization?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Are Morgan’s images universal, and, hence, can they:</p>
<list id="list4-0018726713494165" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>- do justice to indigenous organization theories, perspectives and lives?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>- do justice to organization theories and perspectives within all cultures, ethnicities and religions?</p></list-item>
</list></list-item></list>
<p>We emphasize that the focus of the Special Issue is critical debate on the usefulness of the eight images in the book and whether we need others, rather than on ‘organizational metaphors’ per se. Hence, we are <italic>not</italic> looking for manuscripts that revisit the images or ones that predominantly address the topic of metaphor per se, given that this topic has been discussed extensively elsewhere.</p>

<p>We wish to emphasize that Professor Gareth Morgan has had no role whatsoever in the development of this Call for Papers, nor has the idea come from him. Professor Morgan has kindly agreed to respond to the papers that are selected by the guest editors in the form of a commentary/essay that can take a view of the field and future directions, but he will <italic>not</italic> be involved in any editorial decision-making or any other editorial work. It was Roy Suddaby (University of Alberta, Canada) who recommended us to invite Professor Gareth Morgan to comment on the selected papers.</p>
