<abstract>
<p>This article analyses the continuities and changes in principal development in mainland China over the past two decades by assessing the role of the state in shaping principal development over this period. The article outlines and analyses the 14 key policies that have shaped the practice of principal development. The main changes identified include formal recognition of the need for and potential of principal development to effect change in schools; growth in the number and background of training providers; and shifts in the stated purpose, content, curriculum and pedagogy of principal development programmes. The ‘continuities’ are the enduring power of the state in shaping the ideology that dominates principal development, such as framing it as both a national obligation and a right. We argue that the state has maintained a strong role in shaping principal development in mainland China over the last two decades, but at the same time, has (at least rhetorically) sought to promote increased school autonomy and build more effective schools. This indicates that principal development stands at an important juncture in China.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The importance of principals and principal development to successful educational reform and school improvement has been established internationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741143213485463">Darling-Hammond et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741143213485463">Hallinger and Heck, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1741143213485463">Pont et al., 2008</xref>). In the Asia-Pacific region, principals are seen as critical for effective policy implementation and the achievement of external accountability goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741143213485463">Hallinger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1741143213485463">Walker, 2011</xref>). Across the region, policymakers openly acknowledge that successful reform implementation within a complex, unpredictable environment calls for principals with greater knowledge, understanding and expertise than was previously necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741143213485463">Hallinger, 2003a</xref>). As in Western societies, regional governments have moved aggressively to scale-up preparation, induction and in-service professional development to support principal growth and capacity development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741143213485463">Huber, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1741143213485463">Pont et al., 2008</xref>). How development is conceptualized and operationalized, however, varies as much within the region as it does across different societies globally, and relates to an amalgam of contextual variables. Key among these is the extent to which the state ‘controls' principal development and, conversely, the role that principals themselves play in their own formal development.</p>
<p>Over the last decade or so, governments around the world have moved to explicitly influence principal development. This has taken several forms, including monopolized provision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741143213485463">Bush et al., 2005</xref>), targeted financial support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741143213485463">Orr et al., 2010</xref>), tighter regulation, closer involvement in accreditation and licensure requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1741143213485463">Murphy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741143213485463">Orr et al., 2010</xref>) and through definition of leadership standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741143213485463">Anderson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741143213485463">Duignan and Hurley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741143213485463">Gronn, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1741143213485463">Murphy et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>At the same time, often in line with increased state interest, central agencies have sought to elevate the role of the profession in shaping and running principal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1741143213485463">Moller and Schratz, 2008</xref>). For example, various systems have moved noticeably away from a preference for university-based programmes as the major hub for principal development and towards increased professional control, albeit within central frameworks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741143213485463">Bryant et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741143213485463">Orr et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The state plays various roles in shaping principal development across different domains, and there are different ways of looking at this. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741143213485463">Dale (1997</xref>) suggests that roles and subsequent influence may be determined by three governance activities: funding, regulation and provision. Depending on the context, these can directly affect the professional validity of certificates, programme priorities, timing, provision, purpose, curriculum, content and pedagogy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741143213485463">Huber, 2004</xref>). However, how these forces shape principal development, especially in traditionally centralized systems, has been largely ignored in the literature. This is especially true in China where the quest for ‘modern' approaches to policy implementation, which are often built around imported conceptualizations, can contradict traditional norms and ingrained political ideologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1741143213485463">Qian and Walker, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1741143213485463">Walker and Qian, 2012</xref>). This article examines the role of the state in determining principal professional development in mainland China.</p>
<p>China's recent performance in PISA has attracted interest around the world. A chief area of interest is what Chinese principals do to lead high performing schools and how they are trained to do so. However, it is hard to find an analysis in either the English or Chinese literature that usefully informs wider debate on the topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741143213485463">Huang and Wiseman, 2011</xref>). This mirrors the status quo across the broader field of educational leadership, where the vast majority of research and commentary is dominated by Anglo-American language, theory, practice and structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1741143213485463">Walker et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1741143213485463">2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Part of this scarcity of research on principal development in China is because the country is so large, dense and diverse. China has the greatest number of schools and principals of any nation in the world. In 2010, there were 375,729<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1741143213485463">1</xref>
</sup> schools. Each school has leaders at different career stages involved in different development programmes. This immense scale makes broad-stroke analysis challenging, but nevertheless important.</p>
<p>The recent history of state-dominated involvement in the principal development system can be tracked to the late 1980s, with the release of the milestone document <italic>Strengthening the Training for Principals of Elementary and Secondary Schools Nation-wide </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741143213485463">Chu et al., 2009</xref>). Other important policies in the area flowed over the next 20 years, as outlined later. These policies aimed to guide practice in principal development and were framed within a national strategy, backed by an extensive general educational reform agenda that aimed to improve school education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741143213485463">Lo et al., 2010</xref>). The policies issued by the state largely directed principal development activity by regulating selected providers to implement predetermined programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741143213485463">Feng, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741143213485463">Li and Feng, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Polices targeting principal development in China are in effect the state's declaration of intent, and as such embody the state’s basic understanding of the importance of such development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741143213485463">Dye, 1998</xref>). These policies thus form the requirements upon which institutions and principals base their actions, and play a critical role in shaping principal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741143213485463">Darling-Hammond et al., 2010</xref>). Our aim in this article is to better understand principal development in China by analysing the most recent policies. More specifically, our analysis seeks to identify the changes and continuities in principal development in mainland China over the past two decades, and the role of the state in shaping principal development over the same period. The article is guided by the following three questions.</p>

<title>Framework: Governance of Principal Development</title>
<p>In analysing the relationship between state and education, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741143213485463">Dale (1997</xref>) put forward a structure of education governance that includes three distinct and separable activities: how education is funded; how it is regulated (or controlled); and how it is provided (or delivered). In comparing principal development in 15 countries, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741143213485463">Huber (2004</xref>) used three dimensions to compare and understand principal development. Huber's dimensions include <italic>providers </italic>(monopoly or market, centralized or decentralized planning and implementation of programmes); <italic>target group and nature of participation</italic>; and<italic> aims, content and pedagogy</italic>. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741143213485463">Table 1</xref> shows how the state shapes principal development in different countries through funding, regulation and provision activities. This serves as the analytical framework for understanding corresponding practice in China.</p>

<p>Examining the role of the state necessarily entails some discussion of the profession. Although researchers have explored the meaning of ‘profession’ in English-speaking countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741143213485463">Johnson, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741143213485463">Jones, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1741143213485463">Vollmer and Mills, 1966</xref>), little research has explored the construct in socialist countries where professionals are always state employees. In China, the state is not only the employer but also retains tight control over the context within which different professions operate – this includes, for example, lawyers and doctors as well as teachers and principals. Because of the long shadow cast by the state, professionals in China operate in a different context from their counterparts in countries such as the USA and UK where state involvement in employment and control are much more limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741143213485463">Krause, 1990</xref>). Therefore, principal development in China works within a state-profession nexus that is very different from most Western societies.</p>

<title>Method, Data Source and Policies</title>
<p>To answer the guiding questions, we identified and analysed the 14 key principal development policy documents released between 1989 and 2010. Any national level policy that explicitly addressed principal development was included. As such, we included all national policies explicitly addressing principal development within the designated target time frame in our analysis.</p>
<p>Among the 14 policy documents, four main types were identified (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741143213485463">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>The first type includes macro educational reform policies that set the broader scene for principal development. The second type includes policies that directly guide the administration and enactment of principal development. From 2001, polices on principal development included policies on the training of educational cadres. ‘Cadre’ (<italic>ganbu</italic>) refers to people who are in a position of leadership and authority, that is, the professional staff that form the backbone of the Party apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1741143213485463">Pieke, 2009</xref>: 28). In addition to principals, educational cadres include Party and government officials in educational departments, university leaders, key researchers and teachers in the philosophical and social sciences, and backbone teachers teaching ideological and political theory in universities. Principal development is an integral part of cadre training. This explains why few independent policies on principal development are included in this wider category. Hence, the third type comprises policies targeting the training of educational cadres. The fourth category includes personnel policies relevant to principal accreditation, promotion and ongoing succession. These policies are included to show the importance that the state has recently placed on principal development through clarifying expectations around principal certification, qualifications and evaluation. These policies thus provide important practical insights into principal development in China.</p>
<p>Policies were analysed using a form of content analysis. Policy contents were coded manually and independently by two of the authors, and then compared, combined and refined. Three other Chinese scholars familiar with principal development in China were asked to check the coding and provide feedback. Their feedback served to refine the coding and accuracy of placement. Codes were designed around categories provided by Dale’s (1997) and Huber‘s (2004) framework.</p>
<sec id="section4-1741143213485463">
<title>Stages of Principal Development in China</title>
<p>The state has organized principal development in China over the last few decades through a multi-tiered system of structural and ideological control. Principal development is managed through four administrative divisions: national, provincial, municipal and county. Within these divisions, programmes are divided into three basic (hierarchical) levels. These cater for different stages in the careers of principals, namely, qualification training, improving training and advanced training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741143213485463">MOE, 1999</xref>). The characteristics of these levels are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1741143213485463">Table 3</xref>.</p>

<p>Training providers supply programmes covering the four divisions across some or all of the three different career levels. These are further delineated by school type (elementary, middle and senior secondary). As a general rule, elementary school principals seek qualifications and improving training from county-level providers, middle school principals from municipal-level providers and senior secondary school principals from provincial-level providers. In addition, principals regarded as excellent at any level will be selected to attend advanced training in national training centres in Beijing and Shanghai. Further, given the diversity of governance and the variance in economic and social development across provinces, some provinces may also provide principal development to different groups of principals.</p>
<p>Principals in China are quasi civil servants whose appointment and promotion are made by the local educational authority. Principals have minimal influence on the form or content of their development programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741143213485463">Chu and Yang, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The evolution of principal development in China roughly parallels the procession of the all-encompassing National Five-year Plans. Given the influence of the policies attached to the plans we used the time-delineation of the plans to define and organize our analysis of principal development policy. As such, our review traverses approximately five Five-year Plans. These are used to describe five stages of principal development. The first stage is the Eighth Five-year Plan (1991–1995), the second the Ninth Five-year Plan (1996–2000), the third the Tenth Five-year Plan (2001–2005), the fourth the Eleventh Five-year Plan (2006–2010) and the fifth stage the Twelfth Five-year Plan (2011–2015). These stages are outlined below.</p>
<sec id="section5-1741143213485463">
<title>Principal Development in the First Stage (1991–1995)</title>
<p>Two important policies were released to guide principal development during this stage. These were <italic>Strengthening the Training of Principals of Elementary and Secondary Schools Nationwide</italic> (State Education Commission [SEC], 1989) and the <italic>Qualification Training for Elementary and Secondary School Principals</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1741143213485463">SEC, 1990</xref>). These policies laid the foundation for principal development. They detailed the allocation and definition of levels of organization and responsibility, permitted providers, the purposes of training, content and centralized support measures. These policies called for educational officials and training institutions across levels to provide opportunities for every school principal. This was considered a major step forward.</p>
<p>During this stage, the state framework for principal development was heavily grounded in official Party ideology, which largely determined the tenor of the training activity and formal certification. This ideological dominance was explicitly stated in the driving purpose of development, which was to improve the political calibre and professional quality of principals, and to equip them with ‘profound’ Marxist theoretical knowledge and ‘political quality’. Principals were expected to consciously uphold the Four Cardinal Principles and maintain the socialist direction of schooling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1741143213485463">SEC, 1989</xref>). Political theory, including the foundations of Marxism, Maoism and Chinese Socialist Construction, was mandated as a compulsory unit accounting for more than 30 per cent of the total training requirement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1741143213485463">SEC, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>On a more pragmatic level, policies released during this stage promoted the integration of principal development with other leader building and career progression mechanisms. For example, principal development was more clearly tied to principal evaluation, promotion and succession. It was also connected to formal authorization and certification – content and curriculum were more tightly regulated. Importantly, polices during this stage mandated that all principals had to participate in state-defined development programmes.</p>
<p>For the first time, the central government and its downstream agencies (such as provincial level entities) authorized providers to carry out training for different levels of schooling and granted permission for them to issue formal certificates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1741143213485463">SEC, 1990</xref>). These agencies prescribed the purpose and (largely) the content of programmes, and also suggested different pedagogical approaches by providing national instructional outlines and syllabi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1741143213485463">SEC, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>The priority policy during this stage was geared toward formal qualification. Principals were required to participate in training with an authorized training agency to gain a formal qualification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1741143213485463">SEC, 1989</xref>). Training was also explicitly related to principal performance management, succession and promotion. The <italic>National qualification and requirement of elementary and secondary school principal </italic>clearly stated that principals must attend training and obtain a formal qualification certificate after being appointed as principal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1741143213485463">SEC, 1991</xref>). Initially, the training was compensatory in nature, and all principals, not only new principals, had to undergo training to obtain the formal qualification certificate. <italic>Suggestions for development of elementary and secondary school principals (for trial implementation)</italic> required principals to ‘have (a) qualified certificate before taking up a post’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1741143213485463">The Organization Department of Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and SEC, 1992</xref>). The rationale for this was explained in the State Council’s<italic> Outline for Chinese education reform and development</italic>: ‘it [the policy] aimed to implement the million principals training plan and ensure that every principal held a formal qualification certificate before taking up a post (<italic>Chi Zheng Shang Gang</italic>) by 1997’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1741143213485463">State Council, 1994</xref>, article 25).</p>

<title>Principal Development in the Second Stage (1996–2000)</title>
<p>Issued in December 1995, the State Education Commission directive document on principal training for elementary and secondary schools in the Ninth Five-year Plan (1996–2000) period is widely seen as the most influential policy on principal development during this stage. It guided much of the thinking and activity during this period and beyond. The focus was to consolidate the importance of principal certification and to scale up the quality and quantity of higher level training and certification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1741143213485463">SEC, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>A feature of policies in this period was the positioning of principals and principal development within the wider reform agenda. The SEC policy made this clear: ‘principal training is the basis for basic education reform and development, thus it has strategic meaning for the implementation of the nine-year compulsory education and the improvement of the overall quality of education and administration’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1741143213485463">SEC, 1995</xref>). The quality thrust introduced during this stage shaped major policy goals in China from then on, and continues to have an influence today (see the National Ninth [1996–2000], Tenth [2001–2005], Eleventh [2006–2010] Five-year Plans, and even the Twelfth [2011–2015] Five-year Plan).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1741143213485463">
<title>Principal Development in the Third Stage (2001–2005)</title>
<p>This period witnessed the consolidation of the guiding framework introduced in <italic>Training regulations of elementary and secondary school principal</italic>, which detailed the purpose, content, administration, responsibility and teaching plans for qualification, and the improvement of overall provision. The policy maintained centralized control over ideological and formal mechanisms across the four levels (national [state], provincial, municipal and county level).</p>
<p>The State Council of Educational Administrative exerts macro-control over nationwide principal training. Their responsibilities include making policies, regulations and plans to support and regulate principal training; formulating and organizing implementation of comprehensive plans on principal training; formulating instructional training documents, organizing, recommending and approving training textbooks to be used; building an evaluation system; and directing local implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741143213485463">MOE, 1999</xref>: ch. 3, art. 10).</p>
<p>Provincial educational departments are in charge of local principal training; formulating local principal training plans and supporting policies; taking charge of the implementation, inspection and evaluation of principal training in their areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741143213485463">MOE, 1999</xref>: ch. 3, art. 11).</p>
<p>In short, training was to be carried out by training institutions across the four levels but in accordance with strict state regulation which included control over system administration and the certification of providers.</p>
<p>Policies during this stage introduced the three differentiated (hierarchical) levels of training: certification training for new principals; improving training for those already certified (with up to 5 years of experience) and advanced training for 'backbone' principals (<italic>gugan xiaozhang</italic> – a title granted to principals considered by the state to be outstanding). Training in effect became not just the ‘the right but (the) obligation of the principal, new principals have to obtain the qualification certificate (no less than 300 contact/instructional hours) before taking post. Obtaining the ‘improving qualification' certificate (no less than 240 contact/instructional hours) within 5 years after acquiring the initial qualification is a prerequisite for incumbent principals to remain (in post)’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741143213485463">MOE, 1999</xref>: ch. 1, art. 5).</p>
<p>Principal development in this period was an integral part of the wider educational cadre system. As noted, cadre refers to any educational leader, not just principals, and includes university leaders and Party and government officials engaged in education. Although we focus on principals in this article, the reforms delineated in this stage also apply to these groups.</p>
<p>Alignment with the quality education reform agenda was addressed in several documents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741143213485463">MOE, 1999</xref>, 2001, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741143213485463">2002</xref>). Advanced training for backbone principals was highlighted as important, indeed, such training has long been embedded in leader development in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741143213485463">MOE, 2001</xref>). To guarantee the overall quality of provision, a unified directive teaching plan and textbooks were recommended. Institutions at different levels were required to execute the <italic>Directive Teaching Plan for Principal Qualification Training and Improving Training</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1741143213485463">Personnel Division of the MOE, 2001</xref>). Educational administrative departments at different levels were also required to monitor textbook usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741143213485463">MOE, 2002</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1741143213485463">
<title>Principal Development in the Fourth Stage (2006–2010)</title>
<p>The focus during this period was on how to expand training coverage to address the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee’s policy of the ‘large-scale training of cadres’. In this policy, the state stressed the training of grass-roots, rural and low-performing school principals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741143213485463">MOE, 2007</xref>). The programme content focused on the fundamentals of school management practice, such as budgeting and personnel management. At the same time, differentiated training programmes were provided for special target groups such as principals in rural areas or boarding school principals. This can be seen as the beginning of an attempt to address equity issues in schools in general and the leaders of these schools in particular.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1741143213485463">
<title>Principal Development in the Fifth Stage (2011–2015)</title>
<p>In the current period, the state has yet again reiterated that the main task of principal development is to facilitate the implementation of quality education, with renewed emphasis on the training of rural school principals, principals in areas serving ethnic minorities and leaders of disadvantaged urban school. In alignment with national policies that seek the more balanced development of compulsory education and the concerted development of urban and rural education, the state will implement a Quality Improvement Programme for rural elementary and secondary school principals in the largely poor mid-west provinces of China. To facilitate the development and preparation of education-focused principals, the state has decided to implement Advanced Training Programmes for outstanding elementary and secondary school principals (Leading Party group of MOE, 2010).</p>

<title>Changes in Principal Development</title>
<sec id="section12-1741143213485463">
<title>Formal Recognition of the Need for Leader Development to Effect School Change</title>
<p>The two decades under study witnessed a change in state perceptions of the fundamental purpose of principal development. Policies made before the mid-1990s stressed the importance of ideology in principal development, mainly to reinforce socialism and cultivate the construction and enhancement of the socialist entrepreneur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1741143213485463">SEC, 1989</xref>). However, although the strong ideological component was certainly not neglected, later policies moved to link more closely with broader educational reform agendas such as compulsory education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1741143213485463">SEC, 1995</xref>), quality education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741143213485463">MOE, 1999</xref>), new rural construction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741143213485463">MOE, 2007</xref>), the balanced development of compulsory education and a concerted effort to develop education for the urban and rural poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741143213485463">Leading Party Group of MOE, 2010</xref>). Policy measures set out to maximize the capacity of principals to implement government policy, and established that the fundamental role of school principals was to represent, articulate and implement government educational policies at the school level.</p>
<p>As such, state policymakers viewed principals as key conduits of the new reforms. Beyond this, however, policymakers also recognized that the skilful implementation of reforms would require a higher level of administrative and leadership expertise than was typically demonstrated by the existing cohort of school leaders. The policy response to this was to arm principals with new knowledge to help them to raise the standards and standing of their schools.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1741143213485463">
<title>Expansion of the Number and Background of Training Providers</title>
<p>From 1989 to the end of the 1990s, training was provided predominantly by normal universities or colleges and official educational institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1741143213485463">SEC, 1989</xref>) approved by the state and provincial departments of the educational administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1741143213485463">SEC, 1990</xref>). The <italic>Training Regulations for Elementary and Secondary School Principals </italic>issued in 1999 granted several comprehensive universities the right to provide training. Along with these universities, an increasing number of other bodies, such as research institutes, were encouraged to play an active role in principal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741143213485463">MOE, 2007</xref>). Although the broadening of the provider base has served to break the monopoly held by the small group of traditional providers and made it possible for different providers to address quality concerns, the state retains ultimate control through its sole right to authorize providers.</p>
<p>The state's decision to expand the number of training providers increased the number and quality of institutions involved in order to build the capacity of more principals to implement educational reforms. At the same time, however, the state maintained control of authorization, and also the substance of principal development programmes. This substance continued to hold a large ideological component, and was heavily influenced by the aims of the reforms themselves.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1741143213485463">
<title>Shift in Purpose</title>
<p>The purpose of principal development policy has shifted from positioning principals as technicians to positioning them as leaders of quality education. Over the past two decades, policy has repositioned the principal from an educational specialist with an emphasis on practical experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1741143213485463">SEC, 1989</xref>), to a principal who is a scientific manager in a reform environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1741143213485463">SEC, 1995</xref>), to a principal who is an instructional and management expert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741143213485463">MOE, 1999</xref>), and finally to a principal who is a leader of quality education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741143213485463">MOE, 2007</xref>). Such shifts in purpose reflect the state's attempted realignment of training with wider educational reform initiatives. Nevertheless, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741143213485463">Feng (2003</xref>), principal development in China has been slow to develop the types of competencies and skills needed for effective leadership within a complex reform environment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1741143213485463">
<title>Expanded Content and Curriculum</title>
<p>The content and curriculum of principal development programmes have expanded markedly alongside the flurry of quality education reforms and capacities that the state projects are needed to lead change. On the surface, this appears to be a movement away from the heavy ideological weighting of the traditional curriculum, but this may be cosmetic. For example, the curricular content during the Eighth Five-year Plan period was explicitly ideologically oriented, and had significant amounts of political theory, including the foundations of Marxism and Maoism. In fact, Chinese Socialist Construction accounted for one third of the total courses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1741143213485463">SEC, 1989</xref>). In the Ninth Five Year Plan (1996–2000) period and the Tenth Five Year Plan (2001–2005) period, the curriculum changed nomenclature, and included topics such as political theory and the cultivation of ideological morality, which nevertheless continued to uphold socialist ideas. However, policies flowing from these plans also added topics such as educational policies and regulations, modern educational theory and practice, school management and practice, modern educational technology, modern technology and humanities and social sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741143213485463">MOE, 1999</xref>). The Eleventh Five Year Plan (2006–2010) period witnessed an even heavier loading of reform-related topics, such as the implementation of quality education, and more coherent approaches to school leadership. It also added the flexibility for providers in different contexts to adjust the programme content and curriculum, except for the parts related to ideological education.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1741143213485463">
<title>Fuller Participation</title>
<p>Pedagogical guidelines have shifted from minimal or none to full participation, and attempts to construct Chinese versions of communities of practice. Such initiatives appear to mirror current Western thinking, although it is not explicitly linked to this. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1741143213485463">Taylor et al. (2009</xref>) analysed the pedagogy used in learning and teaching in educational leadership programmes in the USA. They differentiated pedagogies used in educational leadership programmes by the extent to which people participated in a community of practice, namely, minimal or none, peripheral and full participation. Such work helps to explain pedagogical shifts advocated by the state. The Eighth Five-year Plan period fitted the minimal/none category of participation by principals in their learning. The pedagogical thrust was traditional, largely retaining the one-way transmission of formal knowledge. Learning was predominantly ‘part-time, self study and short time, off-shore training’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1741143213485463">SEC, 1989</xref>), and the main pedagogy was ‘independent self-study and concentrated lecture’, supplemented by seminars, experience sharing and thesis writing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1741143213485463">SEC, 1989</xref>). During the Ninth Five-year Plan and Tenth Five-year Plan periods, pedagogy was built around theoretical teaching, self-study, seminar, case studies, field visits and thesis writing. Given certain cultural nuances, this can be classified as peripheral participation. During the Eleventh Five-year Plan period, fuller participation in communities of practice is advocated, mainly through pedagogies including shadowing and attachment to more experienced principals.</p>
<p>In sum, the pedagogy advocated by the state has changed from one of minimal or no participation by principals to fuller participation in communities of practice, at least in a form that suits Chinese preferences. However, in many respects this remains rhetorical, and greater participation requires the state to invest more human, financial and professional resources into principal development processes. This may be particularly true given that the ‘large-scale training strategy’ embedded in the Tenth and Eleventh Five-year Plans depends very much on the growth of distance education supported by better technological resources.</p>

<title>Continuities in Principal Development</title>
<p>Principal development in china is centrally regulated but implemented through different levels of government or semi-government agencies throughout the country. The centralized state hierarchical policy structure shapes what principal development should look like and how it is enacted. For example, the content of <italic>Training Regulations for Elementary and Secondary School Principals </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741143213485463">MOE, 1999</xref>) has endured regardless of other changes. Principal development is still administered by the four levels of administrative agencies, which oversee, accredit and monitor all programmes, regardless of level. Although the four levels by necessity operate somewhat independently, they are the key cogs in what remains, politically, a highly state-dominated enterprise. The state retains firm control of policymaking, curriculum, content and strategy. The other levels are tasked predominantly with implementation rather than innovation, and whereas local relevance is paid increasing lip service, this, in some respects, may be illusionary. In effect, principal development in China remains, as it has been since the founding of the new China, driven by policies that are stipulated, regulated and implemented by the state and attendant agencies.</p>
<p>Despite the modernizing components packaged in recent policies, the decentralization of principal development stops short of cascading further than formal state agencies. Any decentralization that has occurred as the result of policy change has been between the central and local governments, not between local government and schools. Given that the vast majority of schools are publicly funded and government regulated, any policy issued by the state, regardless of tenor, is in effect a policy edict that is to be strictly followed.</p>

<sec id="section19-1741143213485463">
<title>Discussion: Double-edged Role of Strong State in Principal Development</title>
<p>Several conclusions can be drawn from the analysis. First, on the plus side, increased state interest in principal development has:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>highlighted the key role of the principal in successful reform implementation;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>raised the profile of principal development and increased the number of providers;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>pumped considerable resources into principal development, thereby providing learning opportunities for large numbers of principals;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>instituted a measure of consistency in terms of intent, curriculum, content and access that was previously missing.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The fact that the state has acknowledged the importance of the role of principals in successful reform implementation and made principal development a priority is a positive step. The money pumped into the endeavour is symbolically important at the very least. As a result of policy provision, principals can study full time while still receiving full pay and benefits. They are thus given the time and funding to pursue development, an advantage that may be envied by principals in other countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1741143213485463">Su et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The state's hierarchical approach to principal development lays an explicit foundation for all aspects, from intent to content. This control promotes consistency and maximizes the chances that policy will be faithfully and efficiently implemented across the country. This is important given the size of the principal population: it is estimated that more than one million school principals have participated in different forms of development programmes. This is no small feat given the logistics involved and it is doubtful that this could have been achieved without strong top-down centralized control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1741143213485463">Wu and Ehrich, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>If the state had not taken a strong proactive approach to principal development, it would not have achieved the status and spread that it presently possesses. It has undoubtedly been successful in getting things going quickly and raising awareness of what is expected of principals and providers, and of enhancing the basic technical skills of school leaders.</p>
<p>However, there are several downsides to the strong central control of principal development. Strong state control of principal development across all levels:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>continues to focus on ideology and basic skills rather than the knowledge needed to lead change;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>restricts involvement to those either in post or already selected for principalship;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>hinders the power of localized agencies to contextualize programmes;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>negates the power of the profession to shape its own development.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The implicit assumption behind state involvement in China is that the state knows what needs to be done, how to do it and how to get people to do what needs to be done. These assumptions appear to be based on political intention rather than any empirical basis about principalship in China, successful change leadership or implementation strategies that connect to school reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1741143213485463">Qian and Walker, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1741143213485463">Walker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1741143213485463">Walker and Qian, 2012</xref>). Whereas prescription may work well for training principals in basic leadership routines, it is less likely to be effective in helping them to navigate the messy world of meaningful implementation. As such, an overreliance on policy edicts to mandate action may not be effective in producing sustainable changes in the mindsets and practice of principals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741143213485463">Lashway, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Entrance into principal development in China is largely a one-way street (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741143213485463">Lo et al., 2010</xref>). Only state appointees have access and are funded to attend development programmes, which in turn are run by selected state-regulated institutions that award state-accredited qualifications. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1741143213485463">Yang (2005</xref>) pointed out, essential qualification is open to incumbent principals only or those already appointed, not those aspiring to principalship or a few steps removed from the job. As such, the state controls the only real pathways between training and appointment. This excludes those aspiring to a principalship or those seeking to build the capacity to position themselves for the role in future. This raises questions about the efficacy of only developing leaders when they are or are soon to be principals.</p>
<p>Top-down policy assumes that the state is able to see the diverse components of a huge organization and is able to coordinate work through prescription. However, given the massive diversity and uneven social, economic and educational development within China, it is questionable whether standard prescription can work without concomitant structures that provide space for contextual adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741143213485463">Li and Feng, 2001</xref>). This may also entail more discriminatory funding to equalize offerings in more disadvantaged provinces and areas. This fits with established arguments that the planning and delivery of effective leadership development programmes are best derived from the local context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741143213485463">Hallinger, 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1741143213485463">Walker, 2011</xref>). Thus, detailed directives from the top may not make sense for sustainable principal development in China.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most telling example of the lack of opportunity to address localized needs is found in the new curriculum. Although the government has introduced apparently significant changes to the curriculum and content of principal development programmes, the bundle remains prescriptive and retains a large ideological component. Fixed regulation has introduced some change, but this is built around centralized needs assessment that focuses predominantly on equally defined policy implementation. This leaves little room for providers to innovate or effectively contextualize what they teach.</p>
<p>The lack of opportunity to contextualize is compounded by the monopolization of allowable providers. Despite the considerable increase in the number of providers, the field is strictly controlled and there is little room for non-state agencies to be involved.</p>
<p>The state's dictate likewise leaves little room for the profession or other educational communities to have a meaningful input into their own formal growth and development. Thus, principals as a professional group have very little input into their own development. This builds on the argument for providing more space to contextualize development. Principals themselves have little or no input into the content of programmes, which creates the risk that important school level factors that are not understood by either the state or accredited providers are omitted. The principals' needs around school-level planning and implementation tend to be neglected. Much of the programme content is discipline oriented and often irrelevant to the principals’ real work. As a result, the programmes provided fail to motivate principals or to generate more connected development opportunities that closer interaction with professional input might bring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741143213485463">Lv, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1741143213485463">Xiao, 2005</xref>). This flies in the face of current understandings of the value of greater professional involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1741143213485463">Walker and Dimmock, 2006</xref>). The neglect of professional input makes it difficult to increase the impact of principal development in schools.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In terms of the categories displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741143213485463">Table 1</xref>, the state is directly and deeply involved in rule-based regulation, provision and funding of principal development. This indicates that despite recent shifts in policy emphasis, the state retains firm control of almost all aspects that shape the definition and enactment of principal development. The assumptions behind the new policies assume that well-conceived and well-designed training will enhance the capability of principals to increase the success of educational reforms and so lead to improved schools. In short, the policies are designed to address perceived shortfalls in school leader capacity and build on existing strengths to create the necessary transformation. However, in practice, this ‘Ideal state’ exists mainly in the minds of those initiating and commissioning the development and falls squarely within functionalist discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741143213485463">Mabey and Finch-Lees, 2008</xref>). The next stage in policy development may consider instituting a framework that allows for more flexible adaptation and greater involvement by the profession in determining needs, shape and function. Whether this is possible given the state's deeply ingrained need for ideological and structural control is a matter of conjecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1741143213485463">Williams, 1995</xref>). Whereas central recognition of the importance of leader development is an important step forward, while principal development remains based on a one-size-fits-all model and denies the meaningful input of the profession, the effective and sustainable development of further initiatives may struggle.</p>
