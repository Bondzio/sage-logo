<abstract>
<p>Patriarchal norms of the Indian family and normative development goals of gender equity and women's empowerment make uncomfortable bedfellows. This article examines the processes of institutional bricolage that occur with the overlap of these two institutional spaces using ethnographic evidence from two family-based NGOs. It finds that although there is evidence of decoupling between formal structures and actual practices, this does not discount the potential for the transformation of gender norms. I identify three factors that influence this potential: the distance between NGOs and donors; the basis upon which NGOs claim legitimacy with their clientele; and the use of other coercive forms of power. Further, I argue that organizations do not consist of a single institutional space, and that the possibilities for uneven ‘bricolage’ need consideration. These findings are theoretically relevant for understanding processes of institutional bricolage, as well as practically for feminist projects to transform gender norms in, and through, NGOs.</p>

<p>The moon had finally risen, and Smita<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1466138111420507">1</xref></sup> was about to break her fast that started at sunrise. On the roof of their home, Smita paid tribute to the moon, then circled Senthil, her husband, with a brass plate and fed him some food. Senthil poured the first water Smita had tasted since daybreak from a brass vessel into her mouth. Teerji is an annual Hindu practice, in which wives honour their husband and the moon through a day-long fast. Wives show their devotion to their husband and their desire for his well-being above all other concerns. Performance of the ritual helps secure a healthy loving husband: a guard against the inauspicious state of widowhood.</p>
<p>Senthil and Smita, as well as husband and wife, are also secretary and director respectively of the non-government organization (NGO) Education and Enterprise for Development (EED). The entire staff of eight were assembled in the family home for the ritual, four belonging to a joint family, with a further two members from their village, but not directly related. The combination of NGO and family in celebrations was therefore common. As usual, this ritual turned to frivolity. Sushma undertook the ritual with far less seriousness than her sister, pouring water into the mouth of Akil, her husband. Jokingly, Smita's son poured water from a vessel into my mouth, and then their other son into the mouth of Rohit, the driver. Everyone was laughing, as we descended the stairs to eat cake and other snacks.</p>
<p>This overlap of the family and the NGO, as well as the relationship between husband and wife/secretary and director, is more than the sharing of festive occasions. It is also the overlap of two institutional spaces, with different, and at times conflicting, norms and values. The Hindu teerji ritual reflects patriarchal values of wife devotion; the NGO, however, operates within the development sector that explicitly rejects patriarchy and strives for gender equity and women's empowerment. This article explores this tension, using ethnographic evidence from two family NGOs to examine the ways they straddle the moral universes of the development sector and the patriarchal norms of a broader socio-cultural context. In particular, it looks for the potential of institutional transformation, as a result of the coming together of these competing worldviews.</p>
<p>In doing so, my intention is to contribute to the growing body of literature that explores institutional change. Cultural neo-institutionalism posits that cognitive frames shape organizational form and behaviour, resulting in institutional persistence and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1466138111420507">DiMaggio and Powell, 1991</xref>). More recently, there have been calls for greater theoretical development and empirical studies that examine the mechanisms and conditions which result in either institutional change or persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1466138111420507">Campbell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1466138111420507">Schimdt, 2008</xref>). I seek to contribute to this endeavour using a comparison of two NGOs to answer: when do ideas of women's empowerment transform gender relations in a family-based NGO? And when do gender relations remain stable despite external challenges to NGO legitimacy as a result?</p>
<p>The findings of this article tentatively suggest that the overlap between a family and NGO result in processes of institutional bricolage in which NGO practices and management are derived from family norms and values. This results in decoupling; while common in the NGO sector more generally, the family structure further facilitates the maintenance of symbolic adherence to ‘women's empowerment’ (as wives become symbolic leaders), as well as the actual maintenance of patriarchal power by appealing to family values. At the same time, family NGOs are also sites for the potential translation of ideas of women's empowerment to the broader socio-cultural context: in the families themselves and, by example, to the local populations in which they work. Such a result is by no means assured, however, requiring more research into the factors that shape norms and practices in NGOs. These findings are theoretically relevant for understanding processes of institutional change and persistence, as well as practically for feminist projects to transform gender norms in, and through, NGOs</p>
<sec id="sec1-1466138111420507"><title>Neo-institutional approaches to organizations</title>
<p>Neo-institutional approaches have significantly advanced understandings of organizations, their form and function. Each of the three branches of neo-institutionalism takes a different set of criteria for explaining why institutions take, and retain, a particular institutional form: rational self-interest in the case of rational institutionalism; path-dependent trajectories in the case of historical comparative institutionalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1466138111420507">Hall and Taylor, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1466138111420507">Schmidt, 2008</xref>). It has been the identification of the importance of cognitive frames, norms and values found in cultural (or sociological) institutionalism that has proven most useful in understanding organizational form and behaviour across different sectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1466138111420507">DiMaggio and Powell, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1466138111420507">Dowling and Pfeffer, 1975</xref>).</p>
<p>Cultural institutionalism views organizations not as rational actors, but as institutions whose decisions are limited by the environments in which they operate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1466138111420507">DiMaggio and Powell, 1991</xref>). An important component of cultural institutionalism is the focus on ‘nonlocal environments’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1466138111420507">DiMaggio and Powell, 1991</xref>). The organization is a member of a sector, or field, which has socializing effects. The broader environment penetrates organizations, ‘creating the lens through which actors view the world and the very categories of structure, action and thought’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1466138111420507">DiMaggio and Powell, 1991</xref>: 13). The definition of appropriate begins with ‘taken-for-granted scripts, schema, habits, and routines that [organizational actors] possess and through which they interpret the world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1466138111420507">Campbell, 2004</xref>: 19). The environment pertaining to the particular institutional field and social context constrains the possibilities individuals conceive, consequent actions, and relations. The iterative effect is a set of standardized behaviours and expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1466138111420507">Schmidt, 2008</xref>). Adherence to these norms is important for organizations’ survival, as legitimacy is tied to the meanings and values of the institutional field. As organizations are located within a broader social setting, these meanings and values are also constructed in reference to the cognitive frames of the various stakeholders upon which organizations depend for their survival. In the case of NGOs, this includes donors, the clients for whom they work, and the broader public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1466138111420507">Tvedt, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Cultural neo-institutionalism posits that as change requires a transformation in cognitive frames, institutions tend to remain stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1466138111420507">DiMaggio and Powell, 1991</xref>). People who perceive the world according to particular scripts and taken-for-granted realities are unable to identify alternative paths or actions. This emphasis on stability can be a weakness of the approach. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1466138111420507">Hay and Wincott (1998)</xref> argue that institutional equilibrium rests upon a deep-structuralism that removes people's agency. Schmidt concurs, and argues that the suggestion that people are constrained in their actions by ‘all-defining cultural norms’ (2008: 304) ignores how actors think outside, and in critique of, prevailing institutional forms. The identification of these limitations has resulted in a growing body of literature across neo-institutional traditions that seeks to understand institutional change (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1466138111420507">Campbell, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Central are the processes of institutional bricolage: the ways that different institutions are welded together. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1466138111420507">Cleaver (2002)</xref> uses institutional bricolage to ‘suggest how mechanisms for resource management and collective action are borrowed or constructed from existing institutions, styles of thinking and sanctioned social relationships’ (p. 16). In other words, as institutions set the parameters of thought, any new institutional arrangements borrow from the analogies and styles of thought (cognitive frames) of existing institutions. Institutions do not emerge in a vacuum, but rather are shaped by the prevailing institutional environment. To stop here, however, fails to ask ‘the reasons why actors create one bricolage instead of another’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1466138111420507">Campbell, 2004</xref>: 65), or the degree of that bricolage. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1466138111420507">Campbell (2004)</xref> argues for the need to distinguish between substantive bricolage, in which practices and principles are recombined, with symbolic bricolage, in which only the symbols of legitimacy are appropriated. Further, researchers need to account for the possibility that ‘symbolic change at one moment may eventually precipitate much more substantive change at another’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1466138111420507">Campbell, 2004</xref>: 43).</p>
<p>The difference between symbolic and substantive bricolage raises the possibility of the partial assimilation of new institutional arrangements that give the appearance of change, but do not alter practice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1466138111420507">Meyer and Rowan (1977)</xref> recognize that socially legitimate ways of conducting activities are not always the most technically efficient. This results in ‘decoupling’, in which organizations maintain ‘standardized, legitimating, formal structures while their activities vary in response to practical considerations’ (1977: 357). The world society literature has usefully adopted the concept of decoupling to demonstrate how organizations and institutions (including states) agree to certain normative conventions, but with limited impact on their practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1466138111420507">Clark, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1466138111420507">Drori et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1466138111420507">Swiss, 2009</xref>). This literature is valuable in going beyond the mismatch of legitimating norms and technical efficiency, to consider how the underlying values of these norms may be in discordance with existing normative and cognitive frameworks. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1466138111420507">Swiss (2009)</xref> examines the gap between women's right to stand for parliament and their actual election. He argues that such a gap arises in part from the disconnect between a world culture (emerging from organizations, professionals and communities of discourses) and the socio-cultural context of a particular country. The potential for such disconnects are seemingly increasing with globalization, as norms and regulatory bodies pan across divergent social contexts.</p>
<p>The need to consider carefully processes of institutional change and persistence therefore appears particularly urgent in the contemporary era. Empirical research is required that can shed light on the changing forms that organizations take in response to shifting environments. In particular, several questions remain, such as: how do new institutional forms combine with existing ones in processes of bricolage? What aspects of institutions remain despite external challenges to legitimacy? How is decoupling (or loose coupling) used to manage potential discordance between organizational norms and practices? And finally, what are the possibilities for symbolic change to culminate in substantive transformation? The extant empirical literature that examines these processes is concentrated at the macro-level, for example, exploring policy changes across national contexts, or transformations across large commercial sectors. I argue that comparative ethnographic accounts of organizations on a micro-scale have much to contribute through attention to the processes of enactment: how actors imbibe and practice new ideas. As Campbell argues: ‘what links macro-level conditions to outcomes are individuals (or groups of individuals) acting at the micro-level in response to their social and institutional situations and to each other’ (2004: 87).</p>

<sec id="sec2-1466138111420507"><title>Gender and development in organizations</title>
<p>This research agenda has practical importance when applied to examine the ways in which organizations become and remain gendered, as well as changes to gendered meanings and behaviours. Feminist accounts of organizations have highlighted how gender relations involving hierarchies, differential advantages, and specific gendered identities are reproduced (or challenged) in everyday interactions, symbols and rituals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1466138111420507">Acker, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1466138111420507">Alvesson and Billing, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1466138111420507">Mills, 1988</xref>). Appropriate behaviours, the division of labour, hierarchies and relations of domination and submission are a part of the organizational culture, and its shared meanings, ideas and definitions of reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1466138111420507">Alvesson and Billing, 2009</xref>). Cultural neo-institutional approaches draw attention to the way that this organizational culture shapes behaviour, while the behaviour of organizational actors reproduces this culture.</p>
<p>By considering ‘nonlocal’ environments, cultural neo-institutionalism positions organizations within the broader social context of which they are a part. Attention to the connections between organizations and this context is important for two reasons. First, organizations are a site in which broader social norms are enacted, and gender played out; organizations reflect these socially constructed norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1466138111420507">Acker, 1990</xref>). Second, organizations are key sites for the construction/invention and reproduction of gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1466138111420507">Acker, 1990</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1466138111420507">Mills (1988)</xref> argues that it is not enough to identify gender norms as socially constructed, attention must be placed on the people and institutions that play a dominant role in <italic>shaping</italic> ‘social reality’. It is therefore important to examine organizations as the bearers of gender and the ways they interrelate with other locations of culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1466138111420507">Mills, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>Herein lies the challenge for feminists: if organizations can be sites for the reproduction of gendered hierarchies, they can also be sites for challenges to, and re-configurations of, taken-for-granted realities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1466138111420507">Alvesson and Billing, 2009</xref>). Processual accounts examine organizations as processes, rather than ‘relatively stable, rational and bounded structures’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1466138111420507">Acker, 1998</xref>: 196). Gender is continually being done; processes reaffirm existing norms and relations, or alternatively, challenge them. Organizations can thereby ‘be seen as sites of gender construction – and as sites of the undoing (downplaying) of gender, when equal opportunity is promoted’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1466138111420507">Alvesson and Billing, 2009</xref>: 119). Organizations reflect, and contribute to, change and continuity in gender norms and relations. Feminists seek to maximize this progressive role by highlighting the gendered nature of organizations, and advocating for changes in formal rules and informal norms.</p>
<p>Development organizations are potential sites for the challenge to gender norms, even as current evidence suggests that they remain heavily gendered. Non-government organizations operate within the institutional field of the development sector; their legitimacy and thereby survival is based on the way their organization reflects the values and norms of the sector. Development objectives of ‘progress’ and ‘development’ often explicitly reject societal norms and seek to transform them. Gender is one such area in which ‘progress’ means a rejection of patriarchy and expansion in the roles that women can play in public life. Norms of gender equity and goals of women's empowerment have been mainstreamed in the development sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1466138111420507">Cornwall et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1466138111420507">Moser and Moser, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>This is no less the case in India. The durability of patriarchal norms in India has made the empowerment of women central to development objectives and inspired the National Policy for the Empowerment of Women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1466138111420507">GOI, 2001</xref>). The latter seeks to provide a social and economic environment that helps women achieve their full potential, and related objectives have been incorporated into successive five year plans directing the state's development efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1466138111420507">GOI, 2007</xref>). NGOs have an identified role in these efforts. The National Policy states that NGOs ‘which have strong grass-roots presence and deep insight into women's concerns have contributed in inspiring initiatives for the empowerment of women’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1466138111420507">GOI, 2001</xref>). Whether NGOs have achieved much in the way of empowering women is beside the point; the inclusion of NGOs in the policy wording reflects the expectation that they incorporate these concerns in their development activities. NGOs, whose legitimacy is based on meeting the expectations of stakeholders such as donors, the state, and the general public, are more likely to succeed if they undertake the prescribed role of ‘empowering women’. Organizational forms and behaviours that reflect related norms have material benefits, with more funds channelled to NGOs that adhere to certain values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1466138111420507">Alvarez, 2009</xref>), and that are managed by and for women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1466138111420507">O'Reilly, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite these initiatives, sadly the extent to which the emphasis on women's empowerment in the development sector has resulted in substantive changes appears limited. In recent special issues revisiting gender and development, the institutionalization of gender and its incorporation into the strategies and language of the development sector appear to strip feminist goals of their political edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1466138111420507">Cornwall and Anyidoho, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1466138111420507">Cornwall et al., 2007</xref>). The sector has preferred the win-win language of women's empowerment, rather than the potentially confronting talk of ‘gender equity’ that seeks to transform inequitable power relations. Further, women's empowerment is conceptualized through a neo-liberal worldview as individualist and instrumental, with consequent interventions disciplining women for the market, rather than challenging power relations compatible with a neo-liberal worldview (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1466138111420507">Cornwall and Anyidoho, 2010</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1466138111420507">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this context, it is perhaps not surprising that decoupling between the symbols of women's empowerment and more substantive changes to practices has been rife in the NGO sector. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1466138111420507">Wendoh and Wallace's (2005)</xref> evaluation of a project across four countries in Africa found that NGOs perceived gender mainstreaming as something external and imposed. The result was a disjuncture, where the rhetoric of gender mainstreaming appeared in project proposals to satisfy donors, but not incorporated as a value within the organization. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1466138111420507">Tiessen's (2007)</xref> in-depth study of the NGO sector in Malawi provides evidence of the continuation of patriarchal norms in organizations that attest to their sensitivity to gender issues. She finds that a majority of NGOs (with notable exceptions) adopt the technical aspects of gender equity, but with little substantive change in terms of the norms and values that underpin these organizations. The adoption of the ‘vocabulary of rights and equality can … mask any real change’ (2007: 177).</p>
<p>This is all the more disappointing as NGOs have the potential to be intermediaries in the transmission of feminist discourses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1466138111420507">Thayer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1466138111420507">Tiessen, 2007</xref>). Their position within socio-cultural contexts provides them the opportunity to demonstrate progressive behaviour and thereby challenge patriarchal power through example. There is therefore a need to examine the processes through which norms of gender equity are imbibed and enacted in NGOs, and the extent to which this enactment challenges patriarchal norms in broader society. In doing so, I purposefully select NGOs in which the task is complicated by the overlap of the institution of the family. This brings into sharp relief how contradictory norms are reconciled, as well as how the family acts as a transmission of certain values through the NGO.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1466138111420507"><title>Gender in family firms</title>
<p>The ways that family involvement influences organizational behaviour has been the subject of a body of literature examining family firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1466138111420507">Sharma, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1466138111420507">Dyer (2003</xref>: 401) defines family businesses as ‘organizations in which the behaviour of firms and the actors within them are influenced by the familial relationships that are part of the organizational landscape’. The culture of the organization cannot be seen as distinct from that of the family; organization/familial members share cognitive frames based on the interactions within the family and the firm. Familial norms and hierarchy structure relations, determine what is acceptable behaviour, and order individual members' pursuit of their interests in the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1466138111420507">Hoy and Verser, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Research exploring gender in family firms has tended to highlight how familial norms have been replicated, with the organization a site in which gender norms are enacted and reaffirmed. Several empirical studies demonstrate that: women are constrained to more traditional roles in the firm, responsible for domestic and day-to-day management, but rarely in senior positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1466138111420507">Ram and Holliday, 1993</xref>); women are often invisible, ignored by clients and other staff members who do not take them seriously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1466138111420507">Hollander and Bukowitz, 1990</xref>); women are presumed to fill roles that reflect gendered characteristics, such as that of nurturer and peacemaker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1466138111420507">Cole, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1466138111420507">Harriss-White (2003)</xref> notes both the prevalence of family firms in India, as well as the ways that they discriminate against women and exploit them in labour markets. She argues that ‘family firms are authoritarian hierarchies of capital and labour’ (2003: 111), in which women are denied access to assets and management positions. The welding of the family and firm appears to result in a bricolage in which patriarchal norms persist.</p>
<p>These studies suggest that family firms are therefore particularly rigid to changes in gender regimes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1466138111420507">Hollander and Bukowitz (1990)</xref> argue that family firms reaffirm gender roles, and are often the last bastion of socio-cultural change:
<disp-quote>
<p>family businesses are an extension of the family’s culture, dynamics and biases, many of them gender related. The family unit is often the last stronghold against social and cultural change. (1990: 151)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>They argue that family norms persist <italic>despite</italic> changes in broader societal norms. This raises the very real possibility that the overlap of family spaces and workspaces militates against transformations in organizational culture.</p>
<p>This suggests that family NGOs will be less likely than NGOs with no family overlap to implement practices that challenge patriarchal norms. The replication of gender norms across the family and firm is not, however, inevitable. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1466138111420507">Alvesson and Billing (2009)</xref> warn against making such generalizations, and alternative scenarios have also been empirically demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1466138111420507">Cole, 1997</xref>). The point is not to suggest a perfect correlation of familial and organizational cognitive frames, but to highlight the potential for these to overlap, or else need to be reconstituted within the home and workplace. The possibility that changes in one institutional environment can impact on another cannot be discounted; changes in family values may impact on the organization, while different experiences and interactions within the organization may transform familial norms by providing a basis for them to be challenged and reconfigured. This is particularly the case when institutional norms conflict with the taken-for-granted realities of the family.</p>
<p>This literature review has sought to identify several questions explored below. First, what are the impacts that the norms of gender equity and the ideas of women's empowerment have had on the structure and practices of family NGOs? What is the potential for these changes (if any) to challenge gender norms in other social contexts? And are these impacts and potentials any different for family NGOs, as opposed to other NGOs in the Indian context? By examining these questions, I hope to contribute to current understandings of institutional change and stability.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1466138111420507"><title>Two family NGOs</title>
<p>I define a family-based NGO as an organization with one or more of the following criteria: leadership succession within the family; family control over management; family members as paid or unpaid labour; and the association of the family name with the NGO (Jakimow, 2011). This article is based on participant observation with two such NGOs. I worked with Rural Development Organization (RDO), in South India, for three months, and EED, located in North India, for eight months. I gained access to both NGOs through ‘bargaining cards’, skills and knowledge that I brought to the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1466138111420507">Ram and Holliday, 1993</xref>). I was also included in activities outside the NGO as I was adopted into the ‘family’. All members of the organizations consented to my presence, and staff members had the opportunity to talk with me as little or as much as they felt comfortable with. All the names in this article are pseudonyms and some of the identifying features are obscured to protect the identity of my informants.</p>
<p>Participant observation occurred in two periods over four years. I worked at RDO as an undergraduate, my experiences becoming the material from which I wrote my Honours thesis. Returning to these notes revealed the firebrand attitude I took into the field. With a head brimming with post-development critiques, while retaining the idealism that development agencies should act in particular ways, my notes were angry at what I took to be a highly dysfunctional NGO. My good relations with staff members contrasted with my deteriorating relationship with the NGO secretary, all of which coloured my interpretations of the organization. Several years later, I have tempered my expectations and have a better understanding of the constraints within which NGOs must work. Rather than being affronted by the disjuncture between rhetoric and practice at EED, I sought a deeper understanding of why this was the case, facilitated by the longer period of time I worked with them.</p>
<p>Senthil and Smita Gupta established EED soon after their marriage, and within a couple of years were joined by Smita's sister and brother-in-law (Sushma and Akil). They live in a joint family home, and all of them work for EED at the office located at their residence. The office boy is Smita's niece's husband's brother. The driver is ‘fictive-kin’ coming from Smita's natal village but not a blood relation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1466138111420507">Paredo, 2003</xref>). The only non-kin member is Prayant, who has been with the organization three years. Prayant joins Senthil, Smita, Sushma and Akil as the five board members of EED.</p>
<p>EED therefore has a large breadth of family involvement in the organization, and a large overlap between the governance structure of the NGO and the family. There is only one non-family member on the board, and husband and wife hold the top two management positions. Smita is director and in charge of programme management and Senthil strategic direction (discussed below). There is no intergenerational leadership, and Senthil and Smita's children, even though now adults, are not involved in EED, nor do they show interest in becoming involved in the future. Nonetheless, EED is widely synonymous with the family name. When people from other organizations and in their working area refer to EED, it is often in reference to the Gupta family.</p>
<p>Kumar and Gita (husband and wife) founded RDO in the 1990s, and they continue to be secretary and director of the organization respectively. The remaining five staff members are non-kin. The family maintains control of the organization through the two top management positions. They have less breadth but greater depth of involvement than EED. RDO traces its history to the philanthropic activities of Kumar's father, who used the revenue from his substantial land-holdings for charitable work. RDO is seen as a continuation of these activities, which have been recast in terms of ‘development’. People referred to RDO and Kumar in the same breath, and both staff and clients stated that RDO was Kumar's organization.</p>
<p>Both organizations present women's empowerment as an explicit objective. This is particularly the case with RDO, which presents itself as a women-led organization. At the time 93 percent of RDO's beneficiaries were women, and they deal with women-centred programmes such as self-help groups and reproductive and child health. EED has a broader agenda and clientele. Nonetheless, they recognize women as a marginalized segment of society and have in place specific programmes to overcome the disadvantages they face. Both NGOs must therefore reconcile the norms, values and cognitive frames of the family institution with the stated commitment to gender equity and women's empowerment upon which they partially base their legitimacy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1466138111420507"><title>RDO: Patriarchal norms in a woman-led NGOs</title>
<p>Kumar, a tall, robustly built man, collected me from the train station when I arrived to start working for RDO. On the way to the office, he explained the structure of RDO. Gita was the director, and Kumar was in an unpaid advisory position of ‘secretary’. When we arrived, Gita was seated behind a desk, and she rose to shake my hand and welcome me to the organization. Kumar introduced me to the rest of the team, consisting of three women, and two men.</p>
<p>The division of labour at RDO was quickly apparent. The three women were responsible for travelling to the villages and talking to the women. The two men, while occasionally visiting the ‘field’, spent most of their time in the office, writing reports and proposals and balancing budgets. Other chores were divided along gender lines: each morning the office was swept, usually by a female fieldworker and on occasions Gita, but never a male office worker; a man was sent to collect the tea and anything we needed from outside. The female fieldworkers earned less than a third of the wages of male office workers. Such a difference between the salary of office workers and fieldworkers is usual in the sector, though it is normally attributed to a distinction between those with English language skills, and ‘un-skilled’ employees who can speak in the language of the people. Gender dimensions of this difference are overlooked, even as women are preferred as fieldworkers for their ability to speak directly with other women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1466138111420507">O'Reilly, 2004</xref>). Ironically, it is perhaps most apparent in those NGOs that specifically seek to target and empower women and that therefore have a need for female fieldworkers.</p>
<p>What was most striking, however, was the disjuncture between RDO as a woman-led NGO, and the division of labour between Gita and Kumar. My role helping Kumar write correspondence and project proposals for donors made me aware of the central role that he had in decision making. Kumar communicated with funding agencies via email, and prepared all written correspondence with government officials. Gita's name was included at the bottom of all correspondence, but except for written communication requiring a signature, she rarely knew of the contents. Kumar's tone and body language exuded authority. He towered over his staff, and at times spoke harshly and loudly. Gita's role in managing staff was to mend the poor relations that this demeanour created, and in her words, to act as an intermediary between the female fieldworkers and her husband. Although officially Gita was the director, it was Kumar who commanded control of the organization.</p>
<p>Prevailing gender norms that exclude women from the public sphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1466138111420507">Dréze and Sen, 2002</xref>) were also evident. In India, women's mobility is restricted, and the removal of women from the public sphere marks high social status. Gita's mobility was limited to the home and office, and her work duties were of secondary importance to her role as wife and mother. The office was a short distance from her house, and she would return during the day to prepare meals, and help her children with their homework. It was Kumar who went to the field, met with government officials and attended workshops. That Kumar had no difficulty taking his female fieldworkers to villages, often returning past 10 o'clock at night, indicates the extent to which the confinement of women to private spaces is linked to the preservation of class and caste distinctions.</p>
<p>The nature of the persistence of patriarchal norms cannot, however, be attributed solely to the ‘cognitive frames' of institutional members. Gita was certainly no cultural ‘dope’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1466138111420507">Giddens, 1984</xref>). One evening she came to my room to explain the behaviour of her husband, whose temper had become worse over the past month. He was under a lot of pressure, she explained, as the NGO was facing financial problems. Her explanation soon turned into a outpouring of her own frustrations at her limited role within the organization. She felt powerless, as she was confined to mediating between Kumar and the staff. This was not only a matter of leadership; her family depended financially on the NGO, and Kumar's poor decision-making could result in significant financial hardship. Her powerlessness was compounded by Kumar's threats of violence if Gita was to discuss her limited role outside the organization.</p>
<p>I do not wish to speculate if Kumar was ever violent in the home, but I believe it is valid to discuss the way Kumar used his physical stature to intimidate. On occasion when Kumar and I clashed openly, he would come close and tower above me while he spoke loudly and angrily. Though I never feared he would hit me, the effect of intimidation is achieved. As Acker notes: ‘when the top manager is male, large, intimidating and unpredictable, the spectre of physical violence may be particularly oppressive for women under his control’ (1998: 204). For Gita, as wife, and co-resident of Kumar, this spectre of violence likely represented a greater peril. Patriarchal structures are therefore not only a case of social norms and cognitive frames, but also reinforced through other forms of power, such as violence.</p>
<p>Confidential interviews suggested that this intimidation extended to the clients of RDO. A husband of a former client joked that if Kumar found out about our conversation, he would beat him. This comment was made in jest, but indicates the type of relationship between Kumar and his clientele. RDO provided micro-finance loans, and several people expressed a fear that Kumar could remove this facility. As organizations strive for legitimacy with all stakeholders (including their clientele in the case of NGOs), this relationship between Kumar and his clients is significant, especially seen in comparison with EED. This will be returned to below, but I wish to highlight here that the dominance of the male leader of the NGO extends beyond the organization to the broader society, reproducing social structures through the interactions between Kumar and his mostly female clientele. These interactions not only reaffirmed gender relations, but also the dominant position of Kumar's family in the locale.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1466138111420507"><title>Maintaining the status quo in the face of external challenges</title>
<p>Clients are only one of NGOs' stakeholders, and organizations must also maintain the appearance of conformity to norms in the broader development sector. An incident at RDO during my fieldwork indicates the potential for external actors to challenge patriarchal norms, as well as the counter-attempts by internal actors to maintain the status quo. RDO had recently been awarded a grant from a donor that had initiated a South Asia programme. The programme was to be launched in a neighbouring country, and the donor was to pay for the directors of NGO partners to attend. As Gita was the official director of RDO, it was to her that the invitation was extended. As only one person was covered in the budget, she was expected to travel alone and present her project to the gathering.</p>
<p>For Gita to undertake this trip alone challenged many of the norms and hierarchies within the organization. Gita did not travel to the next village unaccompanied, let alone internationally. Further, rarely had she had the opportunity/necessity to present the work of the organization, or herself as director. Following the invitation, Kumar set about trying to secure a second invitation for himself. I wrote many carefully worded emails on Kumar's behalf to ask for his fare to assist the director. To suggest that Kumar should attend instead of his wife, or that Gita was unable to travel independently, would be to expose the woman-led myth of the NGO as a fabrication. The donor refused the repeated requests. After much perseverance by Kumar, the agency eventually agreed to allow him to participate in the gathering (covering food costs), as long as he paid for the air-ticket and the difference between single and double accommodation himself. Kumar used RDO funds to pay for his ticket.</p>
<p>In this instance, Kumar's control over the organization enabled him to accompany his wife, and minimize the challenge to his position and prevailing gender norms. I do not wish to suggest that Kumar's incentive was only to counter this challenge (he expressed his excitement at his first opportunity to travel internationally), but to indicate how his dominant position within the family and household enabled him to pursue his interests. Gita indicated to me that she would not have travelled without her husband. Although she cited safety concerns, such travel would also disturb her relationship with her husband. This decision, had it been necessary, would indicate the extent to which Gita's role as director (and official leader) of RDO is secondary to her status as Kumar's wife. Family norms and culture clearly influence the organizational hierarchy and the opportunity of its members to pursue their interests.</p>
<p>The incident highlights two aspects of a clash between institutional fields. First, it is an example of how donor agencies' control over material resources can exert pressure on NGOs to practise the norms to which they say they subscribe. I do not suggest that this was intentional, or that it had a dramatic impact on gender relations at RDO. It did, however, represent an opportunity for existing thinking to be challenged. Gita travelled internationally to present the work of RDO to a large audience. Her official role as director, invisible at the local level, was providing her space, visibility and opportunities at the international level. At the same time, patriarchal norms regarding mobility, as well as Kumar's authority and control over material resources, circumscribed any transformative effect. Material resources reinforce both transformative pressures, and attempts to maintain the status quo.</p>
<p>As an account of institutional persistence and change, it is instructive. It suggests that attempts to challenge patriarchal social relations through women's management of NGOs may be thwarted by the norms, values and worldviews of existing institutions. At the same time, it highlights that power also operates in more direct ways, including the threat of violence and control over material resources. This prevents actors from challenging the meanings that reinforce their lower status, while at the same time providing opportunities for external actors with power over resources to press for more substantive change. This is only a partial account, however, as it treats both the family NGO and ‘development sector’ as unified institutional fields. My experiences at EED suggest that institutional fields have blurred boundaries, and may contain within them distinct spaces in which gender is reproduced and reconstituted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1466138111420507"><title>EED: Replication, resistance and challenge</title>
<p>When I climbed the stairs the first time to the EED office, the office peon directed me to the front room of the house where Senthil was waiting. We discussed the details of my participant observation with the organization. Senthil told me what he expected me to do for the organization, and we mapped out a general plan of my major tasks. After some time, Smita came in with tea and namkin. Senthil introduced her as EED's director, indicating that his own role had been reduced to an unofficial and unpaid one of guidance. Despite this, although I chatted politely with Smita, the details of my work were discussed primarily with Senthil.</p>
<p>This initial meeting reflected the hierarchy within EED that I observed over the next eight months. Although I worked more closely with Smita on a day-to-day basis, Senthil continued to assign my tasks. Senthil's authority extended over all staff members. His position was exerted through tone and body language, which were assertive in contrast to other staff members’ unassuming posture. This extended to Smita, who although officially director, was demure in front of her husband. The actual (as opposed to official) organizational structure paralleled a patriarchal family structure, with Senthil head of household, as well as EED. Interactions in the office and family home served to reinforce Senthil's relative authority in both spheres.</p>
<p>The interactions that reproduced a particular set of gender relations – most notably between husband and wife – did not, however, extend to all spaces within EED. Smita utilized and created spaces in which she could act autonomously and exercise authority. EED had a second office a short walk from the family home. Staff shifted between the two offices throughout the day, but Senthil remained in the one attached to the family home. Smita had a strong preference for the more distant office, describing it as quiet, and with few distractions. In my own observations, it was also a space apart from her husband, and her domestic chores. Smita's persona in this space was inconsistent with her behaviour in the home-office. She directed her staff assertively, yelling instructions between rooms and directing matters such as meal breaks and work priorities. In this space, she took a larger role in directing my own work, asking me to complete tasks for her, while making sure that they did not interfere with tasks Senthil had assigned.</p>
<p>Smita was most assertive in the villages. Unlike Gita, Smita had few restrictions on her mobility, travelling to villages for monitoring visits for several days at a time. She would stay with family and friends, or if necessary, a hotel. Her higher status vis-à-vis fieldworkers from smaller partner NGOs, and village <italic>pradhans</italic> (heads) was clear in their interactions. Smita spoke from an authoritative position with both men and women, reaffirmed through an assertive tone, and strong body language that belied her gender. Although gender norms in the villages in which EED worked were not as restrictive for women as in RDO's field site, Smita's behaviour was hardly conventional. In general, women's mobility was limited to the village and its surrounds (to collect non-timber forest products), and (with some notable exceptions) women took a secondary role to the men in the village meetings I observed.</p>
<p>What explains the greater assertiveness and better mobility of Smita compared to Gita? Of course, part of the explanation must lie in the personalities involved. Cultural neo-institutionalism, which states that people adhere to ‘cultural scripts', ignores how people are able to reflect on norms, and may choose to challenge these through non-conforming behaviour or communicative action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1466138111420507">Schmidt, 2008</xref>). As seen, however, Gita also critically reflected on her lower status, but was limited in her ability to challenge her position. I argue that three additional factors made Smita better equipped to act in non-gender conforming ways.</p>
<p>First, Smita operated in multiple spaces within the organization: the office attached to the home; the office outside the home; and the project field. Institutions are often treated as a bounded entity, with a singular set of expected behaviour that pervades throughout. The different behaviour of Smita in the home-office and external office suggests that this is simplistic. In the home-office, the overlap of the family and the NGO seemingly constrained Smita's behaviour to the gendered role of a subservient wife. In the external office, she was able to act according to a different set of norms. Her behaviour was that expected of a project manager, with her status as a woman seemingly taking less importance. This suggests that processes of institutional bricolage may not occur evenly throughout an institution. Patriarchal familial norms were seemingly incorporated only in the spaces and interactions that corresponded to the family.</p>
<p>Second, while Gita's lack of mobility possibly enhanced the status of Kumar's family, in contrast, Smita's mobility enhanced the legitimacy of the Gupta family (through EED) to ‘develop’ the area. While RDO's relations with their clients were based on continuing patronage, EED based their relative position vis-à-vis the villagers on their status as modern and cosmopolitan. In the villages, Smita is a ‘developer’, and as such, she bases her legitimacy on being relatively ‘progressive’. Such terms in the Indian context are aligned with women's empowerment; being able to transgress existing gender norms is seen as a sign of development. Smita's mobility and assertiveness are thereby a demonstration of her ‘developed’ status. This provides Smita the space, if not the <italic>necessity</italic>, to behave in an appropriately ‘empowered’ way.</p>
<p>The final factor refers to the mediums through which NGOs communicate their conformity with the norms of the development sector to donor agencies. RDO's funding came primarily from international NGOs. Communication was through email, making it easy to add Gita's name to maintain the illusion of a woman-led organization. In contrast, EED had only one Indian-based donor. Communication was through email, phone and regular face-to-face meetings. To maintain appearances of EED as a woman-led organization, Smita had to take a more direct role in negotiating with funding agency staff. I argue that these three differences between RDO and EED – multiple spaces; relationship with clients; proximity to donor – were at least partially responsible for the different gendered behaviour of Smita and Gita.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1466138111420507"><title>NGOs creeping into the family home</title>
<p>The above examines the persistence (or not) of patriarchal norms within the NGO; but can the norms and values of the development sector challenge the patriarchal norms of the family and society? That is, does involvement in the NGO sector transform the cognitive frames of actors in other institutional settings? The answer to this question helps to identify the potential for NGOs to be a site for the challenge of gender norms.</p>
<p>Although limited, there were several instances and discussions that indicated there was a potential for gender norms to be transformed in a more radical way. This was most evident amongst the female fieldworkers in the villages, several of whom mentioned their increased ability to transgress gender norms. Smita was a role model in this regard, as one female fieldworker from EED's partner NGO explained:
<disp-quote>
<p>Through Smitaji I have learnt a lot. <italic>Aage aa chuki </italic>[I have already moved forward]. It was not like this before we started the project … now we have the confidence to move through the villages and talk freely to people. When people like you [a foreign researcher] come, then we can talk easily with you. (interview, my translation)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The fieldworker continued to describe how she had overcome the resistance of her parents, who wanted her to spend more time on her domestic chores and were wary of her travelling so freely. Although the family had prevented her travelling to the city (a journey of 12 hours), they had consented to her continuing her work.</p>
<p>Perhaps more noteworthy are the changes that occurred within the Gupta family as a result of Smita's role as director. Senthil made a revealing comment in a group discussion with EED staff about the advantages and disadvantages of a family NGO:
<disp-quote>
<p>The negative impact is that roles do overlap. Again it is very difficult to differentiate official role and household role. That disturbs your family life. Those discussions, they, in case of husband/wife, they even creep into your bedroom. And in case like a family like ours, it creeps into our dining table, drawing room; you can’t help it. And in management issues also, sometimes, [Smita] may feel she is the wife, why should she be separated from the NGO. She has the perspective; again it becomes demand … I may be having more rights, than in the official arrangement, I would not have otherwise.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Several aspects are interesting in this quote. The final sentence reaffirms what was stated above; that despite the official roles of the organization, Senthil still dominates, or in his words, enjoys more rights. What is of note, however, is his discussion about how the work of EED impacts on the family, and in particular their relationships. He discusses the difficulty in managing the difference in roles between the organization and the family structure. He notes the ‘perspective’ of Smita, by which he seems to suggest that she feels that she should have more rights as a result of her (formal) position in the organization. Just as she has a dominant position in EED, she has also started to assert herself in the family.</p>
<p>I observed only one occasion in which Smita asserted herself in an organizational matter. We were having a ‘team’ meeting to discuss a new project proposal. Senthil, as was usual in such circumstances, had the dominant role, seemingly filling the space of the small office with his bulk and loud voice. He spoke much as a schoolmaster would to a group of errant children, dismissing their ideas and asserting his own views. For the most part, Smita, Sushma, Akil, Prayant and myself deferred to Senthil's opinions as he directed the meeting. The exception came when discussing the potential site for the project. Senthil wanted a remote location to avoid competing with other NGOs, while Smita wanted one closer to the city and their home. As the person responsible for day-to-day tasks, Smita would be the person to visit the field. A distant field site would reduce her ability to perform her domestic chores, or enjoy leisure time. She was adamant, the field site had to be within a distance easily reachable. She raised her voice to add force to her arguments. When Senthil did not budge in his position, Smita stood up, leaning on the desk and over her husband who was still seated. An angry exchange ensued, and the matter was finally put aside to be decided upon later. Smita sat back down, the mood in the office tense.</p>
<p>This incident stands out as the most serious breach of behaviour considered appropriate for Smita as Senthil's wife that I observed. The overlap of the family and the organization made this organizational issue related to the family. Roles became confused, and Smita was assertive both as director and as wife in these circumstances. This indicates how Smita's assertiveness in other domains may influence the organizational space that correlates with the home office. Smita's official role as director perhaps emboldened her to assert herself in this important matter. Although hardly conclusive of more substantive changes in familial relations or transformed perspectives, such incidents perhaps indicate that the practices and structures that NGOs adopt to maintain legitimacy in the development sector may have broader repercussions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1466138111420507"><title>The potentials and limitations of family NGOs in challenging gender relations</title>
<p>RDO and EED are examples of how development sector norms constructed nationally and globally shape institutional practices on the local level. To remain legitimate and eligible for funding, NGOs must conform (or appear to conform) to expectations. As norms and legitimate objectives are often based on specific meanings of ‘progress’, these are often in conflict with (and seek to change) societal norms. Family NGOs are an extreme example of these potential conflicts, as they must reconcile familial norms and hierarchies with the normative expectations of their organizations. Gender is a particularly pertinent example due to the persistence of patriarchal norms in the family alongside values of gender equity and objectives of empowering women in the NGO sector.</p>
<p>I stress to the reader that RDO and EED are just two family NGOs in a diverse sector in India. It is not my intention to claim that family NGOs never adhere to more ‘progressive’ gender norms, or that processes of change occur in a prescribed fashion. By presenting a comparison of two family NGOs, I have attempted to identify some of the factors that make change or persistence possible. In addition, my involvement with both NGOs does not predate the arrival of ‘women's empowerment’ as a core development objective, and I am unable to present ethnographic material that would provide a contrasting account of before and after. Rather, I have focused on the day-to-day practices in which gender norms are enacted, and the points of tension that indicate potential (or not) for change.</p>
<p>The comparative case study has shed light on how the development sector's norms of gender equity and women's empowerment have influenced the structures and practices of family NGOs. The greater legitimacy given to NGOs that are women-led have resulted in changes to organizational structures in which women are given the official role of director. This has seemingly had little effect, however, on the actual practices of decision-making within the two organizations, as Kumar and Senthil continue to retain leadership. This decoupling between the adoption of formal structures and practices is facilitated through the overlap of family and NGO. Through patriarchal norms that assert men as heads of households, men are able to reassert the power that has been diminished through their loss of formal control of the organization. Wives (and directors) must challenge the norms of the patriarchal family in order to perform their formal role. This is true of other positions which have been nominally given to women, but over which men retain control. In the case of the Panchayat Raj (local governance), reservations for women of between 33 and 50 percent of seats have resulted in many wives acting as puppets for politically ambitious husbands. I am not stating that all female Panchayat Raj officers and all female NGO directors are secondary to their husbands, but rather I suggest that the family appears to facilitate men's control over positions that have been formally handed over to women. Family NGOs may therefore be more prone to decoupling than those without a family overlap.</p>
<p>But this is not to say that the idea of women's empowerment does not penetrate the organization, or more specifically, the cognitive frame of organizational members. Both Smita and Gita were seemingly aware that they had less power in the organization than their position should entail, and were unhappy about it. The extent to which this thinking was a direct result of the norms of the development sector is somewhat speculative without interview data prior to the promotion of women's empowerment in India. At the very least, however, these ideas legitimate claims for more power within the organization (for example, in Gita's expressed frustration over her limited role as against her official one), or in practices that defy patriarchal norms (such as Smita's assertiveness in the office or village). These practices and articulations in turn have the potential to challenge existing gender norms. EED staff accepted Smita's authority, while Smita's ability to travel and speak confidently inspired young women in the area to do the same (and to get familial approval). Further, in the case of EED, there were indications that Smita's official role was resulting in greater assertiveness in her relations with her husband. Although these are minor transformations, they indicate the potential for NGOs to play a positive role in societal change.</p>
<p>The extent to which ideas of women's empowerment can be enacted or articulated were not even across the two organizations, indicating factors that may facilitate or impede institutional change. I identified four factors that influence this potential. First, the distance between NGOs and donors. The ability to isolate RDO from donors, using electronic mediums of communication, allowed a greater disjuncture between rhetoric and practice. It was when this physical isolation could no longer be maintained that the greatest challenge to the status quo came. The second factor is the use of other coercive forms of power. For example, Kumar was able to nullify the impact of this challenge through his control over material resources and the threat of physical violence. The third factor is the accessibility of multiple spaces within the organization. Smita's ability to transgress gender norms was facilitated through the spaces available to her outside the home. Smita was a dutiful wife in the presence of her husband, and an assertive leader in the office away from her family home. Gita had no such opportunities. This highlights the potential for organizations to have multiple spaces in which culture is enacted, and for actors to adhere to different norms and behaviours in each of these spaces. These latter two factors are seemingly more restrictive for women seeking to assert their power in family NGOs, as opposed to NGOs with no family overlap. Gita is susceptible to domestic violence, while the office is an extension of the home: a space under the domain of Kumar.</p>
<p>The final factor, which is also of relevance to the transmission of norms to broader society, is the relationship between each organization and their respective clientele. RDO's legitimacy was based on a history of family philanthropy in the area. They were from a dominant family that maintained their upper-caste distinction through upholding certain caste-related norms – including restricting women from working outside the home. In contrast, EED's legitimacy came from their ‘progressiveness'; the Gupta family were developers due to their ‘modernity’, and taking on of modern values and outlooks (what I have called elsewhere ‘cosmopolitan cultural capital’ – see Jakimow, in press). Adherence to patriarchal norms is essential for RDO to maintain their legitimacy, at the same time as being counter to EED's claims for legitimacy. It is therefore important to look not only at the non-local environment and values of the stakeholders, but the relationship of the organization to them. This becomes even more important in the case of EED and RDO due to their association with Kumar's and the Gupta family respectively.</p>
<p>I argue that it is this association that also magnifies the potential for family NGOs to challenge norms and thinking in the broader social context. The institution of the family is sacred in India (as in many other places), seen as the bastion of revered values. The ability to adhere to certain family norms is also a means through which social status is acquired, exhibited and lost. Both Kumar's and the Gupta family are of a higher class and caste than the majority of their clientele and, as such, represent ‘high values’. The adherence or defiance of patriarchal gender norms thereby presents a strong message. For both RDO and EED, the NGO is a public face through which family norms are displayed. In the case of RDO, this may reaffirm the importance of prevailing patriarchal norms, whereas in EED's field-sites the family's practices are a challenge to these same norms.</p>
<p>What does the example of family NGOs contribute to current understandings of institutional change and persistence? First, the overlap of an organization with an institution that is characterized by stability appears likely to hinder organizational change. This is due to the processes of institutional bricolage in which the values and norms of one institution shape the structure and practices of another. We cannot assume that such bricolage occurs solely through cognitive frames and worldviews; as actors are able to reflect on values and norms, transformation in worldviews is also possible. Forms of coercive power (such as violence and access to material resources) may limit, however, the ability to engage in practices that reflect nonconformist thinking. Alternatively, such powers when exercised by an ally in change may facilitate transformation. In short, when considering why a particular institutional bricolage is created, discourses that frame worldviews should be considered alongside more direct forms of power.</p>
<p>The case study of EED further highlights that such processes of bricolage may be uneven. Organizations consist of multiple spaces, with potentially different enactment of norms. This demonstrates how norms may be tied to certain spaces, and to the disciplining gaze of certain individuals. How actors manipulate these different spaces, and the way such changes occurring in one space may impact on another, requires further research. More generally, there is a need in the neo-institutional literature to move beyond the fallacy of organization coherence.</p>
<p>The analysis highlights some of the factors that make decoupling more likely: the incompatibility with family values; distance from donors; and pressures to confirm to norms of gender equity for financial reasons, rather than personal worldviews. These factors are also present in the world society literature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1466138111420507">Clark (2010)</xref> outlines cognitive frames, evaluation and monitoring, and isomorphism as variables in determining nation-state compliance to international human rights treaties. To these I add one more relevant to the organizational level: the position of organizations in the broader society. Organizations are more likely to decouple symbolic shows of compliance from practices when the relevant norms threaten the relationship with other important stakeholders. Importantly, this does not just refer to the socio-cultural context, but the organization's position vis-à-vis these stakeholders. This is especially the case with NGOs who seek not only to build an affinity with their stakeholders, but also to distinguish themselves from them by adopting ‘progressive’ norms. This requires attention to how norms and values are used not only in legitimating practices, but in positioning organizational actors within the social context.</p>
