<abstract>
<p>To better understand the challenges faced by primary care providers in rural locations in providing care for children with complex chronic conditions (CCC), the authors conducted a cross-sectional survey of primary care providers (N = 132), including physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants, in community settings in 6 counties in northwest North Carolina. Pediatric practices were significantly less likely to be located in rural areas. Practices in rural areas were more likely to be small, with fewer staff members (odds ratio [OR] = 7) and providers (OR = 15) compared with practices in nonrural areas. Additionally, nonrural practices were 3 times as likely as rural practices to have a larger clientele of children with CCC. A majority of primary care providers (77%) reported difficulty caring for children with CCC. Strategies for supporting primary care providers are needed to enable them to provide care for the growing number of children with CCC.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Almost 14% of all children in the United States have special health care needs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812436884">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812436884">2</xref></sup> More than one fifth of US households have at least 1 child with a special health care need.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812436884">1</xref></sup> Children with complex chronic conditions (CCC) are a subgroup of children with special health care needs (CSHCN), with more complex needs, or with severe health conditions. Children with CCC are also described as children who are medically fragile, technology dependent, or medically complex. Children with CCC are living longer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812436884">3</xref></sup> and their medical needs are increasing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812436884">4</xref></sup> Today, children with CCC account for a larger proportion of hospitalizations, hospital days, and hospital charges compared with a decade ago.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812436884">4</xref></sup> Children with CCC are more likely to be readmitted to hospitals than are children without CCC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812436884">5</xref></sup> Caring for children with special needs has been reported to generate substantial stress for their families.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812436884">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Improving the health care system to provide family-centered, comprehensive, and coordinated care to all CSHCN is one of the nation’s health objectives (Healthy People 2020: Objective 31).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812436884">7</xref></sup> The medical home model was developed by the American Academy of Pediatrics to improve the system of care for all children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812436884">8</xref></sup> One of the performance measures of the Maternal and Child Health Bureau is that children and youth with special needs receive coordinated care in a medical home.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812436884">1</xref></sup> Although the medical home model of care has been found to benefit children with CCC in rural communities,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812436884">9</xref></sup> such care is not available to all children with CCC in rural communities. To improve the system of care for children with CCC, it is important to understand more clearly the challenges associated with implementing the medical home model in rural communities.</p>
<p>Prior research has shown that it is more difficult for children and families to access necessary health care (ie, lack of providers, transportation, and other resources for families) in rural areas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812436884">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922812436884">12</xref></sup> A recent study reported that even Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs), hospitals established specifically to increase access to services for rural populations, had worse outcomes than non-CAHs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922812436884">13</xref></sup> Whereas most investigations of rural–urban differences in the care of CSHCN are based on parent/caregiver perceptions, provider perceptions about caring for children with CCC are limited. We describe a study of community-based providers’ perceptions of the system of care, including barriers to care, for children with CCC in rural and nonrural locations.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0009922812436884">
<title>Survey</title>
<p>We conducted a cross-sectional survey of community-based primary care providers (physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants) in pediatric and family medicine practices in 6 counties in northwest North Carolina between April and October 2010.</p>
<p>The survey included 41 questions comprising 2 main areas: (1) communication between hospital-based providers and primary care providers and (2) care for children with CCC. We report our findings related to caring for children with CCC. The survey inquired about provider type (physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant) and practice characteristics, including location (rural, urban, or suburban), number of providers in the practice, number of staff in the practice, and proportion of children with CCC among all children served by the practice. We also asked primary care providers about their perceived level of difficulty caring for children with CCC and their perceptions about barriers to care. In addition, we inquired whether they thought a care coordinator would help them care for children with CCC and to describe how.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0009922812436884">
<title>Survey Administration</title>
<p>An online survey (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://SurveyMonkey.com">SurveyMonkey.com</ext-link>, LLC, Palo Alto, CA) was pilot tested with 14 health care providers and revised, based on their comments. Pediatric and family medicine practices were identified through the practice database of the Northwest Community Care Network (NCCN) of North Carolina. The NCCN is a Medicaid Managed Care Network of more than 100 primary care practices in 6 North Carolina counties (Davie, Forsyth, Stokes, Surry, Wilkes, and Yadkin). All but Forsyth are rural counties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922812436884">14</xref></sup> Approximately 80% of all primary care practices in this 6-county area are members of NCCN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922812436884">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The link to the online survey was e-mailed to practice managers of all pediatric and family medicine practices, and health departments. The practice managers forwarded the survey to all physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants in their practices. One pediatric practice, in which pediatric residents of the sponsoring institution practiced, was excluded because the communication module of the survey was not applicable to this practice. Two e-mail reminders about the survey were sent in April, and a third round of reminder phone calls were made to practice managers in May. In July and September 2010, printed copies of the survey were mailed with self-addressed envelopes directly to providers who had not completed the online survey.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0009922812436884">
<title>Variables</title>
<p>The variable of interest, <italic>practice location</italic>, was collapsed into rural and nonrural—from 3 original categories: rural, urban, and suburban. Other practice-level variables were categorized as follows: provider type (physician vs midlevel [physician assistants and nurse practitioners]); number of providers in practice (8 or less [1, 2-4, 5-8] vs 9 or more); number of staff (less than 20 [less than 5, 5-10, 11-20] vs 21 or more); and percentage of children with CCC (less than 1% vs more than 1% [1% to 10%, 11% to 20%, 21% to 30%, more than 30%]). Respondents were asked to select 1 of 4 options regarding their perceived level of difficulty caring for children with CCC (very difficult, somewhat difficult, not difficult, and does not apply). These responses were categorized into “very/somewhat difficult” and “not difficult/does not apply.” Providers’ perceptions about the ease of caring for children with CCC if a care coordinator were to be assigned were categorized into “yes” and “no”/“don’t know.” A variable, <italic>practice type</italic>, was created from the names of the practices and categorized into pediatric and family medicine/other (which included health departments and 2 practices that could not be classified as pediatric practices).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0009922812436884">
<title>Missing and Duplicate Data</title>
<p>We combined duplicate responses for 4 respondents. There were no discrepancies between the duplicate responses except for 1 participant. For 1 participant, the location of the practice (rural, urban, and suburban) was recorded as rural in one and suburban in the other—this was coded as suburban based on the geographic location of the practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0009922812436884">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Univariate and bivariate analyses were performed. We used Fisher’s exact test for the bivariate analysis. We present unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) to describe the strength of the association between rural and nonrural locations in practice characteristics and provider perceptions. <italic>P</italic> values of &lt;.05 were considered statistically significant. All quantitative analyses are performed using Stata Intercooled Version10 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX). Two investigators (KM and SG) independently reviewed the aggregate open-ended items and organized them into themes. Approval was obtained from the Wake Forest Health Sciences Institutional Review Board.</p>

<sec id="section8-0009922812436884" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The survey was sent to 72 practices; at least 1 provider responded in 52 practicesd (72%). Of the 316 primary care providers who were sent the survey, 132 responded, with a 42% response rate. In all, 65% were practicing in nonrural locations.</p>
<sec id="section9-0009922812436884">
<title>Practice Characteristics</title>
<p>The characteristics of the practices are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922812436884">Table 1</xref>. Most of the providers who responded to the survey were physicians (71%), with a nearly even split between respondents in pediatric practices (47%) and family/other (53%) practices. Rural providers were more likely to work in practices that had fewer providers and staff, and they served &lt;1% CCC.</p>

<title>Perceptions About Caring for Children With CCC</title>
<p>When asked about the level of difficulty in caring for children with CCC, most participants reported that it was “somewhat difficult” (62%) or “very difficult” (15%) to care for children with CCC. This difficulty did not vary by practice location (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0009922812436884">Table 2</xref>). When primary care providers were asked to describe the difficulties they face in providing care for children with CCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922812436884">Figure 1</xref>), the following themes emerged: (1) poor communication between providers (specialists and other agencies), (2) delay or difficulty obtaining referrals to specialists, (3) difficulty coordinating care with multiple providers, (4) lack of services or resources in the community for CCC, and (5) lack of knowledge about issues related to CCC and resources in the community for children with CCC. Rural providers uniquely commented on lack of local resources.</p>

<p>Most providers (81%) responded that a care coordinator could make it easier to provide care for children with CCC. A few respondents (2%) didn’t think a care coordinator would make it easier, and some “didn’t know” (17%). This perception did not vary by practice location. When asked to describe <italic>how</italic> a care coordinator could help make it easier for providers, several themes emerged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922812436884">Figure 1</xref>): (1) helping coordinate care between multiple specialists and agencies, (2) making access to specialists easier, (3) helping families with logistics (eg, making appointments, transportation, etc), and (4) improving communication between multiple specialists.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This descriptive study begins to illuminate the system of care for children with CCC from a provider perspective. Practices in rural communities reported that they are less equipped to provide care for children with CCC than providers in nonrural areas. We also found that primary care providers face considerable difficulties caring for children with CCC regardless of practice location. The strength of our study is that we analyzed both physicians’ (pediatricians and family physicians) and midlevel providers’ (nurse practitioners and physician assistants) perspectives on barriers to care for children with CCC.</p>
<p>Residents of rural areas face considerable challenges in accessing medical care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922812436884">13</xref></sup> Children living in rural areas have greater unmet medical and dental care needs than those living in nonrural locations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812436884">10</xref></sup> Skinner and Slifkin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812436884">10</xref></sup> reported that CSHCN living in rural communities face additional barriers to care, such as lack of access to providers and greater financial difficulties. The lack of adequate staff and providers in rural practices reported in our study may be a contributing factor to poor access to care for children with CCC in rural communities. Geographic location is an important factor related to unmet medical needs; on average, nearly 1 in 3 children must travel 40 miles (64.37 km) or more to access specific pediatric specialty care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922812436884">16</xref></sup> Our study documents a lack of pediatricians in rural areas, which may compound the already complex problems of access to primary care for children with CCC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812436884">10</xref></sup> We found that rural practices are 3 times as likely to have a smaller CCC clientele, which suggests that families of children with CCC are likely using nonrural practices for primary care.</p>
<p>One strategy for improving primary care is implementing the medical home model of care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812436884">8</xref></sup> Although it is a national health objective, in 2005 less than half (47.1%) of CSHCN received comprehensive care within a medical home.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812436884">1</xref></sup> Our study shows that primary care providers experience many barriers when providing care for children with CCC, which may limit their ability to serve as a medical home for this population. A combination of practice-level and system-level interventions are necessary to address the difficulties faced by primary care providers in caring for children with CCC. Prior studies have used practice-level approaches such as standardizing care to increase efficiency and decrease costs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922812436884">17</xref></sup> and having designated care coordinators on the staff.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812436884">9</xref></sup> Policy-level approaches such as increasing reimbursement mechanisms for providers caring for children with CCC are also warranted.</p>
<p>One element of the medical home model is coordinated care, which is essential for monitoring and ensuring collaboration among the multiple providers caring for children with special health care needs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922812436884">18</xref></sup> In our study, lack of coordinated care emerged as a consistent theme among both rural and nonrural providers when asked about difficulties caring for children with CCC. In a survey of pediatricians, Gupta et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922812436884">19</xref></sup> found that less than half of them provided specific care coordination activities such as integrating a child’s medical plan. Lack of time and limited staff were cited as the most frequent barriers for providing care coordination services to children with special needs. An overwhelming majority (81%) of primary care providers in our study thought that it would be helpful to have a care coordinator. One approach to coordinating care for children with CCC is to have a staff member designated specifically to coordinate care. Future research should evaluate specific areas in which care coordinators make it easier for primary care providers to care for children with CCC.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>There were several limitations to our study. The term <italic>complex chronic conditions</italic> can be interpreted in several ways. We included a definition of CCC in the survey in an attempt to ensure common understanding across respondents. A low overall response rate from providers could have resulted in selection bias; however, we did have a high response at the practice level (72%). The small sample size precluded conducting multivariate analyses to evaluate the independent associations of the variables to rural location. Because of the cross-sectional nature of the study, we were unable to assess causality of the associations. Finally, since this study was limited to one geographic area in North Carolina, it may not be generalizable to other areas with different systems of care.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Children with CCC who live in rural areas may have less access to care because there are fewer pediatric practices, smaller practices, and fewer practices with resources (including providers with experience) for treating children with CCC. Future studies should seek to identify strategies and test interventions to reduce the barriers experienced by rural providers who care for children with CCC.</p>
