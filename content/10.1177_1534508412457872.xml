<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this article is to demonstrate ways to model nonlinear growth using three testing occasions. We demonstrate our growth models in the context of curriculum-based measurement using the fall, winter, and spring passage reading fluency benchmark assessments. We present a brief technical overview that includes the limitations of a growth model with three time points, and how nonlinear growth can be modeled and the associated limitations. We present results for a piecewise growth mixture modeling approach to model nonlinear growth for 1 to 3 classes, as well as to further explain individual differences and to capture heterogeneity of growth patterns. We discuss our interpretation of these results, as well as the implications of different methods for modeling nonlinear growth with three occasions.</p>

<p>Curriculum-based measurement (CBM) is designed to measure students’ academic status and growth to monitor student progress and evaluate the effectiveness of instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534508412457872">Deno, Marston, &amp; Tindal, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534508412457872">Fuchs, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1534508412457872">Tindal et al., 1985</xref>). CBM assessments have been developed for various measures of written expression, mathematics, and reading, but passage reading fluency (PRF)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1534508412457872">1</xref></sup> is the most researched and well established of those available procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1534508412457872">Shapiro, Keller, Lutz, Santoro, &amp; Hintze, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534508412457872">Speece, Case, &amp; Molloy, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534508412457872">Wayman, Wallace, Wiley, Tichá, &amp; Espin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1534508412457872">Wood, 2006</xref>). CBM is used to identify students at risk of poor learning outcomes through benchmark assessments and to monitor student progress to help guide and inform instructional decision making through progress monitoring assessments (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534508412457872">Fuchs, Fuchs, Hosp, &amp; Jenkins, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534508412457872">Speece et al., 2003</xref>). In this article, we use a benchmark data set with easyCBM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534508412457872">Alonzo, Tindal, Ulmer, &amp; Glasgow, 2006</xref>) PRF measures at three time points to illustrate how nonlinear growth can be modeled and discuss the associated implications. We demonstrate a series of data analysis procedures for modeling growth with three occasions and respective results, including a use of estimated time score approach to statistically test for nonlinearity. We use a piecewise growth modeling (PGM) approach to allow for the nonlinear nature of data with three occasions, and then extend the PGM to a growth mixture model (GMM) framework to capture further heterogeneity in growth patterns.</p>

<title>Growth Modeling With CBM PRF</title>
<p>Benchmark assessments are generally administered to all students in a school in the fall, winter, and spring as part of a universal screening process. These assessments have important practical applications for students, teachers, and administrators, as schools are currently using the results of these assessments to estimate student risk status and to make decisions on instructional interventions and high-staked service eligibility. More recently, the data from CBM benchmark assessments have become increasingly valuable to applied researchers. These data provide various opportunities to evaluate student performance using procedures that reflect technically adequate measures with potentially robust reliability and validity. Among these opportunities, researches can explore the academic proficiency of all students in a school or district in Grades K–8, analyze the predictive validity of year-end state tests, and estimate cut-points by which to classify students at risk of falling below proficiency expectations. Perhaps most promising, however, remains the opportunity to model student growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534508412457872">Ardoin &amp; Christ, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534508412457872">Christ, Silberglitt, Yeo, &amp; Cormier, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534508412457872">Nese et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>With growth modeling, the greater number of measurement occasions (or time points), the more flexible the functional form of growth to be modeled. In general, with more time points, the functional form of growth is almost always demonstrated to be nonlinear, either discontinuous or polynomial (e.g., quadratic, cubic, etc.). This is well represented in the CBM PRF literature by the choice of functional form made by researches with enough occasions to explore nonlinearity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534508412457872">Crowe, Connor, &amp; Petscher, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534508412457872">Puranik, Petscher, Al Otaiba, Catts, &amp; Lonigan, 2008</xref>). Although some studies have assumed linear growth with enough occasions to model nonlinearity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534508412457872">Ardoin &amp; Christ, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534508412457872">Christ, 2006</xref>), most research in this area has explored and used nonlinear models. In an examination of the predictive validity of PRF slope on comprehensive reading tests, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534508412457872">S. K. Baker et al. (2008)</xref> used three benchmark assessments across 3 years to use a discontinuous model that accounted for differences in intercepts for each year and nonlinear within-year growth. To determine whether school-level average student reading performance varied as a function of groups identified in latent profile analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534508412457872">Logan and Petscher (2010)</xref> used the latent profile groups as school-level predictors of PRF in a quadratic growth model for Grades 1 to 3. Several studies have used four within-year benchmark assessments across several years to use a piecewise growth curve model for PRF intercepts across years, and modeled quadratic PRF growth within years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534508412457872">Al Otaiba et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534508412457872">Kim, Petscher, Schatschneider, &amp; Foorman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534508412457872">Puranik et al., 2008</xref>). Crowe et al. compared the effects of six core-reading curricula on PRF growth by grade level and socioeconomic status using four within-year benchmark assessments to use a quadratic growth model for each grade level. In addition, the authors also controlled for students’ initial status, using the remaining three benchmarks to describe within-year trajectories. To model quadratic growth using just three occasions, only the linear and quadratic slopes were modeled (not the intercept), leaving a degree of freedom to the quadratic parameter (in addition to the linear). This decision demonstrates the adaptation required to model nonlinear growth with only three occasions.</p>
<p>When only three time points are available for a growth analysis, such as with PRF benchmark assessments, the types of growth models that can be fit are quite limited. If only three testing occasions are available and one wishes to fully estimate all model parameters, a linear growth model is the best that can be fit. Using three within-year benchmark PRF assessments, a linear growth model has been used to investigate whether PRF in Spanish and English had a significant effect on reading comprehension within and across languages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534508412457872">D. L. Baker, Park, &amp; Baker, 2012</xref>), the school-level effects on PRF growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534508412457872">Wang, Algozzine, Ma, &amp; Porfeli, 2011</xref>), and the effects of gender, income, and special education status on PRF growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534508412457872">Yeo, Fearrington, &amp; Christ, 2011</xref>). In fact, most studies of within-year PRF growth have used a linear model, with constant change over time estimated most often in weekly units (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534508412457872">Deno, Fuchs, Marston, &amp; Shin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534508412457872">Graney, Missall, Martinez, &amp; Bergstrom, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534508412457872">Silberglitt &amp; Hintze, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent research, however, has sought to specifically test this assumption of linearity and has found evidence to support the nonlinearity of within-year PRF growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534508412457872">Ardoin &amp; Christ, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534508412457872">Christ et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534508412457872">Nese et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that studies that impose linear growth may not be adequate. In other words, those studies that used three within-year benchmark PRF assessments to model linear growth may have benefited from exploring piecewise models.</p>
<p>Using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534508412457872">Christ et al. (2010)</xref> used a PGM and found a nonlinear PRF trend for general and special education students in Grades 2 to 6, with more reading growth in the fall than in the spring. A PGM in this case divides the three benchmark occasions into two segments, one between fall and winter and another between winter and spring, such that each segment consists of two time points. Note, however, that despite citing evidence for substantial magnitudes of variance in both intercept and growth, Christ et al. did not model variance (i.e., random effects) in intercept or either slope estimate. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534508412457872">Nese et al. (2012)</xref> independently conducted a similar study, and using HLM, found evidence for nonlinear within-year PRF growth—piecewise and quadratic. Similar to those results reported by Christ et al., for students in Grades 3 to 5, greater growth was reported for the fall than the spring, and significantly slower PRF rates and less growth for students receiving special education services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534508412457872">Nese et al., 2012</xref>). Note that for the piecewise (and quadratic) model, the authors modeled the variance for the intercept and one of the two slope estimates, as all three could not be modeled without oversaturating the model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534508412457872">Nese et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Because all variance components cannot be estimated in a nonlinear growth model with three occasions, when the pattern of growth is not perfectly linear across three time points and some type of a nonlinear growth model is of interest, some type of model constraints will be required to make the nonlinear model parameters identified. This limitation can be explained from the covariance-structure modeling perspective, where the number of covariance-structure parameters has to be equal to or fewer than the number of unique number of elements in the data covariance matrix. Note that this limitation is not only for a case with three time points. If there are more time points, modeling growth can be more flexible; however, we will encounter some limitations as we attempt to model a more complicated growth model relative to the number of time points available in the data.</p>

<title>Growth Model for Three Time Points as a Mean-Structure Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) Model</title>
<p>One approach for growth modeling is by CFA. By this approach, a single-level two-factor CFA model with mean-structure parameters and constrained factor loadings is used for a linear growth model. This approach is often referred to as latent growth modeling (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534508412457872">Bollen &amp; Curran, 2006</xref>) because the initial status and growth trajectories are modeled as latent factors. One difference from the multilevel modeling approach (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534508412457872">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002</xref>) is that a model by the CFA approach is a single-level model, as opposed to a two-level model by the multilevel approach. This difference is due to the fact that the CFA approach models multiple outcome variables from multiple time points as a multivariate model, whereas the multilevel modeling approach models multiple outcome variables as a univariate model (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534508412457872">L. K. Muthén &amp; Muthén, 1998–2010</xref>).</p>
<p>We apply the CFA approach to data with three measurement occasions using three growth models: linear, piecewise, and piecewise growth mixture models (PGMMs). The linear growth model imposes a single, constant slope and requires no constraints to identify the model. The PGM allows for two different slopes—or gains from Time 1 to Time 2, and from Time 2 to Time 3—and a unique variance component for each, however, requires constraints to the covariance structure for model identification. The GMM uses the linear or piecewise specifications, among others, to classify individuals into heterogeneous groups so that individuals within group are more similar than those between groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534508412457872">Jung &amp; Wickrama, 2008</xref>). We describe these three models in more detail below.</p>
<sec id="section3-1534508412457872">
<title>Linear Growth Model</title>
<p>A typical setup of a linear growth model by the CFA approach with three time points is graphically depicted as a path diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534508412457872">Figure 1a</xref>. Here, <italic>y</italic>1, <italic>y</italic>2, and <italic>y</italic>3 are observed measurement indicators at the three time points. On the other hand, “I” and “S” within circles are latent factors that represent the growth intercept and growth slope, respectively. As these growth parameters are latent factors, it is analogous to the intercept and slope as random effects in the multilevel modeling approach. (Statistically, a random effect variable and a latent factor are the same thing because both are unobserved variables.) Notice that factor loadings are all constrained to fixed values: [1, 1, 1] for the intercept factor and [0, 1, 2] for the slope factor. The assignment of 1 for all time points for the intercept factor is almost always the case. However, assignment of numerical values for the slope factor can be some other values, such as [−2, −1, 0] or values that represent specific weeks in a school year. Furthermore, the little arrows that go into each one of the measurement indicators represent errors.</p>

<p>Parameters to be estimated in this model are categorized into two types: mean-structure parameters and covariance-structure parameters. Mean-structure parameters are the means of the two latent factors, namely, the mean intercept (β<sub>00</sub>) and the mean growth trajectory (β<sub>10</sub>).

By the multilevel modeling approach, the variances of the errors are assumed to be the same across all time points. On the other hand, error variances can be different between time points by the CFA approach. For a linear growth model with three time points, we have a 3 × 3 data covariance matrix with 3(3 + 1) / 2 = 6 unique components of the covariance matrix; therefore, the maximum number of covariance-structure parameters we can estimate is 6 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534508412457872">Kline, 2011</xref>, for details of model identification rules). For a typical linear growth model by the CFA approach, the number of covariance-structure parameters is as follows: 3 error variances (<inline-formula id="inline-formula4-1534508412457872">

This is the same number as the unique components of the data covariance matrix, and thus, the covariance structure is just identified. To make the model equivalent to the multilevel modeling approach, such as HLM, all error variances (Level 1 errors) can be constrained to be the same for all time points. Thus, the number of unique error variance is always 1. Then, the total number of the parameters will be 4, and the covariance structure is overidentified.</p>

This decision was based on their results that showed the chi-square test for the variance component of the fall-winter change parameter was not significant, but the winter-spring change parameter was significant, suggesting to fix to zero the random effect that was not statistically significant.

<title>GMM</title>
<p>Traditional growth modeling assumes that a sample of data has been drawn from a single population. Therefore, when parameters of a linear growth model (i.e., intercept and slope) are treated as random effects, their variances are parameterizations of individual differences in intercept and slope within a single population. However, the assumption of a single population may not always reasonably account for all types of individual differences, especially when groups of individuals display different patterns of growth. To overcome such a limitation, GMM has gained increasing attention in psychological and educational research. GMM aims to account for heterogeneity between individuals by identifying unobserved classes of individuals that display meaningfully different patterns of growth (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534508412457872">B. O. Muthén, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534508412457872">B. O. Muthén et al., 2002</xref>). Essentially, we can set up a GMM analysis in a way that any of estimated parameters in the base growth model can be the same or different between latent classes, depending on our theory about the population data. For example, we may set up the model where only the means of intercept and slope factors are different between latent classes. This setup will still allow us to capture different patterns of growth between latent classes. In addition, the magnitudes of the variances of intercept and slope factors and their covariance can be assumed to be different between latent classes. Differential variances will capture differential magnitudes of heterogeneity within class, whereas differential covariance will capture differential magnitude of the relation between growth trajectory parameters. In this study, we use the GMM by extending PGM specifications. Thus, we will refer it to as PGMM.</p>
<p>One critical decision to make in a GMM analysis is the number of latent classes. This should be done by evaluating the fit of the models with different numbers of latent classes. Typically, it is done by sequentially increasing the number of latent classes and stopping where the improvement of model fit becomes trivial. It has been recommended to evaluate information criterion indices, such as Baysian information criterion (BIC) and Akaike’s information criterion (AIC), as well as negative log likelihood. These indices are used in a way that a model with smaller value would indicate a better model choice. In addition, some goodness-of-fit statistics, such as Lo-Mendell-Rubin (LMR) likelihood ratio test and bootstrap likelihood ratio test, are available to evaluate statistical evidence for the improvement of a model with increased number of latent classes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534508412457872">Jung &amp; Wickrama, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>To conduct a GMM analysis, one needs somewhat specialized software. To date, we are aware of several software tools that can be used for a GMM analysis, including Mplus, OpenMx, Latent GOLD, SAS PROC TRAJ, and lcmm package for R. In subsequent sections, our data analysis demonstrations have been done by <italic>Mplus</italic>. Readers are referred to other didactic articles on GMM analysis, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534508412457872">Jung and Wickrama (2008)</xref>, for practical recommendations of analysis procedure, including software use and issues to be aware, such as small class proportions, nonconvergence, and local maxima problems.</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>This article used a data set from the fourth-grade PRF measure of the easyCBM progress monitoring assessment system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534508412457872">Alonzo &amp; Tindal, 2007</xref>), where scores were measured in the unit of words correct per minute (WCPM). There are a total of 20 PRF forms per grade level in the easyCBM progress monitoring systems. Among them, 3 forms are for benchmarking, which were the forms used for collecting the data in this study. Each form consists of a narrative passage with approximately 250 words, which is appropriate to the target grade level. Students are given 60 s to orally read as much of the passage as they can, and the WCPM is computed as students’ final score. The easyCBM Grade 4 PRF measures have demonstrated moderate to high levels of reliability evidence, with test–retest reliability ranging from .86 to .96 and alternate form reliability ranging from .83 to .98 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534508412457872">Alonzo, Lai, Anderson, Park, &amp; Tindal, 2012</xref>). A collection of data on passage difficulty was used to establish form equivalence of the PRF measures. Passage difficulty of the forms was adjusted to be closely aligned based on the Flesch–Kincaid readability index of 4.4 to 4.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534508412457872">Alonzo &amp; Tindal, 2007</xref>). High correlations between the forms (<italic>r</italic> = .80s–.90s) and results from a repeated measures analysis also have demonstrated that the 20 forms are sufficiently comparable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534508412457872">Alonzo &amp; Tindal, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The original sample data set contained observations from 2,403 students; however, for the purpose of this article, observations with data from only one time point were not included in the analyses. As a result, the sample size for Time 1, Time 2, and Time 3 were <italic>n</italic> = 2,166, <italic>n</italic> = 2,216, and <italic>n</italic> = 2,194, respectively. The descriptive statistics for the outcome measure (PRF) at three time points (PRF1, PRF2, and PRF3) are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534508412457872">Table 1</xref>. The mean difference between Time 1 and Time 2 was 22.44 WCPM, and it was much larger than the mean difference between Time 2 and Time 3, which was 8.91. In other words, the slope of the first segment was much steeper than the slope of the second segment. Therefore, our initial assessment was that a linear growth model would not be the best option to describe the pattern of growth for this data set. Therefore, we decided to seek a nonlinear growth model. In addition, for the purpose of testing for nonlinear growth statistically, we fit a linear growth model by the estimated time score approach, in which a slope factor score is estimated. For this purpose, we assigned time scores for the three time points, such that Time 1 = −2, Time 2 = −1, and Time 3 = estimated parameter (λ). As λ = 0 would indicate perfect linear growth, we tested <italic>H</italic><sub>0</sub>: λ = 0 by the two-tailed <italic>p</italic> value. As a result, λ was estimated to be −0.541 with <italic>p</italic> value less than .001, which was statistical evidence for a nonlinear growth in the population data and was consistent with our decision to model nonlinear growth. Individual growth trajectories for a randomly selected 5% of the sample are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1534508412457872">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

<p>When difference scores between Time 1 and Time 2 and between Time 2 and Time 3 were evaluated at the individual level, it was evident that growth patterns varied across individuals. The standard deviation of the difference scores for the first segment was 17.20, and 18.10 for the second segment. For some individuals, the slope of the second segment slope was as steep as that of the first. In addition, some individuals displayed very flat growth, and some others even displayed negative growth. Therefore, it would not be reasonable to assume that the growth pattern was a fixed effect for either of the two segments. Thus, we fitted a two-segment PGM to model the nonlinear growth pattern by estimating the variances of the slopes for both segments, while fixing the covariance between the slopes of the two segments to be zero. Then, we extended it to the PGMM analysis to further attempt to capture individual differences in growth trajectories and patterns.</p>
<p>All analyses were conducted in the framework of the latent growth modeling by Mplus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534508412457872">L. K. Muthén &amp; Muthén, 1998–2010</xref>), and Mplus syntaxes are provided in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1534508412457872">appendix</xref>. As a reference to the PGM, a regular linear growth model was fit first. The only constraint made for the analysis was equal error variances for all three time points. The comparative fit index (CFI) and Tucker–Lewis Index (TLI) obtained were each .938, which indicated acceptable fit based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534508412457872">Kline (2011)</xref>. However, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA; .267) and standardized root mean residual (SRMR; .107) did not meet Kline’s criteria to claim a good fit. Therefore, we interpreted that there was still room for model fit improvement. Information criterion values (AIC, BIC, and ABIC) are recorded in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1534508412457872">Table 2</xref>, and model parameter estimates are recorded in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1534508412457872">Table 3</xref>.

<title>PGM</title>
<p>We fit a single-class, two-segment PGM to the data in which the first segment consisted of Time 1 and Time 2, and the second segment consisted of Time 2 and Time 3. As mentioned earlier, this attempt requires some constraints to the model. Rather than constraining the intercept or one of the slopes to be a fixed effect (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534508412457872">Christ et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534508412457872">Nese, et al., 2012</xref>), we took an approach to constrain one of the covariances among them to be zero, because our initial data exploration indicated substantial variations between individuals for slopes of both segments as well as for the initial status. In addition, we constrained the error variances to be the same across three time points, which further reduced the number of covariance-structure parameters. Therefore, the number of covariance-structure parameters was 6, and the model was just-identified. Fit indices, such as CFI, TLI, RMSEA, and SRMR, are not obtained for a just-identified model. However, information criterion values, such as AIC, BIC, and ABIC, are still available to evaluate a relative model fit to a competing model(s).</p>
<p>We considered a model where the growth trajectories for the two segments were uncorrelated with one another. The intercept (initial status) was estimated to be 109.79, and the slopes were estimated to be 22.50 and 9.23 for the first and second segments, respectively. These results indicated that the slope of the second segment was much lower than the one for the first segment, which was consistent with the descriptive statistics in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534508412457872">Table 1</xref>. Examination of AIC, BIC, and ABIC indicated that these values were all smaller than the linear growth model, indicating an improved fit compared with the linear growth model (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1534508412457872">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on the estimated intercept and slope, the estimated means were 109.79 (the intercept) for Time 1; 109.79 + (1)(22.50) = 132.29 for Time 2; and 109.79 + (1)(22.50) + (1)(9.23) = 141.52 for Time 3. These are essentially identical to the observed means (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534508412457872">Table 1</xref>). These means are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1534508412457872">Figure 3a</xref> as the estimated growth pattern. The variance of the slope for the first segment was estimated to be 90.49, whereas the variance was 118.31 for the slope of the second segment, indicating slightly larger variation for the second segment slope. Again, these variance estimates were consistent with the descriptive statistics. The covariance between the intercept and the slope for the first segment was −8.33, which is transformed into a near-zero correlation of −.02, indicating that there was no relation between the initial status (fall score) and the growth trajectory for the first segment (fall-winter change score). The correlation is available from the standardized results produced by the software, as well as by a hand computation of <inline-formula id="inline-formula11-1534508412457872">

</inline-formula>. The covariance between the intercept and the slope for the second segment was 145.92 or .37 in the correlation scale. This indicated that the students with higher initial status tended to have steeper growth trajectory in the second segment, although the magnitude of the relation was not that large.</p>

<p>Again, note that this model is just-identified and no model fit indices can be obtained, other than information criterion values.

<title>PGMM</title>
<p>Next, the two-segment piecewise model was extended to a GMM. The first step was to decide the number of latent classes. We sequentially increased the number of latent classes and evaluated various fit indices (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1534508412457872">Table 2</xref> for summary). As a result, we observed that the model was improved by increasing the number of classes. However, we were not able to fit a model beyond the 3-class model, due to local maxima problems. As the 3-class model provided meaningfully interpretable results, we decided to use the 3-class model as the final reporting model. Here, we report both the 2-class model and 3-class model results.</p>
<p>The 2-class growth mixture piecewise model demonstrated improvement of the model compared with the single-class piecewise model. All information criterion values were smaller than those for the single-class piecewise model. Furthermore, both the LMR likelihood ratio test and the bootstrap likelihood ratio test provided small <italic>p</italic> values (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), indicating statistical evidence for model improvement compared with the 1-class piecewise model. The 2-class growth mixture piecewise model identified Class 1 (a majority class: class proportion = 71%) with a lower mean initial status (97.33) and Class 2 (high achievers: class proportion = 29%) with the higher mean initial status (141.04). Class 2 had a lower mean segment 1 slope than Class 1 (17.38 vs. 24.42). However, the mean segment 2 slope was much higher for Class 2 than for Class 1 (15.91 vs. 6.68). These results indicated that Class 1 (a majority class) displayed the same nonlinear growth pattern that was identified by the 1-class piecewise model. However, Class 2 (high achievers) displayed nearly the same slopes for the two segments, indicating a nearly linear growth pattern. In other words, there were about 30% of students who had a quite different growth pattern from the one identified by the single-class piecewise model. Growth patterns for the two classes are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1534508412457872">Figure 3b</xref>, and the growth pattern estimated by the single-class piecewise model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1534508412457872">Figure 3a</xref>.</p>
<p>By examining covariance-structure parameters, the covariance between the intercept and the slope for the first segment [<italic>Cov</italic>(<italic>I, S</italic>1)] was notable for discussion. By the single-class piecewise model analysis, this covariance was estimated to be near zero in the scale of a correlation coefficient (<italic>r</italic> = −.02). However, by the 2-class growth mixture piecewise model, this covariance was estimated quite differently. It was estimated to be <italic>r</italic> = −.49 for Class 1 (majority class), indicating there was a nonignorable negative correlation between the initial status and the slope of the first segment. On the other hand, the covariance was estimated to be <italic>r</italic> = .42 for Class 2 (high achievers), indicating a positive relationship between the initial status and the slope of the first segment. These results indicate that the estimate of this covariance from the single-class piecewise model (<italic>r</italic> = −.02) was quite misleading. In fact, the PGMM revealed that the initial status was indeed a good predictor for the first segment growth.</p>
<p>Next, the 3-class growth mixture piecewise model was fit. It demonstrated further improvement compared with the 2-class growth mixture piecewise model. All information criterion values were smaller than those for the 1- and 2-class piecewise models, and both the LMR likelihood ratio test and the bootstrap likelihood ratio test provided statistical evidence for model improvement compared with the 2-class growth mixture piecewise model (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). It appeared that the 3-class PGMM identified three classes in a way that it retained the high achieving minority class from the 2-class model, whereas the majority class from the 2-class model was further split into two classes. As a result, Class 1 (class proportion = 10%) was the at-risk class with very low mean initial status (58.91) and lower growth trajectories than the other classes. This identification of the at-risk class was the most informative result from the 3-class PGMM. For this at-risk class, the slope for the first segment was 14.61, whereas it was 25.63 for Class 2 (class proportion = 63%) and 17.91 for Class 3 (class proportion = 27%). The slope for the second segment for Class 1 was 4.44, which was 7.45 for Class 2 and 15.60 for Class 3. On the other hand, Class 2 was the majority class, in which students displayed comparable nonlinear growth pattern to the 1-class PGM results, as well as to the majority class from the 2-class PGMM results. Furthermore, we interpret Class 3 as a class of high achievers, just like the minority class identified in the 2-class PGMM, which indicated high initial status and nearly linear growth. Growth patterns for the three classes are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1534508412457872">Figure 3c</xref>.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article demonstrated a series of data analyses to model nonlinear growth and heterogeneity of nonlinear growth patterns (namely, a growth mixture piecewise modeling approach), when data were available from only three time points using a sample data set from PRF measures in easyCBM. However, we would like to note that the demonstrated approach is not the only solution to model a nonlinear growth and heterogeneity of growth patterns when data are available from only three time points.</p>
<p>For example, a possible alternative to model nonlinear growth with three time points is to use an estimated time-score approach. In general, an estimated time score approach fits a linear growth model, while leaving one or more time scores (i.e., equivalent to factor loadings) as parameters. (Note that at least two time scores have to be fixed for any growth model.) If the growth is truly linear, the set of time scores, including those estimated, will retain equal time intervals. On the other hand, if the growth is nonlinear, the set of time scores will display unequal time intervals. For example, for a three-time-point data set, we can specify factor loadings for the growth trajectory factor to be (0, 1, λ), where λ is the parameter to be estimated. With this setup, if λ is estimated to be exactly 2.0, the time intervals between the first two time points and between the second two time points are both 1.0. Therefore, the slopes for the two time intervals are equal, and it would indicate that the growth pattern is exactly linear. On the other hand, if λ ≠ 2.0, the slopes for the two time intervals are not equal. Thus, it would be an indication of a nonlinear growth pattern. If λ &lt; 2.0 in our example, it would indicate that the trajectory for the second segment is flatter than the trajectory for the first segment. On the other hand, if λ &gt; 2.0, it would mean that the trajectory for the second segment is steeper than the first segment. This modeling technique has been used in social science research literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534508412457872">Carlo, Crockett, Randall, &amp; Roesch, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534508412457872">Heck &amp; Takahashi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534508412457872">Li, Duncan, Mcauley, Harmer, &amp; Smolkowski, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534508412457872">Stoolmiller, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Additional benefit of this approach is that we can statistically test for a nonlinear trend. If we have enough evidence to reject <italic>H</italic><sub>0</sub>: λ = 2.0, we can state that we have statistical evidence for nonlinear growth in population data. Practically, for a three-time-point data set, by specifying factor loadings to be (−2, −1, λ), we can directly use the reported two-tailed <italic>p</italic> value for the estimated λ to test <italic>H</italic><sub>0</sub>: λ = 0 to make an inference about nonlinearity in the population data. This use of the estimated time score approach was in fact demonstrated earlier in this article.</p>
<p>Note that this estimated time-score approach is possible only by the CFA approach, because the multilevel modeling approach requires all time scores to be fixed as known values. Nonetheless, one restriction of the estimated time-score approach is that estimated time score(s) cannot be treated as a random effect. Therefore, we cannot estimate the variance of the estimated time score, nor the covariance between the estimated time score and other latent factors (e.g., growth intercept and the grow trajectory for the first segment). The reason is that a time score is a factor loading, and a factor loading cannot be treated as a random effect. (However, a new development in the future may make this statement obsolete because this restriction is due to a limitation of currently available estimation algorithms, rather than a theoretical limitation of the model.) This is a similar restriction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534508412457872">Nese et al. (2012)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534508412457872">Christ et al. (2010)</xref> chose to implement by using the PGM approach. Although we do not present the results, a combination of this estimated time score approach and a growth mixture analysis approach did in fact successfully model heterogeneity of estimated time scores, as well as heterogeneity of growth patterns, and demonstrated similar results as the PGMM approach.</p>
<p>As an alternative approach, we can also fit a quadratic growth model with three time points with some covariance-structure parameter constraints, despite a common perception that we need at least four time points to fit a quadratic growth model. The number of covariance-structure parameters will be 9 without any constraints. Clearly, this number is larger than 3(3 + 1) / 2 = 6, and the covariance structure is underidentified. If we constrain the error variances to be the same for the three time points, as well as one of the three covariances between the three latent factors to be zero, the number of the covariance-structure parameters will be 6. Then, the covariance structure will be just-identified, and this will make the model parameters estimable. Note that these are the same restraints used for our PGMs in this article. Similar to the PGMM we demonstrated, this restricted form of a quadratic model can also be extended to a GMM to further explain individual differences and to capture heterogeneity of growth patterns.</p>
<p>The primary goal of our article was to demonstrate nonlinear growth modeling data analyses to be applied to data with three testing occasions. PRF is the most studied CBM, and researchers have recently challenged and rejected the previously held assumption that within-year PRF growth increased in a linear fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534508412457872">Christ et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534508412457872">Nese et al., 2012</xref>). In general, however, research in this area is generally based on analyses (e.g., OLS regression or HLM), which estimate a mean growth for the entire sample and assume that a single mean growth trajectory can adequately describe the entire population and that all students within the sample are from the same population. As our results demonstrated, these assumptions may not be tenable and may restrict our interpretation of growth trajectory patterns. With approximately 2,100 Grade 4 students, we fit a 3-class PGMM, where Class 1 represented students at risk of poor learning outcomes, demonstrating a very low mean initial PRF status (around the 7th percentile), and a lower growth trajectory than the other classes. Class 2 represented the majority of the sample, or the “average” students, those demonstrating a mean initial status (around the 46th percentile) and greater growth in the fall than spring which could be interpreted as average Grade 4 PRF trajectories (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534508412457872">Christ et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534508412457872">Nese et al., 2012</xref>). Class 3 represented high achieving students, demonstrating high initial PRF status (around the 86th percentile) and nearly linear growth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1534508412457872">2</xref></sup> Such findings from PGMM may provide important implications for local response to intervention (RTI) policies, including the generation of adequate expectations for growth using progress monitoring tools.</p>
<p>Just as exploiting the potential of nonlinear growth models despite a limited number of available random parameters benefits practitioners who rely on accurate benchmarks for growth data, so do the models and analyses presented here benefit applied researchers looking for options and alternatives to modeling growth with three time points.</p>
