<abstract>
<p>The medication assessment tool for cancer pain management (MAT-CP) measures the quality of medication use in relation to guidelines. The original MAT-CP was reviewed, modified and tested at a comprehensive cancer center in Jordan. The tool comprised 30 criteria covering six different aspects of pain management. Seventy patients were included, males 41 (59%), females 29 (41%), mean age 49 (range, 20-79) years. The overall level of adherence to guidelines was 78% with good inter-rater reliability (κ= 0.899). The tool's implementation showed opportunities for improvement in pain management at our institution. The MAT-CP was revised and validated for the first time outside Europe. This tool can be routinely used to assess and compare the quality of pain management in different institutions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pain is one of the most common symptoms in malignant disease; it ranges in prevalence from 14% to 100% among patients with cancer and occurs in 50% to 70% of patients on active treatment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049909111435812">1</xref>
</sup> Effective pain management is an important component of cancer care due to the impact of uncontrolled pain on the quality of life of patients and their families.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049909111435812">1</xref>
</sup> The World Health Organization (WHO) developed a pain management algorithm for cancer pain relief with the 3-step analgesic ladder.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049909111435812">2</xref>
</sup> When the WHO guideline is used appropriately, pain can be adequately relieved in up to 90% of patients with cancer.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049909111435812">3</xref>
</sup> Despite the wide adoption of the WHO algorithm, unsatisfactory pain control is still reported in many patients with cancer, around the world.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049909111435812">4</xref>
</sup> Many factors can contribute to this inadequate pain control including limited access to pain medications, lack of knowledge in pain assessment and management, misconceptions about opioids, poor communication with patients, and nonadherence to treatment regimens.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049909111435812">5</xref>
</sup> Because the pharmacological approach is the cornerstone in treating pain, the appropriateness of prescribing and its adherence to the WHO guidelines can be used to assess the quality of pain management. Based on the WHO clinical guidelines, a medication assessment tool for cancer pain management (MAT-CP) was developed in Norway and revised, validated, and implemented in the United Kingdom.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049909111435812">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049909111435812">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049909111435812">7</xref>
</sup> This tool addresses prescribing and prescribing-related issues and is intended to measure adherence to cancer pain management guidelines. Unfortunately, this tool has never been implemented outside Europe. Revising the MAT-CP to confirm its fitness for our clinical setting and its subsequent implementation to assess the quality of pain management will inform areas for improvement in our practice. The aim of this paper is to describe the revision of the MAT-CP and its validation by using this tool to audit pain management in adult patients with cancer at a comprehensive cancer center in Jordan.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1049909111435812">
<title>Patients and Settings</title>
<p>The study was conducted at the King Hussein Cancer Center (KHCC) in Amman, Jordan. KHCC is a leading, comprehensive, nongovernmental, not-for-profit cancer center that has a capacity of 160 beds. Cancer pain management is provided to KHCC patients by an interdisciplinary hospice and palliative care team that includes physicians, clinical pharmacists, nurses, and social workers. The charts of adult patients admitted to the units of medical oncology or hospice who also experienced pain and/or were on pain medications were reviewed for a period of 4 months in 2010. Relevant information was collected using a special form designed for this purpose.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049909111435812">
<title>The Original MAT-CP</title>
<p>The original MAT-CP comprises 36 criteria grouped under 6 categories covering different aspects of pain management: (1) pain assessment and information transfer, (2) start of strong opioid therapy, (3) current continuous analgesia, (4) current intermittent (as needed [PRN]) analgesia, (5) follow-up of therapy, and (6) other care issues. The criteria are given in the form of statements where a qualifying condition (qualifier, q) is followed by an audit standard (s).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049909111435812">6</xref>
</sup> The qualifier is a statement to determine whether the criterion applies to the patient and indicates that the standard can be tested. The standard that follows the qualifier is a statement of the guideline recommendation and requires “yes” or “no” response on the basis of evidence that the standard is being met.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049909111435812">6</xref>

<sec id="section5-1049909111435812">
<title>Revision and Validation of the MAT-CP</title>
<p>A description of the tool was presented to a focus group of pain management specialists, palliative care specialists, and clinical pharmacists at KHCC. The group suggested some modifications to the original tool to ensure its fitness for purpose in our clinical setting. The modified version was piloted by 2 clinical pharmacists on 10 patients to confirm its applicability before its final implementation in auditing patient records. Results were obtained in terms of percentage applicability of criteria, insufficient data, and adherence to guidelines (overall, per patient, and to individual criteria). Inter-rater reliability was tested during the implementation of the tool by 2 clinical pharmacists, and intra-rater reliability was calculated from the main researchers on 2 separate occasions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1049909111435812">
<title>Statistics</title>
<p>Adherence to the guidelines was calculated for each criterion and for the overall tool by summing the “yes” responses to the standard and expressing them as a percentage of the total number of applicable criteria. A 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for the adherence data. Inter- and Intra-rater reliability was calculated using Cohen kappa (κ) statistics where agreement was judged strong if the κ was (0.81-1.00), substantial (0.61-0.80), moderate (0.41-0.60), fair (0.21-0.40), slight (0.0-0.20), and poor if (&lt;0).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1049909111435812">
<title>Ethics</title>
<p>The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at KHCC. The authors of the original MAT-CP were contacted to permit the revision and validation.</p>

<title>MAT-CP Modified Version</title>
<p>The modifications on the original MAT-CP tool are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1049909111435812">Table 1</xref>. The audit period was changed to include only the current admission rather than a 12-month audit period. Furthermore, as the patients may already be on pain medications, the criteria (7-11) were changed to include starting or adjusting already started strong opioid therapy. In addition, a criterion was added to assess patient satisfaction with pain control. Because the usual starting dose of morphine according to our local guidelines is 10 mg every 4 to 6 hours, criterion 9 was changed accordingly. Moreover, the intermittent opioid dose for breakthrough pain in criterion 22 was changed to no less than 10% to 20% of the total daily opioid dose used for the continuous analgesia.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The original MAT-CP was revised and modified for use at a comprehensive cancer center in Jordan. The revised version comprised 30 criteria related to 6 different aspects of cancer pain management, namely (1) pain assessment and documentation, (2) starting/adjusting opioid therapy, (3) current continuous analgesia, (4) current intermittent analgesia, (5) follow-up of pain therapy, and (6) other care issues. The changes made to the original tool aimed at making its implementation more practical and to better fit our practice setting. For example, the audit period was changed to include only the current admission rather than the 12-month duration. Furthermore, because some patients had been already started on pain medications, the criteria (7-11) were changed to become starting or modification of already started opioid therapy. Other modifications included changes in recommended continuous and intermittent analgesia as well as minor modifications to the criteria relevant to the follow-up and supportive care of patients. In general, the revised tool showed satisfactory reliability and face and content validity. When compared to other tools for pain management assessment, including the widely used Pain Management Index (PMI), the MAT-CP was specific to cancer and more comprehensive in terms of its coverage for different aspects of pain management such as pain characteristics, opioid dose titration, route of administration, intermittent analgesia, and supportive therapies and follow-up.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049909111435812">8</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049909111435812"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049909111435812">10</xref>
</sup> This being said, we believe that one drawback in the MAT-CP and other available tools is that they do not link the estimated appropriateness or quality of pain management to patients outcomes that is pain relief or quality of life. In our revised version of the MAT-CP, we added point 12 to assess patient satisfaction with their pain management which is an essential criterion for adjusting the continuous analgesic treatment. Another point worth mentioning is that most of the available tools do not address some important issues that can affect pain management such as patients' beliefs and expectations about their pain or patients' compliance with their medications.</p>
<p>When used for auditing, the staff involved reported that using this tool took some time to extract and document data, however this time went down when they became more familiar with the forms used. To make its implementation more practical and to save time, a subset of the criteria can be selected to address specific areas of interest for future audits for example pain assessment upon admission. Some information was hard to collect because the review of charts was retrospective. Nevertheless, it was necessary to review charts in order to draw conclusions on the quality and appropriateness of pain management and its documentation. The audit showed that the overall adherence rate was very good (78%). This high score can be justified by the presence of specialized care provided by the palliative care team, including a palliative clinical pharmacist, for most of the patients in the study. However, low adherence rate was noticed in some of the individual criterion such as the assessment of pain duration and pain intensity upon admission, documented reason for choosing nonoral route, exceeded intensity of PRN doses, and the treatment of persistent pain including the use of radiation therapy for bone metastasis. These results can be explained by the lack of knowledge and skills required to perform some of the tasks, for example pain assessment, poor documentation, and the difficulty in retrieving the required information, or by low applicability. For instance, criterion 8 had low applicability because most of the patients audited were already on potent opioids upon admission due to their advanced disease. Nevertheless, there is room for modification in these criteria and particularly in pain assessment documentation. One suggestion is to develop templates that are incorporated into patients' charts to be filled upon admission and for follow-up during the patients' stay in the hospital.</p>
<p>Our results are very much in line with the results reported from other institutions that used the MAT-CP to audit the quality of prescribing in pain management. In a recent study, the MAT-CP was applied at 2 hospitals and 5 hospices in Scotland. For the 192 cancer patients included, the overall guideline adherence was 75% (CI: 74%-77%; n = 3460 applicable criteria). Low adherence (&lt;50%) was seen for 9 criteria, whereas 21 criteria were considered high-adherence criteria (&gt;75%). The study showed that the overall adherence for hospice patients was 79% (CI: 78%-81%), whereas the guideline adherence for hospitalized patients was 65% (CI: 62%-68%). The highest adherence was seen for criteria relating to continuous analgesic drugs and those relating to intermittent pain.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049909111435812">7</xref>
</sup> The criteria with low adherence were those relating to pain assessment and “start of strong opioid therapy,” whereas the highest adherence was reported for the criteria relating to continuous analgesic drugs and those relating to intermittent pain. The authors concluded that although good overall guideline adherence was found, there were gaps in both the hospice and hospital palliative care settings in the implementation of certain treatment recommendations, particularly in relation to pain assessment.<sup>

</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published work to validate the MAT-CP outside the United Kingdom and Norway, and it is the first published article to describe the appropriateness of pain management in the Middle East. Most of the publications from this part of the world focused on the access to opioid analgesia due to political, legislative, cultural, and behavioral barriers.<sup>

</sup> It was important for us as a leading cancer center in the region to show that once opioids and other pain medications become available, it is paramount to ensure that they are utilized effectively. The MAT-CP represented a valid approach to the assessment of the quality of pain management in our patients with cancer. It pinpointed certain problematic areas in our practice that need to be addressed to improve pain services in our institution. Furthermore, this tool can be used to benchmark best practices in other institutions to inform continuous quality improvement initiatives.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We revised and validated a tool to assess the appropriateness of pain management in patients with cancer at a comprehensive cancer center in Jordan. The overall level of adherence calculated indicated a high level of adherence to guideline recommendations. However, there is an opportunity for improvement in certain criteria for example pain assessment. The tool can be used for regular auditing to inform the quality of pain management in a given health care setting or to compare clinical practice between different institutions. Further research is warranted to refine the current tool to count for other factors such as patient compliance and to link the appropriateness of prescribing to outcome indicators such as pain relief and quality of life.</p>
