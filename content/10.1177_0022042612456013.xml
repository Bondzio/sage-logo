<abstract>
<p>Scholars have learned a great deal about the age at which individuals typically initiate particular drugs, the contexts in which they initiate use, and some of the motivations for initiation. Despite this attention, there remain few scholarly examinations of the accounts or “storylines” that users themselves give as explanation for their initiation. The authors present research from 40 interviews with female methamphetamine (meth) users incarcerated in Missouri, a state that has gained national attention for having high numbers of meth lab seizures. This study focuses specifically on the ways in which women articulate their storylines of initiation into meth use. These reveal a number of important findings, including the most common contexts in which women describe first using meth and their motivations for doing so. In particular, the findings highlight the role of family drug use, prior victimization experiences, and meth’s known pharmacological effects in women’s motivations for initiation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There is growing consensus that the use and abuse of methamphetamine (meth) is a serious problem in the United States, and particularly hard hit have been rural areas, where law enforcement officials and social service agencies are racing to deal with the consequences of meth use and production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022042612456013">Kraman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022042612456013">Wermuth, 2000</xref>). Beginning in the early 1990s, the midwestern regions saw a “rapid expansion” in the meth market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022042612456013">Wermuth, 2000</xref>, p. 426), and Missouri is no exception.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022042612456013">1</xref></sup> Although meth use and market involvement have traditionally been characterized as male activities, there is evidence from arrest and treatment data that women in Missouri are actively involved in the use, manufacturing, and sale of meth at rates nearly equal to those of men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022042612456013">Missouri Statistical Analysis Center [MSAC], 2007</xref>). Scholarly research is increasingly focused on women who use and sell meth (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022042612456013">Brecht, O’Brien, von Mayrhauser, &amp; Anglin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022042612456013">Joe, 1995</xref>), yet there are a number of remaining gaps in our understanding of their drug use experiences.</p>
<p>Although there is considerable research on the patterns of drug use onset, there are few ethnographic accounts of drug initiation despite its centrality in the lives of individual users. In particular, there is little information on the way in which users initially gain access to the drug, their experience on the first occasion of use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022042612456013">Sheridan, Butler, &amp; Wheeler, 2009</xref>), and the “storylines” they use to make sense of their drug use onset. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022042612456013">Agnew (2006)</xref> suggests that such storylines are an overlooked causal mechanism for understanding offending, yet can “help us better understand the effect of background and situational factors” (p. 120) that lead to involvement in crime and deviance.</p>
<p>In this study, we examine women’s initiation experiences with meth use, and their narrative accounts of the circumstances surrounding their initiation. Interviews with 40 incarcerated women in the state of Missouri, who self-identify as meth users, provide insight into the situations that surround their first use, including where and with whom initiation took place, how the drug was obtained, and the manner in which the drug was used initially. The data also provide an opportunity for the women to tell us how they construct the “storyline” of their meth use, including their motivations for first use, and how they situate their meth initiation within broader life experiences. Specifically, we ask, How do women describe their meth initiation experiences? What situational contexts and motivations do women highlight as particularly relevant to their decisions to initiate use? Do women articulate their meth initiation in ways consistent with traditional depictions of female drug use, or do they construct narratives that highlight other motivations and contexts? Answers to such questions have relevance for continued research on drug initiation as well as prevention and treatment efforts for women specifically.</p>

<title>The Persistent Problem of Meth</title>
<p>Various drug use indicators—including reports from criminal justice agencies, treatment providers, and public health officials—suggest that meth use is a persistent problem. Data from the 2005 National Household Surveys on Drug Abuse (NHSDA) indicate that approximately 1.3 million persons (0.6% of the population) had used meth within the previous 12 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022042612456013">Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA], 2007</xref>). Reports from emergency room and treatment providers also provide evidence that meth continues to have a profound impact on public health; from 1995 to 2005, the percentage of substance abuse treatment admissions for primary meth/amphetamine use more than doubled, going from 4% to 9% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022042612456013">SAMHSA, 2008</xref>). Meth has also been cited as one of the major drugs of concern by federal, state, and local law enforcement, with 48% of these agencies now reporting meth as their “number one” drug problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022042612456013">National Association of Counties [NACo], 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Scholarly research on meth has increased in recent years, likely due to the toll that the use and production of this drug takes on communities, families, law enforcement agencies, the environment, and users’ mental and physical health. The use of meth is diffusing throughout the United States, particularly into rural areas in the Midwest and South where farming and the economy are declining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022042612456013">Kraman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022042612456013">Wermuth, 2000</xref>). Although meth has been typically associated with less educated, lower socioeconomic status nonminority males, disproportionate rates of meth use have appeared among other groups, including Latinos, gay/bisexual males, and women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022042612456013">Wermuth, 2000</xref>). Despite these trends, there has been less scholarly attention to the meth-related experiences of women, particularly women living in rural areas. Yet, attention to this group is important for several reasons. First, unlike many other illegal drugs, meth appears to be used nearly equally by men and women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022042612456013">SAMHSA, 2007</xref>). Second, studies suggest that the motivations and circumstances surrounding women’s use of meth differ somewhat from those of men. For example, women are more likely than men to be introduced to meth by a romantic partner and also more likely to use it for weight loss or increased energy to perform household tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022042612456013">Brecht et al., 2004</xref>). Finally, meth tends, at least in the Midwest, to be a rural phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612456013">Hunt, Kuck, &amp; Truitt, 2006</xref>). Because family structural conditions, cultural norms, levels of formal and informal social control, and even offending differ by location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022042612456013">Weisheit &amp; Donnermeyer, 2000</xref>), nonurban populations must be studied to gain a more complete understanding of the causes and contexts of meth involvement. Such contextual factors may have particular import for how and why individuals begin using drugs.</p>

<title>Initiation of Meth Use</title>
<p>Although drug initiation is typically a consequential life event, accounts of how individuals first come to use a particular drug, and their qualitative experiences of initiation, are not often the focus of extensive research. Instead, quantitative interest has primarily centered on the timing of initiation and those factors related to “early” versus “late” drug initiation, the patterning of poly-drug use over time, the identity of drug initiation partners, and the various motivations or factors related to initial drug use. Evidence of similarities and differences in the drug initiation contexts of men and women suggests a need for continued focus on such experiences.</p>
<p>Examining meth initiation specifically, scholars note that it often occurs in early adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022042612456013">Brecht, Greenwell, &amp; Anglin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022042612456013">Sexton, Carlson, Leukefeld, &amp; Booth, 2006</xref>) following the use of other drugs such as alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022042612456013">Brecht et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022042612456013">Brecht et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022042612456013">Sheridan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022042612456013">von Mayrhauser, Brecht, &amp; Anglin, 2002</xref>). Although men and women typically begin using meth with family and friends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022042612456013">Sheridan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022042612456013">von Mayrhauser et al., 2002</xref>), men are more often introduced to meth by male peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022042612456013">Brecht et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022042612456013">Joe, 1995</xref>), whereas women more often begin to use with a spouse or intimate partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022042612456013">Brecht et al., 2004</xref>). Finally, although men and women may begin using meth out of curiosity or to get high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022042612456013">Brecht et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022042612456013">von Mayrhauser et al., 2002</xref>), motivations for continued use appear to differ somewhat by gender. For example, women more often report using meth for weight loss and increased energy for dealing with the demands of motherhood and other social relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022042612456013">Brecht et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022042612456013">Carbone-Lopez &amp; Miller, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022042612456013">Joe, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022042612456013">Semple, Grant, &amp; Patterson, 2004</xref>). In contrast, men point to the increased energy, better sex, and ability to work long hours as motivating factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022042612456013">Brecht et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>There are, however, few published qualitative studies on the initiation into meth use and abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022042612456013">Sheridan et al., 2009</xref>). In particular, there is limited information on the ways in which users initially gain access to meth, how and why they begin using, and their experiences on the first occasion of meth use. A focus on these elements of initiation would situate such experiences within the broader contexts of individuals’ lives, including their relationships with families and friends, other substance use, and victimization experiences. “Thick” descriptions of the initial use of meth also provide an opportunity for users themselves to tell us how they understand their drug use.</p>

<title>“Storylines” and Women’s Initiation Into Drug Use</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022042612456013">Agnew (2006)</xref> recently introduced “storylines” as a way to better understand the impact of background and situational factors on crime. Instead of focusing predominantly on individual dispositions and criminogenic factors that lead to crime, or on those situational contexts in which crime is more likely to occur, a storyline approach is interested in the events and conditions leading up to the crime event. In other words, it tells the story of <italic>how</italic> and <italic>why</italic> one comes to be engaged in crime or deviant behavior. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022042612456013">Agnew (2006)</xref>, such stories typically begin with an event that is out of the ordinary. This event then “temporarily affects the characteristics of the individual, the individual’s interactions with others, and/or the settings encountered by the individual” such that the likelihood of criminal or deviant behavior is increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022042612456013">Agnew, 2006</xref>, p. 121). For example, a particular event may temporarily increase strain, reduce social control, or increase opportunities for crime commission. Whether crime occurs, then, is dependent on a number of interrelated factors such as interactions with others, the emotional state of the individual, and situational factors such as the absence of capable guardianship or physical locations and spaces conducive to crime and deviance.</p>
<p>The advantage of the storyline approach is that it mirrors how offenders typically describe their crimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022042612456013">Agnew, 2006</xref>) rather than forcing preexisting analytic frameworks onto those crimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022042612456013">Kavanaugh, 2010</xref>). Using this model, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022042612456013">Agnew (2006)</xref> highlighted five “common storylines conducive to crime” including the desperate need for money, an unresolved dispute, a brief (but close) encounter with an offender, a brief and tempting opportunity for offending, and a temporary break from conventional others (p. 126). These temporary strains may lead some individuals to engage in crime to cope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022042612456013">Agnew, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022042612456013">2006</xref>). Although he focuses on violent and income-generating offenses, and the relevant strains that encourage them, Agnew also acknowledges that storylines may differ according to type of crime and individual characteristics such as age and gender. In fact, the experience of strain and the reactions to it are gendered, and women are more likely to respond to strain with self-directed emotions that are often linked to drug use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022042612456013">Broidy, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022042612456013">Broidy &amp; Agnew, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022042612456013">Jang, 2007</xref>). Thus, a focus on the use of drugs may generate alternative storylines than the initial five Agnew described.</p>
<p>Although it has not used the storyline terminology, the existing research on drug initiation more broadly provides suggestions as to the situations and events that may be most conducive to initial drug use. Yet, in the case of women and their drug initiation, a narrative of “pathology and powerlessness” pervades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022042612456013">Anderson, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022042612456013">2008</xref>). Female drug users have traditionally been portrayed as victims who have been exploited by others, particularly romantic partners, and who begin using drugs to cope with previous traumatic experiences. Such depictions have some support in the empirical literature. For example, there is evidence that the relationship between early victimization experiences and later substance abuse is more significant for females than males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022042612456013">Messina et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022042612456013">Simpson &amp; Miller, 2002</xref>) and that women may self-medicate with drugs following trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022042612456013">Salisbury &amp; Van Voorhis, 2009</xref>). Moreover, women’s access to drugs and involvement in the drug market is often (at least initially) through their boyfriends or husbands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022042612456013">Lopez, Jurik, &amp; Gilliard-Matthews, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022042612456013">Maher &amp; Curtis, 1992</xref>), thus reinforcing the argument that women’s participation in crime and drug activity is contingent on their link to men involved in similar activities.</p>
<p>However, this focus on victimization experiences and the idea that women are dependent on men to provide them with drugs denies women <italic>agency</italic> in their own drug use experiences. Moreover, there is emerging evidence that alternative storylines of women’s drug initiation and use exist. Three examples of qualitative accounts of drug initiation reveal that victimization and romantic relationships are only part of the stories; prior drug use, drug-using friends and family members, and a desire for the benefits associated with drug use are also important elements of women’s drug initiation. Marsha <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022042612456013">Rosenbaum (1981)</xref> portrayed women’s initiation into heroin as the first stage in a drug “career.” When they began using heroin, many of the women in her sample had already experimented with marijuana and other drugs. Their decision to initiate heroin use was made within the confines of their social circumstances. Surrounded by peers and romantic partners who used heroin, the women that Rosenbaum interviewed began exploring the heroin lifestyle. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022042612456013">Claire Sterk (1999)</xref>, in her research on women’s use of crack cocaine, described a similar initiation process. Although many of the women she interviewed described their first (and, in some cases, their subsequent) use of crack as a coincident—they were in the right place at the right time—others admitted that they <italic>sought</italic> out social situations in which drug use would occur. Gradually, these women’s friendship networks evolved to only include other drug users and their use of crack cocaine then intensified.</p>
<p>While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022042612456013">Rosenbaum (1981)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022042612456013">Sterk (1999)</xref> focused on heroin and crack cocaine, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022042612456013">Karen Joe (1995)</xref> described men’s and women’s entry into crystal meth (ice) use in Hawaii in the early 1990s. She found some notable gender differences in initiation experiences and context of use. Specifically, she found that men’s initiation and use patterns were connected to notions of masculinity (“male bonding”), whereas women’s ice use tended to be connected with “being a woman, attending to social appearances and domestic duties” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022042612456013">Joe, 1995</xref>, p. 287). At the same time, Joe also noted the important role of cultural traditions of family and honor, economic marginality, and the presence of violence and substance abuse within the family in motivating and facilitating men’s and women’s initiation with ice. These examples demonstrate that women may initiate the use of different drugs for very different reasons, yet their choices are ultimately structured by their environment and peers.</p>
<p>Describing the contexts in which first drug use typically occurs and identifying those factors related to drug initiation are imperative for the development of treatment and intervention efforts. Given the reemergence of meth as a serious social problem, and the substantial proportion of meth users who are women, it is particularly important to investigate women’s patterns of meth initiation. Only a handful of published qualitative accounts of meth initiation and use patterns are available, and few of them focus specifically on women’s experiences. A qualitative approach provides researchers with important insights into how individuals understand, explain, and give meaning to their life worlds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022042612456013">Mishler, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022042612456013">Orbuch, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022042612456013">Watson &amp; Watson-Franke, 1985</xref>) while also gathering detailed information about the foreground micro- and meso-level processes and contexts surrounding their participation in events or behaviors of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022042612456013">J. Miller &amp; Glassner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022042612456013">Short, 1998</xref>). This approach allows respondents to provide their own accounts of the particular combinations of events and conditions they believe explain why and how they initiated meth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022042612456013">Agnew, 2006</xref>). In the following, we draw on individual women’s narratives of their initiation of meth use—their “storylines”—to provide additional insight into gendered patterns of meth initiation, including the factors they attribute to the onset of their meth use.</p>

<title>Data and Method</title>
<sec id="section6-0022042612456013">
<title>Interview Procedures</title>
<p>Our study of meth initiation narratives relies on qualitative in-depth interviews with 40 incarcerated women involved in a correctional drug and alcohol treatment program.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022042612456013">2</xref></sup> These women were court ordered to participate in a comprehensive treatment program operated by Gateway Foundation at Missouri’s Women’s Eastern Reception Diagnostic and Correctional Center (WERDCC). Missouri is an ideal location for research on women’s experiences with meth. Data on treatment admissions in the state suggest that nearly half of all who seek treatment specifically for meth abuse are women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022042612456013">MSAC, 2007</xref>). Although the cooking of meth has often been characterized as a predominantly male activity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022042612456013">Senjo, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022042612456013">Sexton et al., 2006</xref>), there is evidence that women in Missouri are actively involved in the manufacturing, sales, and use of meth. A recent survey of members of the Multi-Jurisdictional Task Force in Missouri indicated that 40% of meth lab seizures included the arrest of a woman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022042612456013">MSAC, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>To begin to address the gaps in our understanding of women’s initiation of meth, members of the research team visited the prison to meet the women.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022042612456013">3</xref></sup> The first author described the research to all women in the treatment unit and asked for volunteers. Initial screening was done to ensure that women had sufficient experience with meth: Women who had used meth more than 5 times in the 12 months prior to incarceration or had ever sold or cooked it were eligible to participate. These eligibility criteria were initially broad because the Department of Corrections was unable to identify women with histories of meth use. Thus, we were unsure how many meth users we would be able to identify. Our objective was to capture a diverse group of meth-involved women, including women who had recently used as well as those who had somewhat more peripheral involvement in the market, either as sellers or cooks. However, a large number of women volunteered and all had been active or frequent users of meth prior to incarceration.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022042612456013">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Interviews were conducted in private offices within the institution, away from correctional and treatment staff and other inmates. After outlining the research objectives of the study, the interviewers explained to women that they did not have to answer questions they felt were too sensitive. They also asked the women not to use their real names or the names of other people or places discussed during the interview. Finally, the interviewers reminded the women of the exceptions to confidentiality (required reporting in cases where women disclosed future intent to harm themselves or others) and asked them to refrain from making any such statements. Each respondent was paid US$20 for her participation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022042612456013">5</xref></sup> The interviews were audio recorded and later transcribed verbatim by the interviewer. All names in the transcripts were replaced with pseudonyms to protect women’s confidentiality.</p>
<p>The semistructured interviews lasted approximately an hour and covered a range of topics related to women’s experiences with meth. Interviewers began with general background questions and eventually turned to the more sensitive questions, after initial rapport had been established. Women were asked to describe their initiation into meth use; this included both the immediate situational context in which they first were offered or sought out the drug as well as a broader description of their life circumstances at the time of meth initiation. Interviewers probed in most cases to find out specific details on where, with whom, how, and why women began using meth.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>To begin our analysis, all narrative data related to meth initiation were merged into a single data file. Each author independently coded the data by hand for themes and patterns associated with initiation storylines, after which all three worked together to refine the analysis of the thematic patterns reported here. This approach established interrater reliability.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022042612456013">6</xref></sup> Inductive analysis techniques, based on grounded theory principles, were used to identify initiation context and motivations as well as life events identified by women as relevant to their meth initiation. In doing so, we began with close and repeated readings of the data, during which we coded words and passages, documented preliminary analytic observations, and generated emergent hypotheses that we then tested, refined, or rejected using the data. To ensure the rigor of the inductive process, we used constant comparative methods, which involved comparing statements and accounts within and across interviews for evidence of patterns, continuities and discontinuities. For example, we compared women’s accounts based on their age of initiation, prior drug use, and initiation context. Important to this process was the search for evidence that disconfirmed emergent hypotheses. This allowed for the refinement or rejection of initially identified analytic patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022042612456013">Charmaz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022042612456013">J. Miller, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022042612456013">Silverman, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Our methodological approach and sampling strategy come with strengths and limitations. Our study is specific to female meth users in a midwestern state, and is drawn from an incarcerated population with particularly acute problems. Although this poses some research challenges (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022042612456013">Copes &amp; Hochstetler, 2010</xref>), our goal here is not to generalize or make broad causal claims. Instead, we seek to identify social processes and patterns not always readily apparent in deductive research, and in particular to elucidate the accounts that women meth users draw from to explain their initiation into use. The use of rich qualitative interviews with female users who have been deeply involved in meth use and markets is especially appropriate for these goals, and provides strong evidence for the utility of understanding offenders’ “storylines.”</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>All but one of the women in our sample were White and they ranged in age from 20 to 58; the majority, however, were in their late 20s or early 30s (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0022042612456013">appendix</xref> for sample details). Few women had any college education; in fact, nearly half of the women did not complete high school. On average, women reported that they first used meth at age 19, but this obscures considerable variation in their age of initiation. Although nearly a third of the women reported that their first experience with meth came before the age of 16, five women had much later onset of use, ranging from 28 to 41 years. Most of the women had used other substances—usually marijuana—prior to their initiation with meth. However, six women used meth before any other drugs and two indicated that they began using a number of drugs, including meth, all within the same time period and could not recall which drug use occurred first.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022042612456013">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Women most often used meth for the first time with someone they knew in a private residence, as opposed to a more public venue such as a bar or nightclub. More than a third indicated that they initiated meth use with friends, both male and female. Another quarter initiated use with a boyfriend or spouse. Six women began their meth use with family members, usually cousins or aunts/uncles, but in one case, a woman first used with her parents. Two women first used meth alone and another used with her drug dealer. In two cases, it was unclear who was present during the women’s initiation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022042612456013">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>In keeping with the various contexts in which women initiated meth use, when women were asked their motivations for first using it, many initially suggested that they did so to “fit in” with those around them. Others recalled life circumstances, involving friends, family members, and boyfriends that they suggested contributed to their decision to use meth. Yet to suggest that the women in our sample began using out of peer pressure or due to the influence of their family members or romantic partners does not fully represent the richness of their initiation narratives. In most cases, women acknowledged their own motivations for initiating meth use and some even indicated that they <italic>sought out</italic> an opportunity to use for the first time. Throughout their initiation stories, though, we also see evidence of the impact of social and structural circumstances and constraints; 6 women grew up in families heavily involved in the meth market and 12 indicated that their parents had used other drugs during their childhood. Furthermore, the majority had experienced adverse events in childhood, including sexual victimization and other forms of family dysfunction (e.g., parental mental illness, domestic violence in the family of origin) and physical abuse.</p>
<p>Thus, as we further considered women’s narratives of their meth initiation, our analysis uncovered evidence of four themes or “storylines.” Although often women initially articulated their initiation experiences as quite spontaneous or opportunistic, occurring when another person offered them meth and they accepted to feel a part of the group, their narratives also provided a broader view of how they constructed their user identity in the beginning. In the following sections, we describe each of these storylines, which we call “A Family Affair,” “Numbing the Pain,” “Freedom Seekers,” and “In Pursuit.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0022042612456013">9</xref></sup> They are distinguished, in large part, by age at initiation, the people who facilitated use, and the life circumstances women describe in relation to their first meth use.</p>
<sec id="section9-0022042612456013">
<title>A Family Affair</title>
<p>“A family affair” describes the experiences of six women who grew up in an environment where meth use and manufacturing were prevalent. For them, meth was readily available and it seemed that it was only a matter of time before they, like the other members of their family, began to use. These women described families—and particularly parents—who were often heavily involved in the meth market as users, producers, and dealers. From an early age, they were exposed to meth use, had it accessible to them, and were enmeshed within its tight network. Their home environment facilitated easy access to the drug and also allowed women to learn the process of manufacturing meth and become involved in the market at a young age.</p>
<p>For these six women, meth use was normative as women saw parents, siblings, and in one case even grandparents using and sometimes manufacturing meth. Amy recalled, “It [meth] was acceptable in my house. My dad’s a dope cook [and] both my parents, they use. I grew up in that environment. It was always okay.” Similarly, Anna suggested that meth use was “like a family thing, like everybody in my family dealt drugs.” Shannon described being unable to get away from meth as her family and friends all used. She said, “I’ve lived with meth all of my life and my family’s part of it. And I dealt with it and the people I grew up with. I just couldn’t get away from it.” In fact, because their parents were themselves using, the women found that their parents did not try to stop them from using. On learning of her meth use, Anna recalled that her mother “didn’t really react too much about it. She couldn’t say anything. She was doing the same thing.”</p>
<p>The clandestine nature of the meth market meant that their families endorsed very strict rules on the extent to which outsiders could be allowed within the family sphere. Paige recalled that
<disp-quote>
<p>I was raised, you know, what goes on in this house, stays in this house. I’ve always lived by that. I would never go to school and say anything, to say anything about anything that happened outside of my house.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Yet, women indicated that as they grew older they realized that not everyone had parents who used drugs and that most of their schoolmates were not involved in the distribution of meth. Recognizing that their families were, in some ways, different, a few women also spoke of initiating use to spend time with family members who were active users. Paige said, “I wanted to be like my mom and sister.” She was jealous of the relationship between her mother and sister, who were using together. “My mom and sister was always going everywhere together and they always talked about things and I wasn’t allowed in the conversation . . . I think I just wanted to fit in with them.” Moreover, watching family members use made women curious as adolescents about meth’s effects. Wendy saw how happy her family seemed when they used and she made the decision to try it. She recalled, “I just wanted to try it, we seen everyone else doin’ it, so we thought it was okay.”</p>
<p>Because of their family’s involvement in the meth market, these women had ample opportunity to obtain the drug. Three of the women even stole the meth they used from their family members. Jessica took meth from her father’s drawer, not really knowing what it was. Her friend, however, did and showed her how to smoke it. In Paige’s case, her mother was cooking meth in their house. Having seen her mother smoke it before, at 13 years of age Paige decided to try it herself one day when she was alone:
<disp-quote>
<p>It got to a point where my mom would have 30 [or] 40 8-balls sitting out on the kitchen counter. And she was so spun out of her mind, been up for two, three weeks, it was like nothing for me to go grab one and she didn’t notice. The first time I tried it, I was alone. I’d seen it smoked a whole bunch of times so I knew how to do it. And I just got really super high. I was young and I took crayons and . . . I was decorating the lighter with the wax of the crayons. And I was ahh [sighs]. And my mom and my sister, they knew.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When her mother and sister saw her, they immediately realized what she had been doing. Yet, rather than be disappointed because her daughter had begun using meth, Paige recalled that her mother “was mad because I stole her dope.”</p>
<p>Although family drug use provided women with motivation and opportunity for use, it also came at a price. Most of these women described childhood experiences of abuse and neglect and in a few cases, removal from the home or placement in foster care when their parents were imprisoned on meth-related charges. In addition, they described caring for siblings—even parents—and taking on adult responsibilities, often leaving home, at early ages. A family heavily involved in the meth market gave these women the opportunity to experiment with, use, and eventually sell and manufacture the drug, but also put them into precarious situations that negatively affected their lives.</p>
<p>One dramatic example of the negative effects of a family affair is Amy’s story of initiation. In describing her experiences, Amy told us that she was “raised in that environment, so my parents use, my grandparents use.” By the age of 14, she was assisting her parents by selling the meth they made. When first asked about her meth initiation, Amy simply stated, “One night, some of my parents’ friends came over and I did a shot of dope. And that was the beginning.” Despite her ready access to meth, until that particular night, she had never used any drugs. How, then, did she explain her initiation? Later on in the interview, Amy provided an additional detail: While delivering a package of drugs for her parents, she was violently gang-raped by a group of customers. She continued, “And right after that is when I started using.” Although stressing that she herself asked for an injection of meth from her parents, she also acknowledged that the sexual assault provided a catalyst for her initiation into meth use at that specific time. Her family’s involvement in the meth market and her subsequent victimization highlight the complex, and often overlapping, storylines that underpin women’s initiation into meth use.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0022042612456013">
<title>Numbing the Pain</title>
<p>As in Amy’s case, victimization is often highlighted as a pathway to criminal offending and drug use among women. In our sample, 13 women reported sexual victimization experiences in childhood and adolescence. Of these, 2 women indicated that their initiation into meth was <italic>exclusively</italic> the result of these experiences, and another 2 made explicit links between sexual victimization and meth initiation. The storylines of these 4 women centered on using meth to numb their pain. These women initiated meth use at somewhat earlier ages compared with the other women we interviewed. Barbara, for example, began using meth at age 12 when she became involved with an older boyfriend who used. When describing her first use, she explained, “My childhood was not very good.” She then went on to disclose that her uncle, who lived with her family, molested her from age 6 to 12. When she revealed the abuse to her boyfriend, he suggested that meth would enable her to cope with the “things that were going on” with her. She stated, “I wanted to hide the pain. I wanted something to cope with the things that were going on with me when I was a kid. A way to hide my feelings, to numb myself.” Kelly also used meth for the first time in her teenage years, though she was already drinking alcohol and using marijuana and prescription drugs by that time. Her stepfather sexually abused her in adolescence and when her mother found out, she “blamed me for it and moved out and in with him.” The trauma over this experience, at the age of 13, was overwhelming. She recalled that her initiation with meth came as she “was just trying to cover up the pain, trying to make it all go away.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0022042612456013">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Geri too described her initiation into meth use as related to a sexual assault, yet in her case, her first use was not by choice. Instead, she was forced to use meth the first time. At age 11, her father’s best friend raped her and in the process, injected her with meth. A few months later, the same man attacked her and, again, injected her with meth. Geri said, “It took all the pain away. And I didn’t even care anymore. It just took all my worries away and made me feel good.” Later, she described her attempts to cope with these experiences: “You know [the meth] made me feel good so I was like okay with it. Really, I wasn’t okay with it but I was.” Although these first experiences were forced, a few years later, at the age of 14, Geri began to use meth on her own. In describing her voluntary use, Geri attributed it to the earlier trauma she had experienced. She said she used “because the truth all came out about it and the guy got arrested and I continued to use it ‘cause it made me feel good. Took away all the pain of the situation.” Meth took some of the residual pain away and let her proceed with her life, allowing her to manage school and family activities.</p>
<p>Given the large number of women in prison who report a history of sexual abuse (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022042612456013">Wolf Harlow, 1999</xref>), it is not surprising that many of the women we interviewed disclosed a history of abuse, both physical and sexual. But in most cases, women revealed these experiences much later in the interview, often in response to questions about their childhood, suggesting how the long-term consequences of their abuse experiences included their eventual drug use. However, women did not necessarily attribute their meth initiation to these experiences. For example, after describing her first use of meth with a friend at age 17, Lisa later revealed to us a childhood replete with abuse and alcoholism. In addition to the physical and verbal abuse from her father, her mother was an alcoholic, and as a teenager, she was molested by her sister’s boyfriend. Despite a string of such experiences, when asked whether she believed that they contributed to her meth use, Lisa insisted that her initiation was ultimately her choice. She said, “I used to blame it on her [mother], leaving me in an abusive situation with my dad, and so on and so forth, but no, nobody had control of that but me.” Although the victimization experiences undoubtedly affected her life, Lisa’s storyline of her meth initiation did not include them as the <italic>direct</italic> cause of her using meth at 17 years of age. Rather, she tied her meth initiation to a larger pattern of rebellion during her teenage years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0022042612456013">
<title>Freedom Seekers</title>
<p>Like Lisa’s narrative suggests, a third storyline of initiation to emerge was that of a young woman seeking freedom from her life circumstances and using meth as a means to that end. This storyline was articulated by 20 women in our sample and is distinguished by their longing to escape, at least for a time, from the burdens of their daily lives and responsibilities. The constraints from which they sought relief varied. The majority of these women framed their meth initiation as part of their desire for freedom from parental control during their teenage years, but a sizable number indicated that they initially used meth in an effort to escape or cope with their adult responsibilities. Although these may appear to be incongruent desires, teenage rebellion and escape from the responsibilities of adulthood were frequently linked. One consequence of rebellion—and young women’s involvement in risky or delinquent activities—was precocious movement into adult roles, particularly motherhood. Meth, women found, provided instant relief from boredom and provided them a “little bit of freedom” from their overprotective parents or from the daily monotony of caring for their own children and households.</p>
<p>For many of the women whose storyline included their search for freedom, meth initiation was part of an overall rebellious period during their adolescence that frequently included other drug use. Some women indicated that meth initiation was their way to get back at parents who they felt were too controlling. Lisa, introduced above, described constant fighting with her mother during her teenage years: “I was just rebelling all the time, you know, I was having sex, I was just rebelling all the time against my parents.” In Margaret’s case, it was her alcoholic father with whom she fought. After her mother had left the family a few years earlier, she and her siblings were living with their father, who she described as routinely absent, leaving her and her siblings to “take care of” themselves. When he grounded her from all social events during her eighth grade year, Margaret came up with a strategy to circumvent her father’s control.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I’d get my dad drunk during the day and [he would] pass out and [I would] sneak out at night. And, you know, sneaking out at night and being in that crowd, I was kind of thrust into it, meth and dope, running away.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In contrast, Georgia described her childhood as “great” and “excellent.” She continued, “My mother was a Sunday school teacher, my father always worked. I have two brothers and one younger sister and I’m the oldest and my family was always real organized, real functional, nobody used.” Her initiation into meth use came as she “kind of just branched out on my own” along with her boyfriend.</p>
<p>Rainbow provided one of the most cogent narratives of how her desire for freedom from her parents eventually cumulated in her meth use. Her trouble, she noted, dated back to when she was 6 years old. She refused to go to school because she had “separation anxiety” from her mother. She threw such violent fits that she was eventually sent to a hospital. As she entered her teenage years, she became more resentful of her parents and began running away and using marijuana and LSD. Her parents, in an effort to help her, sent her to a group home and drug treatment. When she was 14, she met a girl at the drug program and moved in with her. On their own at a very early age, she and her friend began using lots of drugs and eventually were introduced to an older man who provided them with their first taste of Preludin<sup>®</sup>—“the pure meth”—which turned out to be an “answer to my prayers.” Rainbow recalled how drugs, and meth, in particular, fulfilled this desire for independence from her parents:
<disp-quote>
<p>There used to be a commercial I remember [that] said “nobody ever says, when I grow up I want to be a junkie.” But I did, pretty much. The first time I got high, smoked weed, it was on. I went from weed to acid to, I wanted to get as high as quick as fast as possible. ‘Cause I was just such an angry, resentful, hurt child . . . Even when I found drugs, it was easy crap to fit into and I felt comfortable with it and plus I got my cheap thrills. So I just, balls to the wall, I just wanted to get high.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Kennedy too traced her meth initiation to rebellion from “overprotective” parents as well as her own curiosity. As a teenager, she did well in school, was involved in sports, and was a cheerleader. But she still felt that her mother was “just really controlling. She was too overprotective.” She had her first child by age 17 and moved out of her parents’ house. Living on her own for the first time, she began to “do everything I never really got to do.” When she became involved with a new boyfriend who was using meth, she made the decision to use as well. However, even though Kennedy described her initiation to meth as tied to an overall pattern of rebellion from her parents, the fact that she was a single mother and living on her own as a teenager also likely contributed to her desire to “know what [meth] was like.” Although moving away from home at a young age meant that women could (temporarily) gain freedom, independent living often came at a great price, particularly when women became young mothers and assumed responsibility, not only for themselves but also their young children. Frustration over such responsibilities and a desire for “freedom” after years of fulfilling them to the best of their abilities, then, became important factors in women’s initiation of meth.</p>
<p>This desire for freedom from adult burdens was explicitly articulated as a primary storyline by seven women. Although most of them were beyond their teenage years when they began using meth, these women nevertheless attributed their initiation to running “wild” after experiencing a divorce or separation or wanting a reprieve from their adult responsibilities, including their children. All these women described having children at a very young age and shouldering all the responsibilities for child care after their partner left. Alicia was 22 years old and a single mother of two children, one a newborn, when she first began using meth. Similarly, Sheila noted that she initiated meth at a time when she and her boyfriend had broken up, leaving her to raise their newborn son on her own at the age of 17. No longer living at home or with her boyfriend, she recalled that she was “just irritated at life” and that she “wanted to do <italic>something</italic>.” Likewise, having left her husband, at the age of 21, Mariah was overwhelmed by the responsibilities of caring for her own children as well as taking care of her younger siblings. When her younger sister offered her some meth, though she had never before used drugs, she agreed. She recalled her decision: “I thought I had been tied down for a long time with all these kids and my husband. And so I wanted a little bit of freedom.” Finally, Lauren also had two children by the time she was 20 years old. Her meth initiation came when she “was run down . . . and um, people told me it would help me wake up and keep me going, so I wanted to try it.” The energy that meth provided was an important benefit of use, particularly for single parents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0022042612456013">
<title>In Pursuit</title>
<p>Although Lauren recognized the benefits of using meth after her initiation, 10 additional women described initiating meth use <italic>specifically</italic> because of the benefits—physical or relational—it offered or appeared to offer. For example, Christina initially used meth after noticing that it helped her husband complete his chores. She recalled, “He would be running around, cleaning the yard, rake up the leaves, throw them in the trash, washing the car. Everything was getting done.” Desiring the same energy, she asked him to give her some. Although arguably this motivation for seeking out meth (compared with, for example, heroin) reflects traditional gendered roles—it allowed her to cook, clean, and take care of their household, and gave her abundant energy to care for her children—Christina, like the other women, was careful to articulate that the decision was her own.</p>
<p>At the same time, Christina’s prior experience with other drugs, including LSD, likely played a role in her decision making. In fact, all the women with storylines related to pursuing benefits had used a number of different drugs prior to their initiation with meth. These previous experiences with other drugs gave women a reference point as they decided whether to use meth for the first time. For example, when first offered meth at 41 years, Donna asked what it would do to her. When told it “amps you up,” she accepted. She recalled, “I’m like, all right, that’s it, because I don’t like marijuana because it makes you sleep and eat all the time and I don’t need to be getting no fatter because I used to weigh 300 pounds.” Similarly, Heather extolled the benefits of meth—and particularly its weight loss benefits—versus marijuana: “With pot it just made me tired and hungry . . . and obviously I have a problem with my weight and I don’t like to be hungry and devouring everything in my house.”</p>
<p>The benefits of meth also included increased energy and the rush of getting high. Dorothy initiated her meth use while in graduate school and after she already had experience with a number of other drugs. When a friend offered her meth, she quickly realized it would give her the energy to study. Dorothy tried to explain her rationale: “It wasn’t like I was trying to get high. I was really just trying to get my schedule, keep my 4.0 and keep my grades up.” In contrast, at 35 years, Rose was drawn to meth because of its similarity to speed which she liked because she had “a depression problem anyway and speed helps me quite a bit, get up out of that.” In her case, meth became a way of dealing with her depression and giving her energy. She continued, “I feel like I’m sleeping my life away sometimes and meth kept me, made me awake, made me want to stay awake and be awake and do things and be more active.”</p>
<p>Although the benefits meth offered were primarily related to its pharmacological effects—including increased energy, more focus, and weight loss—in four cases, women desired to maintain or start relationships with romantic partners who were enmeshed in the meth market. Meth networks, according to the women in our sample, endorsed very strict rules on the extent to which outsiders could be allowed to participate in activities or even to hang around with those who used. These four women sought out an opportunity to initiate use, hiding their inexperience to ultimately gain access to and acceptance from friends and loved ones who were using meth. Tracy, for example, recalled that her boyfriend kept leaving her alone with their twin babies to go and use with his friends. Frustrated, she explained,
<disp-quote>
<p>So I kept wondering why he had to leave. Why I couldn’t go. Why we couldn’t take the babies and he said because the people he went to wouldn’t allow us in there because I didn’t do the things they did. And I said, “Well, if it takes you being here with me, I’ll do whatever.” And he’s like, “No, ‘cause then they would think you’re suspicious and this and that.” And I said, “What do I got to do?” And he said, “Meth.” And I was like “What?” So in order to get him to stay with me, you know, get some help with the babies, I said okay, I’ll try it. So he shot me up in my foot.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Tracy was not aware of the potential benefits of meth. In fact, she did not even know what it was. Her decision to initiate was driven by her desire to spend time with her boyfriend and to gain his assistance with household responsibilities. Similarly, Kathy said she initiated meth use “to be a part of the crowd and get back in, mainly, you know, when I look back on it, to get back with the guys that I used to date . . . you know romantically or as in a relationship.” After her divorce, she believed that hanging around with a new group of friends would both keep her husband away and possibly lead to a new or rekindled romantic relationship. But her friends “were acting really weird and looking at me really crazy and I had no idea what was going on.” Eventually, one friend explained their fear that she would “snitch” on them and acknowledged that “you get paranoid when do [meth].” After considering her options for a few months, Kathy went to him and said, “I want to do some of that.” She continued, “So he got a quarter gram, and we went out in the country and snorted it.” Although she quickly realized that meth gave her energy, ultimately Kathy described her initiation in utilitarian terms: “If I could do the things they were doing, I could stay there longer.”</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The first time use of any drug may set the stage for subsequent use. Positive or pleasurable experiences may provide motivation or rationale for continued experimentation and eventually to regular use. Moreover, neutral (neither positive nor negative) experiences may lead to further experimentation, at least in an attempt to experience any effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022042612456013">Becker, 1963</xref>). At the same time, there is also the greatest opportunity for early intervention following first use of a drug. Unpleasant initial experiences, for example, may reduce the risk of future use.</p>
<p>Yet, despite their importance, drug initiation experiences often receive limited qualitative attention in the literature. Our interviews with 40 women who used meth provide some insight into how they construct their storyline of initiation. We asked what situational contexts and motivations women highlight as particularly relevant to their decisions to initiate use. We also questioned whether women articulate their meth initiation in ways consistent with traditional depictions of female drug use, or whether they construct narratives that highlight other motivations and contexts. Most of the women we interviewed recalled with vivid detail who they were with, where they were, and their initial reaction to the drug. Their initiations tended to occur in private settings among family and friends. They also drew on four “storylines” to articulate their meth initiation. Although these storylines do include those traditional elements found in other accounts of women’s drug use such as victimization and romantic partners, we also find that some women exercise a great deal of agency in making the decision to initiate meth use. In these cases, their decisions are often based on their desire for freedom and pleasure.</p>
<p>Our findings also suggest that women’s family members provided motivation and opportunity for their own first meth use. The intergenerational transmission of drug use has recently received attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022042612456013">Giordano, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022042612456013">Thornberry, Krohn, &amp; Freeman-Gallant, 2006</xref>). This body of work suggests that parental drug use has important implications for children, especially girls, as it heightens exposure to others embedded within drug (and crime) networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022042612456013">Lopez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022042612456013">Swetlow, 2003</xref>), increases risks for maltreatment and victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022042612456013">Cohen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022042612456013">Haight et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022042612456013">Swetlow, 2003</xref>), and pushes young women into early caretaking roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022042612456013">Carbone-Lopez &amp; Miller, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022042612456013">Haight, Carter-Black, &amp; Sheridan, 2009</xref>). The unique home- and friendship-based settings of meth production and consumption also appear to have great import for children’s eventual use, as suggested by the women we interviewed.</p>
<p>Families were also important in other ways such that some of the women were rebelling against parental constraints or seeking relief from the adult responsibilities they shouldered at an early age. In these cases, initiation often took place among friends or with male partners and in the context of partying. The women described a desire to grow up quickly and enjoy the benefits and privileges of adulthood, including sexual relationships, parenthood, employment, and independent living. Drug use—and the use of meth specifically—appeared to provide an opportunity to do so. More importantly, after the benefits and privileges (and responsibilities) of adulthood were realized, meth also offered women a way in which to cope with their precocious movement into such roles. In some cases, they actively sought out the drug, concealing their naiveté to others to use.</p>
<p>At the same time, women’s meth initiation storylines tie directly and indirectly to their victimization experiences. A small number of women indicated that they began using meth to cope with sexual assault experiences that they had experienced in childhood and adolescence. Despite the fact that victimization experiences were common (indeed, nearly all the women recounted at least one violent victimization experience throughout their lifetime), surprisingly few of the women in our sample attributed their drug use <italic>directly</italic> to an attempt to cope with their victimization. Of course, there is substantial evidence of the long-term implications of victimization for drug initiation, especially for females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022042612456013">Dube et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022042612456013">B. A. Miller &amp; Mancuso, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022042612456013">Simpson &amp; Miller, 2002</xref>), but it is striking that women largely did not draw on these experiences when telling the story of their drug use initiation. In fact, women often insisted that their meth initiation was <italic>their choice</italic>. One potential explanation for this insistence on highlighting their own agency in drug initiation is the fact that all the women were in treatment (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022042612456013">Anderson, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022042612456013">2008</xref>). Although they described initiation as their own choice, this decision making at the time of initiation must be considered within their broader life experiences. Nonetheless, women’s agentic storylines may offer an important thread when considering intervention strategies.</p>
<p>There are a number of limitations that bear mentioning. Our study relies on retrospective data with a nonrepresentative sample of incarcerated women meth users which is racially and geographically homogeneous. As such, it may be that our research has uncovered initiation storylines that are unique to meth or to nonurban White women. All the women in our sample were extensive poly-drug users and most had relatively lengthy drug careers. The fact that the women were more extensive drug users in treatment for their drug use may also influence the initiation patterns we uncover. Indeed, the initiation storylines of those who subsequently become more chronic or extensive drug users may differ from those who use once or only sporadically. Treatment programs based on the 12-step approach (such as the program the women in our sample attended) typically look for individuals to take responsibility for their drug use. Because of this, the women in our sample may have modified their storylines of meth initiation, placing more emphasis on their own decisions to use rather than on the people around them or other life circumstances; this ultimately may have resulted in more agentic storylines. Finally, our focus here is only on initiation of meth use but it is clear that motivations for, and experiences of, use evolve over time. As women described their <italic>continued</italic> use, they typically became aware of the specific benefits of use including weight loss and enhanced energy, and thus came to rely on it. They also experienced the deep harms that emerged from extensive use. Thus, an important question remains for future research: How do women’s storylines for meth use change over the course of their using careers?</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, we suggest that our work expands the existing literature and theory on women and drug use in two important ways. First, ours is a qualitative examination of <italic>initiation</italic> into meth use. Our data allow us to examine the ways in which women articulate their lives and the situations, environments, and social contexts that bring them to the very point at which they first decide to use. In addition, women provided detailed contextual accounts of their initiation experiences. Second, we uncover themes or storylines of initiation experiences beyond the traditional focus for women on victimization and romantic relationships. Although both of these factors are important in women’s meth initiation, they also note the importance of friends’ and family members’ involvement in the meth market in their own use, as well as their own desires for particular outcomes.</p>
<p>In addition, we suggest that our findings have important implications for the prevention and treatment of meth use, particularly among women. Women in our sample tended to initiate (and continue) meth use in small, intimate settings rather than in open areas or “drug locales” as is often seen with other drugs. This is consistent with characteristics of the meth market more generally: Deals are made within small, tight networks rather than between strangers, and the transactions and use typically take place in private homes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022042612456013">Rodriguez, Katz, Webb, &amp; Schaefer, 2005</xref>). These are places that are difficult to monitor, but they are clearly important factors to address in any prevention plans. Similarly, although it remains important to examine the role of drug-using males in understanding women’s drug initiation and use, it is also apparent that women’s other relationships and experiences should be attended to in prevention and treatment initiatives. Perhaps efforts can be modeled after relapse prevention strategies that focus on the “people, places, and things” that trigger drug use. A woman who uses drugs has very complex relationships with others in her social network. Some of these individuals may provide constructive social support and help her to abstain from drugs, whereas others enable her to continue use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022042612456013">Falkin &amp; Strauss, 2003</xref>). Counseling for women must include helping them to negotiate <italic>all</italic> their relationships and understand who in their social networks is likely to be supportive in constructive ways, helping them to resist use or continued use, and who is likely to be detrimental to their efforts to resist drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022042612456013">Falkin &amp; Strauss, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, a minority of the women in our sample came from families of origin that were heavily involved in the meth market. These women also frequently indicated that their parents had been arrested or incarcerated prior to their own initiation. Early intervention practices may be particularly important in such cases to reduce the intergenerational transmission of use. In cases where children are removed from their home due to suspected (or confirmed) meth use, education efforts can be used to teach children alternatives to drug use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022042612456013">Haight et al., 2005</xref>). This may be critically important in the meth market, which appears to be organized around existing family and peer networks, and which may recruit children as users, cooks, and dealers at very young ages.</p>

<p>For example, since 2001 Missouri has had the highest annual number of clandestine meth laboratory incidents in the United States, though they have decreased in recent years, from 2,885 at its peak in 2003 to 1,189 in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022042612456013">Drug Enforcement Administration [DEA], 2008</xref>).</p></fn>

<p>This was part of a larger project to examine women’s meth use over time, including initiation experiences, periods of escalation and reduced use and desistance, as well as their involvement in the meth market as producers, sellers, and users.</p></fn>

<p>The team included the authors and two additional female graduate students. The first and third authors have extensive experience interviewing men and women, including in carceral settings, about drug use and victimization histories. The project received a full review from the Institutional Review Board at the University of Missouri, St. Louis, with special consideration of vulnerable populations. In addition, the project underwent review by the Missouri Department of Corrections. Each of the students received extensive training on qualitative interviewing and the ethics of human subjects research prior to data collection. In particular, interviewers were trained to watch for signs of distress and either change the line of questions or end the interview. Prior to the interview, interviewers gave women a copy of the informed consent document, reviewed the study procedures and risks of participation with the respondent, and described the measures that would be taken to keep the information confidential.</p></fn>

<p>Because of the large number of women who volunteered and fit our eligibility criteria, we devised a strategy to randomly select 40 participants. Women were invited to participate based on their release dates. Selecting women who were near to their release date meant that they had completed a larger portion of the treatment and they were typically working to restore their relationships with family and friends prior to release. Their consideration of these relationships and their imminent release actually proved useful for the larger project.</p></fn>

<p>We did not provide referrals to the women, on completion of the interview, for two reasons. First, the women were from all over Missouri and even out of state. Second, Women’s Eastern Reception Diagnostic and Correctional Center (WERDCC) itself is fairly innovative at constructing home plans for women leaving the prison and the treatment program also helped women find counseling or other ways to continue treatment after their release.</p></fn>

<p>Once independent initial coding was complete, we met to discuss our preliminary analyses, and found that there was uniformity in our identification of the four major storylines present in the data. We then each returned to the data independently, and explicitly placed each woman in what we identified as her primary storyline and, where appropriate, her secondary storyline. We then met again to compare our classifications. Here, we found there was agreement on all but a few cases. We discussed these cases in detail, returning to a close read of the narrative as a group, and carefully assessed our bases for classification to reach a consensus.</p></fn>

<p>The women in our sample primarily used anhydrous or “black and red” meth, as opposed to crystal meth or “ice” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022042612456013">Jenkot, 2008</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022042612456013">Sexton, Carlson, Leukefeld, &amp; Booth, 2006</xref> for additional details on the ingredients used in their production). These two types of meth are much more easily manufactured in small, independent “laboratories” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022042612456013">Sexton et al., 2006</xref>) and were more readily available in the rural areas in which most of the women lived.</p></fn>

<p>Geri’s first use of meth came when she was forcibly injected during a sexual assault. As this experience was forced, we opted not to include it as her initiation.

<p>In 12 cases, women’s meth initiation actually involved two or more of these themes. The tabulations we present here include only women for whom a particular theme was primary (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0022042612456013">appendix</xref> for more information).</p></fn>

<p>In addition to the significance of “numbing the pain” in these women’s storylines, their pathways to meth initiation also involved other factors, as Barbara’s and Kelly’s narratives reveal. Nonetheless, our focus here is on women’s own storylines; it is here that victimization was especially prominent.</p></fn>
