<abstract>
<p>This article evaluates the effect of the Health Insurance Flexibility and Accountability (HIFA) demonstrations on uninsurance rates among children. HIFA could increase the probability that children would have health insurance either by directly enrolling a child into a HIFA program or by creating a “spillover” effect from adults onto children by making parents of children already eligible for public programs eligible for HIFA. Data were drawn from the Current Population Survey from 2000 to 2007. The estimation approach was a probit model using a difference-in-differences approach. The authors find that the HIFA wavier demonstrations had no measureable effect on the uninsurance rate among children, either through direct eligibility or through a “spillover” effect from parental eligibility. This suggests that public programs that integrate family insurance coverage into a single structure are likely to be more effective at reducing the rate of uninsurance than different programs for different members of the same family.</p>

<body>
<p>The Health Insurance Flexibility and Accountability Act (HIFA) was designed to encourage new comprehensive state approaches to increase the number of insured individuals through Medicaid, State Children’s Health Insurance Program (S/CHIP), and new public–private partnerships. Begun on August 4, 2001, HIFA was based on the premise that, in return for policy flexibility and federal matching funds under Medicaid and S/CHIP, states would be able to invest their own funds in creating partnerships with private industry to reduce the problem of the uninsured. HIFA, which targeted individuals with incomes below 200% of the federal poverty level (FPL), not only allowed expansions in eligibility under existing public programs but also encouraged premium assistance demonstrations and development of new health plan products. Although most of the HIFA demonstrations targeted adults, Oregon and Illinois included children in their target populations, and children in other states might have benefited from a spillover effect of their parents gaining insurance coverage. The purpose of this article is to examine the effect of HIFA waiver demonstrations on uninsurance rates among children.</p>
<p>Under HIFA waivers, states were allowed to make changes in benefit packages, eligibility rules for public insurance programs—including increases in the upper limit on income for eligibility—and creating public–private health insurance partnerships. Under the public–private partnerships, states were allowed to subsidize private health insurance premiums for either S/CHIP or Medicaid enrollees (the latter under the Medicaid Health Insurance Premium Payment program). Subsidies for private health insurance premiums were intended to leverage private funds to help cover the uninsured and overcome the “welfare stigma” associated with public insurance programs for low income recipients. Flexibility was provided for premium assistance options, in terms of benefits and cost sharing (for optional and expansion groups). Premium assistance programs using Medicaid funds under Section 1115 waivers did not have to meet the cost effectiveness test ordinarily required for Medicaid waivers—states needed only to “monitor” cost effectiveness. States also were allowed to use federal funds to develop and subsidize privately offered health insurance products that groups or individuals could purchase with a public subsidy. The net effect of all these provisions was to attempt to give states ways to expand coverage—including but not limited to coverage under Medicaid and S/CHIP—by simplifying regulatory constraints and encouraging partnerships with private coverage, rather than by simply raising eligibility levels (as had been done for more than 15 years with Medicaid and later S/CHIP for pregnant women and children). This was a major domestic initiative of the Bush Administration, reflecting that administration’s argument that states, freed of federal constraints, could fashion more creative solutions to expand insurance coverage, that is, that federal constraints were a part of the problem of covering uninsured populations.</p>
<p>The HIFA demonstration proved to be controversial on both ends of the political spectrum. The controversy stemmed both from the expansion of eligibility for public programs to previously ineligible groups—such as childless adults—which provoked opposition on the right, and from its use of public–private partnerships, which provoked opposition on the left. The states’ use of HIFA as a mechanism to extend coverage to childless adults was a source of particular controversy during the S/CHIP reauthorization in 2007. In the end, 15 states received HIFA waivers between December 2001 and December 2006 as shown in 1. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077558712436693">Table 1</xref> also describes the effective date and primary characteristics of each waiver. The demonstrations continued from their implementation through the period covered by our data set (2007), and many still are in effect.</p>

<title>HIFA Waivers and Children</title>
<p>Most HIFA demonstrations focused on adults, although Oregon and Illinois also included children in their eligible populations. There are two different possible mechanisms by which HIFA could increase the probability that children would have health insurance: first, by enrolling them directly into a HIFA demonstration (as in Illinois and Oregon), and second, by creating a “spillover” effect from adults onto children. If making parents eligible for HIFA makes the parent more likely to enroll the child in another public program <italic>for which the child is already eligible</italic>, then we will observe a positive spillover effect of parent eligibility on the probability children are insured.</p>
<p>There is some support in the published literature for this “spillover” mechanism. Although there is a relative consensus that Medicaid and S/CHIP expansions do increase enrollment in the programs among children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077558712436693">Selden, Hudson, &amp; Banthin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077558712436693">Duderstadt, Hughes, Soobader, &amp; Newacheck, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077558712436693">Cunningham, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077558712436693">Morreale &amp; English, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077558712436693">Racine, Kaestner, Joyce, &amp; Colman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077558712436693">Newacheck, Hughes, &amp; Cisternas, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077558712436693">Card &amp; Shore-Sheppard, 2002</xref>), the disparity between eligibility for parents and children may be a key factor that has limited the effectiveness of Medicaid expansions. Previous studies have found that children are more likely to have coverage if their parents are insured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077558712436693">Williams, 2003</xref>). More precisely, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077558712436693">Dubay and Kenney (2004b)</xref> find that 7.4 million of the 10.6 million uninsured parents could be covered if eligibility levels for parents were raised to the eligibility levels that the states have set for children. But, traditionally in Medicaid and S/CHIP programs, children are more likely to be eligible than their parents.</p>
<p>In states that have expanded coverage to parents, 81% of eligible children participate in Medicaid, compared with only 57% in states that did not expand coverage to parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077558712436693">Dubay &amp; Kenney, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077558712436693">Dubay &amp; Kenney, 2003</xref>). This result was based on an analysis of poverty-related expansions in Medicaid eligibility, comparing participation rates for children in states that expanded Medicaid coverage to parents with states that did not plus a difference-in-differences model using an expansion in Massachusetts. They found that children who reside in states that expanded public coverage to parents participated in Medicaid at a 20% higher rate than those living in states with no expansions. Also, they show that the Massachusetts expansion in coverage to parents led to a 14% increase in Medicaid coverage among children, primarily because of reductions in uninsurance among already eligible children.</p>
<p>This result is consistent with other studies that have found that around 90% of low income children who have insured parents are themselves insured, whereas only 48% of children with an uninsured parent have health insurance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077558712436693">Lambrew, 2001</xref>). In interviews, state officials from four states concluded that enrolling parents has led to substantial gains in child enrollment in both Medicaid and S/CHIP, with child enrollment growing more rapidly than it did during previous child-only Medicaid expansions (Howell, Almeida, Dubay, &amp; Kenney, 2002). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077558712436693">Glied and Gould (2005)</xref> find that expanding Medicaid to parents of S/CHIP eligible parents would provide coverage for 5.2% of the uninsured although the impact would vary significantly across states.</p>
<p>There is also some evidence that programs in states using the flexibility of waiver programs, of which HIFA is one, are more effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077558712436693">Gilmer, Kronick, &amp; Rice, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077558712436693">Ku &amp; Broaddus, 2000</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-1077558712436693">
<title>New Contribution</title>
<p>Our specific research questions are (a) whether making children eligible for the HIFA program, a narrow, limited waiver program with substantial public–private components, reduces the rate of uninsurance among children in the target population and (b) whether making adults with children eligible for public programs eligible for HIFA, reduces the rate of uninsurance among children.</p>
<p>This is the first article to examine the effect of the HIFA waiver program on the rate of uninsurance coverage among children. Although there have been several other articles examining different types of Medicaid expansions and 1115 waiver programs, the unique characteristics of the HIFA program make it particularly applicable to health reform, including the use of premium subsidies and exchanges featuring private plans. Thus, the results of the HIFA program can provide guidance regarding what types of plan designs are likely to be successful and unsuccessful.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1077558712436693">
<title>Conceptual Framework</title>
<p>Our conceptual model assumes that the key factors associated with whether a child is covered by health insurance are insurance availability and demand for insurance. Insurance availability will be determined by family characteristics (income, on public assistance, household size), economic market factors (unemployment rate, firm size, region), and the generosity of public programs (Medicaid S/CHIP eligibility) including the availability of HIFA plans. Demand for insurance will be determined by family income, age, and health status. We also include measures of family stability to measure the family’s attachment to the area and likely knowledge of health insurance options. Knowledge of health insurance options might be enhanced by the adults’ eligibility for subsidized insurance under HIFA.</p>
<p>We have two specific hypotheses. First, we hypothesize that making a child eligible for HIFA will increase the probability that the child is insured. Second, that making an adult in the child’s household eligible for HIFA will increase the probability that the child will be insured.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1077558712436693" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method and Data</title>
<p>Because each state that implemented a HIFA demonstration adopted a different design for its HIFA waiver, there is no single “intervention” to be evaluated, and the “intervention” can be conceived or interpreted several different ways. In states with a HIFA demonstration, we define the target population by the precise income limits used in that state. However, the income limits for the HIFA-eligible target population varies from one HIFA state to another. Thus, in states without a HIFA demonstration (non-HIFA states), we defined the target population as individuals with incomes below 200% of the FPL but ineligible for Medicaid. This matches the top end of the income eligibility for HIFA.</p>
<p>Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services formally identifies the HIFA waivers that authorize each state’s HIFA interventions. All the HIFA waivers are identified in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077558712436693">Table 1</xref>, with information on their effective dates and their primary characteristics. The enrollment data reflect demonstration experience as of May 31, 2007.</p>
<p>We did not analyze all 15 state demonstrations. Nine of the HIFA waivers are not part of our analysis:</p>
<list id="list1-1077558712436693" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>California never implemented its waiver because of budget shortfalls.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>New Jersey used HIFA as a temporary measure to clear a state-program waiting list rather than as an eligibility expansion.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Two demonstrations (Colorado and Oklahoma) used their HIFA waivers to target coverage toward specialized populations (pregnant mothers or disabled persons), which cannot be evaluated using publicly available national data (see below).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Five state demonstrations enrolled less than 1,000 individuals (Arkansas, Idaho, Nevada, Utah, and Virginia). The target population cell sizes in the national datasets used in our study gave us inadequate statistical power to detect demonstration effects in these five states.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>This left six states (Arizona, Illinois, Michigan, Maine, New Mexico, and Oregon) that both received HIFA waivers and enrolled enough individuals to allow us to detect a HIFA effect in our national datasets, if there was such an effect. These states were the focus of our analysis. We examine changes in the rate of insurance in the target populations in the periods before and after implementation of the HIFA demonstrations. The “treated” groups are the target populations in HIFA states in the postimplementation periods in those states. Our control groups comprised (a) individuals living in HIFA states in preimplementation years and (b) individuals living in non-HIFA states who would have been eligible for HIFA if their state had implemented such a demonstration with eligibility defined as 200% of FPL. We tested the sensitivity of our results to different specifications of the control groups.</p>
<p>The unit of analysis is the child, and the dependent variable equals one if the child had health insurance and zero, otherwise. The sample includes children who are eligible for both Medicaid and S/CHIP. As noted earlier, making a parent eligible for HIFA may not only lead them to enroll their child in a HIFA demonstration, but may lead the parent to enroll the child in either an S/CHIP or Medicaid program for which the child was already eligible, for example, a “spillover” effect.</p>
<p>Our primary data source is the Current Population Survey (CPS) from 2000-2007. The CPS is a national survey performed by the Census Bureau. It is designed to establish national trends in variables of interest, such as unemployment and health insurance coverage rates. We identified the target populations by income, age, family status, and years of eligibility, in relation to program eligibility criteria in each state. We separately identified years of initial implementation (i.e., partial years) and years when the HIFA demonstration was fully implemented. We also obtained state-level data from the Kaiser Family Foundation listing state-by-state eligibility for the Medicaid and S/CHIP programs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077558712436693">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>To estimate the effect of HIFA, we used a “difference-in-differences” model. This model estimates the difference in the pre- and postimplementation probability of insurance in the treatment group versus the control group. The difference-in-differences model takes the general form:</p>

<list-item><p>HIFA Child = 1 if the child is (or would be) eligible for HIFA in the child’s state of residence, regardless of whether or not the HIFA program actually is in operation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>HIFA Parent = 1 if the child’s parent(s) child are (or would be) eligible for HIFA in their state of residence, regardless of whether or not the HIFA program actually is in operation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>HIFA Demonstration Operational = 1 if the HIFA demonstration was operational in that state in that year.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The HIFA treatment effect is measured by the coefficient on the interaction terms (<italic>HIFA Child</italic> × <italic>HIFA Demonstration Operational</italic> and <italic>HIFA Parent</italic> × <italic>HIFA Demonstration Operational</italic>). Those coefficients are the “difference-in-differences.” To calculate the parent’s eligibility, we used family income to calculate a parent’s eligibility for HIFA. We also have the child’s eligibility for HIFA, again based on family characteristics and state eligibility rules. The result is two different difference-in-differences intercepts: one for the parent’s eligibility and one for the child’s “own” eligibility. Similarly, we have two HIFA eligibility variables, one for the child and one for the parent.</p>
<p>For the “spillover” analysis, the key variable of interest is the parent’s interaction term (parent eligibility for HIFA interacted with the “HIFA Demonstration Operational” variable). If making parents eligible for HIFA makes the parent more likely to enroll the child in a public program, then we will observe a positive coefficient on the parent eligibility variable.</p>
<p>We estimated two different forms of this general equation. For the first model, we included only the direct HIFA treatment effect and excluded the “spillover” effect. We then estimated a second model including the “spillover” effect. The sample sizes for these two models are different; the first model only includes children who are themselves eligible for HIFA. The second model, which focuses on the spillover effect, also includes children who are eligible for other public programs, such as Medicaid or CHIP. The estimated models are probits with controls for state-level random effects. In the test of whether random effects were necessary, the Likelihood ratio test of ρ = 0 (random effects are not significant), the test statistic was rejected with <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, suggesting that random effects within states are important.</p>
<p>We include variables in our model for</p>

<p>We also included a fixed time (year) effect and a random effect for the state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1077558712436693">2</xref></sup> We report the “marginal effects” of each of our explanatory variables on the dependent variable, rather than the coefficients themselves or odds ratios.

<title>Results</title>
<p>Overall, uninsurance rates among children declined during the time frame studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077558712436693">Figure 1</xref>). This was true for HIFA eligible children, children who lived in HIFA states but were not eligible for HIFA, and for low income (family income below 300% of FPL) children in non-HIFA states. For HIFA eligible children in HIFA states, the average uninsurance rate declined from 24.6% in 1998 to 20.2% in 2001. For this same sample, the uninsurance rate was 19.7% in 2003 and then declined slightly to 16.5% by 2007. (Note: implementation dates vary by state, so uninsurance rates should be compared with caution during 2002-2005 because some, but not all, states had implemented HIFA.) Overall, the HIFA eligible sample has an average uninsurance rate of 22.3% in the pre-HIFA years and an average uninsurance rate of 18.7% in the post-HIFA years, a decline of 3.6 percentage points.</p>

<p>However, in HIFA states the uninsurance rate average showed a very similar decline among children who were <italic>not</italic> eligible for HIFA. For non-HIFA eligible children in HIFA states, the average uninsurance rate declined from 24.9% in 1998 to 23.5% in 2001. For this same sample, the uninsurance rate was 19.1% in 2003 and then declined slightly to 19.0% by 2007. Overall, the non-HIFA eligible sample in HIFA states had an average uninsurance rate of 22.2% in the pre-HIFA years and an average uninsurance rate of 20.2% in the post-HIFA years, a decline of 2.0 percentage points.</p>
<p>In non-HIFA states (the other control group) the average uninsurance rate declined from 25.4% in 1998 to 23.3% in 2001. For this same sample, the uninsurance rate was 20.8% in 2003 and then declined slightly to 19.9% by 2007. Overall, the non-HIFA eligible sample in HIFA states had an average uninsurance rate of 24.7% in 1998-2001 (pre-HIFA years for all states) and an average uninsurance rate of 19.4% in 2005-2007 (roughly the post-HIFA years), a decline of 5.3 percentage points.</p>
<p>Descriptively, HIFA eligible children in HIFA states were quite similar pre- and post-HIFA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077558712436693">Table 2</xref>). Pre-HIFA, children were slightly younger (8.7 years vs. 9.3 years) and slightly more likely to have moved in the previous 12 months and to live in an urban area. Compared with non-HIFA children, HIFA eligibles were (by definition) slightly poorer, but otherwise were quite similar to the non-HIFA eligibles. The non-HIFA state control groups were also fairly similar, although average age was slightly higher (9.5 years vs. 9.3 years) and less urban.</p>

<p>The first model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077558712436693">Table 3</xref>) examines the effect of “own” eligibility for a HIFA demonstration on the probability of a child being insured. The sample for this model includes children who are eligible for HIFA. The baseline probability of a child being insured in the sample is relatively high—79.7%, which is considerably higher than for adults—likely a reflection of substantial expansions of public coverage of children over the past two decades. The results from this model show no evidence that the onset of a HIFA demonstration increased the probability of being insured for children. The coefficient is both small in an absolute sense (0.4468 percentage point increase in the rate of insurance) and statistically insignificant (<italic>p</italic> = .798).</p>

<p>Other control variables have the expected sign. Children with higher incomes, who were born in the United States, are on public assistance, and who are female have higher rates of insurance.

<p>The other control variables again largely have the expected sign. Lower rates of baseline insurance coverage are associated with both child eligibility and parent eligibility, lower income, moving, and living in an urban area. A higher probability of having insurance is associated with being eligible for Medicaid, higher incomes, and younger ages.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1077558712436693" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We find that the HIFA wavier demonstrations had no measureable effect on the uninsurance rate among children, either through direct eligibility or through a “spillover” effect from parental eligibility. It is important to note that HIFA took place during a time when there was rapid enrollment by states of children into the then-new S/CHIP program. Thus, for HIFA to show an indirect effect would have required not merely an increase in enrollment, but a differentially higher rate of increase than that already occurring through S/CHIP.</p>
<p>One question is whether this null finding reflects an actual lack of program effectiveness or if there are alternative explanations for our results. There are a number of limitations to our approach. First, because we do not observe true panel data (e.g., the same child observed in the period before and after the onset of the HIFA demonstration) or the enrollment of individuals in their states’ HIFA demonstration projects, it is possible that the population of HIFA-eligible (or nearly eligible) individuals changed from the preimplementation period in a state to the postimplementation period in ways we cannot measure. Our approach to that problem is to include a large number of control variables measured at both the individual and county level and a random effect for each state. However, to produce a bias in the estimated HIFA effects, such an influx would have to take place <italic>disproportionately</italic> in the HIFA-eligible population in HIFA states in the postimplementation period <italic>relative to</italic> the control groups. We tested for such disproportionate in-migration and found no evidence that it occurred, controlling for other variables in the analysis.</p>
<p>Another limitation is the lack of a true “control” group in the sense of a randomized controlled trial. The control group in our study was comprised of individuals living in HIFA states in preimplementation years and individuals living in non-HIFA states who would likely have been eligible for HIFA if their state had implemented such a demonstration. We tested the sensitivity of our results to different specifications of the control groups, including using 300% of FPL rather than 200% of FPL and by using only HIFA states pre-/postimplementation. We found that our results were robust to these different specifications. We also conducted the sensitivity analysis to see if there were differences in the HIFA spillover effects by age. Enrollment in other public programs varies by age, so it is possible that older children (i.e., teenagers) may be less differently affected by the spillover than younger children. However, we did not find significant results in any of the models, suggesting that the results are robust across age groups.</p>
<p>Also, although the CPS is one of the standard datasets used for analysis of uninsurance, it has several well known limitations. In particular, the CPS may underestimate the number of people on Medicaid; administrative data shows 20% to 30% more Medicaid enrollees than the CPS responses indicate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077558712436693">Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2011</xref>). Similarly, CPS may overestimate the number of full-year uninsured individuals because of misinterpretations of the survey question. However, the design of this analysis (a difference-in-differences model) should minimize the effect of these CPS issues.</p>
<p>One additional possibility is that the lack of change in the rate of uninsurance is because of offsetting increases in public coverage and decreases in private coverage. Although this would not change our conclusions, it would change the interpretation of the results. We tested for this possibility using a multinomial logit model and found no evidence that there were reductions in private coverage in response to the HIFA expansions.</p>
<p>One final reason to believe that this null result actually reflects a lack of program effectiveness is that it is consistent with previous literature in this area. Although some Medicaid expansions for adults do seem to have improved coverage for children (note in particular <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077558712436693">Dubay &amp; Kenney 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077558712436693">2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077558712436693">2004b</xref>), the spillover effect is not uniformly found. In our review of the literature, one theme that consistently emerges is that either making children eligible for programs, but not adults, or making children and adults eligible for different programs, is relatively ineffective in reducing uninsurance. Thus, the extremely different structure of HIFA—which in some states included private premium subsidies for adults while children were eligible for entirely different Medicaid or (S)CHIP programs—may well have been a contributing factor to its ineffectiveness among children.</p>
<p>This study and the previous literature now provide guidance regarding the types of programs that are likely to be effective as health reform moves forward. Programs that integrate family insurance coverage into a single structure are likely to be more effective at reducing the rate of uninsurance than different programs for different members of the same family. Thus, as health reform moves forward, either putting children into insurance exchanges with their parents or making the entire family eligible for Medicaid style programs will lead to the greatest reduction in uninsurance rates among children.</p>
