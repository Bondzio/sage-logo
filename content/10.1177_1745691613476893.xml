<p>This note is a rejoinder to comments by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1745691613476893">H. Rindermann (2013</xref>, this issue) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1745691613476893">R. J. Sternberg (2013</xref>, this issue), on my article “What Makes Nations Intelligent” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1745691613476893">Hunt, 2012</xref>) concerning the level of cognitive ability across nations.</p>
<p>Rindermann’s comments consist of amplifications upon the data reported in the original article and interpretations from a slightly different perspective. I believe that readers will benefit from a combined reading of the original article and Rindermann’s interpretations. Beyond that, I have little to say other than to thank Rindermann for his analyses and insights.</p>
<p>Sternberg’s commentary is more difficult to assess, for in my opinion, it contains a mixture of misinterpretations, errors, and interesting insights.</p>
<p>Sternberg’s commentary contains four major points.</p>
<list id="list1-1745691613476893" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>I overestimate the role of general cognitive abilities in determining various aspects of national welfare. Schooling, in particular, is underestimated.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I fail to discuss creativity, which may vary across societies.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I do not discuss wisdom.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I express admiration for authoritarian regimes and military conquest.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>With respect to Point 1, Sternberg says “<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1745691613476893">Hunt (2012)</xref> places cognitive abilities, or IQ, at the top of the heap of human characteristics (literally and figuratively—see Figure 1 of his article)” (p. 187). He then goes on to argue that the apparent relation between cognitive scores, on a national basis, and a variety of socioeconomic indicators of well-being (e.g., gross domestic product, health statistics) is not due to a causal relation. I find this comment mystifying. The target article quite clearly argues that there are a variety of cognitive skills important in society, that some of them are assessed on intelligence tests and some are not, and that these skills and their development interact tightly with educational development at both the national and individual level. Sternberg argues (correctly) that, to some degree, the correlation between test scores and measures of later success are due to the fact that test scores at the individual level are used to screen for the offering of opportunities, such as entry into colleges and universities. However, it is difficult to see how that reasoning would apply at the international level. Indeed, much of the data that are used in the argument in the target article are data on educational accomplishment. Sternberg’s critique entirely misses this point, which was central to the argument in the article. His comment concerning Figure 1 is equally mystifying, for Figure 1 is a flow diagram, not a hierarchical ordering of abilities. The concept “top of the heap” does not even apply.</p>
<p>Sternberg’s emphasis on creativity suggests an interesting line of research: studies of creativity at the level of societies. I know of no data in which individual measures of creativity are compared across countries, but there are studies of the origins of creative ideas. One such study, in which fairly objective measures were used to identify creative and influential ideas, found that those ideas have, historically, primarily been drawn from Europe and European-derived cultures —precisely those countries that tend to have high scores on measures of general cognitive ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1745691613476893">Murray, 2004</xref>). However, this data is at best tangential to Sternberg’s argument, for which he offers no supporting data. Any phenomenon, including the relations cited in the target article, can be explained by reference to unmeasured variables!</p>
<p>Sternberg also argues that wisdom is an important aspect of society, and one to which I did not refer. He then refers to recent work on wisdom within Western society. Although I hesitate to take a stand against wisdom, I think that there are two problems with using the term <italic>wisdom</italic> to account for relations between cognitive skills and socioeconomic indicators at the international level. The first is simple; as in the case of creativity there is simply no data at the national–international level, and, as noted, a phenomenon can always be explained by reference to unmeasured variables.</p>
<p>The second reason for hesitating to rely on wisdom as an explanation of societal differences is that what counts as wisdom is very much a cultural concept. The typical study of wisdom in the literature alluded to by Sternberg involves having “expert” raters evaluate the wisdom of responses to various social problems. I have been struck by the extent to which the expert judgment seems flavored by the values of highly educated, upper middle-class, socially liberal European/North American society. This is not a criticism of the original research, which was conducted in that society. But consider the following report.</p>
<p>During 2012, there were several reports of customs of tribes along the Afghan–Pakistan border that strike us as, and were reported as, barbaric. The gist of these reports was that if a young woman from Tribe A were to become romantically involved with a man from Tribe B, without her parents’ permission, Tribe A would demand payment: a young girl who would be handed over from B to A without her consent. Such girls usually lived in situations of extreme poverty and servitude very close to slavery. The exchanges were particularly likely to occur if Tribe A was larger and more powerful than Tribe B.</p>
<p>When an elder in the region was asked to explain, he defended the practice as wise! His reasoning was that although the exchange was certainly unfortunate for the young girl, it prevented a blood feud in which many people might be killed. The young girl’s life was used as payment for the good of her tribe.</p>
<p>Such a custom and such reasoning strikes me—a liberal, highly educated North American—as barbaric. However I can see the logic, and (with regret) acknowledge that the elder has a claim to wisdom given the context of his society.</p>
<p>Now let us take an example from a Western country. In our society, and certainly in the research referred to by Sternberg, <italic>wisdom</italic> generally involves defusing rather than encouraging confrontations. There are segments of American society in which it is considered wise to fight physically in response to a perceived insult, on the grounds that failure to do so will expose one to further insults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1745691613476893">Nisbett &amp; Cohen, 1996</xref>.)</p>
<p>The general point is that it is difficult to present measures of a variable (such as wisdom) as causal for other differences between groups (such as measures of economic and social welfare) if the nature of measurement of the first variable differs between groups.</p>
<p>Toward the end of his critique, Sternberg claims that those societies that (according to him) I “so admire” for their cognitive accomplishments are “repressive dictatorships.” Although he does not specify what these countries are, or where I used language of admiration rather than reporting statements of fact, he may be referring to the 10 countries with high scholastic accomplishment scores, as shown in Figure 2 of the target article. Of these 10 “countries,” three are large urban districts of the People’s Republic of China, which is a one-party state. However, it is probably better described as oligarchic rather than a repressive dictatorship. The other seven are all multiparty democracies. The Swiss and the Finns would probably be a bit surprised to find that they were included in Sternberg’s set of “repressive dictatorships.” In fact, I do not think Sternberg would do this, but I do think he was careless in putting words into my mouth and just wish to show how this carelessness could be interpreted.</p>
<p>Similarly, Sternberg reports that I admired the 16th century Spaniards for their conquest of the Aztecs. I did not express any admiration of the <italic>conquistadores</italic> morally, although a moral evaluation of their actions would be complex. (The Aztecs practiced human sacrifice and cannibalism on a grand scale—the <italic>conquistadores</italic> forbade such practices.) I did say that certain aspects of Spanish military technology and ways of reasoning aided them in the conquest…and they did.</p>
<p>Sternberg closes with an assertion that nations would be well advised to utilize creativity and wisdom in a search for peace, rather than amplification of the weapons of war. I agree, but what has this to do with the target article?</p>
