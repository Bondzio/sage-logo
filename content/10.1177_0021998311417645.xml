<abstract>
<p>Titanium matrix composites (TMCs) hybrid-reinforced by <italic>in situ</italic> titanium–boron whisker (TiBw) and titanium–carbide particle (TiCp) were fabricated by reactive hot pressing method. The dry sliding wearing behavior of the TMCs was investigated by pin-on-disc tests under the normal loads ranging from 40 to 100 N, and the effects of reinforcements were discussed. The TMCs showed much lower friction coefficient and improved wear resistances than the Ti matrix. No reinforcements were pulled out during sliding due to the strong interface bonding strength between the Ti matrix and the reinforcements. The TMCs exhibited a mixed-wear mode of adhesive and abrasive. The results showed that the TiBw was more effective to improve the wear resistance of TMCs than the TiCp due to its higher aspect ratio and load-bearing capacity during sliding wear.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998311417645" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Titanium and its alloys have been used for chemical, electric power, aerospace, automobile, and medical applications due to their excellent properties such as high strength and excellent corrosion, as well as high temperature resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311417645">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311417645">3</xref></sup> However, the main drawbacks such as low hardness and poor resistance to sliding wear restricted their application.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311417645">4</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311417645">8</xref></sup> Surface treatments like coating and laser surface processing are widely adopted to improve the wear resistance of titanium alloys,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311417645">9</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311417645">11</xref></sup> but these methods cannot improve the whole strength and hardness of the alloys. With incorporation of ceramic particles into titanium alloys, titanium matrix composites (TMCs) are provided with better hardness, strength, and wear resistance,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311417645">12</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311417645">14</xref></sup> especially those reinforced by <italic>in situ</italic> ceramic particles, received extensive research interests due to their low cost, easy fabrication, and excellent interface bonding strength.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311417645">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311417645">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Among the ceramic reinforcements, titanium–boron (TiB) and titanium–carbide (TiC) are attractive since they are well compatible with the Ti matrix. Panda and Chandran<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311417645">15</xref></sup> pointed out that TiB, especially in the whisker form, was attractive as the reinforcement in metal matrix composites (MMCs) and wear resistance coatings. In fact, for the discontinuously reinforced TMCs, most research efforts were put on those reinforced by TiB or/and TiC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311417645">15</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998311417645">20</xref></sup> Due to the good thermodynamic stability in the Ti matrix, TiB and TiC can provide a strong interface bonding strength which may reduce the pull-out of the reinforcement from the matrix during sliding. Accordingly, TiB and TiC are expected to provide TMCs with good wear resistance. However, information is not enough on the tribological and wearing behavior of TMCs.</p>
<p>The hybrid-reinforced mode is an efficient way to improve mechanical properties of MMCs. Westwood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998311417645">21</xref></sup> proposed a concept to design microstructures for hybrid-reinforced MMCs using: hard particle phases to improve strength, resilient phases to improve toughness, and whiskers for better creep resistance. Rösler and Bäker<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998311417645">22</xref></sup> predicted by simulation that a volume ratio of about 3/4 reinforcements with 1/4 dispersoids was ideal in many cases provided reinforcements with sufficient aspect ratio and size. Lu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021998311417645">23</xref></sup> pointed out that TiC particle (TiCp) is more effective in increasing the flow stress than TiB whisker (TiBw) at low deformation temperature. Recently, our investigation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021998311417645">24</xref></sup> confirmed that the synergistic effect of TiBw and TiCp on tensile strength of TMCs was apparent, and a proper volume ratio of TiBw to TiCp would provide the TMCs with better properties. Based on this result, we considered that it is interesting to find out if this synergistic effect is also effective for the wearing behavior.</p>
<p>In this study, we studied the sliding wearing behavior of the TMCs hybrid-reinforced by <italic>in situ</italic> TiBw and TiCp. A comparison between the TiBw and TiCp was particularly emphasized to make sure which one is more effective to improve the wear resistance of the TMCs.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0021998311417645"><title>Experimental</title>
<p>Based on the reaction of Ti–B<sub>4</sub>C and Ti–C systems (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0021998311417645">Equation (1)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0021998311417645">2</xref>)), we designed a Ti–B<sub>4</sub>C–C system (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-0021998311417645">Equation (3)</xref>) to prepare TMCs with various TiB/TiC volume ratios. The Ti–C system was introduced to adjust the volume fraction ratio of TiB to TiC. The TMCs studied in this study were fabricated by reactive hot pressing of blended powders of titanium (Ti), boron carbide (B<sub>4</sub>C), and graphite (C).

<p>According to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-0021998311417645">Equation (3)</xref>, 10 vol.% (TiBw + TiCp) reinforced TMCs with TiBw/TiCp volume ratios of 8/2, 5/5, and 2/8 were prepared and designated as samples W<sub>8</sub>P<sub>2</sub>, W<sub>5</sub>P<sub>5</sub>, and W<sub>2</sub>P<sub>8</sub>, respectively (<italic>x</italic> = 0, 3, 7). Commercial Ti powders (99% purity), B<sub>4</sub>C powders (99% purity), and graphite powder (99% purity) with an average sizes of 10, 0.5, and 0.5 µm, respectively, were used as raw materials. The blended powders were first hot pressed in vacuum and then extruded into rods of diameter 12 mm at an extrusion ratio of 16:1. The unreinforced pure Ti was produced in a similar manner for comparison and designated as sample Pure Ti.</p>
<p>Phase identification of the as-extruded TMCs was conducted <italic>via</italic> X-ray diffractometry (XRD) using a Phillipx’pert X-ray diffractometer and Cu-Kα radiation, with the sample surfaces paralleling to the extrusion direction. The density of samples was measured three times by the Archimedes method, and an average value obtained. Vickers hardness tests (HV-5) were conducted on the transverse section of the extruded samples using a HV-200 tester under the condition of 5 kg load for 20 s. Tensile tests were performed at room temperature on an Instron 5569 testing machine with the cross-head moving rate of 0.5 mm/min, using dog bone-shaped tensile testing samples with a gage length of 15 mm prepared along the extrusion direction. For scanning electron microscopy (SEM, HITCHI S-4700) analysis, the TMC samples parallel and perpendicular to the extrusion direction were polished and etched with solution of H<sub>2</sub>O:HNO<sub>3</sub>:HF = 85:10:5. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) studies were performed using a Philips CM-12 microscope operated at 120 kV. Thin foil samples sectioned perpendicular to the extrusion direction were prepared using standard techniques involving mechanical grinding and ion milling.</p>
<p>Cylindrical samples with a diameter of 5 mm and a length of 20 mm were machined by electro-discharge machining from the extruded bars, with the axis paralleled to the extrusion direction. Sliding wear tests were carried out on a pin-on-disc machine under the normal loads ranging from 40 to 100 N, with a sliding velocity of about 0.54 m/s. All tests were performed at room temperature in air without any lubricants. The total sliding distance was about 212 m for each wear test. A circular disc with a diameter of 34 mm and a thickness of 10 mm was used as the counter disc which was made of a tool steel with the surface hardness of &gt; 58 HRc and surface roughness of <italic>Ra</italic> = 1 µm. Wear was determined by measuring the mass loss of the specimen using a precision balance (0.1 mg). The worn surface and the debris of samples were examined using SEM.</p></sec>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311417645">Figure 1</xref> shows the XRD pattern of the as-sintered materials. The results showed that the B<sub>4</sub>C and graphite powders disappeared and TiB and TiC were formed after sintering. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311417645">Figure 2</xref> shows the SEM microstructures of samples W<sub>8</sub>P<sub>2</sub> and W<sub>2</sub>P<sub>8</sub> parallel and perpendicular to the extrusion direction, respectively. As can be seen, TiBw with a diameter of less than 0.3 µm and an aspect ratio of about 20 was aligned along the extrusion direction in the TMCs. The interface between the Ti matrix and the TiBw was clear without reactants being detected. It is noted that almost no TiCp were visible in the SEM microstructures of sample W<sub>8</sub>P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311417645">Figure 2(a) and (b)</xref>), and this is attributed to their fine sizes. TEM graph showed that the TiBw owned a hexagonal cross-section, and the TiCp from the B<sub>4</sub>C–Ti reaction were fine particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311417645">Figure 3</xref>). It further confirmed that the interface between the Ti matrix and the reinforcements was clear. For sample W<sub>2</sub>P<sub>8</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311417645">Figure 2(c) and (d)</xref>), except for the TiBw, many TiCps were observed in the matrix and these TiCps came from the reaction between the titanium and the graphite powder.

Compared to Pure Ti, the TMCs exhibited a higher Vickers hardness with an increase of 84%, 88%, and 70%, respectively, for samples W<sub>8</sub>P<sub>2</sub>, W<sub>5</sub>P<sub>5</sub>, and W<sub>2</sub>P<sub>8</sub>. The ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of the TMCs was markedly improved with the elongation being decreased, and sample W<sub>5</sub>P<sub>5</sub> exhibited the highest UTS and ductility.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311417645">Figure 4</xref> shows the friction coefficient (FC) of the TMCs and the Pure Ti samples under the loads of 40 to100 N, respectively. The FC of the Pure Ti was about 0.385 to 0.395, which was relatively stable within the range of the loads. The FCs of the TMCs were decreased with increasing the loads, and they were at the same level under the each applied load, showing that the ratio of TiBw to TiCp on the FC was indistinct. Meanwhile, they were evidently lower than that of the Pure Ti. For example, the FCs of samples W<sub>8</sub>P<sub>2</sub>, W<sub>1</sub>P<sub>1</sub>, and W<sub>2</sub>P<sub>8</sub> are about 70%, 67%, and 64% of Pure Ti. The Pure Ti showed higher FC and this was due to its ductile nature and low work hardening behavior. The formation of the TiBw and TiCp greatly increased the hardness and strength of the TMCs, and this effectively decreased the FC. This lower FC will benefit to increase the wear resistance of the TMCs.
<fig id="fig4-0021998311417645" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>FCs of TMCs and Pure Ti samples as a function of sliding distance.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311417645-fig4.tif"/></fig></p></sec>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311417645">Figure 5</xref> shows the weight loss of the samples under the loads 40 to 100 N, with a sliding distance of 212 m. As can be seen, all the TMCs showed greatly lower weight loss compared to the Pure Ti. Among the TMCs, sample W<sub>8</sub>P<sub>2</sub> exhibited the lowest weight loss, and the weight loss of the TMCs decreased with increasing the TiBw volume fraction. The weight loss values of sample W<sub>8</sub>P<sub>2</sub> were 18.7%, 18.8%, 13.4%, and 10.4% of the Pure Ti under the loads of 40, 60, 80, and 100 N, respectively.
<fig id="fig5-0021998311417645" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Weight loss of TMCs and Pure Ti samples with a sliding distance of 212 m.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311417645-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The TMC samples showed much lower weight loss compared to the Pure Ti. This indicates that the incorporation of ceramic reinforcements efficiently improved the wear resistance of the Ti matrix. The wear resistance of the TMCs decreased with the decrease of the TiBw volume fraction (or the increase of TiCp). This shows that the TiBw could improve the wear resistance of the Ti matrix more effectively than the TiCp. Considering the similar Vickers hardness of the TMCs and the similar Knoop hardness of TiB (28.0 GPa) and TiC (24.7 GPa), the disparity in the wear resistance of the TMCs may be mainly attributed to the different morphologies of the TiBw and TiCp, and this will be further discussed later.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-0021998311417645"><title>Worn surface</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311417645">Figure 6</xref> shows the worn surface of the TMCs and the Pure Ti samples. For the worn surface of the Pure Ti (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311417645">Figure 6(a)</xref>), it was heavily deformed and torn, and was covered by severe flakes and long grooves. The morphology of this worn surface showed the typical characteristic of severe adhesive. For the TMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311417645">Figure 6(b)–(d)</xref>), the surface wearing was less severe and covered with finer wear debris. Meanwhile, some shallower worn tracks were also found on the worn surfaces. This morphology exhibited the characteristic of both adhesive and abrasive.
<fig id="fig6-0021998311417645" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>SEM micrographs of worn surfaces of TMCs and Pure Ti samples under load of 100 N.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311417645-fig6.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The different morphologies of the worn surfaces between the TMCs and the Pure Ti samples are attributed to the presence of the TiBw and TiCp. For the Pure Ti, the surface morphology formed as the counter body ploughed across the soft surface and eventually removed material from the worn surface through primarily ductile processes. On the one hand, the formation of the TiBw and TiCp greatly increased the strength and hardness of the soft matrix and this was beneficial to the wear resistance. On the other hand, once the soft Ti matrix was recessed, the TiBw and TiCp embedded in the matrix would stick out and wear against the counter body, thereby retarding further wear of the matrix. As the TiBw and TiCp were <italic>in situ</italic> formed, the interfacial bonding strength between the reinforcements and the matrix was strong enough; so, it was difficult to pull them out during the wear process. As a result, the TiBw and TiCp on the wear tracks were worn away instead of being pulled out, which efficiently increased the wear resistance of the TMCs.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311417645">Figure 7</xref> shows the etched cross-section of worn surfaces of the TMCs and the Pure Ti samples. It was noticed that there was a plastic-deformed subsurface under the worn surface of each sample. For the Pure Ti sample, the worn surface was rough with many pores being apparently visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311417645">Figure 7(a)</xref>). Those pores should have been resulted from the defects such as micro-cracks which were generated by the plastic deformation during the process of friction and wear. Compared to the Pure Ti sample, the worn surfaces of the TMC samples were relatively smooth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311417645">Figure 7(b)–(d)</xref>). The subsurfaces were about 15 µm in thickness with obvious plastic deformation, and no visible pores were found in this region. Many TiBws in the subsurfaces were found to be broken and bent toward the sliding direction. Meanwhile, some large TiCps were also found to be broken (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311417645">Figure 7(d)</xref>). It was also noted that decreasing the volume fraction of the TiBw led to increased distortion degree of the subsurface.

<p>The cross-section of the worn surfaces revealed that for the Pure Ti, the plastic deformed region with defects was likely to be formed in the subsurface during the process of friction and wear. This is due to the low strength and stiffness of the Pure Ti. It showed lower deformation resistance during the test. Compared to the Pure Ti, the TMCs had higher strength and stiffness due to the presence of the TiBw and TiCp; thus, they can effectively retard the defects from being formed in the subsurface and then increase the wear resistance. Furthermore, the TiBw perpendicular to the wear direction can effectively pin up the Ti matrix. Thus, it is difficult for the wear debris to flake off under shear stress, but it is not the case for the TiCp due to its particle morphology. At the same time, the TiBw exhibited better resistance to wear plastic deformation than the TiCp due to its higher aspect ratio and load-bearing capacity during sliding wear. These causes explain why the TiBw improved the wear resistance more effectively than the TiCp.</p></sec>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311417645">Figure 8</xref> shows the debris of the TMCs and the Pure Ti samples, respectively. While they exhibited similar lamellar morphology, they were different in sizes. The debris of the Pure Ti sample showed large sizes and the width of most debris was more than 200 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311417645">Figure 8(a)</xref>), but the debris of the TMCs showed much smaller size and it increased with increasing the TiCp content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311417645">Figure 8(b)–(d)</xref>). As the presence of the TiBw and TiCp prevented the cracks from being formed and extended within the matrix, the formation of a spall on the wear track was retarded and it was difficult for the large lamellar spall to form. Due to their whisker-like morphology, the directionally aligned TiBw would retard the formation of lamellar spall more efficiently than the TiCp, and this explained the largest size of debris in sample W<sub>2</sub>P<sub>8</sub>.

<sec id="sec9-0021998311417645"><title>Effects of reinforcements</title>
<p>So far, few research studies were reported on the comparative assessment of the effect of different types of reinforcement on the wear properties of MMCs. Wang and Rack<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021998311417645">25</xref></sup> studied the dry sliding wearing behavior of A1 MMCs reinforced by 20 vol.% SiC particle and 20 vol.% SiC whisker (perpendicular or parallel orientation), respectively. They reported that the effect of the shape of reinforcement depends on the sliding velocity. The steady-state wear rates of the composites were generally independent of the reinforcement geometry (particulate vs. whiskers) and orientation (perpendicular vs. parallel) at low sliding velocities, but the SiC particle-reinforced composite exhibited the highest wear rate at high sliding velocities. Miyajima and Iwai<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998311417645">26</xref></sup> investigated the effects of reinforcements (SiC whisker, SiC particle, and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> fiber) on the dry sliding wearing behavior of Al MMCs. They found that whisker fragments formed in the wear process were small, resulting in little aggressive action on the counterface material. On the other hand, fiber and particle fragments were large in size and angular in shape, promoting abrasion on the counterface at high volume fraction. They concluded that particles are most beneficial for improving the wear resistance of MMCs. As discussed above, different types of reinforcement may affect the wear properties of MMCs. However, it is difficult to make a comparison between our results and those obtained by Wang and Rack<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021998311417645">25</xref></sup> and Miyajima and Iwai<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998311417645">26</xref></sup> because of different matrix alloys, reinforcement fractions, and experimental conditions.</p>
<p>Another issue that should be taken into consideration is the oxidation behavior of the TiBw. During the sliding process, the heat resulting from the friction between samples and the steel disc increased the temperature, which could result in the oxidation of the TiBw on the worn surfaces. It was reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021998311417645">27</xref></sup> that at high temperatures, TiB would be oxidized into TiO<sub>2</sub> and B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Subsequently, the B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> would react with the water from the environment to form H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub>. Both the B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and the H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub> could act as solid lubricants so as to alleviate the friction and wear of the TMCs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021998311417645">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021998311417645">29</xref></sup> and this would be partially responsible for the better wear resistance of the TMCs, which contain more volume fraction of the TiBw.</p></sec></sec>

<list-item><p>In situ TiBw and TiCp hybrid-reinforced TMCs with various TiBw/TiCp ratios were fabricated by reactive hot pressing. The TMCs showed significantly better wear resistance than the Pure Ti, and the TiBw was more effective to improve the wear resistance of the TMCs than the TiCp.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The TMCs showed an apparently lower FC than the Pure Ti, and the influence of the TiBw/TiCp ratio on FC was not distinct.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The TMCs exhibited the characteristic of both adhesive and abrasive, which was different from the severe adhesive mode of the Pure Ti. There was a plastic deformation subsurface under each worn surface of the TMCs. Many TiBws and some large TiCp in this region were found to be broken and bent toward the sliding direction. The reasons that the TiBw is more effective than TiCp to resist wear plastic deformation are its higher aspect ratio and load-bearing capacity during sliding wear.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The debris of the TMCs and the Pure Ti showed similarly lamellar morphology. The former showed smaller size than the latter, and it increased with increasing TiCp content.</p></list-item>
