<abstract>
<p>This study examines the intersection of journalist gender and campaign news coverage across legislative and executive political offices in a gender-prominent context: mixed-gender elections—those with at least one woman and one man. Based on a content analysis of U.S. newspaper coverage, this study focuses on “masculinized” and “feminized” political issues and character traits, and explicit references that highlight a candidate’s novelty. Results revealed no direct relationship between journalist gender and news coverage; however, when type of office was considered, there were significant shifts and differences in the focus of coverage by female and male journalists.</p>

<p>Two of the most important and intertwined arenas in America are journalism and politics. These domains create a cycle that on good days undergirds democracy: Politicians speak to journalists, news media report on policies and campaigns, and citizens draw on these communications to learn about politicians,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077699012468695">1</xref></sup> and to form vote decisions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1077699012468695">2</xref></sup> With this in mind, a growing body of work has explored whether news coverage differs based on a journalist’s or politician’s gender.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1077699012468695">3</xref></sup> However, little scholarship has examined whether a journalist’s gender may act as an individual-level influence on <italic>campaign</italic> coverage, and almost no research has studied the relationship between journalist gender and news coverage in what might be called <italic>gender-prominent</italic> contexts—such as in all-female or mixed-gender elections. In these contexts, candidate gender becomes a major part of the public discussion. For example, in the 2012 presidential campaign, the presence of a congresswoman led to such headlines as “Michele Bachmann, Wife In Chief?”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1077699012468695">4</xref></sup> and “Bachmann Bats Eyes at Iowa.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1077699012468695">5</xref></sup> Prompted by the increasing number of female journalists and women political candidates,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1077699012468695">6</xref></sup> this research analyzed U.S. newspaper coverage of mixed-gender elections with a focus on descriptive labels and a set of political issues and character traits that are commonly cast in “gendered” terms. This work adds another dimension of gender to the interplay of journalism and politics and contributes to scholarship on gender in the newsroom and political communication.</p>
<sec id="section1-1077699012468695">
<title>Gender in political campaigns and news</title>
<p>American journalism and politics have long been considered “masculinized” domains. Historically, this masculinization has occurred because of a lack of female access and representation. In journalism, for much of America’s early history, most women did not receive formalized education and were either illiterate or semiliterate,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1077699012468695">7</xref></sup> a reality that kept most women out of the news, including its production and consumption. In politics, at the national level, women did not gain the right to vote until 1920—three years after the first woman was elected to U.S. Congress in 1917—and the first woman elected governor who was not a wife or widow of a previous governor assumed office in 1974.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1077699012468695">8</xref></sup> The exclusion of most women meant journalism and politics were male-centered domains, largely promulgating masculine behaviors and norms. Even today, much recent scholarship suggests that journalistic and political values align closely with masculine values—in that masculine behaviors, characteristics, and professional experiences are highly valued and considered the norm.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1077699012468695">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>This perspective has prompted a focus on how a journalist’s gender may shape daily news coverage. Some scholars have found a male socialization effect on female journalists.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1077699012468695">10</xref></sup> In other words, women working in a masculine newsroom environment learn and adopt the more masculinized attributes of their surroundings, which may obviate any differences based on journalist gender. Beyond the individual journalist, male socialization may also occur at the level of editor and managing editor. Splichal and Garrison posited, “Perhaps women who achieve management positions, as their male counterparts, have been rewarded for conformity in addition to achievement.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1077699012468695">11</xref></sup> Other studies, however, have found female reporters to be more likely than male reporters to incorporate female sources,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1077699012468695">12</xref></sup> and female TV correspondents to be more likely than male counterparts to allocate the first source position in a story to a female.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1077699012468695">13</xref></sup> In addition, female journalists have been found to be more likely to write about women and include mentions of women in more prominent portions of an article, such as the headline, than male journalists, and male journalists have been found to be more likely to do the same for men.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1077699012468695">14</xref></sup> A number of studies, then, have found that journalist gender does influence coverage.</p>
<p>Little research, however, has focused on distinctly gender-prominent political contexts. Liebler and Smith analyzed coverage of female and male TV correspondents during President Bill Clinton’s first one hundred days in office—a period they called a time of “peaked” attention to women due to Clinton’s appointment of women to high-profile positions and because Hillary Clinton garnered significant media attention.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1077699012468695">15</xref></sup> Liebler and Smith ultimately selected stories that focused on discussion of the president, his administration, or his policies. Thus, gender was more of a peripheral factor in the study’s news environment and may be why Liebler and Smith found little to no differences. In the current study gender is a central factor. First, news coverage of mixed-gender campaigns is examined, with a focus on coverage that discusses both the female and male candidates. Second, the female candidates in these elections are seeking offices never before held by a woman. As such, gender is a high-profile contextual characteristic in this research. To explore this environment, three newsworthy domains of electoral coverage are examined: novelty labels, political issues, and character traits.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1077699012468695">
<title>Novelty labels</title>
<p>A relatively unequal representation of women in the profession is something American politics and journalism share. For example, as of 2012, women were approximately 38% of the daily newsroom workforce and 17% of the U.S. Congress.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1077699012468695">16</xref></sup> Furthermore, as of 2012, no woman owned a metropolitan newspaper or national news outlet, and no woman had been elected U.S. president. Therefore, women are the minority in both news and politics, and no woman holds the highest position within either field. In the words of Jill Abramson, the recently appointed first female executive editor of the <italic>New York Times</italic>, “there are still few women successfully leading the cornerstone institutions of our society.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1077699012468695">17</xref></sup> This distinctly minority status of female journalists may trigger identifiable patterns in coverage of female politicians seeking to win and hold offices never before held by a woman.</p>
<p>One way to examine this impact is to analyze how journalists describe female and male candidates. Such descriptions often take the form of labels that call attention to a candidate’s unusual characteristics in certain contexts. These labels—what may be called “novelty labels”—may include references regarding a candidate’s gender (e.g., “female”) or “uniqueness” (e.g., “first female”). The motivation for whether journalists employ such labels is multifaceted. For example, female journalists may retreat from overly emphasizing the novelty of female candidates because of their own minority status. Such a trend may also occur because of a desire to avoid negative connotations that often arise from highlighting a woman’s nontraditional gender in politics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1077699012468695">18</xref></sup> Yet again, female and male journalists may capitalize on the long-standing journalistic norm of emphasizing novelty because it is seen as newsworthy,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1077699012468695">19</xref></sup> and perhaps even historic. It is plausible, therefore, that in coverage of mixed-gender elections, female journalists may emphasize novelty labels either less than or equal to the amount of male journalists.</p>
<p>At the same time, not all electoral offices are alike, and some can be viewed as distinctly “gendered.” This gendering may result in female candidates being treated as more of a novelty when they seek more “masculine” offices. For instance, legislative offices such as those in Congress are seen as more feminine because they require communal relationships to enact policy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1077699012468695">20</xref></sup> This gendered impression is based on the idea that American women are more interdependent than men and seek to develop and maintain relationships,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1077699012468695">21</xref></sup> and that their leadership style is perceived to be more collaborative and democratic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1077699012468695">22</xref></sup> Conversely, executive offices such as governor and president are perceived as more masculine because only one person at a time holds these offices and has executive power to act on his or her own.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1077699012468695">23</xref></sup> This gendered impression is based on the idea that American men are more independent and autonomous,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1077699012468695">24</xref></sup> and their leadership style is perceived to be more autocratic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1077699012468695">25</xref></sup> Some women have been elected governor, but not many. For example in 2012, six states had female governors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1077699012468695">26</xref></sup> These gendered offices are also consistent with public perceptions; voters prefer a candidate with more masculine issue expertise and masculine traits for executive offices, and they also prefer a candidate with more feminine issue competency and feminine traits for legislative offices.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1077699012468695">27</xref></sup> Overall, executive offices are seen as more masculine and legislative offices are seen as more feminine because of the general tasks of the position, how those responsibilities align with gender role stereotypes, and voters’ perceptions of those offices.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1077699012468695">28</xref></sup> Taken together, it may be that female candidates are covered by journalists as more of a novelty when they seek offices that are perceived to be more “masculine.” The following research question is thus posed: In a mixed-gender campaign context, are female journalists more or less likely to use novelty labels than male journalists in general and based on the office sought (<bold>RQ</bold>)?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1077699012468695">
<title>Gendered issues and traits</title>
<p>When we turn to news topics, political issues, and personal trait preferences, we find that journalism and politics also share similar, gendered distinctions in these domains, as well. In the 1970s, the newspaper industry encountered severe financial problems, caused in large part by a readership that shrank due to the increasing popularity of broadcast television news.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1077699012468695">29</xref></sup> Newspapers noticed that their male readership outnumbered their female readership, and in an attempt to secure more female readers, they hired magazine writers to bring a more “feminine touch.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1077699012468695">30</xref></sup> Journalist Zoe Heller noted, “Historically, the role of the female newspaper writer has been to leaven the serious (male) stuff . . . [with] news from the realm of the domestic, the emotional, the personal.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1077699012468695">31</xref></sup> Thus, female journalists have been charged with a distinctly more feminine coverage domain.</p>
<p>In politics, socially constructed sex roles and their accompanying stereotypes have created and fostered gendered areas of emphasis, as well. In particular, the theories of issue and trait ownership posit that through a history of attention and effective handling, certain groups are seen as “owning” certain issues and traits.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1077699012468695">32</xref></sup> Traditionally, ownership scholarship has focused on what political parties own.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1077699012468695">33</xref></sup> The handling by political parties of certain issues leads “voters to believe that one of the parties (and its candidates) is more sincere and committed to doing something about them.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1077699012468695">34</xref></sup> More recently scholarship has developed around gender ownership, based on a history of public perceptions of effective issue handling and knowledge, as well as social roles, for men and women.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1077699012468695">35</xref></sup> For example, men are often viewed as society’s protectors and breadwinners, and have therefore been perceived as more effective in handling politics, business and economics, crime, and international affairs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1077699012468695">36</xref></sup> Conversely, women have been seen as family-oriented and as society’s compassionate caretakers—thereby creating female ownership over the issues of education, health care, family life, and social welfare.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1077699012468695">37</xref></sup> Therefore, men and women journalists and politicians are seen as owning the coverage of and political handling of certain news topics and issues.</p>
<p>Journalism and politics also prioritize gendered domains similarly. In journalism, feminine news topics are often published in less visible spaces, whereas masculine news topics are generally considered “hard news” and thus worthy of the front page.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1077699012468695">38</xref></sup> In politics, masculine issues are seen as more important to voters than feminine issues generally, and especially as candidates run for national, executive offices.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1077699012468695">39</xref></sup> This preference for masculinity crosses over to another important and gendered area in politics: character traits. Built on the theory of gender ownership and traditional gender roles and behaviors, traits have also split along gender lines. Stereotypically feminine traits include compassion, emotionality, honesty, altruism, and congeniality, and stereotypically masculine traits include strength, decisiveness, independence, aggressiveness, and confidence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1077699012468695">40</xref></sup> More recent studies show that voters still hold these gender-based stereotypes of women and men, and more commonly associate stereotypical feminine traits with women and stereotypical masculine traits with men.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1077699012468695">41</xref></sup> Notably, voters tend to prefer masculine traits over feminine traits, and this preference increases as candidates run for executive offices.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-1077699012468695">42</xref></sup> Therefore, across news topics, political issues, and traits, norms of masculinity are preferred over norms of femininity.</p>
<p>These gendered divisions spur some specific expectations for news coverage of mixed-gender campaigns, namely, a gender-congruent link between journalist gender and gendered news domains. That is, men’s long-standing place in journalism and traditional alignment with more masculine topics is expected to result in male journalists offering more masculinized coverage. The gender-congruent link between males and masculine topics is based on tradition, but it still exists in contemporary news. For example, in 2006, when Katie Couric was announced as the first solo network anchorwoman, Larry King pointedly asked Walter Cronkite whether news of war should be delivered in a male voice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-1077699012468695">43</xref></sup> Couric was acutely aware of the gendered distinction. In her 2012 graduation commencement speech at the University of Virginia, Couric said, “Some said I lacked ‘gravitas’ [for the position], which I’ve since decided is Latin for ‘testicles.’”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-1077699012468695">44</xref></sup> Furthermore, many women journalists were employed to provide a feminine touch, and are “still concentrated in sectors considered to be ‘soft news.’”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-1077699012468695">45</xref></sup> As a result, women are situated in the newsroom in a way that bolsters the gender-congruent link between women and more feminized coverage. Taken together, the partitioning of news coverage based on journalist gender has become its own newsroom routine and may suggest why, despite male socialization, previous studies have found gender congruency between journalist and coverage.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-1077699012468695">46</xref></sup> In addition, Craft and Wanta found that at newspapers with a lower percentage of female editors, which is still the vast majority of newspapers, gender congruency was upheld because male journalists covered politics more often then female journalists, and female journalists were more likely to cover education.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-1077699012468695">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>With all of this in mind, the following predictions in a mixed-gender campaign context are offered: First, female journalists will provide more coverage of so-called feminine content than male journalists in general (<bold>H1a</bold>) and for so-called feminized, legislative offices (<bold>H1b</bold>); second, male journalists will provide more coverage of so-called masculine content than female journalists in general (<bold>H2a</bold>) and for so-called masculinized, executive offices (<bold>H2b</bold>).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>To examine these hypotheses, news coverage of male and female candidates in eight mixed-gender elections in eight newspapers between 1999 and 2008 was analyzed. Two elections were selected for four women who ran separate times for different offices among senator, governor, vice president, or president. Specifically, each candidate sought a legislative (senator) or executive office (governor, vice president, or president). The candidates were Republicans Elizabeth Dole and Sarah Palin and Democrats Claire McCaskill and Hillary Clinton. All of the women sought offices that had not been occupied by women.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-1077699012468695">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>To ensure sufficient and conceptually parallel news coverage across campaigns and candidates, the top two largest-circulation newspapers in the candidates’ states were selected, based on the “2010 Top Newspapers” rankings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-1077699012468695">49</xref></sup> The newspapers were the <italic>Charlotte Observer</italic> and Raleigh <italic>News &amp; Observer</italic> for Dole, the <italic>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</italic> and <italic>Kansas City Star</italic> for McCaskill, the New York <italic>Daily News</italic> and <italic>Buffalo News</italic> for Clinton, and the <italic>Anchorage Daily News</italic> and <italic>Fairbanks Daily News-Miner</italic> for Palin.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-1077699012468695">50</xref></sup> For the content analysis, the sample was collected via two steps. First, a keyword search using the online databases of Access World News, Factiva, and Nexis was conducted, with the female <italic>and</italic> male candidates’ names in the search string. News articles were systematically randomly sampled within this content to select approximately 30% of the articles. This process yielded a total of 706 news articles.</p>
<p>A subset of articles written by either female or male journalists only was created—creating a final sample of 553 articles across all eight elections. The other 153 articles were written by both female and male journalists or credited as simply “staff writers.” The variable <italic>journalist gender</italic> was assigned based on the journalist’s name, with additional research conducted for gender-ambiguous names such as “Terry” and “Avery.” The variable was coded as “male” (1) or “female” (2). Of the analyzed articles, men wrote 84% (<italic>n</italic> = 466) and women wrote 16% (<italic>n</italic> = 87). The variable <italic>type of office sought</italic> was coded as “senator” (1), “governor” (2), or “vice president or president” (3), henceforth labeled as “president.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-1077699012468695">51</xref></sup> The offices of governor and president were not collapsed into one category so as to ascertain any differences in coverage between executive offices.</p>
<p>The unit of analysis for each content variable was the news article. The variable <italic>novelty labels</italic> comprised any explicit gender references such as “woman,” “man,” “mother,” or “husband,” or explicit uniqueness references such as “first” or “pioneer.” Each of these labels was assigned a code of present (1) or absent (0) for each female or male candidate, and the four items were combined for an aggregated variable ranging from 0 to 4 (<italic>M</italic> = 0.42, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.71). For instance, a 0 for novelty labels indicated that neither the female nor the male candidate received any novelty coverage, whereas a 4 indicated that coverage of the female included both gender and uniqueness labels <italic>and</italic> coverage of the male included both gender and uniqueness labels.</p>
<p>The variable <italic>feminine issues</italic> comprised any discussion of one of four issues perceived to be feminine in nature: education, health care, reproductive rights, or women’s issues, a term that incorporated several matters (e.g., equal rights, equal pay, or entitlements during maternity leave). In a parallel manner, <italic>masculine issues</italic> comprised any discussion of one of four issues perceived to be masculine in nature: military, defense, or war, crime, foreign affairs, or economy. For both issues variables, for each of the respective issues a code of present (1) or absent (0) was assigned for each female or male candidate, and these items were combined for an aggregated variable ranging from 0 to 8 (feminine issues <italic>M</italic> = 0.37, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.87; masculine issues <italic>M</italic> = 0.78, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.13).</p>
<p>The variable <italic>feminine traits</italic> comprised any discussion of one of five traits perceived to be feminine in nature: compassion, emotionality, honesty, congeniality, or altruism. <italic>Masculine traits</italic> comprised any discussion of one of five traits perceived to be masculine in nature: leadership, rationality, aggressiveness, decisiveness, or independence. For both traits variables, for each of the respective traits a code of present (1) or absent (0) was assigned for each female or male candidate, and these items were combined for an aggregated variable ranging from 0 to 10 (feminine traits <italic>M</italic> = 0.18, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.51; masculine traits <italic>M</italic> = 0.33, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.67).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-1077699012468695">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>Intercoder reliability was calculated by two coders on 15% of articles in the sample, and Scott’s pi calculations ranged from π = .79 for masculine issues to π = .99 for journalist gender.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-1077699012468695">53</xref></sup></p>

<p>The research question examined the potential difference between male and female journalists in their employment of novelty labels, either in general or by office sought.

Feminine issue coverage by female (<italic>M</italic> = 0.48, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.08) and male journalists (<italic>M</italic> = 0.35, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.83) did not differ significantly, <italic>t</italic>(551) = 1.08, <italic>ns</italic>. Also, feminine trait coverage by female (<italic>M</italic> = 0.20, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.50) and male journalists (<italic>M</italic> = 0.17, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.51) did not differ much, <italic>t</italic>(551) = 0.36, <italic>ns</italic>. The results showed that female and male journalists were not substantively different in their focus on feminine content coverage of these mixed-gender campaigns. In addition, masculine issue coverage by female (<italic>M</italic> = 0.80, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.31) and male journalists (<italic>M</italic> = 0.77, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.09) did not differ significantly, <italic>t</italic>(551) = 0.24, <italic>ns</italic>. Finally, masculine trait coverage by female (<italic>M</italic> = 0.33, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.68) and male journalists (<italic>M</italic> = 0.33, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.66) was virtually identical, <italic>t</italic>(551) = 0.09, <italic>ns</italic>. Therefore, female and male journalists were not different in their emphasis on masculine content coverage of the mixed-gender campaigns analyzed in this study.</p>
<p>However, when type of office was taken into account there were marked differences between female and male journalists regarding both feminine and masculine content. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077699012468695">Figure 1</xref> graphs the means for feminine issue and trait coverage by journalist gender and by office.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077699012468695">Figure 1</xref> shows that female and male journalists shifted their feminine content focus when covering mixed-gender campaigns for different types of offices. For both feminine issues and traits, female journalists focused more on feminine coverage than male journalists when reporting on mixed-gender Senate campaigns. However, when candidates ran for executive offices, different patterns emerged. Specifically, male journalists emphasized feminine issue coverage slightly more when candidates ran for governor, and there were no differences due to journalists’ gender when candidates competed for president. For feminine traits, there were no differences between journalists in gubernatorial coverage, but at the presidential level male journalists emphasized feminine traits more than female journalists. In general, female journalists emphasized feminine content more than male journalists when covering the more feminized office of Senate, and men narrowed this gap or surpassed women in such coverage of campaigns for governor and president.</p>
<p>To examine the significance of these results, univariate GLM analyses were run. The results indicated significant main and interaction effects. First, means differed significantly based on type of office sought for feminine issue (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and feminine trait (<italic>p</italic> = .006) coverage. Specifically, feminine issue coverage ranged from <italic>M</italic> = 0.40, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.96 for senator to <italic>M</italic> = 0.83, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.23 for governor to <italic>M</italic> = 0.19, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.50 for president, and feminine trait coverage ranged from <italic>M</italic> = 0.21, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.55 for senator to <italic>M</italic> = 0.04, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.20 for governor to <italic>M</italic> = 0.20, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.54 for president. As a result, the governor’s office received the most feminine <italic>issue</italic> coverage, but the least feminine <italic>trait</italic> coverage. Second, for feminine issues the interaction term between journalist gender and type of office approached significance, <italic>F</italic>(2, 552) = 1.71, <italic>p</italic> = .091, and it was significant for feminine traits, <italic>F</italic>(2, 552) = 2.37, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. Specifically, the means for feminine content coverage differed as candidates sought different types of offices, with female journalists including more feminine coverage in Senate races, and male journalists increasing their coverage of such content for executive offices.</p>
<p>To examine masculine content coverage, the means for masculine issues and traits by journalist gender and by office were graphed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1077699012468695">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1077699012468695">Figure 2</xref> revealed two patterns. First, female journalists focused more on masculine content coverage—for both issues and traits—than male journalists when covering candidates running for Senate. Second, when candidates ran for more executive offices, female journalists decreased their focus on masculine content, while men increased their focus on masculine content.</p>
<p>Univariate GLM revealed significant main and interaction effects. First, means differed significantly based on office sought for masculine issue coverage (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001): specifically, such issue coverage ranged from <italic>M</italic> = 0.99, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.36 for senator to <italic>M</italic> = 0.74, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.02 for governor to <italic>M</italic> = 0.62, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.92 for president. Therefore, when candidates campaigned for more executive and masculinized offices, journalists focused less and less on masculine issues. Next, the interactions between journalist gender and type of office were significant for both masculine issues, <italic>F</italic>(2, 552) = 4.48, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, and masculine traits <italic>F</italic>(2, 552) = 2.98, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. Specifically, when covering mixed-gender elections for more executive and masculinized offices, male journalists emphasized masculine content coverage more than female journalists.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study expands scholarship on gender, the news-making process, and political communication by addressing three important dynamics. First, this research builds on previous work by exploring the impact of journalist gender in gender-prominent political contexts that are becoming increasingly common. Second, this study analyzes the effects of journalist gender on distinctly gendered news content. Third, journalist gender is examined in combination with type of office sought to further understand its role in electoral news coverage. Across these, two important patterns emerged. In the aggregate, the individual-level influence of journalist gender did not produce any significant direct effects on gendered coverage. However, when type of office was considered, there were significant shifts in the focus of coverage by female and male journalists. Both of these patterns present several implications.</p>
<p>First, there was no significant relationship between journalist gender and gendered news coverage when coverage across offices was combined. This finding counters some research that has found a connection between journalist gender and general news coverage.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-1077699012468695">55</xref></sup> This study extends previous work and provides a more nuanced perspective by examining the relationship between journalist gender and news coverage in campaign news, and, more specifically, gender-prominent electoral news. Given that past work has found gender congruency between journalist gender and coverage at newspapers with a lower percentage of female editors, future research may benefit from examining the effects of both editor and journalist gender on news coverage in general and in gender-prominent contexts. Such work would be able to examine the effects of gender at the individual and organizational levels of influence.</p>
<p>Second, across different types of office there were notable differences in female and male journalists’ coverage patterns. In particular, there was a pattern of gender-congruence between journalist gender and type of office. Specifically, female journalists focused more on coverage of so-called feminized issues and traits than male journalists when covering the office of senator, whereas male journalists emphasized more so-called masculinized content coverage than female journalists when they covered the executive offices of governor and president. Therefore, there was a gender-congruent link among journalist gender, gendered news content, and gendered office when examining coverage of mixed-gender campaigns. This gender-congruent link has several implications.</p>
<p>First, journalists—consciously or not—upheld the gendering of political offices. One interpretation of this is that female journalists may have sought to aid female politicians for legislative offices, and male journalists may have sought to assist male politicians for executive offices. This would not be a positive outcome. The gendering of offices reinforces barriers to candidates seeking gender-<italic>in</italic>congruent offices. This creates a particular disadvantage for women who are already seen as novelties in politics because they have to overcome the stigmatism of their gender <italic>and</italic> the masculinization of executive offices if they want to win the offices of governor or president. The combination of these challenges for women may help explain why the highest proportion of women across the offices in this study are concentrated in legislative offices, with lower levels of representation historically and presently in executive offices.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-1077699012468695">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>Second, another implication of this gender-congruent link is that candidates, women in particular, have to develop a campaign strategy that either harnesses the advantageous effects of coverage or effectively maneuvers around such coverage. For example, research has shown that when female candidates emphasize feminine issues, they gain a strategic advantage with voters when they run for the legislative offices of the U.S. House and state legislature.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-1077699012468695">57</xref></sup> That means that women may gain a boost in the polls from the combination of female candidates <italic>and</italic> female journalists emphasizing more feminine content for legislative offices. However, the strategy for executive offices is more complex. If male journalists are traditionally more likely to cover elections and are focusing on more masculine content for executive offices, then women candidates must stress masculine issues and traits in their campaign communication to gain the attention of male journalists. That is, women candidates need to show competent handling of masculine issues and an authentic portrayal of masculine traits to show that they are a “fit” for executive office and its accompanying coverage. Recent work has shown that Democratic and Republican women running for governor were seen as more likeable, competent, and electorally successful when they emphasized both femininity and masculinity via issues and traits.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-1077699012468695">58</xref></sup> Therefore, women candidates do not need to abandon femininity to win. Rather, they may seek to emphasize masculinity, alongside femininity, while on the campaign trail to attract both voters and coverage. As a result, women candidates can be gender congruent for society’s expectations of women, but also gender congruent for society’s and male journalists’ expectations of executive offices.</p>
<p>These findings and implications are not without limitations. The split for journalist gender among the sample news articles heavily tilted to those written by men (84%). As mentioned previously, men significantly outnumber women in the newsroom (approximately 62% male).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-1077699012468695">59</xref></sup> To increase the generalizability of the findings in this study, it may be prudent to bring the proportions of articles by men and by women more in line with the profession’s current demographics. It is important to note, however, that the dominance of articles about political candidates written by men may serve as another indication of the two masculine domains of politics and journalism colliding, with male journalists tasked more often to write about the masculine world of politics. Future research could compare the percentage of electoral articles written by men only and by women only, and examine if the disparity found in the present study is a broader pattern.</p>
<p>Journalism and politics remain two highly masculinized, highly intertwined public domains. Men still write the majority of articles about the majority of men running for and winning political office. However, both domains are experiencing a slow, but persistent change. For example, in journalism Jill Abramson became the first female executive editor of the <italic>New York Times</italic> in 2011. In politics, Nancy Pelosi became the first female Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2007, and in the 2010 midterm elections three states elected their first female governor, including Susana Martinez, America’s first Hispanic female governor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-1077699012468695">60</xref></sup> Norms are evolving in both arenas, and the prevalence of gender-prominent contexts is increasing. To further examine these contexts, future studies need to incorporate office sought. It is impossible to determine whether journalists’ gender-congruent content focus or the precedence of women in certain offices ultimately led to the gendering of political offices. But given voters’ reliance on news coverage to learn about politicians and formulate vote choices, it is imperative that journalists recognize and reconcile how their gendered news coverage contributes to the gendering of political offices, and the potential gender boundaries such coverage may present for women seeking to run for and win executive offices.</p>

<p>Scholars characterize certain political offices as masculine and feminine, but it is important to note that there are exceptions to the gendering of offices. For example, legislative offices are not strictly communal because legislative bodies such as Congress have internal hierarchy via positions such as Speaker of the House and various committee chairperson positions, and therefore there are top-down power dynamics at play. Despite this hierarchy, public perceptions of the perceived or abstract tasks and responsibilities of these offices, versus concrete, day-to-day actions, perpetuate the social construction of masculine and feminine offices.</p>

<p>The elections, in order of office, and time frames were as follows. For Dole, campaigns of focus were (1) her 2002 general election for senator of North Carolina against Erskine Bowles and (2) from her announcement of an official presidential exploratory committee for president in March 1999 to her formal withdrawal in October 1999, against George W. Bush and Al Gore. McCaskill’s two elections were (1) the 2006 general election for senator of Missouri against Jim Talent and (2) the 2004 general election for governor of Missouri against Matt Blunt. For Clinton the focus was (1) the 2000 general election for senator of New York against Rick Lazio and (2) from her announcement of an official presidential exploratory committee for president in January 2007 to her formal withdrawal in June 2008, against Barack Obama and John McCain. Campaigns for Sarah Palin were (1) her 2006 general election for governor of Alaska against Tony Knowles and (2) the 2008 general election for vice president against Barack Obama and Joseph Biden. Note that Elizabeth Dole’s announcement of an exploratory committee was selected as the start date because she left the 2000 presidential election before formally announcing her candidacy. To create a more comparative design, Clinton’s official announcement of an exploratory committee was selected as the start date for the 2008 presidential election, and in that announcement she also proclaimed her official bid for candidacy. In addition, only one or two men were included per election, as opposed to every man who entered the election. This approach ensured a more constant and comparative data set of news coverage. For Dole and Clinton, the eventual general election nominees were selected.</p>

<p>Examples of issue and trait coverage are as follows: Feminine Issue (education), “Jim Talent plans on increasing funding for schools in an effort to get more students reading at the appropriate grade level”; Feminine Trait (congenial), “McCain is a very likable guy, and that will carry him a long way”; Masculine Issue (crime), “Under Claire McCaskill’s stewardship, Jackson County’s response to the inter-related problems of drug abuse and crime became a model for the rest of the nation”; Masculine Trait (aggressive), “Mrs. Clinton’s verbal grenades showed a side of her we’ve never seen, more aggressive than she’s ever been.”</p>

<p>Scott’s pi for the rest of the variables of interest were as follows: novelty labels π = .96, feminine issues π = .95, feminine traits π = .89, and masculine traits π = .82. According to Krippendorff, acceptable reliability coefficients for Krippendorff’s alpha (α) are appropriate for Scott’s pi (π), and coefficients above .80 are sufficiently reliable to draw conclusions, and coefficients between .67 and .80 are reliable enough to draw tentative conclusions. Therefore, the intercoder coefficients reached acceptable levels for analysis.
