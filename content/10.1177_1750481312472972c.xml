<p>Have you ever walked out of a movie theatre feeling vaguely let down by simplistic or anachronistic scripts, paltry character development, cloned extras, ponderously simple documentaries or seemingly endless animated scenes washed out by samey computer-generated greyish blue? The explanation, according to Kirby’s monograph, is that our cultural texts are evolving into ‘digimodern’ texts characterized by onwardness, haphazardness, evanescence, redefined textual roles, evolving authorship, fluid textual boundaries, electronic digitality and evincing aesthetics of earnestness, apparent realness and infantilism.</p>
<p>While these trends have brought with them the opportunity to make digimodern masterpieces such as Peter Jackson’s <italic>The Lord of the Rings</italic> and bring to filmic life children’s classics including C.S. Lewis’s <italic>Narnia</italic>, the more videogame-style and comic-book movies may lack adult appeal.</p>
<p>A good theory explains something in the ‘real’ world and <italic>Digimodernism</italic> does exactly that. Kirby, and he is not alone, argues that postmodernism is dead or dying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750481312472972">Hutcheon, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1750481312472972">Kirby, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1750481312472972">Vermeulen and Van den Akker, 2010</xref>). Kirby proposes that the new paradigm is digimodernism, which explains the impact of computer technology on cultural products from personal communication to blockbuster movies, from popular television to radio programming.</p>
<p>For examples of pure digimodernism, Kirby takes us to television where ‘we’ now participate in <italic>Big Brother, Pop Idol</italic> and <italic>Strictly Come Dancing</italic>; to Web 2.0 where ‘we’ contribute to Wikipedia, social networking sites, blogs and micro-blogs; to videogames such as <italic>Grand Theft Auto IV</italic> and <italic>Final Fantasy XII</italic> where ‘we’ customize our characters and equipment; and to radio where ‘we’ talk back.</p>
<p>After a brief introduction and a solidly argued and excellently supported discussion of ‘The Arguable Death of Postmodernism’, Kirby presents and supports his case for digimodernism in five richly illustrated chapters. An intriguing essay on pseudoautism, grand narratives and the death of competence draws the themes together and he closes with a very brief conclusion. Supporting material includes 12 pages of useful notes, a six-page bibliography and an 11-page index.</p>
<p>Chapter One, ‘The Arguable Death of Postmodernism’, combines an entertaining explanation of how the arrival of postmodernism in children’s films signals the end of that era with a scholarly discussion of key threats to postmodernism and rival theories to digimodernism. Kirby argues that <italic>Toy Story</italic>, for all its postmodernism, is a landmark in digimodernism because it is the first completely computer-generated movie. Kirby then evaluates how postmodernism was challenged by Dogme 95 (an avant-garde film-making movement which eschews the use of special effects), the New Puritans (a literary movement espousing simplicity) and the Stuckists (who proposed that postmodernism’s failure to address important human issues left it to be over-ridden by ‘remodernism’). Dogme 95 paved the way for docusoaps, the YouTube boom and the aesthetic of the apparently real. The Stuckists proposed that postmodernism’s failure to address important human issues left it to be over-ridden by ‘remodernism’. Kirby argues that something ‘wrenchingly huge’ was required to sweep postmodernism away and that this something is digital technology.</p>
<p>In this chapter Kirby also evaluates rival successors to postmodernism thus: performatism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1750481312472972">Eshelman, 2000/2001</xref>) is poorly defined and backward looking; hypermodernity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1750481312472972">Lipovetsky, 2005</xref>) provides some important insights on hyperconsumerism; supermodernity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1750481312472972">Crowther, 2003</xref>) is consonant with digimodernism; and critical realism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1750481312472972">Lopez and Potter, 2001</xref>) insists on the possibility of truth and reality but dates back to the 1970s. Not apparent here are Nicolas Bourriaud’s ‘altermodern’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1750481312472972">2009</xref>), Robert Samuels’s ‘automodernity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1750481312472972">2008</xref>) (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1750481312472972">Kirby, 2010</xref>) and metamodernism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1750481312472972">Vermeulen and Van den Akker, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Chapter One concludes with a table suggesting that the fall off from the postmodernist film triumphs of the late 1980s and 1990s to the ‘recent failure’ of certain postmodern films of the 2000s (e.g. <italic>The Matrix Reloaded</italic>, 2003; <italic>Lunar Park</italic>, 2005; <italic>Molière</italic>, 2007) provides evidence that postmodernism is dead. While Kirby makes a good case, he has recently conceded that postmodernism lives on in works such as Jasper Fforde’s novels and <italic>Family Guy</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1750481312472972">Kirby, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Chapter Two focuses on the digimodernist text, tracing an evolution from an author-led textuality characterized by fixed meaning, through post-structuralism’s death of the author (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1750481312472972">Barthes, 1977</xref>), to the restoration and revalorization of the author(s). Authorship is often multiple (Wikipedia), interactive (<italic>Big Brother</italic>, talkback, blog) and creative (YouTube), but it can also be anonymous (Wikipedia), hierarchical and closely managed (moderated chatrooms, talkback). Here, Kirby explains digimodernist traits thus: onwardness – as in works remain in progress; haphazardness – things can go in any direction; evanescent – transient; and redefined textual roles – the blurring of boundaries between reader, author and producer. Here, one feels the lack of engagement with concepts such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1750481312472972">Toffler’s (1981)</xref> ‘prosumer’ and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1750481312472972">Bruns’ (2007)</xref> ‘produser’; instead Kirby rapidly disposes of the popular ‘user’, toys with ‘viewser’ and concludes the right word has not yet been coined.</p>
<p>Chapter Three, ‘A Prehistory of Digimodernism’, identifies precursors of digimodernism, such as industrial porn with its apparent realness; Ceefax, which provided onward digital news from the 1970s until 2012; the TV show <italic>Whose Line is it Anyway?</italic>, notable for its haphazardness and multiple authors; house music’s dependence on technological change (as opposed to its postmodernist sampling); BS Johnson’s boxed book <italic>The Unfortunates</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1750481312472972">1969</xref>) in its haphazard nonlinearity; and the interactivity of pantomime.</p>
<p>In Chapter Four, ‘Digimodernism and Web 2.0’, Kirby outlines how the forms of Web 2.0 lie at the heart of digimodernism: onwardness is found in chatrooms, message boards, blogs and Wikipedia; (pseudo)anonymity can be found in chatrooms, Wikipedia and YouTube; multiple authors create blogs, Wikipedia, YouTube and Facebook; interactivity is found in Facebook, blogs and chatrooms; evanescence is in Wikipedia’s updated entries; and digitization of (social) life is central to Facebook’s mimicry of friendship.</p>
<p>Chapter Five, ‘Digimodernist Aesthetics’, argues that the aesthetics of digimodernism is characterized by the dominance of children’s stories, the apparently real, earnestness and a move towards ‘the endless narrative’ (p. 155). Children’s stories emphasize children’s experiences, pre-democratic social structures with kings and queens, romanticization of dinosaurs, pirates and other violent mythical creatures; pre-literate story telling (comics, cartoons, videogames); obscuring of sexual reproduction, bypassing the world of work, sporadic abandonment of the laws of nature, and a lack of interest in inner thoughts and psychological plausibility. Kirby argues that apparently real culture is often manipulated but gains its appeal from the ‘real’ elements. Authenticity is demanded in internet creations such as Wikipedia, he says. Being engulfed in the present means for Kirby that historically set productions make little or no attempt to replicate dialogue or mores of the past. In <italic>Digimodernism</italic>, Kirby tells us, irony gives way to earnestness, sages such as <italic>Lord of the Ring</italic>’s Gandalf and <italic>Harry Potter</italic>’s Dumbledore dish out wisdom, while ‘experts’ guide us through documentaries and reality shows. Kirby rightly points to the endlessness manifested in narratives in books, soaps and serials which always leave the gate open to the sequel.</p>
<p>Chapter Six, ‘Digimodernist Culture’, identifies the videogame as the foundation stone of digimodernism and a new form of textuality. Kirby argues computer-generated images (CGI) drive the infantilization of movies and collapse film genres down to three main types: apocalyptic (Emmerich’s 2004 film <italic>The Day After Tomorrow</italic>), historical (Stone’s 2004 movie <italic>Alexander</italic>) and myth (Peterson’s 2004 epic <italic>Troy</italic>). For Kirby, George Lucas’s original <italic>Star Wars</italic> trilogy (1977, 1980, 1983) is postmodern, and his new trilogy (1999, 2002, 2005), digimodern. Sommers’s <italic>The Mummy</italic> (1999) begins as a postmodern romp and ends in rampaging digimodernism. Peter Jackson’s <italic>The Lord of the Rings</italic> is a fully fledged digimodern masterpiece. If CGI films fail it is because they lack social relevance and a ‘critical engagement with the world’ (p. 182).</p>
<p>In Chapter Seven, ‘Toward a Digimodernist Society?’, Kirby does not argue that digimodernism is a distinct era cleanly separated from previous eras, but he does argue that pseudoautism is as central to digimodernism as neurosis was to modernism and schizophrenia to postmodernism. The use of the language of autism does take some getting used to and may offend people with autism or Asperger’s or their families, but Kirby uses the concept as a scalpel to dissect how pseudoautistic traits counter cultural and social forces pervading contemporary Western society. Sticking to the term ‘pseudoautism’ would have kept this on more politically correct ground, but he does warn readers that he is using the term as a short-hand term and no offence is intended. Ascribing autistic traits is driven by technologies which de-socialize and by the normalizing of sociopathic characteristics in popular culture. He argues that ‘autism’ counters overpopulation by seeking solitude, insecurity by favouring routine, slick social skills and social kissing by valuing authenticity and reserve, multiplicity of views by favouring objectivity, and anti-science by a love of facts.</p>
<p>Chapter Seven proposes that contemporary society’s grand narratives are religion and consumerism. However, according to Kirby, religion poisons through its links to terror, superstition and ignorance and its stand against freedom, education and democracy; while consumerism is an overwhelming ideology which reframes lives, homes and selves as commodities and consumers.</p>
<p>In his one-page conclusion, ‘Endless’, Kirby questions what we will make of digimodernism.</p>
<p>While <italic>Digimodernism</italic> is tinged with an almost curmudgeonly critique of contemporary attitudes to education, echoing the centuries old cry of ‘Youth of today!’, and a scathing condemnation of consumerism as the new dominant ideology, it provides a convincing explanation for the plethora of cultural phenomena and practices Kirby groups under digimodernism. In a second edition, I would look forward to a discussion of the implications for individual identity and privacy (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750481312472972">Pariser, 2011</xref>), an even more comprehensive index and Kirby’s interpretations of <italic>Avatar, Cowboys and Aliens</italic>, Facebook, Twitter and <italic>Minecraft</italic>.</p>
<p>Kirby’s digimodernism has been noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1750481312472972">Vermeulen and van den Akker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1750481312472972">Viires and Sarapik, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1750481312472972">Waxler and Hall, 2011</xref>) and supported by some scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1750481312472972">Viires and Sarapik, 2010</xref>). While it has yet to be widely accepted as <italic>the</italic> successor to postmodernism, Kirby’s concepts and examples offer a challenging new lens through which to investigate the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1750481312472972">Barthes, 1977</xref>).</p>
