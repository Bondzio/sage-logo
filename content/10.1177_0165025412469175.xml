<abstract>
<p>Available evidence indicates that experience with one face from a specific age group improves face-processing abilities if acquired within the first 3 years of life but not in adulthood. In the current study, we tested whether the effects of early experience endure at age 6 and whether the first 3 years of life are a sensitive period for the effects of experience on perceptual learning. To this end, we compared the effects of early (before age 3) and later (after age 5) experience with one younger sibling on 6-year-olds’ processing of adult and infant faces. Unlike children without siblings, those with a younger sibling were equally skilled at differentiating faces of the two ages and showed a generalized inversion effect for both face ages, irrespective of when exposure to the sibling face began. Results indicate that face representation retains flexibility in response to extensive exposure to one facial identity even after age 3, and perceptual learning engendered by early experience continues to affect face-processing skills at 6 years.</p>

<p>Adult face-processing skills exhibit strong biases, such that discrimination and recognition are superior for specific categories of faces than for others, with relevant categories including species (see review in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0165025412469175">Dufour, Pascalis, &amp; Petit, 2006</xref>), race (see review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0165025412469175">Meissner &amp; Brigham, 2001</xref>), gender (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0165025412469175">Lewin &amp; Herlitz, 2002</xref>), and age (see review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0165025412469175">Rhodes &amp; Anastasi, 2012</xref>). Evidence converges to show that, across the lifespan, these face-processing biases are under environmental control. One way in which this control occurs is through natural discrepancies in the amount of differential experience with various face types to which virtually every individual is exposed from the time of birth onwards.</p>
<p>For example, developmental studies on race biases have shown that between birth and 3 months of age, infants develop a familiarity preference for faces of a specific race only if they are raised in a mono-racial environment, or if the proportional size of the encountered racial groups within the infants’ social environment is unequal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0165025412469175">Bar-Haim, Ziv, Lamy, &amp; Hodes, 2006</xref>). Similarly, changes in the proportional size of racial groups occurring as a consequence of children’s cross-cultural adoption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0165025412469175">Sangrigoli, Pallier, Argenti, Ventureyra, &amp; de Schonen, 2005</xref>) or adults’ migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0165025412469175">Hancock &amp; Rhodes, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0165025412469175">Michel, Caldara, &amp; Rossion, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0165025412469175">Rhodes et al., 2009</xref>) can mitigate or even reverse the processing bias for faces of the participants’ own race.</p>
<p>This evidence is evocative of a face representation, which constantly adapts to reflect the individual’s social and perceptual experience throughout the lifespan. Nevertheless, little is known about whether the magnitude of such adaptation varies across the lifespan. Recently, research on age-related face processing biases has provided promising contributions to the answering of this question. Age biases across the lifespan can be conceived as arising from the constant adaptation of face representation to reflect the predominant age morphologies of the faces that are most common within the individual’s social environment, which often, but not always, happen to be peer faces (e.g., He, Ebner &amp; Johnson, 2011; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0165025412469175">Hills &amp; Lewis, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0165025412469175">Macchi Cassia, 2011</xref>). For example, in the case of young adults, social and perceptual experience is heavily biased toward same-aged individuals, unless living conditions and/or working environment induce frequent contact with other age groups (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0165025412469175">de Heering &amp; Rossion, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0165025412469175">Macchi Cassia, Picozzi, Kuefner &amp; Casati, 2009</xref>). Instead, it has been suggested that young children’s social experience is more biased toward caregivers and other adult individuals than peers, although under particular conditions it may extend as well to other-age individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0165025412469175">Macchi Cassia, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0165025412469175">Scherf &amp; Scott, 2012</xref>). Accordingly, there is good evidence that younger adult faces are typically over-represented in face space of both young adults and 3-year-old children, as participants in both age groups manifest enhanced discrimination abilities and greater expertise when processing these faces in comparison to other-age faces (adults: e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0165025412469175">Anastasi &amp; Rhodes, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0165025412469175">Ebner &amp; Johnson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0165025412469175">He et al., 2011</xref>; Kuefner, Macchi Cassia, Picozzi &amp; Bricolo, 2008; 3-year-olds: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0165025412469175">Macchi Cassia, Kuefner, Picozzi, &amp; Vescovo, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0165025412469175">Macchi Cassia, Pisacane, &amp; Gava, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0165025412469175">Proietti, Pisacane, &amp; Macchi Cassia, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>However, there is also evidence that, in adults as well as in children, exposure to multiple faces from other age groups occurring as part of the individual’s social or working experience can mitigate or eliminate the processing bias toward young adult faces. Adult studies showed that the bias was absent or smaller in maternity-ward nurses (Macchi Cassia, Picozzi et al., 2009; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0165025412469175">Yovel et al., 2012</xref>), preschool teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0165025412469175">de Heering &amp; Rossion, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0165025412469175">Harrison &amp; Hole, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0165025412469175">Kuefner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0165025412469175">Kuefner, Macchi Cassia, Vescovo, &amp; Picozzi, 2010</xref>) and retirement-home nurses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0165025412469175">Proietti et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, a recent study with children showed that the bias was absent in 3-year-olds who experienced extensive contact with elderly adults within their rearing environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0165025412469175">Proietti et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, these findings indicate that perceptual experience acquired in early childhood (that is, the first 3 years of life) and adulthood with multiple identities from a specific age group has comparable effects on the quantitative and/or qualitative properties of face-representational space supporting face-discrimination skills. In adults as well as in young children, the existing face norm can adapt, or a new norm can be created, to incorporate the properties of the newly encountered face-age group.</p>
<p>This view, however, would prove partial if not complemented with the results of a series of studies that explored the effects of experience with one facial identity from a certain face-age group, as is the case of 3-year-old children who, from their time of their birth, have been exposed to the face of a younger or an older sibling (Macchi Cassia, Kuefner et al., 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0165025412469175">Macchi Cassia et al., 2012</xref>) or adult women who gave birth to their first child (Macchi Cassia, Kuefner et al., 2009). Continuous exposure to <italic>one</italic> identity of a certain facial type can be thought as providing the perceiver with a more subtle type of experience in comparison to extensive exposure to <italic>multiple</italic> identities, because it does not supply information on the physiognomic cues that are more critical to make perceptual discriminations among exemplars of that specific facial type. Results suggest that this type of experience is capable to affect face-processing skills in 3-year-old children but not in adults.</p>
<p>In two different studies, Macchi Cassia and colleagues (Macchi Cassia, Kuefner et al., 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0165025412469175">Macchi Cassia et al., 2012</xref>) tested 3-year-old children with and without a younger or an older sibling for their ability to discriminate among individual adult and infant or child faces, and used the size of the inversion effect for each face-age group as a marker of perceptual expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0165025412469175">Yin, 1969</xref>). Results showed that children with a younger sibling were equally skilled at discriminating adult and infant faces, and exhibited an inversion effect of comparable magnitude for both face types (Macchi Cassia, Kuefner et al., 2009, Exp. 1). Likewise, 3-year-olds with an older sibling, unlike first-born children, showed comparable discrimination abilities and a generalized inversion effect for adult and child faces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0165025412469175">Macchi Cassia et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The authors concluded that the extensive experience acquired within the first 3 years of life, with one infant or child face, is sufficient to modulate the tuning of the face representational space, so as to allow children to efficiently process previously unlearned faces from the same age group. Importantly, the authors also showed that this same type of experience acquired in adulthood through mothers’ exposure to the face of their first-born child was ineffective, since these mothers performed as poorly as non-mother age-matched controls at discriminating infant faces, and did not show any inversion effect for infant faces (Macchi Cassia, Kuefner et al., 2009, Exp. 2).</p>
<p>Together, these findings suggest that young children can bootstrap perceptual learning of a specific face age group from extensive exposure to one identity from that group, whereas adults cannot. To our knowledge, this is the only evidence of the existence of age of acquisition effects within the face-processing domain, which leaves a number of questions unanswered. In particular, two questions are the focus of the current investigation. The first relates to the existence of a sensitive period for the effects of experience with one face on perceptual learning. Infant studies have shown that the first year of life is of particular relevance for the tuning of perceptual discrimination abilities to the face subtypes that are most frequently experienced (perceptual narrowing; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0165025412469175">Scott, Pascalis, &amp; Nelson, 2007</xref>). Studies on the effects of sibling experience show that the face processing system retains flexibility beyond this time frame, at least into the second year, since exposure to the younger sibling face for the children tested by Macchi Cassia, Kuefner et al. (2009, Exp. 1) began after the first year of life. Nevertheless, these studies leave open the question of whether such flexibility drops abruptly after the end of the second year, or decreases smoothly over the lifespan up to the point of eventually hindering perceptual learning from one facial identity in adulthood.</p>
<p>The second question is whether early experience with one facial identity from a certain age group has any long-lasting effect on face processing skills. Children studies on the effects of sibling experience tested the contiguous effects of this type of experience. One study with adults showed that the effects of sibling experience do not persist into adulthood in the absence of re-exposure to the original experience. Adults who had a younger sibling within their first 3 years of life and no further experience with infants over the years performed just like age-matched controls without younger siblings when asked to discriminate upright and inverted adult and infant faces (Macchi Cassia, Kuefner et al., 2009, Exp. 3). In light of this evidence, it would be important to ascertain whether the effects of perceptual learning engendered by exposure to the sibling face, which are visible at 3 years, endure any time after this time frame.</p>
<p>The present study aimed to address both these questions by comparing discrimination and matching abilities for upright and inverted adult and newborn infant faces in three groups of 6-year-old children. One group (no exposure) included children who had no younger siblings and limited face-to-face contact with young infants. The two other groups included children who have had daily exposure to an infant face through the presence of a younger sibling in their home. For one group (early-exposure group), exposure provided by the sibling’s birth began <italic>before</italic> the end of the third year of life, and for the other (later-exposure group), exposure began <italic>after</italic> the fifth year. By testing children in the later-exposure group, we explored the contiguous effects of later-occurring experience with an infant face. By testing children in the early-exposure group, we examined the lasting effects of early exposure to an infant face in the presence of limited re-exposure to the original experience. In fact, it is important to note that somewhere during the course of infancy, an infant face is no longer a newborn face. Although we cannot pinpoint where that change takes place, it is reasonable to assume that continued exposure to the sibling’s face provided children in the early-exposure group with less and less experience with a newborn face, as the face continued to grow into an infant face or a toddler face. Based on these arguments, we argued that the comparison between the performances of the two sibling groups would provide evidence for the differential effects of early versus later acquired experience on children’s perceptual learning.</p>
<p>Because we aimed to compare our results with those obtained in earlier studies with 3-year-old children, we used the same stimuli and the same delayed two-alternative forced choice matching-to-sample task used by Macchi Cassia, Kuefner et al. (2009), in which children had to match a briefly presented target face to two simultaneously presented test faces appearing shortly after the target. Like in earlier studies, to contrast the perceptual processing strategies evoked by adult and infant faces in each group of children, stimuli were presented in both the upright and inverted orientation. Because the inversion effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0165025412469175">Yin, 1969</xref>) is taken as a measure of the ability to extract the relevant configural and/or featural (see review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0165025412469175">Maurer, Le Grand, &amp; Mondloch, 2002</xref>) cues needed for upright-face recognition, its size was used as a measure of children’s expertise at processing faces.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 57 children, 6 to 7 years old (37 females; mean age = 6 years 4 months, range = 5; 5–7; 6) participated in the study, divided into three groups according to whether or not they had a younger sibling and their age at the time of the sibling’s birth. The no-exposure group included 22 children without younger siblings, the early-exposure group included 22 children with one younger sibling born <italic>before</italic> the children turned 3 years, and the later-exposure group included 13 children with one younger sibling born <italic>after</italic> the children turned 5 years (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0165025412469175">Table 1</xref>). All children had limited face-to-face contact with infants other than their younger sibling, as assessed through a purpose-made questionnaire administered to the parents. The questionnaire included specific enquiries aimed at assessing if participants have, or have had contact with infants of relatives, friends or acquaintances. In each case, if the response was positive, parents were asked to specify the time period and the situation in which the child was in contact with infants and the frequency, during this period, with which they had contact (e.g., “daily short visits to the neighbors’ new baby during the past year,” “one afternoon per month during the past 6 months with my sister’s new baby”). The information gathered through parents’ responses were used to select those children who had null or sporadic face-to-face contact with infants. For the purposes of the selection criteria, an “infant” was defined as being 6 months of age or less. Children were all from middle-class Caucasian families and had normal or corrected vision, as reported from parents and class teachers. Parents signed a written informed consent, children provided their verbal assent. An additional seven children were excluded from the sample due to failure to complete the task.</p>

<title>Stimuli</title>
<p>Stimuli were 24 gray-scale photographs of adult (20- to 30-years-old) female faces and 24 gray-scale photographs of newborn infant faces (after Macchi Cassia, Kuefner et al., 2009). Each photograph displayed a full-front neutral expression (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0165025412469175">Figure 1</xref>). Faces within each age category were cropped to be the same size and pasted on a gray background. To reflect the natural differences in the size of real adult and infant faces, we cropped the photographs so that the adult stimuli were slightly larger than the infant stimuli. An attempt was made to pair faces based on subjective criteria of luminance and overall similarity, so as to generate 12 pairs for each face age. An additional four face images were used in practice trials. Inverted stimuli were created by a 180° rotation of each face.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were tested individually on a portable computer using a delayed two-alternative forced-choice matching-to-sample task. The experiment began with four practice trials (two for each face age); on each trial the target face appeared in the centre of the screen for 2000 ms, followed by a 1000 ms blank interstimulus interval and then two probe stimuli, the target face and a novel face, that appeared side by side until the subject responded by pressing a key on the keyboard corresponding to the side of the screen on which the target appeared. The target and probes appeared in the same orientation and the left or right position of the target and novel face was counterbalanced across trials. The target and novel status of each face within the test pairs was kept constant across participants, whereas it was counterbalanced across orientations, so that each face appeared as the target in the upright orientation and as the novel face in the inverted orientation. Trials from each face age and orientation condition were presented in blocks. Participants completed one block of 12 trials for each condition (total of 48 trials). Upright and inverted trials were administered in two sessions separated by an interval of 15 minutes. To make the task more child-friendly, upright trials were presented first, whereas face age was alternated between blocks. The age of the faces in the first block was counterbalanced across subjects. Response accuracy was recorded as the dependent variable.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Accuracy in all conditions was significantly above chance for all groups (all <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .001). A preliminary Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) revealed no main effect or interactions involving the factor order (adult face first, infant face first). Therefore, data were collapsed across this factor in the subsequent three-way ANOVA with group (no-exposure, early-exposure, later-exposure) as the between-subjects factor and face age (adult, infant) and orientation (upright, inverted) as within-subjects factors. The analysis revealed a significant main effect of orientation <italic>F</italic>(1,54) = 97.89, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .644, and a marginal effect of face age <italic>F</italic>(1,54) = 3.96, <italic>p </italic>= 0.052, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .068, which were both qualified by a significant Orientation × Face Age interaction, <italic>F</italic>(1,54) = 7.55, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .123. Most crucially, there was also a significant three-way interaction between the factors face age, orientation and group, F(1,54) = 3.443, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .113, indicating that accuracy for adult and infant faces in the two orientation conditions differed for the three groups of children. To further explore this interaction, separate 2 × 2 ANOVAs were conducted for each group.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The comparison between performance of children in the no-exposure group and children in the two exposure groups showed that experience with a younger sibling influenced the extent to which children showed greater expertise at processing adult versus infant faces. Notably, perceptual learning engendered by sibling experience affected children’s performance to the same extent irrespective of whether experience initiated before or after the end of the third year of life. In fact, children without a younger sibling were better able to differentiate among upright adult faces than among upright infant faces and to extract the relevant featural/configural cues necessary for efficient face recognition from adult faces, as revealed by the inversion effect being specific for these faces. In contrast, children in the early-exposure group, as well as those in the later-exposure group, were equally able to differentiate among upright adult and infant faces, and exhibited inversion effects of comparable magnitude for both face ages.</p>
<p>These findings replicate earlier demonstrations of the effects of sibling experience on children’s face processing abilities (Macchi Cassia, Kuefner et al., 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0165025412469175">Macchi Cassia et al., 2012</xref>) and extend such demonstrations in two ways. Firstly, they show that perceptual learning induced by early exposure to one sibling face occurring before age 3 continues to affect children’s performance into the sixth year of life. In fact, because children were selected for having limited experience with infants, apart from that provided by their younger sibling, it is reasonable to assume that the expertise at processing newborn infant faces manifested by children in the early-exposure group originated from the exposure they had to the younger sibling’s face, which, for all children in this group, occurred before the end of the third year.</p>
<p>Secondly, current results extend previous evidence by showing that children remain capable to perceptually learn from the encounter with one sibling face even after the third year, at least until age 6. It is possible that motivational factors arising from becoming brother/sister to a younger sibling may have played an important role in enhancing older children’s interest in infant faces and consequently in boosting their ability to learn from exposure to one facial identity. However, this hypothesis seems hardly reconcilable with existent evidence that adult mothers cannot bootstrap perceptual learning of infant faces from continuous exposure to their baby’s face (Macchi Cassia, Kuefner et al., 2009). Indeed, differences in the pattern of evidence obtained by earlier studies with adults and 3-year-old children were taken as suggestive of the existence of age of acquisition effects within the face-processing domain, with a loss of plasticity in response to experience with one facial identity occurring between early childhood and adulthood. Current findings add an important piece of evidence to this picture, suggesting that no decrease in plasticity occurs during childhood before age 6, as exposure to the younger sibling face beginning after the fifth year improved 6-year-olds’ sensitivity to the featural/configural cues embedded in infant faces, allowing efficient discrimination of these type of faces.</p>
<p>The strength of this conclusion hinges on the assumption that the experience that the 6-year-olds in the two exposure groups acquired with their younger sibling was comparable. As already discussed, we are confident that this was the case because children in the current study were tested with newborn infant faces, and somewhere during the course of infancy an infant face is no longer a newborn face. Therefore, the more experience participants in the early- exposure group had with their sibling, the farther away from a <italic>newborn</italic> face the sibling’s face became. Nevertheless, differences did exist between the two exposure groups in the temporal gap between the onset of sibling experience and the time of test, which was much shorted for the later-exposure group than for the early-exposure group. This may have affected the results, as children in the later-exposure group may have benefitted from their recent exposure to the newborn sibling's face. Future investigations should attempt to more closely match all quantifiable aspects of experience to ensure that the pattern of group differences is truly informative about the existence (or the lack of) age-of-acquisition effects.</p>
