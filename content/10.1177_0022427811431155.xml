<title>Objectives:</title>
<p>To examine possible effects of housing foreclosure on neighborhood levels of crime and to assess temporal lags in the impact of foreclosure on neighborhood levels of crime.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Longitudinal data from Glendale, Arizona, a city at the epicenter of the nation’s foreclosure problem. The authors rely on four data sources: (1) foreclosure data, (2) computer-aided dispatch (CAD)/police records management system (RMS) data, (3) U.S. census and census estimate data, and (4) land use data.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Foreclosure has a short-term impact, typically no more than 3 months, on total crime, property crime, and violent crime, and no more than 4 months for drug crime.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>Foreclosures do not have a long-term effect on crime in general, and have different, though modest effects on different types of crime. The relationship between foreclosure and crime is not linear in nature but rather is characterized by a temporal, short-term flux in crime.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since the first reports of the housing crisis (HC), the media, local law enforcement agencies, and community groups have been issuing concerns about the detrimental impact the HC will have on crime rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022427811431155">Mummolo and Brubaker 2008</xref>). These concerns are based on the belief that foreclosures contribute to certain neighborhood social conditions, such as a reduction in the number of residents or increases in disorder, that ultimately lead to crime. This link is so strong in the minds of the public that nationally, by 2006, well before the HC began, 27 cities had adopted programs aimed at reducing foreclosed, vacant, or abandoned buildings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022427811431155">US Mayors Report 2006</xref>). However, in empirical literature, only the association between foreclosure and crime has been affirmed, though this literature is in its infancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022427811431155">Baumer, Wolff, Arnio 2010</xref>). Several criminological traditions, such as social disorganization, disorder, or routine activities theory, can be invoked to support the idea that foreclosures and vacant buildings are related to crime. A few studies have found an association between foreclosures, vacancy, and crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022427811431155">Krivo and Peterson 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022427811431155">Spelman 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022427811431155">Taylor 2001</xref>). The presence of the association is not necessarily in question. The simple association between foreclosure and crime is not what communities and cities act upon—it is the idea that foreclosures cause crime that drives policy. The hole in this literature is a test of the causal pathway that is implicit in both criminological theory and anecdotal evidence: Do foreclosures <italic>cause</italic> crime? We can contextualize this question for the current HC as: has the increase in foreclosures caused by the HC generated additional crime in communities experiencing foreclosures?</p>
<p>To our knowledge, no research to date has been able to answer the above questions. The paucity of research on this topic has not been the consequence of lack of curiosity but rather has been the consequence of a lack of available data. Most studies of foreclosure and crime have experienced one or more of the following limitations: (1) the data used were cross-sectional, (2) the ecological unit used did not adequately represent a neighborhood, and (3) only the most serious crimes had been correlated to foreclosure. Cross-sectional data enable only a glimpse of the relationship between foreclosures and crime—while the association between the two can be established, the causal pathway cannot. Additionally, given that foreclosures and crime are both highly ecological phenomena that are unevenly distributed, studying this relationship at the county or zip code level might mask some of the nuances of the phenomenon. Gathering data at lower ecological levels that would control for the local variation in foreclosure and crime has proven to be difficult. Last, only examining the relationship between serious crime and foreclosure leaves much of the theories behind foreclosure and crime unexplored. Consequently, due to methodological limitations, the causal relationship between foreclosures and crime has yet to be adequately tested.</p>
<p>In this article, we present a longitudinal study of foreclosure rates and crime in a city in Arizona, a state that experienced the brunt of the HC. In fact, about 62 percent of foreclosures have been concentrated in four states: Arizona, California, Florida, and Nevada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022427811431155">Lucy and Herlitz 2009</xref>), making the Phoenix metropolitan area a natural choice for studying the HC. We ask: in neighborhoods, does the increase in foreclosure result in additional neighborhood crime? Also, how is the relationship between foreclosure and crime conditioned by the HC? Our monthly data span from 2003 to 2008—encapsulating much of the HC. In the section below, we discuss several of the hypothesized relationships between foreclosure and crime. We then present the findings of prior research on the relationship between foreclosure and crime and discuss the limitations to this body of work. Next, we present our methodology, analysis plan, and results. We conclude the article by discussing our findings in the context of the existing literature, criminological theories, and policy implications.</p>
<sec id="section2-0022427811431155">
<title>Hypothesized Relationships between Foreclosure and Crime</title>
<p>Much of the concern regarding foreclosure and crime is less about the act of foreclosure itself, and more about the neighborhood conditions that a foreclosure is believed to create. Foreclosures are thought to compromise the social environment of a neighborhood, triggering crime. Below we detail the primary theories and demographic circumstances that assist in explaining the relationship between foreclosures and the neighborhood social environment, and how that relationship may trigger crime.</p>
<p>One of the most influential theories addressing the impact neighborhood environment has on crime is broken windows theory. In the seminal essay “Broken Windows” by Wilson and Kelling, the authors hypothesized that neighborhood disorder and crime are “inextricably linked” (1982:31). They posited that unchecked social and physical disorder, specifically, visual cues that “no one cares” about the neighborhood, creates a neighborhood environment that fosters crime. A number of researchers have since explained that disorder leads to crime in a rather formulaic, time-ordered sequence that can be applied to the foreclosure process. Visible disorder, they argue, if left uncontrolled, heightens citizens' fear of crime and leads citizens to believe that a neighborhood is unsafe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022427811431155">Wilson and Kelling 1982</xref>). After citizens begin to feel unsafe, they withdraw from the community, both physically and psychologically, by reducing their public presence and social ties with other residents. Once a large number of residents withdraw, informal social control mechanisms break down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022427811431155">Wilson and Kelling 1982</xref>). Residents are no longer present to supervise youth or others in the community that are prone to mischief and misbehavior and no longer feel a sense of mutual responsibility to react to such behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022427811431155">Skogan 1990</xref>). As a consequence, more serious forms of disorder begin to materialize, eventually leading to an increase in crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022427811431155">Wilson and Kelling 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022427811431155">Kingsley, Smith, and Price (2009)</xref> explain that such processes will play out in neighborhoods with high home foreclosure rates. Homeowners at risk of losing their home will defer maintenance on their property. Grass, trees, and shrubs will become overgrown and home fixtures (e.g., doors and windows) will go unrepaired. After the homeowners vacate their property, the condition of the home deteriorates further because the home is vacant and there is no one responsible for maintenance or security. During this period, the home, now vacant, can become a contagion for crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022427811431155">Spelman 1993</xref>). Squatters, drug dealers and users, or prostitutes might use the home for illicit activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022427811431155">Spelman 1993</xref>). Additionally, vacant homes may become stripped of their wiring, appliances, or other valuable assets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022427811431155">Halverstadt and Trevizo 2009</xref>). As the number of foreclosures in a neighborhood reaches a critical tipping point, the spiral of decline hastens and neighborhood levels of crime increase.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022427811431155">Taylor (2009)</xref>, however, points out that many of the above processes are contingent upon residents' interpretations of changes occurring in their neighborhood. He notes that foreclosed and abandoned homes might not signal a declining neighborhood to residents and potential criminals. Rather, foreclosures might be interpreted in the broader context of the national HC, potentially foregoing the negative social effects of the broken windows theory. He further points out that if the foreclosure problem is taking place across neighborhoods, rather than being concentrated in particular communities, foreclosures might not have the anticipated negative impact on disorder and crime.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022427811431155">1</xref>
</sup> In addition to Taylor’s argument, others have emphasized that evidence in support of the broken windows theory is mixed, with some scholars finding support for the theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022427811431155">Kelling and Coles 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022427811431155">Skogan 1990</xref>) and others failing to find support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022427811431155">Harcourt 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022427811431155">Sampson and Groves 1989</xref>; Sampson and Raudenbush 1999; Taylor 2001).</p>
<p>Like broken windows theory, routine activities theory links foreclosures to crime through the impact foreclosures have on social life in a neighborhood, though the two theories approach breaches in neighborhood social control differently. Under routine activities theory, crime is the consequence of exposure and proximity to potential offenders, and routine activity differentially exposes victims to and protects them from potential offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022427811431155">Cohen and Felson 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022427811431155">Hindelang, Gottfredson, and Garofalo 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022427811431155">Meier and Miethe 1993</xref>). Because crime occurs when an offender and a suitable target come together in the absence of capable guardianship, routine activities are a significant contributor to an individual’s risk for victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022427811431155">Cohen and Felson 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022427811431155">Gottfredson 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022427811431155">Meier, Kennedy, and Sacco 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022427811431155">Meier and Miethe 1993</xref>). Any activity that reduces guardianship, increases exposure or proximity to potential offenders, or increases an individual’s suitability as a target, subsequently also increases their risk of victimization. Thus, routine activity theory tells us that foreclosures impact crime through a reduction in capable guardians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022427811431155">Taylor 2009</xref>). Here, because foreclosures facilitate a neighborhood environment where residents are increasingly hesitant to be social, the neighborhood loses its natural ability to guard its residents. Thus, as fewer residents are willing to engage in the neighborhood, both physically and socially, individuals who are present in the public areas of the neighborhood are at increased risk. Additionally, the number of capable guardians is reduced simply by out-migration as residents are forced to leave their homes. Taylor further notes that such factors as land use might condition the impact of foreclosure on crime. For example, a neighborhood which experiences high numbers of foreclosures as well as high traffic might be at increased risk for crime because there is a higher likelihood that potential offenders will enter into the neighborhood and observe the criminal opportunities in the neighborhood created by the foreclosures.</p>
<p>Foreclosures also have an impact on the demographic composition of a neighborhood. Simply stated, foreclosures force individuals to leave communities, therefore changing neighborhood demographics. Foreclosure-based out-migration expels residents who are most commonly associated with neighborhood stability and investment: homeowners. Neighborhoods that experience a few foreclosures can weather some residents leaving. However, for communities facing low residential stability, out-migration of homeowners may compound the negative effect that foreclosures have on neighborhood social life. Predatory lending, which creates a higher likelihood of foreclosure, also undermines residential stability and is rampant in neighborhoods experiencing concentrated disadvantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022427811431155">Immergluck and Smith 2005</xref>). Thus, for communities already facing issues of crime and depressed informal social control, out-migration from foreclosure can have a most negative effect. Out-migration limits informal social control and cuts ties to residents, specifically home owners, who would typically be the most beneficial and socially invested in a community.</p>
<p>Other academics have hypothesized that neighborhood demographic structures and processes condition the relationship between foreclosure and crime. Specifically, several scholars have contended that foreclosures should have a more substantial impact on crime in low-income neighborhoods when compared to high-income neighborhoods. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022427811431155">Immergluck and Smith (2006)</xref> hypothesized that the impact of foreclosure on crime in middle- and upper-income neighborhoods should be minimal because the value of property in these neighborhoods are protected by positive features such as good schools, high quality of life, and developed infrastructure. Because of these features, homes in middle- and upper-income neighborhoods should be vacant for shorter periods of time, creating fewer opportunities for disorder and crime. Middle- and upper-class communities continue to draw new residents even when property values are reduced. Taylor (2009) further hypothesized that wealthier communities might react differently to the foreclosure crisis. Wealthier neighborhoods have the money and resources to maintain their neighborhoods and address problems associated with physical and social disorder. Additionally, they are more likely to be able to leverage public resources to address their neighborhood’s problems associated with foreclosure. Because of these assets, wealthier communities do not have to rely exclusively on informal social control to enforce their community’s ideals. Thus, the main attribute of neighborhood life that foreclosures are hypothesized to impact, informal social control, is buffered from the detrimental effects of foreclosures simply because residents have other means of addressing community problems.</p>
<p>Conversely, low-income communities are less desirable and possess fewer of the attributes that attract home buyers. As a consequence, foreclosed homes in poor communities remain vacant significantly longer than they do in middle- and upper-income communities. Because these neighborhoods are less structurally sound (e.g., with regard to jobs and home loan terms), they are less capable of both formally and informally responding to problems associated with foreclosure. Taylor (2009) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022427811431155">Dalton, Gradeck, and Mercaldo (2008)</xref> further note that the general lack of informal social control mechanisms in socially disorganized communities simply does not permit these communities to proactively address disorder and crime problems commonly associated with foreclosure such as homelessness, looters, drug dealers, prostitutes, and arsonists.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0022427811431155">
<title>Prior Research on the Relationship between Foreclosure and Crime</title>
<p>To our knowledge, there have been only a handful of studies examining the link between foreclosure and crime. To begin with, the first study, by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022427811431155">Immergluck and Smith (2006)</xref>, examined the relationship between foreclosure and crime using data derived from Chicago, Illinois, in 2001. The authors' cross-sectional study relied on census tract data from the 2000 U.S. Census, business count data from Dunn and Bradstreet, and Uniform Crime Report (UCR) data from the Chicago Police Department. The author’s analysis revealed a direct relationship between foreclosures and crime, with a 1 percent increase in the foreclosure rate being associated with a 2.3 percent increase in UCR violent crime. No relationship was observed between foreclosures and property crime.</p>
<p>In 2008, shortly after the foreclosure epidemic began, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022427811431155">Bess (2008)</xref> examined the impact of home foreclosures in Charlotte, North Carolina. The author determined that between 2003 and 2007 about 9,000 homes were foreclosed in the community, and that many of them occurred in 13 neighborhoods. Bess identified 12 neighborhoods with homes that sold for a similar price but had a much lower rate of foreclosed homes. He reported that while crime remained low in the low-foreclosure neighborhoods, crime doubled in the high-foreclosure neighborhoods—from 1 percent of homes reporting a violent crime in 2003 to 2 percent of homes reporting a violent crime in 2006.</p>
<p>One of the most extensive studies to date was conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022427811431155">Baumer, Wolff, and Arnio (2010)</xref>. Baumer et al. examined the impact of foreclosures on acquisitive crime (i.e., robbery, burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft) and stranger homicides, in 2007, at the county level using UCR, foreclosure, and Census data from approximately 1,500 counties across the United States. Their analysis indicated that there was a significant and direct association between high foreclosure rates and acquisitive crime and lethal violence; and that the link between foreclosure and violence was associated with socioeconomic factors such as high unemployment and high levels of resource deprivation.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section4-0022427811431155">
<title>The Present Study</title>
<p>Most of the research that has examined the relationship between foreclosure rates and serious crime suggests that the relationship is direct and linear. However, many of these studies have faced limitations that the current study aims to address. First, and perhaps most important, most prior research has been limited to the examination of cross-sectional data (for exception see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022427811431155">Taylor 2001</xref>), which has not permitted researchers to examine the causal relationship between foreclosure and crime. Consequently, researchers have been unable to examine issues pertaining to temporal lag. Second, prior research has relied on measures of criminality that are limited. Specifically, they primarily rely on UCR data, which necessarily limits their analyses to specific serious offenses. Last, the ecological unit used by most of these studies is of issue. While some studies use small neighborhood units (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022427811431155">Immergluck and Smith 2006</xref>), others test this relationship at the county level (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022427811431155">Baumer et al. 2010</xref>). Given the differences in ecological units across these studies, it is difficult to fully understand how neighborhood social life is affected by foreclosure. Thus, the ramifications of foreclosure for social conditions in the neighborhood, and therefore crime, have yet to be fully explored.</p>
<p>The present study uses longitudinal data to examine the impact of foreclosure on crime in one Southwestern city at the epicenter of the nation’s foreclosure problem. In this study, we ask: does an increase in the number of foreclosures over time result in additional neighborhood crime? Specifically, we extend prior research by (1) examining whether there are any direct and HC-specific effects of foreclosure on neighborhood levels of crime, and (2) examining whether there is a temporal lag in the impact of foreclosure on neighborhood levels of crime.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0022427811431155">
<title>Setting</title>
<p>The present study reports on findings from Glendale, Arizona. Glendale is located in the northwest corner of the Phoenix metropolitan area and is bordered by Phoenix and Peoria. Glendale is a fairly prosperous city with a lower than average level of unemployment (7 percent) and a relatively high median income ($66,115). The city underwent a substantial amount of growth between 1990 and 2008, increasing from 151,748 residents in 1990 to 243,259 in 2008. The racial/ethnic composition of the city is diverse, with Caucasians making up approximately 78.4 percent of the community, African Americans, 5.4 percent; Asians, 4.3 percent, American Indians, 1.4 percent, and 10.6 percent, other race. Hispanics represent about 32 percent of the city’s population.</p>
<p>In 2008, Glendale’s crime rate was higher than some Southwestern cities (e.g., Las Vegas, NV; Los Angeles, CA; and San Diego, CA) but lower than others (e.g., Albuquerque, NM and Phoenix, AZ). The crime rate in Glendale declined by about 15 percent from 1998 to 2008, with 67.20 index crimes reported to the police per 1,000 residents in 1998, compared to 57.53 crimes reported to the police per 1,000 residents in 2008. In 2008, it was estimated that there were 85,579 housing units within Glendale, with about 33 percent of the units being renter occupied. Glendale, like Arizona in general, experienced a substantial decline in its housing market over the last few years. Prior to 2007, for example, Glendale, Arizona, typically experienced fewer than 60 foreclosures per year. From April 2007 through October 2008, however, the city experienced over 3,000 foreclosures (The Arizona Republic 2008). Put another way, about 3.5 percent of Glendale homes were foreclosed upon over this 18-month period. At the height of the foreclosure crisis, the city of Glendale had one of the highest number of foreclosures in the state, just behind Phoenix and Mesa (The Arizona Republic 2008). Along with the increase in residential home foreclosures came substantial reductions in home values. In 2006, homes sold for an average of $249,400, and by 2010 the average home value in Glendale had fallen to $115,500 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022427811431155">Zillow 2010</xref>), for a 46.3 percent decline over the 5-year period. The decline in home values precipitated by the foreclosure crisis was similarly observed in the Phoenix metropolitan area and the state of Arizona, where home values declined by 51.6 percent and 55.5 percent, respectively, over the same 5-year period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022427811431155">Zillow 2010</xref>). Together, this suggests that Glendale is an important site to conduct this research. While Glendale is certainly an extreme case, if a relationship between foreclosure and crime is not found, it might be unlikely to be found anywhere.<sup>

<title>Data</title>
<p>The present study relied on six data sources. First, foreclosure data from Information Market were used to calculate the number of foreclosures at the neighborhood level. Second, computer-aided dispatch (CAD)/police records management system (RMS) data were used to construct neighborhood-level measures of crime. Third, Geolytics provided intercensus neighborhood population estimates, total number of households, and other neighborhood level structural characteristics, by year and census block, for years 2003 through 2008. Geolytics calculates the yearly intercensus estimates by generating life tables which estimate the likelihood of dying or having a child for the overall population in the block group and for each age, race, and sex combination. The life tables are then used to estimate the population counts over the years.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022427811431155">3</xref>
</sup> Geolytics, however, was unable to provide intercensus estimates of all neighborhood characteristics. Therefore, we also obtained 2000 U.S. decennial census data and 2008 census estimate data provided by Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) to construct measures of median income and education levels from each neighborhood. Finally, we obtained land use data from the City of Glendale's planning department to determine how land is used at the neighborhood level. We discuss each of these data sources in greater detail below.</p>
<p>For the present study, Information Market provided residential addresses for a total of 5,431 foreclosures. Data pertaining to the address of each foreclosed home and the date of the home foreclosure was provided for Glendale, Arizona, from January of 2003 through December of 2008. These data were geocoded and summed within neighborhood boundaries (i.e., census block) to count the number of foreclosures within each of Glendale’s neighborhoods by month. There are two possible measures of foreclosure in Arizona. The first is the notification of trustee sale. This occurs 90 days prior to foreclosure and notifies the person that their home is being foreclosed. This provides the owner an opportunity to pay, contest, or otherwise postpone the actual foreclosure. The second is the Trustees Deed, which measures the date that the bank takes possession of the property and the property is actually foreclosed upon. The present study uses the Trustee Deed, and the date the Trustee Deed was filed, as our measure of foreclosure.</p>
<p>As mentioned above we used three sources of data to measure the social–structural dimensions of each community: Geolytics data, 2000 Census data, and 2008 ESRI demographic update data. The Geolytics data provided information on the total population, the total number of households, and the race/ethnic and age composition of each neighborhood for each year from 2003 through 2008. Geolytics, however, was unable to provide yearly block level estimates for educational achievement and median income. As a consequence, Summary file 3 (SF3) data from the 2000 U.S. decennial census and 2008 ESRI Demographic Update data (i.e., estimated census data at the block level; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022427811431155">ESRI 2007</xref>) were used to produce yearly estimates of educational achievement and median income by linearly interpolated the intervening years. While there are a total of 164 census blocks in Glendale, Arizona, three census blocks were excluded from the present study. They were excluded because their total populations were less than 50 persons and/or they had less than 30 housing units within them, which resulted in their crime and foreclosure rates being outliers.</p>
<p>Additionally, we included land use data obtained from the City of Glendale planning department. The land use data encapsulated the percentage of land within the neighborhoods that is used in various ways. Of particular concern for the present study was industrial use and shopping use. Not only is the percentage of land used for nonresidential purposes important for understanding foreclosures, prior research has shown that areas of mixed land use can be more vulnerable to crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022427811431155">Browning et al. 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Last, police CAD/RMS data from January of 2003 through December of 2008 were used to construct the study’s neighborhood-level measures of crime. These data, which included calls for service (CFS) and incidents arising from citizen- and police-initiated activity, were aggregated to the block group level. For the sake of simplicity, in the findings section, we refer to these data as calls for service (CFS). All duplicate records were eliminated from the data set. The final data set included a total of 400,509 incidents in the City of Glendale for the study period.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022427811431155">4</xref>
</sup> We used these data to construct the following measures: total crime, drug-related crime, property crime, and violent crime. CAD/RMS data are more inclusive of minor incidents in the neighborhoods. Traditionally, efforts to measure crime by place have often been restricted to police crime reports. However, a number of researchers have argued that official crime data are perhaps inappropriate for such studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022427811431155">Mazerolle et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022427811431155">Sherman, Gartin, and Buerger 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022427811431155">Sherman and Weisburd 1995</xref>). Two major reasons have been noted. First, official police records substantially underreport, and perhaps distort, less serious crimes. Scholars maintain this is largely because, once called, police officers are more likely to handle such incidents informally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022427811431155">Skogan 1990</xref>). The second weakness of official crime data is that the mean number of official offenses recorded at the neighborhood level is often too low to generate a sufficient amount of statistical power. Therefore, the probability of finding a significant effect is decreased substantially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022427811431155">Mazerolle et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022427811431155">Sherman and Weisburd 1995</xref>). Accordingly, using CAD/RMS data provides a more accurate view of neighborhood-level problems, reduces measurement bias, and increases statistical power.</p>

<title>Dependent Variables</title>
<p>The unit of analysis in the present study is the monthly number of incidents reported in each Glendale neighborhood for four offense categories. Specifically, incidents were assigned to one of the following categories: (1) total crime, (2) property crime, (3) drug crime, and (4) violent crime.<sup>

</disp-formula>There were several problematic months in the CAD/RMS data; specifically, these incidents were missing geographic data to link them to specific census blocks. Therefore, crime data for the months January through March 2004, January through March 2005, and July through September 2005—all periods prior to the economic crisis, were imputed using multiple imputation. These imputed incidents were used to construct the rates. In this process, we created five multiple imputation data sets, where each imputation utilized predictive mean matching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022427811431155">Little 1988</xref>) based on the time trend, the month of the year, the block group, the population, the foreclosure rate, and our control variables. Predictive mean matching uses the predictor variables to predict conditional means using linear regression.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022427811431155">6</xref>
</sup> Then, for each missing case, the algorithm locates the closest “neighboring” case that is not missing. This observed value is then taken for the imputation. The results presented in this article report the pooled estimates that take into account both the sampling variation and also the variation introduced by analyzing multiple imputations.</p>

</disp-formula>Four months of lags of the foreclosure rate are also included in the model. Thus far, many studies of foreclosure and crime have only been able to examine such issues by year (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022427811431155">Baumer et al. 2010</xref>). Given the lack of research on the effect of foreclosure and crime, we suspect that the effect of foreclosure on crime might be shorter than 1 year. Currently, should foreclosures have an effect on crime in a neighborhood; it is unknown how long the effect lasts. We ran models that included logged foreclosure rates of up to 12 months; we found that the effect of foreclosure over time is short-lived and because of space limitations and model parsimony only present 4 months of lags in this manuscript.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022427811431155">7</xref>
</sup> Also, there is the potential to have cumulative effects of foreclosure on crime. We ran several models that tested the cumulative effects of 2, 4, and 6 months of foreclosure. We did not find an effect of cumulative foreclosure on crime.</p>
<p>Additionally, the timeline of the data occurs before and during the HC in the United States; and, as a consequence, our study contains a natural experiment and has a quasi-experimental design. As discussed above, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022427811431155">Taylor (2009)</xref> hypothesized that the relationship between foreclosure and crime may be different before and during the HC. Therefore, to account for the potential variation in the relationship across the two periods, we created a dummy variable that differentiates the years of the HC (2007 and beyond) from the pre-foreclosure crisis years. Using classic experimental techniques, by interacting the foreclosure lags with the HC dummy, we are able to differentiate the HC-specific effects of foreclosure on crime from general foreclosure effects.</p>

<sec id="section10-0022427811431155">
<title>Controls</title>
<p>In addition to the independent variables, we also include a series of control variables known to be related to crime in neighborhoods. First, we include neighborhood demographic characteristics related to crime: the percentage Hispanic, median income, percentage male between the ages of 15 and 24, and the percentage of the population with less than a high school education in each neighborhood. We also control for the percentage of land within the neighborhood used for industrial purposes and shopping/retail. Last, we include two measures of time: time in months and time squared. Time squared enables us to account for the decreasing crime trend over the timeline in our data.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022427811431155">8</xref>
</sup> All variables are grand mean centered.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0022427811431155">
<title>Modeling</title>
<p>We analyzed the data using random effects time series models,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0022427811431155">9</xref>
</sup> where we regressed the rate of crime on 4 months of lagged foreclosure rates (per 100 housing units), an indication of pre or post HC, time and time-squared, and controls for the neighborhood-level ecological characteristics and land use.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0022427811431155">10</xref>
</sup> We employed a mixed-effect regression technique to model the rate of crime in each neighborhood across time. Our model nests time points within neighborhoods. We predict that the rate of CFS (CR) at time <italic>t</italic> in the <italic>i</italic>th neighborhood is a function of rate of new foreclosures (FR) at time <italic>t</italic>, and the number of new foreclosures for each past month up to 4 months. In other words, the models contain a measure of the current foreclosure rate as well as four lags representing the last 4 months of foreclosure.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0022427811431155">11</xref>
</sup> We also entered into the model a measure for the HC and interacted this measure with the foreclosure predictors. We did this to test whether the impact of foreclosures on crime was qualitatively different before and during the HC.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0022427811431155">12</xref>
</sup> We also entered as controls (noted as C below) the percentage Hispanic, the median income of that neighborhood, the percentage of the population that were males between the ages of 15 and 24, the percentage of the population with less than a high school education, the percentage of the area that was in use for industrial purposes, and the percentage of the area that was used for shopping and retail. Finally, because crime was decreasing over time in all of Glendale, we also added an indicator for month (T), and a quadratic term to capture nonlinearities in time. We estimate random effects for the intercept, σ<sub>0</sub> = SD(ζ<sub>0i</sub>), which is the estimated between-neighborhood variance of the intercept, and for the immediate effect of foreclosure, σ<sub>1</sub> = SD(ζ<sub>1i</sub>), which is the estimated variance across neighborhoods for the immediate effect of foreclosure. Foreclosures are not evenly spread throughout the neighborhoods in this study, especially during the HC; the random effect addresses this. Thus, our model for the <italic>i</italic>th block at time <italic>t</italic> is<disp-formula id="disp-formula3-0022427811431155">

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022427811431155">Figure 1</xref> displays the trend in foreclosures and CFS in Glendale from 2003 to 2008; notably, the HC in Glendale began in the first quarter of 2007. Importantly, the figures also show that there was a fairly consistent decline in the number of CFS in Glendale over the study period. Thus, despite the emergence of the HC, CFS continued to decline during the period of this study.</p>

In 2003, the average number of housing units per block was approximately 539; by 2008, this increased to about 581. The average population similarly increased from 1,482 per block to 1,713 in 2008. Despite the increase in population, the total number of CFS decreased across blocks, from 37.8 in 2003 to 29.5 in 2008. Analysis revealed a similar trend across each type of CFS examined: drug-related CFS remained virtually the same (0.82 and 0.81, respectively), CFS for property crime decreased from 15.8 to 13.9, and CFS for violent crime decreased from 6.0 to 4.7.</p>

<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022427811431155">Table 1</xref> also shows that while CFS decreased over the study period, the number of foreclosures increased substantially. Unlike CFS, the average number of foreclosures increased from virtually zero per month in 2003 to .8 per month by the end of the study period in 2008. During this period, socioeconomic indicators also changed. The median income increased from about $57,0489 to $66,888 and the percentage of the population without a high school diploma decreased from about 14 percent to 9 percent. The proportion of the population characterized as Hispanic increased from about 25 percent to about 42 percent, and the percentage of the population characterized as males aged 15 to 24 stayed approximately the same at around 10 to 11 percent. On average about 2.5 percent of each neighborhood was used for industry and 0.9 percent was used for shopping.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022427811431155">Table 2</xref> displays the results of the mixed models. Our analysis showed that during the pre-crisis period, for every one unit increase in the current foreclosure rate, the total rate of CFS increased by about 11 (model 1). We also observed a lagged effect. Two to three months following a one unit increase in foreclosure, the total rate of CFS increased between 10.05 and 6.07 respectively. We observed a similar pattern for property crime (model 3) during the pre-crisis period, with a one unit increase in the current foreclosure rate being associated with CFS for property crime increasing by about 8.5. Likewise, 2 to 3 months following a one unit increase in foreclosure, the rate of CFS for property crime increased between 6.2 and 5.2, respectively. Our analysis also showed that pre-crisis, current, and 3 months of lagged foreclosures have a positive effect on the rate of CFS for violent crime (Model 4). In general, a one unit increase in foreclosure leads to an increase in two CFS for violent crime. In contrast, a one unit increase in the foreclosure rate reduces the rate of drug-related CFS by 1.53 (model 2). Lagged foreclosure rates do influence the rate of drug-related CFS, however, the effect is rather small (less than one unit change), even if significant. The total or cummulative effect can be calculated by summing the coefficients from “current foreclosure rate” through “4 months” for each crime type. These findings indicated that for every foreclosure in a neighborhood the total number of CFS increased by about 30 per 1,000 people in the population. Likewise, for every foreclosure in a neighborhood, there were about 18 more CFS for property crime (per 1,000 population), 8 more CFS for violent crime, and 2 fewer CFS for drug-related crime.</p>

<p>Our analysis indicated that, when compared to the pre-crisis period, the period during the HC yields different effects of foreclosure on crime. First, we see during the HC, total CFS, CFS for property crime (though nonsignificant), and CFS for violent crime decreased over the HC period. Drug-related CFS increased slightly but significantly. We also observed short-term lag effects during the foreclosure crisis. Total CFS, for example, decreased substantially the month of the foreclosure, only to be followed by a month of increased CFS, and followed again by a month of decreasing CFS. A similar trend was observed for CFS for property crime and violent crime—an initial decline in CFS, followed by a month of increased CFS, and followed again by a month of decreased CFS. An inverse relationship was discovered between foreclosure and CFS for drug crime during the foreclosure crisis. Specifically, the rate of CFS for drug crime increased significantly the month of the foreclosure, only to be followed by a month of decreased drug crime, followed by a month of increased drug crime, and then a month of decreased drug crime. Effectively, when accounting for the relationship between foreclosure and crime both pre- and post-HC, we see that during the HC the short-term relationship is washed out. Similar, to the procedure described above, the total effect can be calculated by summing the coefficients (including the interactions with HC) across each month for each crime type. These findings indicated that for every foreclosure in a neighborhood, during the post-crisis period, the total number of CFS increased by about 19 per 1,000 population. When examining the cumulative effect over time by crime type we found that for every foreclosure in a neighborhood there were about 12 more CFS for property crime (per 1,000 population), 3 more CFS for violent crime, and CFS for drug-related crime held stable.</p>
<p>Next, we report on the relationship between our measures of crime and several of our controls. The percentage Hispanic in the neighborhood had a significant and positive impact on CFS, regardless of crime type. Additionally, land use had little to no effect on CFS, with the exception of calls for drug crime. During the study period, CFS was trending slightly downward as evidenced by the significant time variable and the negative and significant squared time variable (also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022427811431155">Figure 1</xref>). The three other controls—median household income, percentage low education, and the percentage male ages 15-24—yield variable effects by crime type. Percentage male of age 15 to 24 had a significant negative impact on all types of CFS and the percentage low education was positively related to all types of CFS. Our analysis also indicated that median income for a neighborhood has a modest but positive effect for all types of CFS except violent crime.</p>
<p>Finally, we included random effects to measure the between-block variation in the intercept and the immediate effect of foreclosure. We did this to explore whether there was between-block variation in the base-month CFS and whether there was between-block variation in the relationship between foreclosure and CFS, respectively. Examining the estimated standard deviation of the random effect for the constant in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022427811431155">Table 2</xref>, we note that there was indeed significant variation in the intercept for all CFS. This variation was most prominent in total CFS and CFS for property crime. Therefore, even after controlling for the factors in our model, there is a significant amount of between-block variation in CFS that has yet to be explored. We also examined the estimated standard deviation of the random effect for the foreclosure rate to assess whether the average effect of foreclosure on CFS is consistent across blocks. The random effect of foreclosure is significant for all types of CFS; like before, the variation was most prominent in total CFS and CFS for property crime. This indicates that there may be an immediate effect of foreclosure in some block groups but not others for some types of CFS examined here.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>In the present study, we sought to extend prior research by examining the temporal impact of foreclosure on various crime types in one southwestern city. Specifically, we were interested in (1) examining whether there was a direct (linear) and HC-specific effect of foreclosure on neighborhood levels of crime and (2) examining whether there was a temporal lag in the impact of foreclosure on neighborhood levels of crime. Our study reveals that foreclosures do not have a long-term effect on crime in general, and have different, though modest effects on different types of crime. This is noteworthy given that our research site is an extreme example of how cities and neighborhoods suffered during the HC. These findings have both theoretical and policy implications.</p>
<p>First, our findings suggested that foreclosed homes may not have the long-term negative impact on crime that many scholars feared. For instance, most recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022427811431155">Wilson and Paulsen (2010</xref>:14) noted that even one foreclosed home in a neighborhood can result in the first step toward that neighborhood’s decline and eventual increase in criminality. Instead, our results show that foreclosure has a short-term impact, typically no more than 3 or 4 months. Our findings are contrary to those who have maintained that increased levels of disorder result in a spiral of decay that leads to increased neighborhood crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022427811431155">Kelling and Coles 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022427811431155">Skogan 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022427811431155">Wilson and Kelling 1982</xref>) but are supportive of others who have argued that disorder has limited impact on neighborhood levels of crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022427811431155">Harcourt 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022427811431155">Katz, Webb, and Schaefer 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022427811431155">Sampson and Raudenbush 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>It might be that disorder and crime are two separate phenomena, with one not necessarily causing the other. Typically, disorder and crime are specified as both being caused by a lack of social control, though at other ends of a continuum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022427811431155">Sampson and Raudenbush 1999</xref>). Specifically, disorder does not cause crime, but, like crime, it is a symptom of levels of social control in the neighborhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022427811431155">Sampson and Raudenbush 1999</xref>). On the other hand, it might be that foreclosures that take place during the HC do not change the social meaning that residents assign to their neighborhood. Given the amount of media attention and public discussion surrounding the matter residents might view foreclosures as “normal,” contextualizing the problem within the nation’s foreclosure crisis (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022427811431155">Taylor 2009</xref>). Residents have been shown to be unable to discriminate between the idea of disorder and crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022427811431155">Armstrong and Katz 2010</xref>); in this circumstance, when disorder, in the form of foreclosures, has been precontextualized for residents, it is difficult to say they are interpreting foreclosures as a sign of decay. Future research should focus on the longitudinal impact of disorder on crime to further examine the scope and nature, if any, of the relationship. Furthermore, special emphasis should be placed on understanding how and why residents assign meaning to disorder and the macro (e.g., national), meso (e.g., neighborhood), and micro (individual) factors that influence change.</p>
<p>Second, it is also important to note that the relationship between foreclosure and crime during the HC was not linear in nature, but rather was characterized by a temporal, short-term flux in crime. Specifically, our analyses showed that foreclosures that occurred during the HC initially caused the overall rate of CFS and the rate of CFS for property crime, and violent crime to decrease. However, the first month following an increase in foreclosure was typified by a month of increased CFS, followed by a month of decreased CFS, and CFS thereafter stabilizing. A similar trend, but in inverse, was observed for drug-related CFS.</p>
<p>An explanation for this phenomenon might be that following a foreclosure the neighborhood goes through a period of transition. One hypothesis might be that crime initially decreases as a consequence of out-migration among homeowners who lack economic stability, and who have foreclosed upon their homes. Families that face foreclosure are most likely the same families that experience substantial economic stress, which is related to crime and delinquency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022427811431155">Kaplan and Sommers 2009</xref>). Immediately following foreclosure neighborhoods might simultaneously undergo population loss and economic and neighborhood stabilization, resulting in a temporary reduction in crime. Put another way, it might be that the HC in Glendale resulted in the economic homogenization of neighborhoods, with those who are under economic stress (and more likely to commit crime) being the most likely to leave the neighborhood. Such a change is referred to by some economists as economic Darwinism or economic natural selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022427811431155">Sloth and Whitta-Jacobsen N.d</xref>.).</p>
<p>Following the short period of declining crime, crime might temporarily increase during the transition period for several of the reasons discussed above. For example, there are fewer guardians in the neighborhood to supervise youth and deter criminal activity. Foreclosed homes might be robbed of valuable goods (dishwashers, copper, hardware, etc.), or after more individuals become aware that the home has been foreclosed, the home might be used as a place for youth to congregate. Following this period of transition, crime might stabilize because formal and informal social control mechanisms are established or reestablished and maintained until the home is sold. For example, a bank might take ownership of the home and assign a capable guardian to it (i.e., a real estate agent who is in charge of selling the house), or neighbors might contact city services when weeds become overgrown or the home becomes dilapidated or used for illegal purposes, and mandate that the bank address the problem. In the greater metropolitan area of Phoenix, there is anecdotal evidence that neighbors often step in to maintain the public spaces of the home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022427811431155">Holdsworth 2010</xref>). A notable exception to the findings discussed above is for drug crime. Our analysis indicated that drug-related CFS increased and then decreased month to month in the 4months following an increase in foreclosure. While we have no evidence it might be that foreclosed homes are contagions for drug-related crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022427811431155">Spelman 1993</xref>). This might occur in several ways. The foreclosed home might be broken into and used as a place to use or sell drugs, or individuals might be using the property surrounding the home to use or sell drugs because of the absence of guardians. The police might address the problem for a short period of time resulting in a temporary reduction in drug crime. This cycle might repeat itself for a short period of time. While data limitations do not enable us to determine that foreclosed homes are specifically being used for drug use and sales, an increase in the rate of foreclosure certainly does increase the occurrence of this type of crime.</p>
<p>It should be noted that several of the ecological controls in our models remained powerful predictors of our crime categories. Percentage Hispanic and percentage low education were all positively associated with most of our crime categories. These neighborhood characteristics are proxies for the level of disorganization in the neighborhood; social disorganization has long been associated with higher levels of crime. Median income was also positively associated with crime, but across the models, the slopes are rather small and inconsequential. Finally, the percentage of the population that is male 15 to 24 years old was inversely related to all types of CFS. While this is contrary to much of the literature that shows young males commit the majority of crime, and a higher presence of them in a neighborhood would increase crime, this is not the case here. In this study, some neighborhoods have upward of 20 percent of its population consisting of young males. We suspect that the decrease in crime here is related to the youth of the population in the neighborhood, meaning, these neighborhoods are most likely to have a great deal of children and young families in them which provide an element of social control in a neighborhood. Additionally, changes in neighborhood characteristics as a result of the HC may play a more important role if there is a long-term effect of foreclosure on crime in a neighborhood. However, the nation needs to be clear of the HC and recession for this to be assessed.</p>
<p>Several potential limitations should be noted and serve as context for interpretation of the findings. First, while the present study builds upon the prior literature in a number of important ways, we were limited in our ability to assess the extent to which homes were vacant as a consequence of foreclosure. It might be that foreclosure is simply a proxy or indicator of vacancy. The foreclosure process is often variable in its temporal sequence of vacancy, resale, and reoccupancy. In the future, researchers should consider the role of vacancy in neighborhood crime and its interaction with foreclosure. Second, because of the time-ordered process of foreclosure and the restrictions of our data, we were unable to determine whether there are any tipping points for when foreclosures cease to illicit a positive impact on crime. Without knowing the timeline behind when a home is foreclosed upon, vacated, and eventually re-sold, we cannot estimate a precise number of foreclosures in the neighborhoods at any given time. Third, we used the number of housing units as our denominator and not mortgaged properties, which might have impacted our findings. However, prior work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022427811431155">Kirk and Hyra (2011)</xref> suggested that regardless of the denominator used (number of housing units, number of mortgaged housing units), the findings are essentially the same. Fourth, like others before us, we did not examine the possibility of spatial dependence in our models. While we found that the impact of foreclosures on neighborhood levels of crime was short-lived, in the future researchers should examine how foreclosures might impact crime in nearby neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Last, the generalizability of these findings is unknown. Glendale, Arizona, is located in the state with the second highest number of foreclosures in the nation and has the third highest number of foreclosures in the state, only behind Phoenix and Mesa. As a consequence, our research site is best viewed as an extreme example. The effects of foreclosure on crime may be different in other settings; additional research should be conducted in other communities in different geographic and political contexts. For example, as a suburb of Phoenix, Glendale neighborhoods have not experienced generations of disadvantage such as those seen in cities like Chicago, Detroit, or Washington DC.</p>

<p>We used predictive mean matching instead of a pure regression-based approach for two reasons. First, since we were imputing the dependent variables, we felt uncomfortable using our regression models as imputation models. This would have resulted in falsely strengthening our model since we would be filling in predicted values for missing values using a similar set of predictors. Second, regression-based approaches could have resulted in negative values which would be meaningless in this analysis. To overcome these problems, we considered predictive mean matching as the best compromise between a regression-based approach and using plausible values for imputation. As a result, we conservatively estimated our dependent variable and also maintained the distribution of crime.</p>

<p>To test the robustness, and to examine potential problems with collinearity, we fit models where we include each lag in a model individually. We found for total crime that each lag performed individually as it did in the final model. We found the same pattern for drugs, violence, and property. Thus, we found that the inclusion of multiple lags did not bias the results of any individual lag.</p>

<p>Additionally, we tested to see whether there was a cubic trend to the data. To test this, we include linear, quadratic, and cubic time variables in the models to assess the time trend. We found that the cubic time variable was nonsignificant and did little to alter the results; due to this, we include only the linear and quadratic forms of time in the model.</p>

<p>In response to one reviewer’s comments, we conducted analysis where the effects of the immediate disclosure rate are fixed across neighborhoods. We found that the results did not substantively change for any of our outcomes. However, in the case of total crime and property crime, the coefficient for current foreclosures doubled. Upon further analysis, we believe that the increase in the coefficient is due to an outlier block. Since the random effects model that we used compensates for this outlier block, we presented this model.</p>

<p>One concern about using rates in analysis is when the denominator of the rate correlates with other variables in a model. To address this, we examined correlations between variables. Total population was not highly correlated with any control variable. To further address this concern, we ran two types of Poisson models with variable exposure by the total population: (a) models with foreclosures as counts, and (b) models with foreclosures as rates. Neither of these models yielded significantly different results; in fact, when running the models, we have two types of exposure: the total population for the number of crimes and the number of housing units for the number of foreclosures. Because of this, we feel that the interpretation of these models is awkward and that including them was not viable.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn11-0022427811431155">

<p>Because of the structure of our data, the effect of foreclosure on crime may also be related to future foreclosures. Specifically, individuals may begin neglecting their home and contributing to the spiral of decay only after their home has had a foreclosure filing. To test this, we tried various tests of the leads (future foreclosure) and lags in the models. We found that there were no substantial effect of leads on crime, especially when including the lags in the model. Also, the interaction between leads and the housing crisis (HC) dummy did not yield any significant effects.</p>

<p>The current model tests whether there is a time-ordered relationship between foreclosure and crime, however, there can also be concern over the functional form of that relationship. Namely, is there a nonlinear relationship between foreclosure and crime? At issue here is that the distinction between the pre- and during the HC may not be of concern if the relationship between foreclosure and crime is nonlinear (i.e., crime increases as foreclosure exponentially increases). This is an important distinction that needs to be tested. To begin with, in addition to the nontransformed current and lagged foreclosure, we ran a model which included squared foreclosure rates in the model, for both current and lagged foreclosure. Additionally, we did a split sample test (i.e., only time points pre-crisis and time points during the crisis) to be sure that any nonlinearities were not attributable to the HC (i.e., at test of whether the functional form remained the same over the 2 periods in the model). The first model with the squared lag terms had large multicollinearity problems. So we reduced the model to only one squared term: current foreclosure. For the split sample model (which we ran using the reduced model to avoid multicollinearity), we did find differences across the two time points. Thus, our final test of this issue, we included current foreclosure, foreclosure<sup>2</sup>, crisis, crisis*foreclosure, and crisis*foreclosure<sup>2</sup>. None of the squared terms were significant. Whatever the difference in functional forms is, it seems to be captured by differentiating between pre- and during the HC. This leads us to believe that socially, the HC is driving the relationship between foreclosure and crime rather than a critical mass of foreclosures in the neighborhood.</p>
