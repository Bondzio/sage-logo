<p>When I was 16, I was a National Young Liberal and read everything John Stuart Mill had ever published. I was given to understand that ideologically I could call myself a libertarian socialist. I re-read <italic>On Liberty</italic> over and over again. I memorized some of the key passages. I was inspired to be a journalist, a trade I have carried on for nearly 40 years, by <italic>On Liberty</italic> (1859), by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein's book on Watergate, <italic>All The President's Men</italic> – along with the film of the same name – and by <italic>The Execution of Charles Horman: An American Sacrifice</italic> (1978). This was the Thomas Hauser book that inspired the 1982 film <italic>Missing</italic>, directed by Costa Gavras and starring Jack Lemmon.</p>
<p>So I was delighted that the philosophy of Mill should get a hearing at the Leveson Inquiry – and horrified to hear his views so misrepresented. The word “libertarian” has been ripped asunder from “socialist” and in many left-wing circles is as malodorous as fascism. I feel I have been hearing the cry: “The journalists are our misfortune.” Yet I know from experience that criminal wrongdoing in journalism is unlikely to be any greater than in any other trade, office or profession. Journalism is well regulated by law – and harsher sanctions for transgressions not already regulated will not do our battered and tired democracy any good.</p>
<p>John Stuart Mill understood and wrote about the importance and constitutional significance of both freedom of the press (now media) and freedom of expression for the individual. I think he saw them as complex social and utilitarian contracts. The U.S. First Amendment inspired by John Locke, Thomas Paine and other enlightened political philosophers has never been absolutist in constitutional application, but for it to have democratic validity it has had to be paradigmatic and this means operating legally with pragmatic priority.</p>
<p>I do wonder what has been gained by what I can only describe as the authoritarian tendency landing their blows. I have had to leave the NUJ on principle and been condemned as a First Amendment Fundamentalist. One saving grace remains the interaction of students, who appreciate how I can demolish intellectually, for the purposes of argument, my own beleaguered position that less law is good, and the harm in communication lies in the social reaction and interpretation, not in its expression.</p>
<p>Having lived and breathed public service broadcasting throughout most of my career, I have transferred the view that in universities we should strive for an aspiration to separate politics, research and teaching. Professionally in journalism I have operated on the basis of aspiration to impartiality, representing mainstream and marginalized voices, accuracy, attribution, transparency, and avoiding conflict of interest. “Park your politics at home before you go to work in your newsroom” was the maxim of one of my first editors.</p>
<p>So I could not be more perplexed in trying to understand the distortion of John Stuart Mill's <italic>On Liberty</italic> both at the Leveson Inquiry and indeed when Professor Baroness Onora O'Neill visited Goldsmiths to provide a lecture to our Departmental Centre for the Study of Global Media and Democracy, towards the end of last year.</p>
<p>Academics such as Professor O'Neill seem oblivious to the existing legal regulation of media behaviour and expression, the extraordinary discrimination against media defendants in defamation and other legal areas, and indeed the jeopardy of punitive costs and damages when losing or winning. They seem determined to mock the credibility of the assertion in the PCC Editors' Code of Practice that “There is a public interest in freedom of expression itself”. They are wedded to a thesis that media corporation power is confused and corrupting of the concept of freedom of expression.</p>
<p>This is propagandising <italic>On Liberty</italic>. In Professor O'Neill's lecture there is no analysis or proper consideration for the content, import and significance of Chapter 2 of <italic>On Liberty</italic> which begins: “The time, it is to be hoped, is gone by when any defence would be necessary of the ‘liberty of the press’ as one of the securities against corrupt or tyrannical government.” It ends, 72 pages later, with a complex and sophisticated warning that “law and authority have no business with restraining” the expression of speech even when vituperative.</p>
<p><italic>On Liberty</italic> discussed so eloquently that the danger of the worst kind of “polemic, is to stigmatise those who hold the contrary opinion as bad and immoral men”. In a mid-Victorian context, Mill had a clear idea of how and when law should intervene to regulate harm in communication. He was concrete. He talked of the clear and present risk of a mob rioting outside a corn-dealer's house when incited by the rumour of prices being manipulated. The control, regulation and censorship of the rumour were supposed to be temporary and proportionate.</p>
<p>The good professor and her supporters, of which there are many in media studies, are pumping out a fashionable fantasy that <italic>On Liberty</italic> is all about the content of Chapter 3; the flourishing of individuality as one of the elements of well-being. This is then conflated with Chapter 4 of the book with an argument that misrepresents <italic>On Liberty's</italic> discussion of the need to limit the impact of society's authority over the individual.</p>
<p>The debate at Leveson and afterwards has not engaged the leading thinkers and writers on John Stuart Mill; it has not addressed the philosophical and jurisprudential foundation of media freedom and freedom of expression and its role in democratic constitutions. Oppressive authority in terms of religious power and bigotry, tyranny of public opinion, state persecution and legal abuse of power became a misleading and political attack on media corporation power.</p>
<p>Speaking as the tradesman of media law and ethics at Goldsmiths, I find this argument lacks academic credibility unless there is coherent consideration of the world's leading authorities on the nature of freedom of speech arising out of John Stuart Mill's <italic>On Liberty –</italic> writers such as Harvard's Professor Thomas “Tim” Scanlon, Princeton's Professor Alan Ryan, and indeed Richard Reeves, author of <italic>John Stuart Mill – Victorian Firebrand</italic>.</p>
<p>As a mere journalist I would leave my annotated copy of <italic>On Liberty</italic> at home, interview Scanlan, Ryan and Reeves, alongside O'Neill and some of the other academics who gave only one side of the story about Mill to Leveson on July 16, 2012.</p>
<p>I would be loath to pontificate to any of my academic colleagues on the ethics of representing all sides of an argument, but I have to say I am getting used to being told by them how to regulate my own profession.</p>
