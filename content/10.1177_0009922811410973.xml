<p>On August 19, 2009, during the H1N1 epidemic, the Obama Administration urged employers to adopt “flexible and non-punitive” sick leave policies for containing the spread of the virus. The guidelines were presented in a joint announcement from the Secretaries of Commerce, Health and Human Services, and Homeland Security. Commerce Secretary Gary Locke stated,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>From top to bottom, businesses need to drive home the point that if an employee stays home sick, it is not only the best thing for that employee’s health, but also for the health of his or her co-workers and the productivity of the company.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>He asked employers to drop a common requirement that workers provide doctor’s notes or other paperwork to prove that they had to miss work because of illness. Such a requirement “has potential to overload the health care system that will likely be stressed during this years’ flu season”, he said.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811410973">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>This was excellent public health advice. If it was good public health policy for the H1N1 virus, then it should be good policy for all communicable diseases. The requirement for a doctor’s excuse should be abolished. The requirement implies that if an employee or student is sick enough to miss work or school, then they are sick enough to see a physician. In the great majority of cases this is not true. Most illnesses in the employed population, students, and children in daycare do not require a visit to a health care facility. Obtaining a doctor’s excuse increases expenses for the patient, insurance companies, and the federal government, that recently was announced to be the largest health insurer in the country.</p>
<p>Another reason for abolishing the doctor’s excuse requirement is that a doctor’s excuse does not guarantee that the patient is no longer contagious. During the H1N1 outbreak, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that an infected patient not return to work/school until they had been free of fever 24 hours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922811410973">2</xref></sup> They later found that some patients shed virus up to 10 days after they were free of fever.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922811410973">3</xref></sup> Even if the patient sees a physician, there is no practical way to ensure that they are not still contagious following many communicable diseases. There is no evidence that from a health standpoint a doctor’s excuse has any value. It does not even prove that the patient was sick enough to seek medical attention.</p>
<p>Failure to produce the excuse can threaten the employee’s job or a student’s ability to progress in school. The excuse requirement has produced an industry to provide fake excuses. Google “doctors’ excuses for work” and you get more than 5 million hits. There are scores of sites that sell or offer for free, authentic looking excuses. They may be essential for the employee but, of course, have no public health value. For the patient with private insurance, most will incur co-pay for the encounter. For those without insurance, the total cost will be out-of-pocket. For those with government-financed insurance, Medicare or Medicaid, there may be co-pay, but the majority of the cost will be borne by the taxpayer.</p>
<p>A good example of the waste of medical resources and cost increase caused by the required excuse is the clinic in which the author practices. The great majority of patients seen in this clinic have Medicaid insurance with no co-pay. There is no financial disincentive to use services. It is common to see a family with 2 or 3 children who have had a minor illness for a day or two but are obviously improving or even asymptomatic. I used to wonder why they had requested an appointment until I realized that when the parent was told that they were recovering well, the inevitable response was, “I need a school and work excuse.” I estimate that as much as 5% to 10% of our illness visits are primarily to obtain doctor’s excuses.</p>
<p>If indeed 5% of visits to physician’s offices, hospital outpatient departments, and hospital emergency rooms are primarily for the purpose of obtaining a physicians excuse, the cost is overwhelming. According to Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, the national average cost of a doctor’s office visit is $60 and the national average cost of a visit to a hospital emergency department is $383.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811410973">4</xref></sup> According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2006, the number of visits to physician’s offices by persons younger than 65 years was 672 117 000 whereas the visits to hospital facilities for those younger than 65 years were 188 588 000.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922811410973">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811410973">6</xref></sup> If as much as 5% of those visits were primarily to obtain a doctor’s excuse, using Blue Cross Blue Shield Texas’ figures, the total cost would be $5 627 811 200 for 1 year.</p>
<p>The requirement for any business or other public entity to require a doctor’s excuse should be abolished, probably by federal legislation. The requirement creates unnecessary cost to individuals, to private insurance companies, and to state and federal governments. An “excuse” does not prove severity of illness, does not guarantee freedom of contagiousness, and has no public health value. It may even be easily faked.</p>
<p>One wonders if careful study might reveal that the excuse requirement is a violation of a patient’s rights under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. If not it should be.</p>
<p>What is the alternative to the “doctor’s excuse?” It is a management problem for those requiring them to find an alternative and cut the unnecessary consumption of medical resources by a practice that has negative value. There is no excuse for a doctor’s excuse.</p>
