<abstract>
<p>In this paper we present a review of the literature on men caring for a relative with dementia. While there is an abundance of literature on caregiving in general, there is a dearth of information on male caregiving and in particular on the role of sons as carers. Keywords used were dementia, Alzheimer's disease, caregiver, caregiver burden, caregiver support, sons, spouses, husbands, men, fathers, male, widowers, help seeking behaviour, parent child relations, gender identity and combinations of these. The inclusion criteria stipulated that papers had to be research based, written in English, published between the years 1999 and 2010 and related to men caring for a person with dementia. The categories that emerged from the literature included men in a caregiving role, gender differences in caregiver burden, support services and sons as carers. Further research is needed to highlight the needs and experiences of men in a caregiving role.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1471301211421235" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Demographic ageing is a worldwide phenomenon and many people are now living longer and healthier lives than before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1471301211421235">Alzheimer's Disease International, 2009</xref>). However, with an aging society, the prevalence of chronic disease has increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1471301211421235">Martin-Cook, Trimmer, Svetilk, &amp; Weiner, 2000</xref>). As one gets older, the risk of developing dementia increases to one in five at 80 years and older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1471301211421235">Howcroft, 2004</xref>). Worldwide, there are an estimated 35.6 million people living with dementia and this is estimated to nearly double every 20 years to 65.7 million in 2030 and 115.4 million in 2050 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1471301211421235">Alzheimer's Disease International, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Dementia is a syndrome caused by a range of illnesses. Most are currently incurable, and cause progressive, irreversible brain damage. They include Alzheimer's disease (the most common cause), vascular disease, frontal lobe dementia and Lewy body disease. Symptoms of dementia can include memory loss, difficulties with language, judgement and insight, failure to recognize people, disorientation, mood changes, hallucinations, delusions and the gradual loss of ability to perform all tasks of daily living (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1471301211421235">Mathers &amp; Leonardi, 2000</xref>). As the dementia progresses the person becomes more dependent and this has an impact on those providing care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1471301211421235">Svanström &amp; Dahlberg, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Men are underrepresented in the literature pertaining to family caregiving in dementia. Yet, they play an important role in providing care for cognitively impaired older adults in the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1471301211421235">Houde, 2001</xref>). While there is extensive literature on caregiving in dementia, only a few studies have emphasized the caregiving role of men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1471301211421235">Coe &amp; Neufeld, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1471301211421235">Kramer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1471301211421235">Russell, 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1471301211421235">2007b</xref>). In particular, there is a dearth of research on the caregiving role of sons. In view of projected demographic trends and an increased need for male caregivers, it is important to explore the male experience of caregiving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1471301211421235">Houde, 2001</xref>). This review aims to address the gap in the literature by exploring the experiences of men caring for a relative with dementia.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1471301211421235" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>Methods used to search the literature involved the use of the Athens search engine, Google Scholar and manual searches of books, reports and journals. The main databases searched and the numbers of hits identified were the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 18 papers), the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE; 9 papers), and the Psychological Information Database (PsycINFO; 6 papers). Additional references were sought from citations within the identified studies and reports. Keywords used were dementia, Alzheimer's disease, caregivers, caregiver burden, caregiver support, sons, spouses, husbands, and men, fathers, male, widowers, help seeking behaviour, parent child relations, gender identity and combinations of these. The inclusion criteria stipulated that papers had to be research based, written in English, published between the years 1999 and 2010 and related to men caring for a person with dementia. Although outside of this timeframe, three additional papers were deemed relevant to the review by virtue of the specific focus of the research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1471301211421235">Delgado &amp; Tennstedt, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1471301211421235">Harris, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1471301211421235">1998</xref>). Each manuscript was read and recurring themes were noted. In total 56 papers were critically appraised. The key themes that emerged from the literature and consequently formed the basis of this review include men in a caregiving role, gender differences in caregiver burden, support services and sons as carers. The review concludes with a discussion.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1471301211421235"><title>Men in a caregiving role</title>
<p>Caring for a person with dementia is multifarious and challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1471301211421235">Armstrong, 2001</xref>) and places immense difficulty on family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1471301211421235">Nagatomo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1471301211421235">Maas et al., 2004</xref>). Caregiving by family members is recognized as being the primary source of care for older people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1471301211421235">Jansson, Nordberg, &amp; Grafstrom, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1471301211421235">Kitwood, 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1471301211421235">Campbell and Carroll (2007)</xref> point out that in society, caregiving is gendered with women providing more care than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1471301211421235">Martin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1471301211421235">Pretorius, Walker, &amp; Malan Heyns, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1471301211421235">Shanks-McElroy &amp; Strobino, 2001</xref>). This is partially explained by the stereotypical view that associates women with nurturing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1471301211421235">Gallicchio, Nauman, Langenberg, &amp; Baumgarten, 2002</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1471301211421235">Houde (2001)</xref> argued that this view is no longer acceptable in light of the evolving roles of men and women in society with current trends indicating a greater involvement of men in a caregiving role in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1471301211421235">Houde, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In a review of the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1471301211421235">Houde (2002)</xref> examined the role of gender and family relationship in the caregiving experience and found a lack of research on male caregivers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1471301211421235">Neufeld and Kushner (2009)</xref> added that most of the research in relation to male caregivers has focused on spousal caregivers with men accounting for 41% of spousal caregiving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1471301211421235">Brown, Chen, Mitchell, &amp; Province, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Research in the area of male caregiving is evolving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1471301211421235">Campbell &amp; Carroll, 2007</xref>) in that it questions previously held assumptions about men in a caregiving role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1471301211421235">Sanders &amp; McFarland, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1471301211421235">Russell (2001)</xref> carried out a qualitative study of elderly male spouses (<italic>n</italic> = 14) and concluded that men were frequently described as inefficient and incapable in comparison with their female counterparts. Russell's analysis revealed three major themes, feelings of isolation and invisibility of their care work, a style of caregiving that blended management and nurturing and feelings of commitment, devotion and responsibility. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1471301211421235">Krisi, Hervonen, and Jylha, (2004)</xref> upheld these findings based on an analysis of extracts from written texts and focused interviews with 13 Finnish husbands. A qualitative study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1471301211421235">Sanders and Power (2009)</xref> investigated changes in the roles, responsibilities and relationships of husbands (<italic>n</italic> = 17) in a caregiving role to wives suffering from memory loss and other chronic conditions. Their findings suggested that husbands adapted to their new role as caregiver and learned to form new relationships with their wives.</p>
<p>A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1471301211421235">Pretorius et al. (2009)</xref> of male (<italic>n</italic> = 10) spouses caring for a wife with dementia concluded that the approach adopted by male carers was different to that of their female counterparts. The study showed that the male carers were task orientated and focused on problem solving with the effective use of available resources while maintaining meaning and satisfaction in their role. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1471301211421235">Russell (2007a)</xref> examined the transition of men from the workplace to care in the home setting. The study included older men (<italic>n</italic> = 30) and revealed the struggle of having to cope with caring in isolation in the home setting. Many made the transition by using a dyad of management and nurturing skills.</p>
<p>Other studies examined the tasks undertaken by men in their caregiving role. In a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1471301211421235">Russell (2007b)</xref> investigating two aspects of care, namely meal preparation and personal care, findings suggested that while men struggled with the demands of caregiving, entrenched in perceived masculine roles, they were more capable and willing to perform hands on personal care than had been reported previously. This too was evidenced in a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1471301211421235">Parsons (1997)</xref> which investigated the experience of five male spouses and three sons caring for a family member with Alzheimer's disease. Although the men expressed difficulty with the personal care element of their role, they persevered and displayed a readiness to learn new skills and take on new responsibilities. This sense of commitment was also evident in a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1471301211421235">Harris (1993)</xref> of husbands (<italic>n</italic> = 15) caring for wives with Alzheimer's disease. Harris conducted in depth interviews and identified four types of male caregiver: the worker, the labour of love, the sense of duty and at the crossroads. By incorporating knowledge of their former work role with the strong feelings they had for their wives, men directed themselves to the role of caregiver. Similarly, in a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1471301211421235">Cahill (2000)</xref> of older male spouses (<italic>n</italic> = 74) caring for wives with dementia, the participants demonstrated a strong commitment to their caring role. When asked what influenced their decision to care for their wives, they stated that their caring role grew out of <italic>‘love, marriage, duty or a combination of each’</italic> (p. 61).</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1471301211421235">Houde (2001)</xref> there is lack of research into the caregiving role of men in relation to culture and ethnic background. Culture influences a person's perception of familial responsibility and how this, in turn, influences caregiver burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1471301211421235">Etters, Goodall, &amp; Harrison, 2008</xref>). Consequently, it is important to understand how caregivers negotiate the conflict between cultural beliefs and the burden of their individual situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1471301211421235">Neary &amp; Feeney Mahoney, 2005</xref>). A qualitative study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211421235">Harris and Long (1999)</xref> examined the impact of culture on Japanese (<italic>n</italic> = 15) and American (<italic>n</italic> = 30) men in their caregiving roles and found that culture influenced the caregiving experience of both groups. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1471301211421235">Kwok (2006)</xref> carried out two research projects between 2002 and 2003 and found that adult sons in Hong Kong were the major caregivers in elderly care and actively participated in financial and emotional support. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1471301211421235">Kwok (2006)</xref> highlighted that the sons were in a position to take on the role as caregiver due to the contribution of their wives, further highlighting the complexity of gender divisions of work within culturally diverse family setting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1471301211421235"><title>Gender differences in caregiver burden</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211421235">Connell, Janevic, and Gallant (2001)</xref> suggested that the nature of caregiving and its effects on caregiver health are different for men and women. Burden is related to the individual caregiver and the behavioural, cognitive and functional impairment of the recipient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1471301211421235">Papastavrou, Kalokerinou, Papacostas, Tsangari, &amp; Sourtzi, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1471301211421235">Krisi et al. (2004)</xref> highlighted the way in which research has evolved around the realization that it is not only the wellbeing of persons with dementia that is affected by the disease, but also those close to them.</p>
<p>A literature review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1471301211421235">Baker and Robertson (2008)</xref> explored the phenomenon of coping with caring for a person with dementia. Of the nine articles focusing solely on men caring for a person with dementia, all were cross sectional in design and lacked generalizability due to small sample sizes. The only study that integrated a model of coping theory was by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1471301211421235">Kramer (1997)</xref>. Kramer used a cross-sectional study of husbands (<italic>n</italic> = 74) caring for their wives with dementia and considered how men appraised the caregiving situation in terms of strain (negative) and gain (positive). Findings revealed that those with less education, better social participation and better health experienced higher levels of gain. This study was further developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1471301211421235">Kramer (2000)</xref> who compared men who continued to look after their wives at home with those whose wives were in care homes. Kramer found that men who continued to care for their wives at home, considered the functional limitations of their spouses less stressful. They also displayed lower levels of depression. However, men whose wives were in care homes experienced no psychological improvement even though resources improved and stressors lessened. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1471301211421235">Sanders (2005)</xref>, in a qualitative study, interviewed female (<italic>n</italic> = 59) and male (<italic>n</italic> = 26) caregivers and found that sons reported the lowest levels of strain and gain, husbands the highest and daughters intermediate levels.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1471301211421235">Russell (2004)</xref> studied female (<italic>n</italic> = 45) and male (<italic>n</italic> = 16) spousal caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease. Results showed that male caregivers experienced less emotional distress than their female counterparts in self-reported scales and immune and bioinstrumentation parameters. A literature review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1471301211421235">Yee and Schulz (2000)</xref> reported that female caregivers experienced more negative outcomes from caregiving than their male counterparts. They also reported greater burden and strain from role conflicts such as work responsibilities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1471301211421235">Gallicchio et al. (2002)</xref> draws attention to the fact that the review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1471301211421235">Yee and Schulz (2000)</xref> was not focused exclusively on caregivers of dementia patients but also included other mentally/physically disabled elders. In addition, most of the studies in the review focused on spousal caregivers and not adult children or other relatives in a caregiving role. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1471301211421235">Gallicchio et al. (2002)</xref> carried out a study that involved the secondary analysis of an existing data set of females (<italic>n</italic> = 259) and males (<italic>n</italic> = 68). The results revealed that female caregivers experienced more burden than male caregivers. An Irish study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1471301211421235">Coen, O'Boyle, Coakley, and Lawlor, (2002)</xref> explored individual quality of life factors distinguishing low-burden and high-burden caregivers of a relative with dementia. The results showed an over representation of daughters in the higher-burden group compared to other family groups. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1471301211421235">Chumbler, Grimm, Cody, and Beck (2003)</xref> refuted these findings and found that there were no significant differences in caregiver burden between adult children and spouses. Although adult daughters scored higher burden scores than more distant relatives, they had equivalent scores to wives, sons, and husbands.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1471301211421235">Mannion (2008)</xref> investigated the physical and psychological effects of caring for a person with dementia. The sample consisted of female (<italic>n</italic> = 34) and male (<italic>n</italic> = 9) family caregivers. Results showed that a significant proportion of carers reported poor self rated health, depression, restless sleep and decreased tolerance for pain. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1471301211421235">Mannion (2008)</xref> found that gender was an important determinant of health with 75% of females reporting poor health compared with 25% of males. Similarly, a literature review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1471301211421235">Etters et al. (2008)</xref> highlighted that female caregivers reported more health problems than their male counterparts. Likewise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1471301211421235">Papastavrou et al. (2007)</xref> using a volunteer sample of females (<italic>n</italic> = 132) and males (<italic>n</italic> = 40) found that women had higher scores of burden and depression and suffered from more social deprivation than men in a caregiving role. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1471301211421235">Brown et al. (2007)</xref> in their grounded theory study of the help seeking behaviour of husbands (<italic>n</italic> = 9) whose wives had dementia, found a difference between older male and female caregivers in terms of depression, stress and burden with male caregivers reporting lower levels in these areas. They acknowledge that the reason for this is not known but indicated that it may be that men used more services or received more help. Personal health issues for example, sleep disorders, anxiety and fatigue may develop as a result of caregivers not taking time out for themselves, resulting in the caregiver becoming the first casualty of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1471301211421235">Juozapavicius &amp; Weber, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1471301211421235">Shanks-McElroy and Strobino (2001)</xref> in their survey study of male spousal caregivers of wives with dementia (<italic>n</italic> = 29) found that physical health problems increased by one third when pre- and post-caregiving data were compared. They emphasized that while caring for a person with dementia challenges the health of the spousal caregiver, the majority of the literature centres on the female experience and therefore generalizability to the male caregiver is difficult.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1471301211421235"><title>Support services</title>
<p>Findings are inconclusive in relation to male caregivers’ use of services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1471301211421235">Brown et al., 2007</xref>). Male caregivers, similar to their female counterparts depend on support from others to assist in their caregiving role but there is evidence to suggest that some men consider their interactions with support services to be unhelpful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1471301211421235">Coe &amp; Neufeld, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1471301211421235">Neufeld &amp; Kushner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1471301211421235">Russell, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1471301211421235">Coe and Neufeld (1999)</xref> conducted a grounded theory study on male caregiving. The sample mainly consisted of husbands (<italic>n</italic> = 17) and sons (<italic>n</italic> = 3) but also included one son in law, one brother, one grandson and one friend. Findings revealed that personal barriers deterred male caregivers from getting assistance and that men were isolated and reluctant to disclose their situation. It was only when men were faced with a crisis that they engaged in formal care and their interaction with the health care system and individual members had both enabling and disabling effects. A later study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1471301211421235">Neufeld and Kushner (2009)</xref> further investigated male carers’ experiences of non-supportive interactions. Results revealed the complexity and variation in male caregivers experiences of non-supportive interactions. These included lack of orientation to the caregiving situation, unsatisfactory linkage to support sources, insufficient support and hurtful interactions. The authors emphasized that although they may be unintentional, non-supportive interactions can result in a suspension of support and add to caregiver distress.</p>
<p>There is some evidence in the literature to suggest a difference in the ways in which male and female carers perceive support groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1471301211421235">Coe &amp; Neufeld, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1471301211421235">Lauderdale &amp; Gallagher-Thompson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1471301211421235">Siriopoulos, Brown, &amp; Wright, 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1471301211421235">Siriopoulos et al.

Seven male participants (six husbands and one son) took part in the study. Findings revealed that while support groups were an important service, caution was required when advertising support groups and the use of gender sensitive terms such as ‘workshop’, was considered more appropriate for men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1471301211421235">McFarland &amp; Sanders, 2000</xref>). Men were also more likely to contact such groups by encouragement from family or friends. The study also found that men viewed the opportunity to talk about things and pass on advice helpful and while it was difficult for men to share their feelings, the participants acknowledged that it was an important function of the group. Of particular interest to men was information on service availability, management issues in relation to care and practical skills training. This finding was supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1471301211421235">Gant, Steffen, &amp; Lauderdalae (2007)</xref> who found that the male caregivers (<italic>n</italic> = 32) interviewed preferred informational and skill development interventions over emotional focused interventions.

<p>While there is an ever-growing body of evidence on male carers there continues to be a dearth of studies on sons caring for a parent with dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1471301211421235">Sanders &amp; McFarland, 2002</xref>). Studies that dealt with sons addressed issues such as perception of the caregiving role, gender and masculinity, formal and informal services and parental bonding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1471301211421235">Campbell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1471301211421235">Campbell &amp; Carroll, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1471301211421235">Daire, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1471301211421235">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1471301211421235">Delgado &amp; Tennstedt, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211421235">Harris &amp; Long, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1471301211421235">Sanders &amp; McFarland, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1471301211421235">Delgado and Tennstedt (1997)</xref> examined the role of Puerto Rican sons as caregivers. They interviewed sons (<italic>n</italic> = 17) and daughters (<italic>n</italic> = 89) using qualitative and quantitative research methods. They found that sons provided 30 hours less caregiving and used fewer services than daughters, yet fulfilled the same caregiving responsibilities as daughters. Sons took on their caregiving role out of a sense of responsibility and helped more with transportation, financial management, shopping and housekeeping. A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211421235">Harris (1999)</xref> used grounded theory and a non-random sample of sons (<italic>n</italic> = 30) providing care to a parent with dementia. A total of 17% were African American and the remaining 83% were White males. The results of this study revealed common themes. These were duty, acceptance, taking charge, common emotions and work flexibility. The typology of sons as caregivers that emerged was the dutiful son, the one who goes the extra mile, the strategic planner and the son who shares the care.</p>
<p>A grounded theory study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1471301211421235">Sanders and McFarland (2002)</xref> used interviews to examine the role of sons (<italic>n</italic> = 18) caring for a parent with dementia. Fourteen of the sons cared for a mother with Alzheimer's disease and four cared for a father with Alzheimer's disease. Eleven of the sons had a sibling who assisted them in their caring role. Five categories emerged from the interviews. These were the initial reaction to memory loss, becoming a caregiver, women in the son's world, learning new roles, conflicts and uncomfortable situations. The findings revealed that sons experienced a multiplicity of emotional responses and personal and professional conflict as they acquired new roles and responsibilities in their endeavours to gain access to vital services for their parent with dementia. The limitations of the study included a lack of variation in sampling (the sample consisted of White middle-class males) and the rural location of most of the study participants. As a result, the findings may not be applicable to different socio-economic and cultural backgrounds. The majority of sons in this study cared for a mother with dementia and the authors acknowledged that a sample of sons caring for a father with dementia may have yielded different findings.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1471301211421235">Daire (2002)</xref> investigated the influence of childhood parental bonding on the emotional distress experienced by sons (<italic>n</italic> = 40) of a parent with dementia in a care facility. Data were collected through the use of the Parental Bonding Inventory (PBI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1471301211421235">Parker et al., 1979</xref>), the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1471301211421235">Derogatis, 1993</xref>) and the Caregiver Survey Questionnaire (CSQ). Results suggested that sons who had a close bond with their parents reported less distress with the caregiving role. The study was limited insofar as it only included sons whose parents were in care, suggesting a need for further studies to explore the phenomenon of sons in a caregiving role. A later study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1471301211421235">Daire (2004)</xref> investigated the use of the PBI as a tool to predict distress in sons caring for a parent with dementia. He concluded that the PBI had potential as a means of distinguishing family members who may be better suited to a caregiving role.</p>
<p>A qualitative study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1471301211421235">Campbell and Carroll (2007)</xref> investigated gender and masculinity of adult sons (<italic>n</italic> = 58) who provided care to an aging parent. A total of 40 sons provided care to their mothers, 15 sons provided care to a father and 3 sons provided care for both parents. Half of the male participants (<italic>n</italic> = 29) cared for a parent with Alzheimer's disease. The study addressed the significance of masculinity for male caregivers and an image of masculinity emerged from the interview that was quite different from the hegemonic ideal. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1471301211421235">Campbell and Carroll (2007)</xref> emphasized that the hegemonic ideal is not put in jeopardy by this non-hegemonic vision of masculinity. Limitations acknowledged by the researchers were lack of control for a variety of social characteristics such as class, culture and sexual orientation as this may have affected the conceptualization of masculinity. Although the sexual orientation of participants was not addressed, the researchers recommended that the relationship between caregiver sexual orientation and perception of masculinity may be an area worthy of investigation.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1471301211421235">Campbell (2010)</xref> conducted a qualitative study of filial caregiving for married and never-married sons caring for a parent (<italic>n</italic> = 48) and pointed out that while the phenomenon of female caregiving has been explained in the literature the diversity of male caregivers has been overshadowed. According to Campbell, caregivers fall into two categories: the ‘internalist’, which suggests that women are predisposed to the caregiving role because of their personality traits and as a result of early childhood experiences; and the ‘externalist’, which emphasizes outside factors that push or pull men and women into caregiving. Campbell points out that what is achieved by defining these two categories is a diversion from the focus of the diversity of male caregiving. Findings from this study demonstrated that the caregiving role for married sons was more limited than for never-married sons and that the caregiving role of never-married sons was more of a central element in their lives. Campbell acknowledged that the use of a different characteristic rather than marital status might have yielded different patterns in the analysis but added that the study would benefit from longitudinal data and the inclusion of sons from diverse social and ethnic backgrounds.</p>

<sec id="sec8-1471301211421235" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the literature review, 56 papers on men caring for a relative with dementia were critically appraised. The studies reviewed were carried out in the UK, USA, Australia, Finland, Cyprus, Sweden, Canada, China, South Africa, Japan and Ireland. Most of the studies reviewed were qualitative in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1471301211421235">Brown et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1471301211421235">Campbell &amp; Carroll, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1471301211421235">Pretorius et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1471301211421235">Russell, 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1471301211421235">2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1471301211421235">Sanders, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1471301211421235">Sanders &amp; McFarland, 2002</xref>) and used face-to-face interviews with data transcribed verbatim. Common limitations of these qualitative studies were lack of ethnicity and lack of differentiation by relationship to the carer, all of which reduce the generalizability of the findings. While the studies revealed valuable insights into the role of the male caregiver, the findings from these qualitative studies could be used to inform a quantitative study with a large, representative sample. There is also a need for more rigorous qualitative studies, longitudinal in nature, focusing solely on male caregiving in dementia. In addition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1471301211421235">Houde (2002)</xref> called for better controlled intervention studies to test novel interventions and compare the effect of the intervention (e.g. distress reduction) on both male and female caregivers.</p>
<p>Men are motivated to take on the role of caregiver for various reasons such as proximity to care, sibling involvement, being an only child, a sense of duty and their relationship with their relative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1471301211421235">Cahill, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1471301211421235">Parsons, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1471301211421235">Siriopoulus et al., 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1471301211421235">Daire (2002)</xref> identified the importance of the bond between parent and adult child as a factor influencing the decision of sons to take on a caregiving role. However, it may also be the case, particularly in rural areas, that the decision to care may be influenced to some extent by succession plans whereby the family home and/or farm may be ‘signed over’ to a son on the understanding that he will provide care to the parents if required. This view is supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1471301211421235">Heenan (2000)</xref> in her research on farming families in Northern Ireland when she described this arrangement as beneficial for everyone.</p>
<p>Gender-specific issues that arose in the literature highlighted that men experienced less emotional distress, physical and psychological effects than their female counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1471301211421235">Gallicchio et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1471301211421235">Kramer, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1471301211421235">Hagedoorn, Sanderman, Buunk, and Wobbes (2002)</xref> set out to examine the possible explanation for a common finding in the literature that female caregivers report more psychological distress than male caregivers. They found that it was only among female partners that self-efficacy and personal accomplishment were found to be positively linked to distress and in contrast to their male counterparts, female partners reported more distress when they acted less supportively. They concluded that the difference in psychological distress between male and female caregivers was influenced by a subgroup of partners who felt that were not doing a very good job at caregiving.</p>
<p>However, the review also suggests that men approach caregiving in a different way to that of their female counterparts. Men adopt a task-oriented approach, viewing it as an aspect of work to be completed. In doing so, they appear not to get as emotionally involved nor as distressed as female carers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1471301211421235">McFarland &amp; Sanders, 1999</xref>). However, the evidence base to support the hypothesis that men experience less stress than women is limited. It may be the case that men, not socialized to appear weak or vulnerable, may experience high levels of stress but be unwilling to admit this to a researcher. It may also be the case that men, although identified as carers, have support from wives and female family members whereas female carers may not be supported to the same extent either because of societal perceptions of the role of women in society or because they themselves do not seek help. It is also clear that culture plays an important part in moulding the role of the male caregiver. In Eastern society sons are portrayed as the primary carer. Yet, on closer examination, it appears that sons are able to assume this position because they receive assistance from their wives. Their role appears to be a more coordinating or supervisory role as opposed to a hands-on role. Further research is needed on the impact of culture and sex role stereotyping on male caregiving.</p>
<p>With the exception of a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1471301211421235">Kramer (1997)</xref>, the review revealed the limited number of studies that addressed coping, most of which were cross sectional, lacked generalizability and did not draw on coping theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1471301211421235">Cahill, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211421235">Harris &amp; Long, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1471301211421235">McFarland &amp; Sanders, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1471301211421235">Russell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1471301211421235">Siriopoulos et al., 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1471301211421235">Samuelsson et al. (2001)</xref> observed that sons in their study appeared to use problem-focused coping strategies and while the coping strategies used by men in caregiving roles warrant further investigation, it is possible that their rational approach may explain why male carers have been reported as experiencing less burden and strain than females.</p>
<p>The review also suggest that men, in general, do not find support groups as useful as their female counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1471301211421235">Siriopolous et al., 1999</xref>) and prefer informational and skill development interventions over emotional focused interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1471301211421235">Gant et al., 2007</xref>) with the latter considered more suitable for women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1471301211421235">Pretorius et al., 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1471301211421235">McFarland and Sanders (1999)</xref> suggested that men may find mentoring or support through telephone or computer media more effective than more traditional methods of support. However, caution must be observed in adopting a ‘one size fits all’ approach as male caregivers may even become more isolated if there only contact is of a ‘virtual’ nature.</p>

<sec id="sec9-1471301211421235" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>While the majority of research studies have addressed the caregiving experience of women, this review concludes that there is a lack of research on male caregiving in dementia. Men and women go about their caregiving role in different ways and greater consideration should be given to the specific needs of male carers, in particular sons. The review suggests that men are committed, capable and competent caregivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1471301211421235">Cahill, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1471301211421235">Sanders, 2007</xref>). As people continue to live longer, chronic illnesses, including dementia, will pose major challenges for family carers. This, coupled with the blurring of gender roles, is likely to result in an increase in male caregiving in dementia. In conclusion, while there are many similarities in the experiences of male and female carers, there are also potential differences and these merit further consideration in order to identify the interventions needed to enable men to carry out their caregiving role more effectively and to normalize the dogma of the male caregiver.</p>
