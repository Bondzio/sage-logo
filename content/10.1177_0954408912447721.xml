<abstract>
<p>An improved fixed orifice Joule Thomson cooling system has been obtained to provide a viable alternative to self-regulating Joule Thomson (J-T) coolers. It is based on the fact that Joule Thomson coolers require sufficiently lower gas flow for continued liquid formation. The inherent problem of high gas consumption of the system is solved electronically by reducing the gas flow to a sufficient level. Normally, in a self-regulated Joule Thompson cooling system, the flow reduction is achieved by reducing expansion orifice area through temperature-controlled mechanical bellow mechanism or flow area control mechanisms. In this article, an effort has been made to provide a gas-independent alternative to a self-regulating system which is always fluid specific.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954408912447721" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Joule Thomson (J-T) coolers are widely used for the spot cooling of infra red detectors in cryogenic temperatures in the range of 80 K to achieve their optimimal performance. Isenthalpic/J-T expansion of the gas compressed to high pressures are used to achieve the desired cooling and are contained in a vacuum insulated metal/glass instrumented Dewar. The expanded gas is cooled sufficiently by expansion for partially liquefying and to cool the detectors. To obtain cooling, the temperature of the working fluid, i.e. nitrogen, before expansion must be below the characteristic inversion temperature of 621 K. It is worthwhile to note that nitrogen is the preferred working fluid for the 80 K range due to its good compressibility, easy availability, inert nature and affordability.</p>
<p>Typically, a practical miniature J-T cooler consists of a recuperative finned tube heat exchanger, wound on a mandrel, an orifice to facilitate expansion, and an inlet port for entry of high pressure gas in to the heat exchanger. The recuperative heat exchanger cools the incoming high pressure gas to a temperature which is sufficient to provide the desired liquefaction temperature through isenthalpic expansion.</p>
<p>Joule Thomson coolers essentially require a high operating pressure of 25–30 MPa to provide large gas flow for commencement of the liquefaction of gas. High operating pressure also helps to achieve faster cooling. The gas is stored in a specially designed high pressure gas reservoir. The storage pressure can be as high as 60 MPa, depending on the safe working pressure of the reservoir. It has been observed that liquid formation continues even at lower gas pressures of 7 MPa. This experimental finding forms the basis of the present work. It implies that reduced gas flow is sufficient for the continuance of liquid formation. Fixed orifice J-T coolers operate on a fixed flow as their orifice has a fixed diameter and the system based on them has a serious handicap of short bottle duration time. As the volume of high pressure gas bottle is limited, its duration time is substantially increased by reducing the regulated pressure to a level, which is sufficient to give the required gas flow rate to maintain liquefaction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0954408912447721"><title>Basic principle</title>
<p>Gas flow through an orifice is dependent on orifice diameter, gas pressure and environmental temperature. Self-regulating coolers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954408912447721">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954408912447721">2</xref></sup> achieve reduction in flow by reducing the orifice diameter with the help of a pressurized bellow mechanism in the mini cooler. Other mechanisms of orifice area reductions have been tried and patented<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954408912447721">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954408912447721">9</xref></sup> by many researchers, but in the present study, self-regulating coolers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954408912447721">10</xref></sup> with temperature sensitive bellow have been discussed and compared with fixed orifice J-T coolers. The bellow mechanism in the self-regulating coolers is active when liquid formation is achieved and lower flow rate is obtained through the temperature sensitive bellow mechanism which activates a control needle to reduce the orifice area.</p>
<p>The present scheme uses the electronic pressure regulator (EPR) unit in place of a mechanical pressure regulator to control the flow by reducing the pressure to a level sufficient for the continuing liquefaction process for a fixed orifice J-T cooler which is simple in construction, low in cost and easy to maintain.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954408912447721">Figure 1</xref> shows the general layout of a basic Joule-Thomson cooling system. It comprises a high pressure gas bottle, mechanical pressure regulator and the Detector Dewar Cooler Assembly (DDCA). The fixed orifice J-T coolers have two flow levels of working fluid namely, making flow and sustaining flow. Making flow corresponds to higher operating pressure (level 1) whereas sustaining flow corresponds to lower pressure (level 2). Making flow level is the minimum required level but can be increased by opting for a higher operating pressure to meet lower cool down time requirement. Similarly sustaining flow level is the minimum flow needed for liquefaction. The value of level 2 pressures may not be same for all coolers which need to be experimentally determined.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954408912447721">Figure 2</xref> shows a layout diagram of an improved version of the basic fixed orifice J-T cooling system shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954408912447721">Figure 1</xref>. It comprises a high pressure gas bottle (1) with quick release valve (2), EPR unit (14), programmable logic controller (PLC)/computer (13), analog-digital (A/D) converter (12) and the DDCA (4). The temperature feedback signal of DDCA is fed to EPR unit (13) through A/D converter (12) for reducing the pressure. A/D converter converts the analog resistance signal of Resistance Temperature Detector (RTD) into digital signal of 4–20 mA/0–5 V. This temperature is predetermined and obtaining this signal implies achieving the required cooling temperature in the DDCA. Gas consumption is substantially reduced by reducing the output gas pressure of the EPR unit from level 1 to level 2. The reduction of operating pressure of level 1 to level 2, after the liquefaction/achieving cooling temperature is achieved by providing a cooling temperature digital feedback signal from the DDCA to the PLC through the A/D converter. On receiving a temperature feedback signal, the PLC/computer gives a set point (20) command to the EPR, which reduces its output pressure to a pre set level 2. Thus the EPR provides two pressure settings through a PLC for operating between two output pressure levels as per the temperature feedback signal (gas specific) from the DDCA. These pressure levels have been experimentally decided and are cooler specific.
<fig id="fig2-0954408912447721" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Improved cooling system.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954408912447721-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954408912447721">Figure 3</xref> explains the working of electronic pressure regulator unit which is an assembly of a dome regulator (17) integrated with an electronic regulator (18), pressure gauges (23,24,25), pilot regulators (21,22) along with piping, connectors, etc. The assembly is divided into two lines namely process line (15) and pilot line (16). The desired pressure reduction is carried out by using the EPR unit. The inlet pressure from the high pressure bottle is reduced to the desired range of outlet pressure by the dome regulator (17) and electronic regulator (20) sub assembly. The electronic regulator is controlling the dome regulator. The electronic regulator requires a constant pilot air supply of 0.70 MPa. The pilot supply line consists of two regulators, which reduce the pressure in two stages. The primary regulator (21) reduces the pressure to 10 MPa while the secondary regulator (22) further reduces this pressure to 0.70 MPa which goes to inlet of the electronic regulator. Pressures of 0.7 MPa and 10 MPa are chosen as these are the minimum required set values of secondary and primary regulators, respectively. Pressure gauges in the system will show the inlet pressure (23), primary regulator outlet pressure (24), secondary regulator outlet pressure (25), and the process outlet pressure (19). The co-relation between temperature and pressure can be set with the electronic regulator software operated through the PLC/computer. It has an input port for digital temperature signal from the A/D converter (12). The response time of the EPR is 50 ms with an accuracy of 1%. The feed to process and pilot lines is provided by branching of pressure input line to the unit. Outlet port provides the regulated pressure to the DDCA (4).</p>

<p>The DDCA comprises I-R detector (11a), which is to be cooled, Dewar (8) which provides the proper metallic/glass encapsulation to fixed orifice J-T cooler (6) and has requisite instrumentation namely, resistance thermometer (RTD) (11b) and fixed orifice J-T cooler. The fixed orifice J-T cooler has a recuperative counter flow heat exchanger comprising miniature finned tube (9) wound on an insulating/thin walled mandrel (7). As the cooling progresses, the resistance of the RTD decreases. In case of PT 100 RTD, the resistance is 19 Ω at 78 K. This signal is then fed to the A/D converter for further processing.</p>

<p>The experiment was laid out as per <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954408912447721">Figure 1</xref> in the controlled environment temperature of 300 K and the output of the pressure regulator was set at 14 MPa.

<p>The liquefaction was observed continuously even when the bottle pressure fell just below the set pressure output (14 MPa) level of regulator. The experiment was continued even after the bottle pressure fell below the preset regulator output pressure to record the lowest bottle pressure needed for continued cooling. Bottle pressure and cooling temperatures were recorded at regular intervals. The observations made were:

<sec id="sec7-0954408912447721"><title>Improved cooling system</title>
<p>The minimum pressure (level 2) required to provide continued liquefaction of 7 MPa was experimentally determined. The experiment was laid as per <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954408912447721">Figure 2</xref> and the fixed orifice cooler of the experiment “Basic cooling system” was used. The EPR has a feedback port which was connected to temperature output signal of detector of the DDCA. The EPR output was then connected to inlet port of mini cooler (1 W fixed orifice J-T cooler) of the DDCA. The EPR possesses one more command port which is connected to the PLC. The PLC is used to give command for level 1 and level 2 pressure settings to the EPR. The EPR was set to level 1 (14 MPa) and level 2 (7 MPa) for switching over from level 1 and level 2. The value of level 2 pressure of 7 MPa was observed from the experiment using basic cooling system.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0954408912447721"><title>Operating procedure</title>
<p>In the beginning, gas at level 1 pressure was fed to the DDCA inlet port and cooling process was initiated and the temperature fall of detector recorded and its signal fed to the PLC. Once the temperature reached the preset level, the PLC gives a command to the EPR to bring down the EPR output pressure to level 2. Thus the DDCA inlet port received reduced pressure but the process of liquefaction continues till the gas is available in the reservoir at level 2 pressures. The indication of insufficient bottle pressure is the increase of temperature of detector. The PLC is suitably programmed to switch off system once the EPR input is less than set level</p>

<p>The make time observed for the self-regulating cooler is almost 80% higher than the fixed orifice cooler as the initial flow rate is higher in this case.</p>
<p>The demand flow system gave the maximum bottle duration time. However, this gain has a higher price too, as the self-regulating cooler is thrice the cost of a fixed orifice cooler.</p>
<p>The improved cooling system using the EPR controlled fixed orifice cooler gave a reasonably good make time as well as bottle duration. The additional cost (∼10%) of the EPR unit is partially offset by the cheaper fixed orifice cooler and the absence of a mechanical pressure regulator in the circuit.</p>
<p>The space occupied by the EPR system is much more than the mechanical pressure regulator-based cooling system. But overall size is a matter of concern only in the case of mobile systems. For laboratory-based systems, a decision has to be taken between price and space available.</p>
<p>The flow rates indicated in the various experimental observations are mean values. The variation of flow rates in all the experiments have been shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954408912447721">Figure 4</xref>. In the experiment using the basic cooling system, the flow rate values were almost constant until the bottle pressure reached the value of output value of pressure regulator. Later it was found to be regularly decreasing with decrease in the bottle pressure. In the case of the demand flow cooling system, most of the time, the flow rate was 1.5 normal liter/minute while the flow rate of 5.5 normal liter/minute was observed only during liquid formation phase. In the EPR-based system, the flow rate was high (9.3 normal liter/minute) as pressure settings were set at level 1 to meet the make time requirement of 1 min. The operating pressures were brought down to level 2 to maintain the liquid nitrogen pool in the Dewar.
<fig id="fig4-0954408912447721" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Flow rate variation with time.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954408912447721-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The temperature stability was double in case of improved cooling system since this system is pressure based whereas self-regulating coolers control flow only during temperature increase from preset value.</p>
<p>For a heat seeking role in air-borne mode, the EPR-based cooling system is cost effective as most of the hardware stays back with mother system and only comparatively cheaper fixed orifice cooler accompanies the seeker assembly, which eventually gets destroyed. The recurring cost for cooler is reduced to one third though fixed cost is enhanced.</p>
<p>From <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954408912447721">Table 2</xref>, it is seen that the EPR-based cooling system is able to provide a 219% improvement in bottle duration time as compared to the mechanical regulator-based system. This improvement is comparable with the self-regulating cooling system where the improvement is 268%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0954408912447721" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The EPR-based scheme is independent of working fluid as bellow controlled self-regulating coolers are to be predesigned for intended working fluid. The bellows system is also to be filled with the same working fluid below critical pressure.</p>
<p>The proposed electronically regulated cooling system is more robust as bellow leakage and malfunctioning of needle control mechanism is not associated with it. This is best suited for air borne heat seeking role due to its low recurring cost.</p>
