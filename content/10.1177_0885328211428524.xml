<abstract>
<p>The article describes the design of the multicomponent hydrogel system of poly(acrylic acid-HEMA)/gelatin for tissue engineering application. Derivative of polycaprolactone-diol (polycaprolactone diacrylate (PCL-DAr)) was used to cross-link acrylate monomers whereas gelatin was kept free for cell proliferation. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), an anti-oxidant phytochemical, was loaded by diffusion method. Its in vitro release study in PBS (pH 6.5) at 37 ± 0.2°C (75 rpm) revealed a sustained release profile upto 20 days. Fitting of drug release data in Korsmeyer-Peppas model equation revealed probable release mechanism through the value of release coefficient (<italic>n</italic>), which was found to depend on formulations composition. Drug-polymer interaction, thermal behavior, and surface morphology were investigated by attenuated total reflectance–Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and scanning electron microscopic (SEM). Swelling behavior of hydrogel in PBS (pH 6.5 and 7.4, 0.2 M) and in distilled water was found to increase with increasing AAc/HEMA ratio. Compression modulus decreased from 203 ± 3.7 KPa to 11.6 ± 1.1KPa, at 30% strain, whereas displacement values significantly increased from 3.2 ± 0.2 to 4.7 ± 0.6 mm at 20 N force (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), with increasing AAc/HEMA ratio. Percentage cell viability was analyzed using indirect 3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazolyl-2]-2,5-diphenyltetrazo-liumbromide (MTT) assay with fibroblast L929 cells; showed ≥92.3% cell viability after 24 h incubation. Cell proliferation on the scaffold surface was found to increase with incorporation of HEMA in P(AAc)/G cross-linked hydrogel matrix upto a certain extent. These biocompatible, elastic, and swellable hydrogels can serve as a matrix for drug delivery and tissue engineering applications.</p>

<p>Hydrogels are three-dimensional (3D) cross-linked polymeric structures, possess water retention capacity, and have soft tissue-like consistency. Their inherent water-absorbing property makes them a suitable architecture for controlled drug delivery applications for dermatological patches or films, soft tissue regeneration (bone, cartilage, skin, blood vessel, etc), and for various other biomedical and pharmaceutical applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328211428524">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328211428524">6</xref></sup> Controlled release of potent drugs at the desired site of application is a crucial and desirable property of drug carrier which offers many advantages (i.e. higher therapeutic efficacy with minimum drug induced side effects, patient compliance as well as cost effectiveness of the drug regime) over conventional drug delivery systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328211428524">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328211428524">10</xref></sup> The drug release profile from the hydrogel is influence by many biological (pH, temperature, and biochemical microenvironment at the site of application) and physicochemical (functionality of polymer network) factors. These factors ultimately affect swelling, degradation, compression, and other important properties of the matrices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328211428524">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328211428524">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328211428524">13</xref></sup> In spite of many favorable properties, hydrogels are devoid of mechanical strength, which limits their biomedical and pharmaceutical applications. Various research schools improved the mechanical strength and elasticity by formulating interpenetrating polymeric network (IPNs) matrices and by incorporating nanocomposite materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328211428524">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328211428524">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>For adhesion and proliferation of cells, we need platforms that possess biological activity as well as strength and elasticity. Various natural and synthetic biomaterials have been explored by the researchers for the hydrogel synthesis for numerous biomedical and pharmaceutical applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328211428524">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328211428524">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328211428524">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885328211428524">20</xref></sup> We authors designed a multicomponent hydrogel scaffold based on poly (acrylic acid-2-hydroxy ethyl methacrylate)/gelatin. They integrated chemically, morphologically, and functionally, resulting into novel hydrogel system with defined functionality.</p>
<p>Polyacrylic acid (PAAc) is an FDA-approved anionic polymer, which have excellent swelling properties in alkaline media. On the other hand, a non-ionic monomer, hydroxyethyl-methacrylate (HEMA), possessing limited water absorption capacity, was added in varying ratio with AAc to regulate swelling and other physicochemical properties. Elasticity and extracellular matrix (ECM) mimetic properties were introduced by incorporating gelatin into this system. Gelatin is a natural polypeptide comprised of three polypeptide chains arranged in α-helical structure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328211428524">17</xref></sup> Authors choose it as their first choice owing to its versatile properties viz. non-immunogenicity, biocompatibility, cell responsiveness and cost-effectiveness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328211428524">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328211428524">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328211428524">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is a major poly-phenolic compound from green tea possessing excellent antitumor and wound healing potential due to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and free radical scavenging properties. Moreover, at low concentration, EGCG promotes the angiogenesis and re-epithelization by triggering myofibroblasts and keratinocytes. In case of wound healing application, an optimum concentration of EGCG is required for achieving maximum healing rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885328211428524">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885328211428524">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>With consideration of above facts and desirability, multicomponent hydrogel scaffold of PAAc, HEMA, and gelatin have been constructed using polycaprolactone diacrylate (PCL-DAr) as a cross-linking agent. The suitable polymers were selected to meet the desired properties such as swelling, elasticity, biocompatibility, and controlled drug release profile. Gelatin was intercalated into the acrylate network without cross-linking. The effect of feed composition on EGCG release profile and kinetics were investigated using fickian diffusion model and Korsmeyer-Peppas model. Physicochemical characterizations of matrices were carried out by attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectra, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) examination. The compression properties, weight loss profile, and equilibrium swelling ratio was also investigated as a prerequisite characterization of hydrogel formulations. The biocompatibility studies were performed by 3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazolyl-2]-2,5-diphenyltetrazo-liumbromide (MTT) assay and the effect of PAc/P (HEMA) ratio on cell proliferation were established using fibroblast L929 cells. The aim of the present study was to formulate a biocompatible hydrogel scaffold for soft tissue engineering particularly for wound healing.</p>

<p>Thermal initiated radical polymerization method was used for the synthesis of P(AAc-Hm)/G hydrogels with poly caprolactone diacrylate (PCL-DAr) as a cross-linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0885328211428524">Scheme 1</xref>). APS and TEMED being water-soluble initiators and provide an advantage of initiating the polymerization reaction at low temperature in aqueous media and avoid harsh treatment of the proteineous component. The dissolved oxygen from water was removed by N<sub>2</sub> bubbling for 15 min for maximizing polymerization. Additionally, the reaction temperature was kept below 25°C prior to initiator addition to prevent pre-activation of initiators. With consideration of needful biocompatibility, mechanical strength, as well as swelling and degradation profile, monomers and cross-linker were selected. Polyacrylic acid, a hydrophilic polymer, imparts swelling properties to the hydrogels while P(HEMA) contributes for mechanical strength and gelatin, a natural biopolymer, conferred excellent biocompatibility. It also helps in tailoring the characteristic properties of cell proliferation to the matrix for tissue engineering applications. Additionally, in comparison to bisacrylamide and other small molecular weight cross-linkers, PCL-DAr contributes to the elasticity of the hydrogels.

The ratio of AAc/HEMA influenced the swelling properties of matrices, which eventually modulates their morphology and pore size. Swelling of matrices increased with increasing PAAc content (section Swelling properties), which eventually governed the sizing of ice crystals during freezing before lyophilization. Pore size was measured from 10 randomly selected surface areas and the mean ±SD was used to interpret the data.

It is hypothesized that under normal incubation conditions, hydrogel lose their weight by two ways, first, due to release of uncross-linked gelatin with increasing swelling of the system, secondly, due to breaking of the cross-linking as a result of cleavage of ester bonds of PCL-DAr with the formation of macromers of long chain P(AAc-Hm). Polyacrylic acid and P(HEMA) both are essentially nondegradable system, but incorporation of gelatin enhance the swelling of the matrices in buffer media which eventually leads to the leaching of gelatin out of the matrices. Due to incorporation of gelatin, comparatively a loose network was formed which led the matrices to leach the gelatin in a time-dependent manner, which eventually enhanced the EGCG release profile too.

In case of hydrogels, gradual increment in compression modulus (from 53.2 ± 1.1 to 92 ± 3.4) was observed with increased HEMA/AAc ratio (from 3/7 to 7/3) of the matrices. This could be the result of comparatively reduced swelling capacity of hydrogels with higher P(HEMA) content (swelling properties of the matrices; Figure 5). It also offered lesser amount of water to be available in the matrix for displacement during compression resulting in decreased displacement values with increasing HEMA content (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).

<p>MTT assay is a well-recognized and quick method to evaluate cytocompatibility of the biomaterials as a preliminary biocompatibility test before proceeding to in vivo applications. The assay is based on reduction of MTT into insoluble violet color formazan crystals by mitochondrial enzymes of viable cells. Indirect MTT assay method (using extracts of composite matrices) ensures the possible availability of any toxic chemicals (unreacted monomers) in the formulations as well as ensures the flawless polymerization reaction during their preparation. Calcein AM penetrates the cell membrane of living cells. Once inside, the cellular esterase present in living cells hydrolyze it into calcien, which is cell membrane-impermeable and gives its emission maximum at 515 nm. The cell viability was tested after 24 h of incubation of extract. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0885328211428524">Figure 8</xref>, it was found that in all the formulations, more than 92.3 ± 2% viability was observed in comparison to positive control (gelatin). Additionally, percentage viability did not change with varying extract volume. Cell viability data were calculated from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-0885328211428524">Equation 3</xref> and as a mean of ±SD, <italic>n</italic> = 6.

<p>To know the effect of matrix surface on cell proliferation, fibroblast L929 cells were seeded and their morphology and quantity were evaluated on days 1, 3, and 5. Cells stained with Calcien AM demonstrated that with decreasing AAc/HEMA ratio from 1:0 to 1:1 (i.e. P(AAc<sub>1</sub>Hm<sub>0</sub>)/G to P(AAc<sub>1</sub>Hm<sub>1</sub>)/G), a significant improvement was observed in the cell quantity on the surface of matrices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0885328211428524">Figure 9</xref>). The attached cells found their natural morphology and confluency on day 5. Increasing HEMA content decreased the anionic properties of the scaffolds, as a result, the cell attachment and proliferation were found to enhance.

<p>Due to the presence of −COO<sup>−</sup> groups, PAc surface is anionic in nature. It is well-known that neutral and anionic surfaces do not allow negatively charged cell membrane to attach on the surface. Therefore in this study, PAc content of the matrices was replaced with gelatin (upto its maximum loading concentration) while P(HEMA) content increased from 0 to 100 and of PAc ration (w/w). Thereby, with decreasing PAc content to 30% by P(HEMA) and 40% by gelatin, we were able to make an interpenetrating network that allowed the cells to attach and proliferate. In addition, crucial hydrogel properties such as swelling, biocompatibility and mechanical properties were retained.</p>

<sec id="sec26-0885328211428524"><title>Drug loading and release profile</title>
<p>EGCG was loaded by diffusion method. The dry sample discs were incubated into the required quantity of aqueous solution of EGCG for 24 h at room temperature. The amount of distilled water used for drug dissolution was estimated to ensure that whole of the solution will get absorbed without spilling. The loosely adhered drug on the discs surface was removed by dipping of discs in distilled water for 10 s following drying at room temperature for further drug release experiments. Percentage drug loading and percentage loading efficiency of hydrogels was found to be 1.85 ± 0.55% and 96 ± 1.5%, respectively. %DL increased with increasing AAc/HEMA ratio in the hydrogels, since swelling in distilled water was increasing in the same ratio. On the other hand, %LE was also regulated by swelling capacity of matrices.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0885328211428524">Figure 10</xref> depicts the percentage cumulative release profile of EGCG from all formulation with respect to time. It was noticed that almost ∼53% and ∼74% of drug has been released from PAAc hydrogels within 48 h and 96 h, in contrast to 26% and 38% from P(HEMA) hydrogels. On the other hand, only 9% of total drug remains into the PAAc hydrogel network in contrast to 38% from P(HEMA) hydrogels after 20 days. In case of hydrogels, nearly 27%, 33%, 40%, and 38% of drug released within 48 h while ∼41%, ∼50%, ∼57%, and ∼58% of drug released within 96 h from P(AAc<sub>4</sub>Hm<sub>6</sub>)G, P(AAc<sub>5</sub>Hm<sub>5</sub>)G, P(AAc<sub>6</sub>Hm<sub>4</sub>)G, and P(AAc<sub>7</sub>Hm<sub>3</sub>)G hydrogels. The drug release data from these formulations indicate that with increasing PAAc content of the matrices, cumulative release of EGCG increased. These results can be explained on the basis of the influence of swelling and weight loss profile of the matrices (under the sub-section ‘swelling properties’ and ‘weight loss profile’, Fgures 5 and 6). In buffer media (pH 6.5, 0.2 M), ionic repulsion of carboxyl ions (−COO<sup>−</sup>) resulted into expansion of polyacrylic acid chains thereby, gelatin was released from the matrices as per AAc/HEMA ratio. This led to faster and complete release of drug from the network having higher PAAc content while maximum drug retained inside P(HEMA) hydrogels (i.e. least swelling). Due to interpenetrating network formation of three polymeric components, PAAc, P(HEMA), and gelatin, sustained release profile of EGCG was observed in comparison to pure hydrogels [i.e. PAAc and P(HEMA)]. Tailoring of formulation compositions according to needful sustained release of EGCG for in-vivo wound healing applications is a crucial and novel feature of these formulations. Drug-polymer interactions also play a significant role in its release from the matrix. Physical interaction of hydroxyl (−OH) groups of EGCG with free functional groups of gelatin (−NH<sub>2</sub>, −COOH,) and PAAc (−COOH) make the drug to remain inside the network and which act like a depot for EGCG-sustained release (as depicted in ATR-FTIR spectra of EGCG laden semi-IPN matrix; Supplementary data). Downward shifting and reduced intensity of −C = O of PAAc at 1716 cm<sup>−1</sup> from 1723 cm<sup>−1</sup> as well as shifting of bands from 1653, 1543, and 1453 cm<sup>−1</sup> to 1636, 1530, and 1446 cm<sup>−1</sup>, respectively, indicated the formation of H-bonds between EGCG and P(AAcHm)/G semi-IPN constructs. It was found that approximately (90%) and (58%) of the drug was released from PAAC hydrogel and P(AAcHm)G composite hydrogel in the presence of H-bonds among (−COOH,−OH) of polymers chains and EGCG. It indicates that swelling was the main contributing factor for EGCG release behavior from PAc system while swelling as well as gelatin release both regulate the drug release behavior of P(AcHm)G matrices.

<p>The linearity was calculated by plotting the logarithm of the % drug release versus logarithm of time. The exponent (n) reveals the dynamics of EGCG release from hydrogels, which was calculated from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula7-0885328211428524">Equation 7</xref>. According to Korsmeyer-Peppas equation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328211428524">26</xref></sup> fickian diffusion (Case-I transport) occurs when <italic>n</italic> ≤ 0.5, while non-Fickian release (anomalous transport) is assumed when 0.5 &lt; <italic>n</italic> &lt; 1.0. From the slope of the linear plot of In (f) versus In (t), the diffusion exponent value (<italic>n</italic>) was obtained. The diffusion exponent value (<italic>n</italic>) for formulation PAAc, P(HEMA), P(AAc<sub>3</sub>Hm<sub>7</sub>)G, P(AAc<sub>4</sub>Hm<sub>6</sub>)G, P(AAc<sub>5</sub>Hm<sub>5</sub>)G, P(AAc<sub>6</sub>Hm<sub>4</sub>)G, and P(AAc<sub>7</sub>Hm<sub>3</sub>)G was found to be 0.354, 0.398, 0.529, 0.611, 0.536, 0.535, and 0.504, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0885328211428524">Table 2</xref>). It was observed that single component hydrogels followed the fickian rule (n value &lt; 0.5), whereas, hydrogels followed both diffusion and erosion mechanism (<italic>n</italic> value &gt;0.5).</p>
<p>Hydrogels were made-up of various monomer/polymer components (Table 2) where AAc and HEMA were crosslinked with PCL-DAr whereas, gelatin chains remain free and were intercalating into the 3-dimentional P(AAC-HEMA) network. From the value of diffusion exponent (n), the plot of In (f) versus In (t), it was found that release of EGCG from interpenetrating network was governed by PAAc/P(HEMA) ratio. With increasing PAAc and decreasing P(HEMA) concentration, the value of diffusion coefficient (n) varied from 0.529 to 0.504, while in case of hydrogels [PAAc &amp; P(HEMA)], the <italic>n</italic> values were found to be less than 0.5, hence it was suggested that solvent (PBS) penetration was a rate-limiting step in dense polymeric network (Hydrogels) thereby, EGCG from these networks was released primarily by diffusion mechanism.</p>

<p>Conclusively, biocompatible 3-dimentional multicomponent hydrogels were successfully prepared by redox-initiated thermal polymerization, where gelatin chains intercalated in between P(AAc/HEMA) cross-linked network. The composite matrix played significant role in cell proliferation, elasticity, and drug release. Gelatin helped in the cell attachment and proliferation, whereas the composite hydrogel matrices of P(HEMA) and PAAc not only provides hydrated environment for the optimum cell growth but also the strength and elasticity that furthermore regulate drug release profile. Moreover, their tunable physical properties, sustained release of EGCG, cytocompatibility, and cell proliferation performance gave an outlook to utilize these formulations for pharmaceutical and soft tissue engineering.</p>
