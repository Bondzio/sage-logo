<p>Over the past 25 years, attempts to increase the quality of visitor experiences have been a priority in outdoor recreational areas for planners and managers. Recreation planners should determine acceptable usage levels for an area before making planning decisions. Physical, economical, ecological and social carrying capacity of that area must be determined, in order to assess acceptable usage levels. In this study, the influence of the characteristics of the area on visitor perception of user density levels was evaluated. The activity of walking was chosen to determine the perception of the user density level. Walking was chosen because it is a recreational activity that can be performed easily and frequently by visitors of outdoor recreational areas without any need for experience. Factors affecting the perception and effects of the user density level on visitors were examined from urban recreational areas to rural recreational areas. According to our results, characteristics of the recreational area and changes in the perception of suitable user density levels varied according to the recreational activities performed in an area. Specifically, rural recreation users tolerated less user density. In contrast to the expected, female users preferred lower user density.</p></abstract>

<sec id="sec1-1420326X12451986"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the past 25 years, attempts to increase the quality of visitor experiences in outdoor recreational areas have been a priority for recreational planners and managers. According to previous research, the perception of crowding has an influence on the satisfaction of visitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X12451986">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1420326X12451986">3</xref>]. Consequently, the terms “recreational experience quality” and “user density perception” have been created [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1420326X12451986">4</xref>]. The majority of studies on this subject are on three basic topics and their effects on recreational experiences. The first topic deals with “encountered visitors”. Encountered visitors are those visitors seen by a visitor during his/her trip or in the area he/she used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1420326X12451986">5</xref>]. The second topic is the perception of the user density level. There is a negative perception of the amount of encountered visitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X12451986">6</xref>]. The third topic addressed is the “norm”. The norm is the standard that determines acceptability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1420326X12451986">7</xref>]. These concepts help researchers evaluate the perception of the user density level. Recreational optimum user density levels may determine quality standards of an area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1420326X12451986">8</xref>]. Therefore, optimum recreational user density levels should be determined and managed.</p>
<p>In this study, the recreational suitability of different user densities in the roads of different recreational areas was examined, and to identify optimum user density in these areas. The recreation area characteristics and user characteristics were also evaluated.</p>
<p>Previous studies that aim to determine and manage the perception of crowding have proven that visitors develop behaviours according to the recreational area’s situation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1420326X12451986">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X12451986">11</xref>]. Recreational visitors show three basic behaviours in the face of the perception of crowding: product shift, rationalisation and displacement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X12451986">12</xref>]. In this context, product shift refers to changing the recreational activities in the area, rationalisation, involves the change of expectation from the area, and displacement is simply moving to other recreational area. Research has revealed that increasing usage density causes a change in visitor expectations or, in other words, a change in visitor experiences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1420326X12451986">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1420326X12451986">14</xref>]. According to the study conducted by Shelby et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X12451986">11</xref>], one-third of the visitors who encountered unexpectedly high usage density showed the behaviour of rationalisation rather than displacement. While the change of expectations is an intellectual response, changing recreational activity or the recreation area itself are behavioural responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1420326X12451986">15</xref>]. Behavioural responses of visitors include trying alternative areas within the main recreation area, changing the time of arrival in the area, changing their recreational activities or choosing another recreation area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X12451986">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1420326X12451986">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1420326X12451986">16</xref>].</p>
<p>Determining the norms that can be used to set usage standards in recreational areas has interested many researchers over the last 20 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X12451986">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X12451986">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1420326X12451986">17</xref>]. Researchers have primarily used the measures of acceptability and unacceptability to evaluate recreational activities and environmental situations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1420326X12451986">18</xref>]. Consequently, attempts to establish recreational management models, such as Limits of Acceptable Change (LAC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1420326X12451986">19</xref>] and Visitor Experience and Resource Protection (VERP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1420326X12451986">20</xref>], have been initiated. These models consider information on social structure, resources and management into consideration when determining standards. The models also investigate how many of the changes which may occur would be acceptable to users. In studies attempting to determine standards, the norms regarding social structure are primarily investigated. The most popular norm examined is the perception of crowding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1420326X12451986">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1420326X12451986">21</xref>].</p>
<p>A popular method to determine recreational standards is the use of photographs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1420326X12451986">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1420326X12451986">23</xref>]. This method also keeps the interest of survey participants alive. Shelby and Harris [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1420326X12451986">24</xref>] have compared different methods used to examine the evaluations of visitors for recreational areas. However, it is difficult to create suitable examples of the evaluation of visitors. In this study, the use of photographs due to low cost, convenience and reliability was adopted. Shelby and Harris [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1420326X12451986">24</xref>] found that using photographs was the second best method for determining recreational standards where an ideal method would be creating concrete real-life recreational environment. Manning et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1420326X12451986">22</xref>] found that the statistical differences between the measurements done in an area and the results from using photographs are very small.</p>
<p>There are many studies that use photographs to determine recreational standards. There are various methods used to evaluate the photographs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1420326X12451986">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1420326X12451986">26</xref>], but these methods can be divided into two main categories. The first method is to evaluate photographs one by one. This method is called the “overall evaluation method”. With this method, it is possible to obtain information for nearly every situation within an area. However, this method takes a long time and is a tedious process for evaluators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1420326X12451986">7</xref>]. The other method requires the evaluator to pick the best or the worst photograph among a series of photographs regarding the area of interest. This method is called the “specific evaluation method”. This method is easier and takes less time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1420326X12451986">7</xref>]. However, Kim and Shelby [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1420326X12451986">27</xref>] found that survey participants preferred the overall evaluation method rather than the specific evaluation method.</p>
<p>In previous studies, the effect of the perception of crowding differed in the determination of the quality of recreational experiences of visitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1420326X12451986">3</xref>]. When we examined the reasons for this difference, we encountered many factors (as indicated above). Most of the previous studies have determined that the elements causing these differences are associated with visitors’ preferred recreational activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1420326X12451986">5</xref>]. There are few studies that have examined the interaction between recreational areas preferred by visitors and their perception of crowding. The existing studies have examined recreational areas within rural regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1420326X12451986">28</xref>]. Rural recreational areas and urban recreational areas had not previously been compared in terms of visitors’ perception of crowding until our study. In this study, the differences between the perceptions of crowding by visitors in rural recreational areas and by visitors in urban recreational areas were examined.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1420326X12451986" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>In this study, the influence of the characteristics of the area on visitor perception of user density levels was examined. In order to determine the perception of the user density level, the activity of walking was chosen. Walking was chosen because it is a recreational activity that can be performed easily and frequently by visitors of outdoor recreational areas without any need for experience. Images were taken from Abant Natural Park, which is the most used rural recreation area. As to represent urban recreational area, the images were taken from a route frequently used by vehicles, pedestrian and joggers. In the selection of these areas survey participants’ experiences about the areas is considered.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-1420326X12451986"><title>Photographs</title>
<p>We established criteria to determine the areas to be photographed. First, areas had to have a very clear difference between rural and urban areas. Rural and urban areas had similar road widths and lengths in all photographs taken. Photographs were taken in similar seasons and at similar times, and the same camera was used for all photographs. Density of people ranged from 1 to 10 in separate images, and place and angle of capture were the same in all images showing gradual people density.</p>
<p>Density of people on the roads was initiated with one person. Afterward, it was increased one by one and each increase in density was photographed. When the increases were photographed, the place and angle of capture were fixed.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-1420326X12451986"><title>Evaluation of Photographs</title>
<p>Since the main purpose of this study was to determine the effects of characteristics of the recreational area on the perception of user density levels, we fixed factors such as age, education and specialty, which may cause a change in perception of the people who participated in the survey. For this reason, students in the Department of Landscape Architecture were chosen as the sample population. The reason for this selection is that students who take nature-based classes as a part of their university education can find more free time to participate in recreational outdoor activities when compared with other university students in Turkey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1420326X12451986">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1420326X12451986">30</xref>]. Our survey was conducted on 217 students of landscape architecture in the provinces of Istanbul, Ankara, Trabzon and Düzce. In the selection of the students it was aimed that they have professional experience therefore they were chosen among seniors. 75% of senior students were surveyed. Students were randomly selected in school campus.</p>
<p>Participants were shown 20 road photographs in total. Around 50–60 participants per group evaluated the photographs projected. Ten photographs were taken within a rural area and the other 10 were taken within an urban area. In each series of ten photographs, user density increased one by one. Participants were asked to evaluate each photograph in terms of suitability for walking, cycling and use by motor vehicles. Participants were further asked to evaluate the suitability of the roads for “walking to go somewhere” and “walking for pleasure” that are deemed to be the categories of walking. In other words, the students determined at what level they thought the road in the photograph was suitable for different types of walking. Respondents were shown one photo at a time and asked to evaluate it before moving on. A 5-point Likert scale was used for this purpose. In the scale, 1 was designated as “not suitable” and 5 was designated as “suitable”. The midpoint of the scale (3) was perceived equivalent to acceptability levels used in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1420326X12451986">3</xref>]. Therefore, a 3 was designated as the optimum level of suitability. Furthermore, in order to determine the personal experiences of walking visitors, which may cause a change in their perceptions, factors such as frequency of walking in rural and urban areas, gender and financial status of their families were determined (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1420326X12451986">Table 1</xref>).

<sec id="sec5-1420326X12451986"><title>Reliability of Survey</title>
<p>SPSS 13.0 was used for statistical analyses. Reliability analysis was conducted in order to determine the reliability of the survey. As a result of the analysis, the Cronbach alpha value was determined to be 0.82. This result demonstrates that the survey is highly reliable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1420326X12451986">31</xref>].</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-1420326X12451986"><title>Results</title>
<sec id="sec7-1420326X12451986"><title>Characteristics of Participants</title>
<p>Of our survey participants, 64% were female students. The reason for this high rate is that the profession of landscape architecture is preferred by women in Turkey. The monthly financial status of 50% of the participants is in the middle financial level of Turkey (US$751–1500). In terms of walking experiences for recreational purposes, 21% of participants walked in a rural area once a week and 67% walked in an urban area once a week. According to these findings, participants have more experience in recreational walking in urban areas (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1420326X12451986">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-1420326X12451986"><title>Perception of the User Density Level According to the Characteristics of the Recreation Area</title>
<p>One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine the changes in perception according to the density of visitors in rural recreation areas and urban recreation areas. In order to reveal how the perception of the user density level changed, the mean suitability levels of the variable density of visitors were determined.</p>
<p>An increased density of visitors on a rural road could cause a change in the perception of the user density level for all recreational uses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1420326X12451986">Table 2</xref>). Suitability levels decreased as a result of increasing visitor density for all uses. However, the optimum suitability level (3), which is the middle point of the 5-point scale used in this study, varied according to the type of recreational use. In a rural road with a width of 6 m, the density of 6 visitors was the acceptable limit for walking for pleasure and the act of walking to go somewhere. For walks of pleasure, a density of 5 visitors was considered the acceptable limit. Acceptable density of visitors on roads decreased rapidly when different uses were added to walking. If the road was used for cycling in addition to walking, the acceptable density of visitors became 4. Furthermore, if the road was used for motor vehicles in addition to walking, the acceptable density of visitors became 2.

<p>An increase in the density of visitors on an urban road could cause a change in the perception of the user density level for all uses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1420326X12451986">Table 3</xref>). Suitability levels decreased as a result of increasing density of visitors for all uses. In an urban road with a width of 6 m, the acceptable density of visitors was considered to be 6 visitors for walking and 8 visitors for the act of walking to go somewhere. Participants stated that the urban road shown was not suitable for walks of pleasure. The acceptable density of visitors on urban roads also decreased when different uses were added to walking. For example, if the road was used for cycling in addition to walking, the acceptable density of visitors became 3. When the road was used for motor vehicles in addition to walking, the acceptable density of visitors became 2.

<p>In order to determine the relationships between recreation area, recreational activity type and the perception of user density levels, multiple analyses of variance (MANOVA) were used. The diagrams shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X12451986">Figure 1</xref> were created according to the findings obtained.
<fig id="fig1-1420326X12451986" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Suitability density level according to type of recreational use.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X12451986-fig1.tif"/></fig>
</p>
<p>Based on the answers of participants, there was no difference between the acceptable densities of walking visitors in both recreation areas (<italic>p</italic> = 0.29, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X12451986">Figure 1</xref>). However, there were differences between the acceptable densities of visitors for the act of walking to go somewhere according to the type of recreation areas (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X12451986">Figure 1</xref>). Participants who would use rural roads for the act of walking to go somewhere were less tolerant of high user density levels than those preferring urban roads. There was an obvious difference between the perceptions of user density levels between the visitors who walk for pleasure on rural roads and the visitors who walk for pleasure on urban roads (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X12451986">Figure 1</xref>). While the participants of our survey had a certain amount of tolerance towards the density of visitors when they walk for pleasure on rural roads, they did not find the urban roads suitable for walking for pleasure (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X12451986">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>According to the answers from the participants, no difference was observed between the acceptable densities of visitors in rural and urban roads when there was motor vehicle used in addition to walking (<italic>p</italic> = 0.97, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X12451986">Figure 1</xref>). Also, the acceptable density of visitors was not changed according to the type of road when the road was used for cycling in addition to walking (<italic>p</italic> = 0.93, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X12451986">Figure 1</xref>). Our results show that, regardless of the type of road, walkers are less tolerant of visitors who perform different recreational activities than visitors who perform similar recreational activities. Although this arguable implication is not settled by our results, there are other studies that reported findings to support it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1420326X12451986">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1420326X12451986">4</xref>].</p></sec>

<sec id="sec11-1420326X12451986"><title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>Previous studies have shown that the social carrying capacity is important in the management of the quality of visitors’ experiences. Furthermore, it is known that the social carrying capacity has a strong relationship with the perception of the user density level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1420326X12451986">32</xref>]. In this study, participants’ expectations of user density on different types of roads were evaluated. In addition to this, the effect of changing the type of use and the effect of participants’ characteristics on the perception of user density levels were investigated.</p>
<p>In the photographs used for this study, road length was kept short (approximately 50 m), since dense usage in the foreground of the picture effects the perception of user density levels more than in background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1420326X12451986">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1420326X12451986">33</xref>]. For this reason, our conclusions are different from those previously reached by Manning et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1420326X12451986">34</xref>]. According to Manning et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1420326X12451986">34</xref>], the optimum density for walking on a rural road with similar characteristics except for a length of 100 m was determined to be 16 people. However, the optimum density was 6 in our study. For this reason, short road length and homogeneous user density are important in order to reach accurate conclusions in studies using photographs.</p>
<p>It is known that the factors preventing cyclists and walkers from carrying out such activities are similar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1420326X12451986">35</xref>]. Motor vehicles are one important factor that can affect cycling or walking. Previous studies have indicated that cyclists are more tolerant of pedestrians who use the same road than the pedestrians are towards the cyclists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1420326X12451986">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1420326X12451986">35</xref>]. Moreover, Manning et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1420326X12451986">34</xref>] emphasised that cyclists are less tolerant of other cyclists than they are of pedestrians. Cessford [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1420326X12451986">35</xref>] connects the increase in walkers’ perceptions of crowding because of the multiple uses of roads to two basic reasons. There is the perception of the physical effects on the environment made by users and the perception of security risks. Drivers of motor vehicles can affect the roads and the environment much more than cyclists and walkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1420326X12451986">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1420326X12451986">37</xref>]. However, previous studies have indicated that there is not much difference between the effects made by walkers and cyclists on environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1420326X12451986">34</xref>]. It is an indisputable fact that motor vehicles can increase the perception of accident risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1420326X12451986">38</xref>]. Walkers believe that cyclists are a security risk to them, although to a lesser extent than are motor vehicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1420326X12451986">38</xref>]. However, it has not been verified by the literature that such risks have increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1420326X12451986">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1420326X12451986">40</xref>].</p>
<p>In the last 20 years, there have been a few studies that examined rural areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1420326X12451986">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1420326X12451986">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1420326X12451986">42</xref>]. According to those studies, users of rural areas are less tolerant of crowding than users of urban areas. This result was found when subjects were “walking to go somewhere”, but would be completely different if “walking for pleasure”. In fact, no user density level was considered acceptable when “walking for pleasure”. Although 67% of the participants declared that they “walk for pleasure” at least once a week, they did not think the areas shown in photographs were suitable for this activity. This is because there was no route preferred for “walking for pleasure” in the city. For instance, there were no shopping areas around and green areas were very limited, which proved that it is harder to identify user density norms for urban roads. However, it is essential to improve walking experiences on these roads, which are used very often in daily life.</p>
<p>In this study, gender, financial status and recreational experiences were considered as the factors that might affect participants’ perception of user density levels. Absher and Lee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1420326X12451986">43</xref>] found that gender, which is a characteristic of participants, did not influence the perception of crowding. However, in this study, although gender was not effective in influencing the perception of user density levels in urban areas, it was effective in influencing the perception of user density levels in rural areas. Unexpectedly, female users found less crowded rural roads more suitable for walking than male users. Many studies have found that women do not want to walk alone in rural areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1420326X12451986">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1420326X12451986">45</xref>]. Since the participants were not shown a road without people in the photographs, the preferences of female participants about empty roads were not evaluated. However, female participants considered a rural road with one person as the most suitable road for walking. The reason for this is that the security perception of female participants, which affects the perception of user density levels, may be satisfied by at least one person. Female participants may expect lower density of use on rural roads than men. This expectation may be understood by the studies of Davidson and Freudberg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1420326X12451986">46</xref>] and Burger et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1420326X12451986">47</xref>]. According to these studies, awareness of women towards protecting environments is more developed than men. For this reason, an increase in the density of use, which has a negative effect on environment, may increase the perception of user density levels of women participants more than men. Marsinko et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1420326X12451986">48</xref>] found that the financial status of participants could affect the frequency of participating in recreational activities. In that study, the perception of user density levels was indicated as the most effective reason for participants to change their duration of stay and the recreational activity they performed in the area, regardless of financial status. Based on our results and the results of the study by Marsinko et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1420326X12451986">48</xref>], the density of users could influence the perception of optimum suitability user levels in rural and urban recreation areas, regardless of financial status.</p>
<p>In this study, participants’ frequency of walking on rural and urban roads was determined. The purpose of determining this was to reveal if there were any differences between perceptions of user density levels of experienced and inexperienced participants. According to our data, the perception of user density levels for both types of roads did not differ according to participants’ experiences. However, previous studies have found that participants with more recreational experience are more tolerant towards crowding than less experienced participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1420326X12451986">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1420326X12451986">51</xref>]. The reason for this difference is the fact that the participants in our study had no previous experience with the areas shown to them. In our study, the expected densities of use by participants for the shown areas were determined, which show that the expected density of use has a strong and direct relationship with the density perceived within the area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1420326X12451986">52</xref>]. Shelby et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1420326X12451986">53</xref>] determined that participants’ perception of crowding decreased by about 3% when they encountered a density similar to the one they expected. However, their perception of crowding increased by nearly 40% when they encountered a higher density than the one they expected. As we have shown, it is very important that recreational managers know the expectations of visitors in advance.</p>
<sec id="sec12-1420326X12451986"><title>Management and Policy Implications</title>
<p>It is not possible to limit user density levels on roads. However, it is possible to influence density perception. As indicated by many studies, users can be informed of the content and density of an area in advance, area noise can be reduced, deformations caused by dense usage can be removed, and the factors that may create anxiety of injury risk can be removed. These changes can cause the user to perceive that the area is well managed and may cause a decrease in the perception of high crowding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1420326X12451986">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1420326X12451986">54</xref>]. In addition, an increase in green areas will definitely improve the quality of walking for users and will increase tolerance for user density.</p>
<p>Pedestrians are not tolerant of motor vehicles on roads with multiple uses. However, pedestrians are more inclined to use roads with cyclists. Cessford [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1420326X12451986">35</xref>] determined that pedestrians are more tolerant of cyclists when cyclists improve their behaviours (e.g. careful riding, controlled speed, friendly manner).</p>
<p>The knowledge of how gender, income level and experience can affect the tolerance for density in recreational areas will inform executives so that they can establish new strategies to sell existing products. According to our results, user density expectations should be evaluated separately depending on the gender of users. Security expectations of women should be considered and precautions should be taken to prevent obstacles due to overuse. Although experiences of the users had no effect on user density expectations in our study, decision makers should inform the users about user density. This may increase the tolerance of the users for dense use.</p>
<p>In future analyses, the differences should be examined between the conclusions obtained by studies using photographs to examine the perception of user density levels and the conclusions of other studies that have been made in the same area. In this way, the most effective and accurate measure of user density can be determined. Such studies should be conducted, especially in different urban recreation areas such as squares, festival areas and playgrounds. It must be taken into consideration that most of the studies that have examined the effects of user characteristics on the perception of user density levels were carried out in countries with high standards of living. Such relationships should also be investigated in other countries.</p></sec></sec>
