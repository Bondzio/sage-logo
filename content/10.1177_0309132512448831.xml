<abstract>
<p>This paper revisits the central ontological claim in the production of nature thesis, Neil Smith’s proposition that labour is at the heart of the mutual co-production of nature and society. Surveying Smith’s work and others, we argue that there is a danger of losing the embodied, historically and geographically specific practices that are so central to the making of natures. Turning to the work of Antonio Gramsci, we find crucial resources that enable a historicized and geographically contextualized understanding of the making of natures.</p>

<title>I Introduction</title>
<p>Neil Smith’s notion that nature is produced is a scandalous proposition to those beholden to a belief in the reality of the so-called natural world. However, since Smith published <italic>Uneven Development: Nature, Capital and the Production of Space </italic>in 1984, many of his more provocative arguments concerning the production of nature appear confirmed with the development of OncoMouse, worsening problems of Global Environmental Change, the urbanization of ‘nature’ and the deepening commodification of ecological life. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0309132512448831">Marx (1973</xref>: 63) noted, ‘the nature that preceded human history…today no longer exists anywhere’. More clearly than ever, nature is produced ‘all the way down’ and the impossibility of distinguishing ‘nature’ and ‘society’ would appear to have been confirmed. All forms of life and ecologies are deeply entangled in dense, relationally defined assemblages. Unsurprisingly, in the intervening years, countless studies in political ecology (urban or otherwise) and environmental politics have constructed elaborate arguments around Smith’s deliberately provocative thesis that nature is socially produced through the labour process: the conceptual and political endurance of Smith’s work is further witnessed in a recent special issue of <italic>New Political Economy</italic> dedicated to the 25th anniversary of <italic>Uneven Development</italic>’s publication, as well as in the reissue of the text in a third edition by the University of Georgia Press and Verso Press. Almost a decade earlier, <italic>Uneven Development </italic>was already considered a ‘classic in human geography’ by <italic>Progress </italic>(see <italic>PIHG</italic> 24(2)).</p>
<p>Important texts that force us to rethink foundational questions elicit sharp commentary and criticism. This is most certainly the case with <italic>Uneven Development</italic>. On occasion the book generates shock, abhorrence and even anger at what Smith terms the ‘quixotic’ thesis that nature is produced. More often, Smith is charged with underplaying the materiality of nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0309132512448831">Castree, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0309132512448831">Guthman, 2011</xref>) and the liveliness of non-humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309132512448831">Bakker and Bridge, 2006</xref>). In this vein, others, such as Bruce <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309132512448831">Braun (2002</xref>), have questioned whether <italic>Uneven Development</italic> lapses into economic reductionism, thereby limiting the number of generative relations identified in the making of nature. Yet, paradoxically, one area of Smith’s work that has escaped critical analysis is his treatment of labour, practice and productive activity (for an exception, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0309132512448831">Guthman, 2011</xref>). This is peculiar given that labour is the ontological key to understanding how nature is produced and how humans engage with different ecologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0309132512448831">Castree, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0309132512448831">Harvey, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0309132512448831">Loftus, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0309132512448831">Mitchell, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0309132512448831">Swyngedouw, 2000</xref>). For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0309132512448831">Smith (1998</xref>) this focus on productive activity was a politically inspired move aimed at placing labour at the centre of environmental politics. Given Smith’s claim, it would seem imperative to explore the treatment of productive activity within <italic>Uneven Development </italic>and the debates that have followed it. Not only do we need to better understand how labour is conceptualized in debates around the production of nature but also how activity is organized and differentiated, depending on the societies in which it occurs. In exploring such questions, this paper will shed light on how nature is made, while also considering the making of the person in the creative acts of producing natures. These creative acts feed back into a conception of the labourer within capitalist societies and a sense of the liberatory possibilities in alternatives to capitalism.</p>
<p>Overall, we will argue for a deeper socially and culturally textured account of practical activity – and of those engaged in this activity – within understandings of the production of nature. However, in advancing this argument, we also consider how some of these themes are articulated in studies of agrarian production, which have emerged alongside, although not always in dialogue with, the production of nature literature. After examining Smith’s argument and the debates that have followed, we reflect on how an engagement with Gramsci’s philosophy of praxis helps us to consider the broad organization of practical activity and of those subjects engaged in the making of nature. We will argue that Gramsci forces us to highlight the different types of concrete labour (artistic, intellectual, scientific, manufacturing) that are formative in the production of nature, before closing by reflecting on how Gramsci’s absolute historicism requires embedding concepts within the ebbs and flows of particular histories and geographies: these historical geographies, in turn, provoke theoretical refinement and extension. This may seem a somewhat paradoxical argument to make in what remains a theoretically oriented paper. But it is one that refocuses our efforts on the movement between the concrete, the abstract and the reconstruction of the thought concrete in our understandings of the production of nature (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0309132512448831">Marx, 1973</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0309132512448831">1</xref></sup> Through an engagement with the practice of making natures, we also begin to tap into the conditions of possibility for alternative conceptions of the world, of nature, and of environmental politics. From such perspectives, we might begin to craft new realities based less on the constraints of an abstract, socially necessary labour time and more on the creative energies shaped by constant interaction between human and non-human.</p>
<p>We write this article in the spirit of strengthening our understanding of the diverse subjects and types of practical activity that contribute to the making of nature. Far from suggesting that research on the production of nature is somehow passé, our ambition is to deepen the approach laid out by others, through a re-engagement with an open and flexible historical geographical materialism. <italic>Uneven Development </italic>already provides numerous openings for considering both how ecological activity is organized and the subjects engaged in such activity. Yet these openings are nascent and underdeveloped. It is our contention that Gramsci provides the conceptual resources for furthering these arguments and contributing to the development of an integral analysis of environmental politics.<sup>

<title>II The production of nature: one more time</title>
<p>By stressing that nature is socially produced, Smith confronts contemporary environmentalists’ preoccupation with the defence of pristine landscapes that are supposedly untouched by human interventions. <italic>Uneven Development </italic>fosters a fiercely de-naturalizing approach that seeks to uncover the history of human activity in the most apparently natural of environments. In so doing, Smith disrupts bourgeois ideologies that posit nature as distinct from humanity and demonstrates the centrality of capitalism to contemporary nature-society relationships. Indeed, ‘under capitalism the appropriation of nature and its transformation into the means of production occur for the first time on a world scale’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0309132512448831">Smith, 1984</xref>: 49). The specific relationship between ‘humanity’ and ‘nature’ in the present moment must, at least in part, be derived from the social relations of capitalism. Labour involves conceptually and physically engaging parts of ‘nature’ so as to make a new product, which, for Smith, is analogous to a new nature.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0309132512448831">3</xref>
</sup> In Smith’s argument the labour process and production are the mediating relations between ‘nature’ and ‘society’ or, in other words, the moments in which the different forms of human and non-human become entangled in the making of new things. Within capitalist societies, both labour and the production process are governed by the inner dynamics of this historically specific societal form, a societal form that necessitates continual growth and the generalization of wage labour and exchange value. The production of nature is thereby transformed from a process necessary for the survival of human life (the appropriation of nature that remains fundamental to every society of which humans have been a part) to one which is animated by the need to produce exchange values. Smith describes this process as a movement from production in general, to production for exchange, followed by capitalist production. In this progression, nature is increasingly subsumed under the logic of exchange value and eventually ‘to the creation and accumulation of value which determines the relation with nature under capitalism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0309132512448831">Smith, 1984</xref>: 49; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0309132512448831">Smith, 2006</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0309132512448831">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>It is important to note that Smith in no way claims that the ‘appropriation of nature’ is specific to capitalist societies. Quite the contrary, <italic>Uneven Development</italic> builds on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0309132512448831">Marx’s (1973</xref>: 87) claim that ‘all production is appropriation of nature on the part of an individual within and through a specific form of society’. Instead, from the <italic>Grundrisse</italic>, Smith takes his cue to historicize production thereby developing an incipient co-evolutionary perspective in which labour serves as one moment within a broader, continually transforming, totality (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0309132512448831">Marx, 1973</xref>: 99). Nevertheless, subsequent interpretations have often imposed an anachronistic reading of such relationships, claiming that it is only with the development of capitalism that nature comes to be produced (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0309132512448831">Castree, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0309132512448831">2005</xref>). Such readings fail to appreciate the relationship between the production of nature ‘in general’ and the distinctive transformation of the production of nature ‘within and through’ distinctively capitalist conditions.</p>
<p>What is crucially important to recognize is that, if Smith <italic>had</italic> claimed that an epochal shift towards the production of nature occurred only with the development of capitalism, such a claim would suggest that at one point, prior to capitalism, nature and society existed separately. Recent moral panics around genetic engineering, not to mention the environmental apocalypticism of the contemporary moment, have been driven by concern at these ‘momentous’ or ‘epochal’ shifts that blur a once-sacrosanct division between society and nature. However, this is not Smith’s argument. Indeed the production of nature thesis is, in many ways, antithetical. Beginning from production in general, Smith demonstrates how human life depends upon a continual metabolic interchange between human and non-human. With the further mediation of this metabolism through the development of the exchange relation in capitalist societies, a distinct ‘nature’ and ‘society’ begins to circulate as a world-view, based, in part, on the commoditization of crucial aspects of the means of existence. To use a specific example we have both referred to elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0309132512448831">Ekers and Loftus, 2008</xref>), one need only think of the circulation of potable water within commercialized water services. In order for profits to be realized, potable water must be sold to consumers. This requires the capitalist appropriation of what was formerly part of the commons. Thus, in an apparent reverse of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0309132512448831">Castree’s (2000)</xref> claim that Smith ‘used Marxian economics to argue that <italic>capitalism </italic>has replaced a nonhuman “first nature” with a socially produced “second nature”’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0309132512448831">Smith (1984</xref>: 48) actually claims that ‘in Marx we see the opposite procedure. He begins with the relations with nature as a unity and derives as a simultaneously historical and logical result whatever separation between them exists’. No act of ‘replacement’ occurs in <italic>Uneven Development</italic>; instead certain aspects of the production of nature come to be historicized while the disruption of dualisms seen in the appropriation of nature or the metabolic interchange between nature and society remains constant. In short, the key is to historicize the specific forms that the making of natures takes, and to be able to do this in geographically situated ways.</p>
<p>Crucial to Smith’s understanding of the historical specificity to the production of nature in capitalist societies is Alfred Sohn-Rethel’s theorization of ‘real abstractions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0309132512448831">Sohn-Rethel, 1978</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0309132512448831">Postone, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0309132512448831">Toscano, 2008</xref>). Smith quotes the German scholar at some length in relation to the new distinction between first and second nature in capitalist societies:<disp-quote>
<p>In German the world of ‘use’ is often called ‘the first or primary nature’, material in substance, while the sphere of exchange is termed a ‘second, purely social, nature’ entirely abstract in make-up…[First nature is] concrete and material, comprising commodities as objects of use and our own activities as material, inter-exchange with nature; [second nature is] abstract and purely social, concerning commodities as objects of exchange and quantities of value. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0309132512448831">Sohn-Rethel, 1978</xref>: 28, 56–57)</p>
</disp-quote> Bookending this quotation is Smith’s own interpretation of what it is that changes in the transition from production for exchange to capitalist production:<disp-quote>
<p>the distinction is now between a first nature that is concrete and material, the nature of use values in general, and a second nature which is abstract, and derivative of the abstraction from use value that is inherent in exchange-value…The same piece of matter exists simultaneously in both natures; as physical commodity subject to the laws of gravity and physics it exists in the first nature, but as exchange value subject to the laws of the market, it travels in the second nature. Human labour produces the first nature, human relations produce the second. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0309132512448831">Smith, 1984</xref>: 78, 79)</p>
</disp-quote> If labour has a two-fold character in capitalist societies, appearing concretely in the manufacture of use values and also in abstract form as socially necessary labour time, this two-fold character is also reflected in the dual character of the nature produced. Nature appears as both a material and an abstract entity: at the same time this is a differentiated <italic>unity</italic>, not a duality. Nevertheless, perhaps because his concern was more to identify this particular transformation of nature and the labour that produces it within capitalist societies, the focus of <italic>Uneven Development</italic> is much less on specific forms of labour and much more on labour’s abstract form: both, we should stress again, make up what should be understood to be a differentiated unity. Moreover, if abstract labour – the average socially necessary labour time congealed in a product – is a crucial determinant of both practical activity and nature in capitalist societies, this is not the sole determinant. If the same piece of matter travels subject to the laws of gravity, physics and exchange value (to use Smith’s example from above), while being crafted by human labour and embodying the relations through which that labour is organized, those forms of social domination organizing the practical abstraction of exchange value are only one part of the broader ensemble making matter ‘what it is’. Indeed, if human labour produces the first nature and human relations produce the second, the labour of first nature must be seen as embodied – requiring us to look at the lived life of the labourer – and the human relations of second nature must be seen to be structured by various other axes of what are often mutually determining productions of social difference.</p>
<sec id="section3-0309132512448831">
<title>1 The question of labour</title>
<p>Amid the myriad material, symbolic and representational relations that contribute to the making of natures, most of the theoretical contributions made by historical materialists highlight the generative role of the capital-labour relation in the production of capitalist natures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0309132512448831">Castree, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0309132512448831">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0309132512448831">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0309132512448831">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0309132512448831">Harvey, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0309132512448831">Kirsch and Mitchell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0309132512448831">Mitchell, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0309132512448831">Smith, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0309132512448831">Swyngedouw, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0309132512448831">2006</xref>). This is not surprising, nor is it necessarily a failing, if it is recognized to be only a partial understanding of the content of second nature. Put in simple terms by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0309132512448831">Mitchell (2003</xref>), ‘the landscape can be understood to be a product of human labour, of people going to work on the land to make some <italic>thing out</italic> of it’. Mitchell then goes on to support this claim through a detailed discussion of the concrete ways in which different workers perform the labour of producing the Californian landscape. Notwithstanding Mitchell’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0309132512448831">1996</xref>) socially textured analysis of labour and landscape, within much of the theoretical literature on social natures, there is a tendency to treat production and labour in a fairly abstract or universal fashion. Thus, Smith’s (1984: 34) chapter on the production of nature starts by suggesting that ‘the place to begin is with production in general, since this is the most basic material relation between human beings and nature’. Supporting this, he quotes the <italic>Grundrisse </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0309132512448831">Marx, 1973</xref>: 85): ‘<italic>Production in general is an abstraction</italic>, but a rational abstraction in so far as it really brings out and fixes the common element’ in all periods of production. Emily <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309132512448831">Eaton (2011</xref>: 247) is very direct on this point: ‘The production of nature thesis is…a universal approach. It excludes no society because every society must apply labour to furnish itself with food, clothing, shelter, etc., and because every production process transforms raw materials and thereby alters and constructs the physical environment’.</p>
<p>Smith’s argument, and his use of Marx, reflects an underlying premise of historical materialism, which stresses that the labour process is necessary for (re)producing everyday life.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0309132512448831">5</xref>
</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0309132512448831">Heynen et al. (2007</xref>) make a similar claim, invoking Marx:<disp-quote>
<p>[The labour process] is the universal condition for the metabolic interaction between man and nature, the ever-lasting nature imposed condition of human existence, and it is therefore independent of every form of that existence, or rather it is common to all forms of society in which human beings live. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0309132512448831">Marx, 1977</xref>: 283, 290; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0309132512448831">1973</xref>: 87)</p>
</disp-quote> This is one of Marx’s most quoted passages on the question of nature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0309132512448831">Swyngedouw (2006</xref>: 108) builds on this same statement arguing that ‘to the extent that labour constitutes the universal premise for human metabolic interaction with nature, the particular socio-technical vehicles and social relations through which this metabolism of nature is enacted shape its very form’. Notice the dialectic between the ‘universal’ and ‘particular’ framing of metabolism (labour) in Swyngedouw’s remarks. We will return to this point below; however, it is worth highlighting that within the literature the stress has been placed on the universal characteristics of labour over the particular relations that animate different social groups’ metabolic relationships with nature.</p>
<p>Within his own analysis, Smith is far from oblivious to other divisions of labour that exist within, prior to, or outside of capitalist societies. Nor does he neglect the increasing differentiation of labour in the movement from production in general to capitalist production. On several occasions <italic>Uneven Development </italic>considers an increasing social division of labour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0309132512448831">Smith, 1984</xref>: 72), a technical division of labour (p. 73) and a gendered division of labour (pp. 74–75). In this respect, the question of difference is woven through the ways in which various social groups come to perform the act of producing natures. However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0309132512448831">Smith (2011</xref>) admits, the discussion remains frustratingly abstract. This fits with the ambitions of <italic>Uneven Development</italic>. Indeed there is almost a surprise in Smith’s tone when, in the Afterword to the third edition of the text, he cites concrete examples of produced natures and finds the abstract arguments from the original thesis increasingly vindicated. Making this move from the abstract to the concrete and adequately historicizing the production of nature within new divisions of labour in the contemporary moment is, nevertheless, crucial if we are to take the project of <italic>Uneven Development</italic> forward in the future. Indeed Smith points us towards such an analysis, writing that:<disp-quote>
<p>The capitalist mode of production remains based on the fundamental distinction between a working class and a class that owns capital. This leads in the opposite direction, toward a differentiation of cultures along class lines and of course a further differentiation on the basis of gender and race. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0309132512448831">Smith, 1984</xref>: 53)</p>
</disp-quote> Again, however, if difference is acknowledged as central, the claim remains abstract, or, in Marx’s words, one-sided and lacking social content. In part, the abstract character of Smith’s discussion of labour is a reflection of his close engagement with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0309132512448831">Marx (1977</xref>: 142, 150). In challenging the ahistorical conception of labour within classical political economy Marx increasingly acknowledges the transformation of concrete labour into abstract labour with the development of a capitalist mode of production. Every commodity is rendered commensurable by virtue of embodying a certain amount of socially necessary labour time despite the different concrete forms that labour takes. Paradoxically, with the historical development of capitalism, labour becomes a practical abstraction that had formed the starting point for the (ahistorical) analyses of classical political economists. Thus:<disp-quote>
<p>for the first time, the point of departure of modern economics, namely the abstraction of the category ‘labour’, ‘labour as such’, labour pure and simple, becomes true in practice. The simplest abstraction, then, which modern economics places at the head of its discussions, and which expresses an immeasurably ancient relation valid in all forms of society nevertheless achieves practical truth as an abstraction only as a category of the most modern society. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0309132512448831">Marx, 1973</xref>: 105)</p>
</disp-quote> Smith’s discussion of labour describes a ‘real abstraction’ that is simultaneously the ‘thought abstraction’ of classical economics. This ‘real abstraction’ emerges out of the universal measure of value represented in socially necessary labour time. Abstract labour is ‘an abstraction which is made every day in the social process of production’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0309132512448831">Marx, 1977</xref>: 129). Nevertheless, in dealing with the historical reality of abstract, as opposed to concrete labour, Smith’s account of the labouring acts involved in the production of nature becomes increasingly distanced from the historically and geographically specific ways in which labour is embodied, organized and differentiated. Famously, Marx urges us to move from the abstract to the concrete in our analyses, although his interpretation of the concrete is not necessarily one concerned with the lived life of the labourer. Thus:<disp-quote>
<p>The economists of the seventeenth century, e.g., always begin with the living whole, with population, nation, state, several states, etc.; but they always conclude by discovering through analysis a small number of determinant, abstract, general relations such as division of labour, money, value, etc. As soon as these individual moments had been more or less firmly established and abstracted, there began the economic systems, which ascended from the simple relations, such as labour, division of labour, need, exchange value to the level of the state, exchange between nations and the world market. The latter is obviously the scientifically correct method. The concrete is concrete because it is the concentration of many determinations, hence unity of the diverse. It appears in the process of thinking, therefore, as a process of concentration, as a result, not as a point of departure, even though it is the point of departure in reality and hence also the point of departure for observation. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0309132512448831">Marx, 1973</xref>: 100–101)</p>
</disp-quote> By refocusing our attention on the question of labour within the production of nature, we re-emphasize the concrete as the concrete ‘because it is the concentration of many determinations, hence unity of the diverse’. Note, here, that the concrete for Marx may be ‘the point of departure in reality’ and also ‘for observation’ but the concrete is also an arrival point, achieved through identifying the multiple determinations that constitute specific processes. Herein lies the historicist method put to such effective use by Gramsci. Nevertheless, if the ‘scientifically correct method’ involves moving from the imagined concrete, through a process of abstraction, to the reconstruction of the concrete in thought, many aspects of capitalist society come to assume an abstract form, something Marx demonstrates through the example of abstract labour. This abstraction is the fate of nature. Indeed, the abstract, second nature that Smith refers to captures the one-sidedness of a nature that circulates as an exchange value, a nature in which myriad qualities are reduced to abstract quantifications. For Marx, the challenge is not to take these abstract categories as givens but to historicize how they were brought into being, thereby reconstructing the concrete in thought. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0309132512448831">Sayer (1989</xref>) suggests, this is a method that involves deconstructing immediate phenomenal forms into their constitutive relations and then providing a historical account of what these relations comprise. Smith embarks on part of this project in <italic>Uneven Development</italic> but he never quite reconstructs the historical account necessary for a return to the concrete.</p>
<p>Recognizing both the concrete and abstract character of labour necessarily requires moving beyond a universalized figure of the labourer operating under capitalist conditions towards an understanding of gendered, raced and classed subjects operating within historically and geographically specific divisions of labour. Much more contextualization of the practical act and much greater attention to the lives of those engaged in the practical acts of producing nature are therefore demanded of us. Indeed, this lack of attention to the historically and geographically specific practices through which nature is produced has hindered an appreciation of the specificities of labour and production in particular historical geographical moments. The risk is that, in invoking the timeless character of labour, we find a theoretical ‘guarantee’ that labourers do the work of making nature. A transhistorical focus on practical activity as ‘labour’ and the theoretical security that workers <italic>in general </italic>do the work of making natures has resulted in scholars taking labour for granted, rather than examining specificities and differentiations.</p>
<p>Sonya <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0309132512448831">Rose (1997</xref>: 139), has highlighted similar issues with universal treatments of workers in labour history, arguing that historians have built theories of class formation through an ‘abstract notion of work…featuring disembodied workers’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0309132512448831">Rose (1997</xref>: 144) goes on, suggesting that ‘scholars have developed understandings of class formation using [men] as particular political actors and their activities as prototypes in a universal process’. She argues that a ‘quintessential worker’, which is presumed to be a white, working-class man, haunts labour studies, enabling the projection of a universal worker rather than a particular labourer. Writing from a socialist feminist perspective, Rose claims that the ‘quintessential workers problem’ has been a persistent thorn in the side of labour studies, making it difficult to incorporate women and people of colour into accounts of working life, while also blinding scholars to processes of gender and racialization.</p>
<p>Focusing more on the division of labour than the figure of the worker, Nancy Hartsock’s feminist standpoint theory performs a similar challenge to such universal categories. In a brilliant move, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0309132512448831">Hartsock (1998</xref>: 112) argues that historical materialism has neglected the gendered division of labour (she uses the term ‘sexual division of labour’) which ‘is the first and in some societies the only division of labour’. In highlighting the gendering of work practices, Hartsock is able to develop an argument that women’s work provides a more fundamental position from which to struggle for a radical world-view capable of challenging capitalist patriarchy. Within this feminist framework, Hartsock’s deployment of Marx has numerous similarities with that of Smith:<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0309132512448831">6</xref>
</sup> indeed her development of feminist standpoint theory is a more likely catalyst for feminist work on the production of nature than it is for ecofeminist theorizations of environmental politics (although for an argument in which Hartsock’s work is crudely conflated with ecofeminist essentialisms see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0309132512448831">New, 1996</xref>). Nevertheless, in order for a conversation to develop between feminist standpoint theory and the production of nature, the activity out of which natures are concretely produced needs to be further situated, historicized and spatialized.</p>
<p>An apparently singular focus on the capital-labour relation in the production of nature has, in recent years, raised the ire of scholars writing about social natures from radically different epistemological frameworks. For instance, Bruce <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309132512448831">Braun (2002</xref>: 17) suggests that ‘one of the problems that haunts many marxist approaches to social nature is their narrowly defined sense of the generative processes that shape nature’s transformation. Economic processes tend to be emphasized, while much less attention is paid to cultural practices’. While Braun overlooks many marxist oriented accounts of social natures that can hardly be described as reductionist (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0309132512448831">Gandy, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0309132512448831">Kaika, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0309132512448831">Kaika and Swyngedouw, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0309132512448831">Swyngedouw, 1999</xref>), one way of addressing his critique is through adding texture to the treatment of labour within marxist accounts of the making of natures, through such work as Hartsock’s and Rose’s. As we discuss in what follows, accounts of labour that recognize these multiple determinants and the embodied practice of labouring are now explicit in many grounded studies of the production of nature; however, the multiplicity of determinations demanded by Braun is also implicit in the approach Smith takes from Marx (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0309132512448831">Marx, 1973</xref>: 99).</p>

<title>2 Concrete labour</title>
<p>As influential as the production of nature thesis has been, several other approaches to the study of nature, society and labour have developed alongside of Smith’s work. Notably, the ‘Berkeley School of political ecology’ has reflected on transformations of agricultural labour and landscapes. From the 1980s, Judith Carney, Michael Watts and Donald Moore, among others, focused on the over-layering of multiple modes of production including peasant production and the introduction of capitalist social relations to the agricultural and resource sectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0309132512448831">Carney, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309132512448831">Carney and Watts, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0309132512448831">Moore, 1993</xref>). More recently, Shurbra <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0309132512448831">Gururani (2002</xref>) in her anthropological work in Kumaon, India, has made similar arguments, investigating how the history of colonialism, patriarchy and capitalism conditions women’s labour in the forested landscape. This literature demonstrates how a number of social rhythms and modes of production mediate the relationship between social groups and environments, within particular historical and geographical conjunctures. Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309132512448831">Carney and Watts (1990</xref>), in their study of agricultural production in The Gambia, argue for more attention to how questions of meaning and representation are articulated in changing production regimes and specifically the changing gender relations associated with the articulation of peasant and capitalist production. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309132512448831">Carney and Watts (1990</xref>) build on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0309132512448831">Burawoy’s (1985</xref>: 7) argument that ‘as men and women transform raw material into useful things, they also reproduce social relations as well as an experience of those relations’. In the hands of Carney and Watts, Burawoy’s point yields important insights regarding how agricultural labour is lived, felt and organized through a range of social relations, with gender being a key determinant. The concrete character of this research fills in the subjective dimensions of the production of nature while also highlighting how concrete labour is, in Marx’s words, fundamentally a ‘concentration of many determinations’.</p>
<p>For reasons that are not entirely clear, the research coming out of Berkeley and studies that have come in the wake of Smith’s <italic>Uneven Development</italic> have remained somewhat separate. Smith’s thesis has provoked a number of interesting conceptual debates whereas detailed ethnographic research has been at the heart of the Berkeley School. While Smith and others have elected for a detailed engagement with Marx, many members of the Berkeley School came to ‘political ecology’ through reading the likes of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0309132512448831">Kautsky (1988</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0309132512448831">Mann and Dickinson (1978</xref>) who theorized the specificity of agrarian production. The Berkeley School built on this work, considering how the particularities of crop establishment and the temporal disjuncture between the investment of capital and the maturation of the products (crops) has led to the development of hyper-flexible and marginalized labour forces and the development of distinct forms of credit and financialization. Capital investment and the social character of work become increasingly differentiated in accordance with the ‘natural obstacles’ of agrarian production.</p>
<p>More recently, a number of studies have tried to bridge the insights developed from Smith and the Berkeley School. For instance, a series of studies concerning the intersection of agrarian capitalism and political ecology have focused on the role of variable capital (human labour) in the process of capital accumulation and the making of landscapes. In the case of California, Richard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0309132512448831">Walker (2004</xref>), Don <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0309132512448831">Mitchell (1996</xref>) and George <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0309132512448831">Henderson (1999</xref>) have demonstrated how the control of labour in accordance with the biophysical specificities of crop production is crucial to the success of agribusiness. In the studies of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0309132512448831">Mitchell (1996</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0309132512448831">Walker (2004</xref>), the iconic aesthetic landscape of California and the flattened fields where crop production occurs are not natural, but rather are the products of intense and difficult labour. For George <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0309132512448831">Henderson (1999</xref>) and Scott <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0309132512448831">Prudham (2005</xref>) the biophysical constraints of crop and forest production have facilitated the establishment of seasonal and migrant workforces. Within such work, relations of ‘race’ and class intersect with ecological processes in determining which social groups come to perform reforestation and agricultural work. In these respective studies, there is no universal subject that labours; rather there are particular classed, gendered and racialized groups that are involved in the production of landscapes differentially across time and space. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0309132512448831">Mitchell (1996</xref>: 10) captures the underlying premise of this research particularly well, stating that ‘labour in the abstract never made anything, labour power is embodied. And in California those bodies have been marked by ideologies of race and gender, or more generally inferiority.’</p>
<p>These empirically rich studies of agrarian capitalism and political ecology have fractured the treatment of labour solely in its abstract form. Thus, it is possible to identify a hiatus between concrete studies that focus on the differentiation of labour, and work that concentrates on the capital-labour relation in the abstract (as socially necessary labour-time). It is crucial to evaluate the effects of refracting the integral ontology of labour advanced in some of the empirical studies back into the theoretical discourses. This open ontology of labour challenges us to consider the specific subjects who work, the organization of their labour, and the different valuation of social work. As Mitchell suggests, labour may be a universal feature of all human life, yet differentiation is always the norm. The same is true of the natures produced through the labour process: they are achieved and linked through practical activity (broadly understood) but also bear the histories of the specific social groups and relations that contributed to their making.</p>

<title>3 Openings</title>
<p>In this section, we want to highlight what we see as two conceptual claims that can help foster an integral and socially textured account of labour in the production of nature literature. First, in a retrospective article, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0309132512448831">Smith (1998</xref>) both clarified and extended his original thesis arguing that production should not be restricted ‘to those acts of manual and not imaginative work, economic and not cultural creation, individual labour rather than social accomplishment, and the making of objects rather than the productive consumption by subjects’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0309132512448831">Smith, 1998</xref>: 277). This statement represents an elaboration of implicit suggestions in the earlier account that the production of ideas, conceptions and consciousness are imbricated in the material production of nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0309132512448831">Smith, 1984</xref>: 63).</p>
<p>In an impressive commentary on <italic>Uneven Development</italic>, Emily Eaton highlights how <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0309132512448831">Smith (1984</xref>: 77) is cognizant of how ‘the production of the meaning, concepts and consciousness of space…are inseparably linked to its [spaces] physical production’. Yet Eaton gently pushes Smith on this point, asking for a more prolonged engagement with the production of meaning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309132512448831">Eaton (2011</xref>: 250) suggests ‘we maintain the unity of symbolic and material productions when we speak of the production of nature and space’. This point informs her analysis of genetically modified organisms, which represents a symbolic and material production of nature. In an illuminating argument, Eaton suggests that the production of meaning contributes to the differentiation of nature. There are clear resonances here to earlier arguments emerging from the Berkeley School, which point to what might be gained through a closer dialogue between varying approaches to ‘political ecology’.</p>
<p>Likely in response to Eaton, and building on his previous work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0309132512448831">Smith (2011</xref>: 262) recently called for an understanding of ‘production in all its multifold forms’, thereby inviting us to consider the diverse types of labouring that continually occur and, crucially, the <italic>subjects</italic> who labour that both produce and consume natures. In these retrospective reflections by Smith, we see the conceptual groundwork for an integral or open account of the processes through which nature is produced and consumed by subjects. However, the gesture towards the ‘productive consumption by subjects’ (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0309132512448831">Marx, 1973</xref>: 90) is not followed by an argument to investigate the particular subjects involved in these processes and in this respect still tends to be marked by a degree of universalism.</p>
<p>The second entry point for developing a socially textured treatment of labour in debates regarding the production of nature is a consideration of how the labour that makes nature is organized. We return here to Swyngedouw’s (2006) claim that if we understand the act of labouring as constituting a socionatural relation ‘then, the particular relational frame through which this labour is socially organized has to become an integral part of understanding the continuous (re)making of…socio-natural entities’. As suggested previously, there is a tendency to treat the organization of labour as solely a relation between capital and labour. Workers sell their labour power in return for a wage and the capitalist utilizes workers to transform parts of nature into new socionatural entities. Swyngedouw’s call to pay attention to the <italic>‘particular </italic>relational frame through which labour is socially organized’ (emphasis added) challenges us to look for other windows through which we understand the production of nature. His remarks, considered broadly, highlight the varied, yet particular, ways in which labour is socially organized in the production of nature. We need an approach for grappling with the organization of labour, in the broadest possible sense, that attends to various relations and processes that bring people to labour and regulate the activity through which nature is produced. In the current conjuncture, financial work dramatically shapes the making of natures in countless ways (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0309132512448831">Labban, 2010</xref>), which signals the need to consider the labouring acts of making natures as openly as possible. Smith’s call to pay attention to the subjects who labour and the different forms of labour, as well as Swyngedouw’s claim that the organization of labour is a constitutive aspect of the remaking of nature, highlight the potential openness of marxist accounts of the production of nature.</p>

<sec id="section6-0309132512448831">
<title>III The Gramscian turn</title>
<p>In these final sections we want to discuss how an engagement with Gramsci can help realize some of these openings. As a starting point, we want to stress that aspects of Gramsci’s treatment of ‘nature’ are broadly compatible with Smith’s thesis (for discussions of Gramsci and nature, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0309132512448831">Ekers, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0309132512448831">Ekers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0309132512448831">Fontana, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0309132512448831">Loftus, forthcoming</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0309132512448831">Mann, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0309132512448831">Wainwright, forthcoming</xref>) As Gramsci explains:<disp-quote>
<p>The individual does not enter into relations with other men by juxtaposition, but organically, in as much, that is, as he belongs to organic entities which range from the simplest to the most complex. Thus Man [sic] does not enter into relations with the natural world just by being himself part of the natural world, but actively, by means of work and technique. Further: these relations are not mechanical. They are active and conscious. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0309132512448831">Gramsci, 1971</xref>: 352)</p>
</disp-quote> Gramsci’s argument here is strikingly similar to the underlying premises of Smith’s work. Ontologically, humanity is part of the ‘natural world’ and the internal relationship that people have to ‘nature’ is the result of activity, work and technique. If there are similarities between Gramsci and Smith, there might be ways in which other aspects of Gramsci’s approach might reinvigorate work on the production of nature.</p>
<sec id="section7-0309132512448831">
<title>1 On the subjects and organization of labour</title>
<p>Gramsci is often credited with being a theorist of hegemony, concerned with the consensual and coercive relations that underpin the rule of a particular social group. In contrast, Michael <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0309132512448831">Denning (2009</xref>) has recently argued that Gramsci was a theorist of labour interested in the shifting conditions and organization of labour. There is clearly no need to choose between these two Gramscis; however, Denning’s point highlights the occlusion of Gramsci’s deep interest in the broad social and spatial relations that organize the labour process (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0309132512448831">Ekers et al., forthcoming</xref>). As Denning also suggests, Gramsci often appears less interested in the discreet topics of ‘work’ or ‘labour’ than the broad regulation of work. Thus: ‘The most widespread methodological error…has been to look for the essential characteristic in the intrinsic nature of intellectual activity rather than in the system of relations wherein this activity is located within the general ensemble of social relations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0309132512448831">Gramsci, 1971</xref>: 8). The same holds true for activity that is more conventionally understood as work: ‘the worker is not specifically characterised by his manual or instrumental work but by his working in specific conditions and within specific social relations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0309132512448831">Gramsci, 1996</xref>: 199). With echoes of Marx’s emphasis on the ‘concentration of many determinations’, Gramsci thus shifts our focus away from work itself to an appreciation of the broad conditions of labour and the ensemble of relations that organize working life and the production of nature. Gramsci’s integral understanding of labour is historicized in his notes on ‘Americanism and Fordism’ in which he examines how the rationalization of labour was central in enabling the rising hegemony of the United States. What marks these notes as exceptional is the acute attention to the ensemble of relations that frame the question of labour. A high wage regime was of course one part of the regulation of labour during the emergence of Fordism: yet such a strategy of labour management was connected to a broad number of social processes including prohibition, the regulation of sexuality and changing migration patterns at the international level and between city and country. Engaging with Gramsci’s discussion of labour enables us to build upon Swyngedouw’s call to consider the ‘the particular relational frame through which this labour is socially organized’ in the production of nature. It does so by radically opening up the ‘relational frame’ through which we understand labour to be organized. Gramsci forces us to consider the ensemble of relations that are woven together in the process of making natures. In short, he provides us with a conceptual vocabulary for understanding the arguments made by those feminists and scholars of agrarian capitalism who emphasize the gendered, classed and racialized regulation of labour in the making of concrete natures.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0309132512448831">Gramsci (1971</xref>: 355) was deeply sceptical of any claims based on ‘man in general’, given that such a formulation always represents an unhistorical and problematic conception of what it means to be human. Against such an account, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0309132512448831">Gramsci (1971</xref>: 352) argued that each person is in a process of ‘becoming’ and ‘is the synthesis not only of existing relations, but of the history of these relations. He is a précis of the past.’ Throughout the <italic>Prison Notebooks </italic>there is no discussion of the ‘subject’ per se. Instead Gramsci’s concern is with the constitutive relations that contribute to a making of ‘the person’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0309132512448831">Thomas, 2009a</xref>). In part, the Gramscian notion of ‘the person’ speaks to some of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0309132512448831">Julie Guthman’s (2011)</xref> concerns with <italic>Uneven Development</italic>. For Guthman, the physical constitution of workers is underplayed in <italic>Uneven Development</italic>, something Smith acknowledges when he claims that more attention needs to be placed on the body as a particular production of nature. Gramsci’s analysis of how particular persons are historically made – always emphasizing that the production of nature is one crucial moment in this process – is one way of conceptualizing the making of workers in the making of social natures. As Gramsci argues:<disp-quote>
<p>one could say that each one of us changes and modifies the complex relations of which he is the hub. In this sense the real philosopher is, and cannot be other than, the politician, the active man who modifies the environment, understanding by environment the ensemble of relations which each of us enters to take part in. If one’s own individuality is the ensemble of these relations, to create one’s personality means to acquire consciousness of them and modify one’s own personality means to modify the ensemble of these relations. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0309132512448831">Gramsci, 1971</xref>: 352)</p>
</disp-quote> Gramsci historicizes some of his more abstract comments when he considers the concrete development of Americanism and Fordism, examining how Fordism demands a new type of worker. Thus, the ‘American phenomenon’ was the ‘biggest collective effort to date to create, with unprecedented speed, and with consciousness of purpose unmatched in history, a new type of worker and man’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0309132512448831">1971</xref>: 302). Workers do not enter into the production process with their aptitudes and behaviours intact. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0309132512448831">Gramsci (1971</xref>: 298) explains that the production of the ‘new type of worker’ has ‘been an uninterrupted, often painful and bloody process of subjugating natural (i.e. animal and primitive) instincts to new, more complex and rigid norms and habits of order, exactitude and precision which can make possible the increasingly complex forms of collective life which are the necessary consequence of industrial development’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0309132512448831">7</xref>
</sup> The labouring body is thus a historical achievement and involves a process of ‘psycho-physical adaptation’ in which workers became accustomed to the rhythms of an accelerated work schedule. Brought into conversation with debates on the production of nature, Gramsci pushes us to consider how the making of workers goes hand in hand with the making of new natures. We can realize the emphasis Smith places on the subjects that both produce and consume natures, through historicizing the figures of labour and their activity, something that was central to Gramsci’s overall philosophy of praxis.</p>
<p>Within the <italic>Prison Notebooks </italic>Gramsci expresses preliminary reflections on how relations of sexuality, gender and ‘race’ are important components of the ensemble of relations that comprise workers and the organization of their labour. Nevertheless, Gramsci’s treatment of these issues is insufficient for fully understanding how relations of social difference contribute to the organization of labour and the constitution of workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0309132512448831">Ekers, forthcoming</xref>). While the <italic>Prison Notebooks</italic> provide an integral account of labour, an engagement beyond the Italian thinker is necessary for comprehending the full breadth of relations that contribute to the making of nature. We would stress, though, that such an appreciation of social difference can be realized within a Gramscian approach. As Peter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0309132512448831">Thomas (2009a</xref>: 449) explains, Gramsci provides us with a philosophy of praxis that incorporates ‘<italic>a philology of relations of force</italic>, that is, a study of the differential intensity, efficacy and specificity of social practices in their historical becoming’. Within such an open and anti-reductionist understanding of relations of force it is possible to understand how labour is organized in an integral manner through a Gramscian framework that necessarily goes beyond Gramsci.</p>

<title>2 Multitudinous labour</title>
<p>Throughout Marx’s own writings, the terms ‘activity’, ‘work’ and ‘creativity’ tend to be used interchangeably, although with greater emphasis being placed on one or the other, depending on the text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0309132512448831">Ollman, 1971</xref>: 101) and the particular focus. There is little reason why our understandings of the forms of practice involved in the making of natures need be reduced entirely to the capital-labour relation. Feminist standpoint theorists remind us that gendered acts might only be indirectly related to this specific nexus. Nevertheless, in writing <italic>Capital,</italic> Marx placed most emphasis on forms of activity geared towards the immediate satisfaction of life’s needs within capitalist societies. Hence, his focus was on work. Similarly, for Smith, the concern is to explore the ways in which capitalist social relations have become increasingly central to metabolic interactions. Nevertheless, in <italic>The Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0309132512448831">Marx, 1975</xref>) the focus is on ‘activity’ and in Marx’s earlier writings the focus tends to be on creativity. This broader understanding of activity, beyond the concrete determinations that comprise wage labour in capitalist societies, is fundamental to the move made by feminist standpoint theorists such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0309132512448831">Hartsock (1998</xref>). In opening up ‘activity’, Hartsock is thereby able to apply Marx’s understanding of the metabolic interaction of the relationship between human and non-human to her theorization of the conditions of possibility within the historically and geographically situated practices of women within a gendered division of labour. She foregrounds this argument by stressing that ‘the epistemological (and even ontological) significance of human activity is made clear in Marx’s argument not only that persons are active but that reality itself consists of “sensuous human activity, practice”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0309132512448831">Hartsock, 1983</xref>: 118). In so doing, Hartsock builds on the understanding of ‘sensuous activity’ taken forward in the <italic>Theses on Feuerbach </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0309132512448831">Marx, 1975</xref>).</p>
<p>Very few other pieces of writing by Marx were of greater importance than <italic>The Theses on Feuerbach </italic>to Gramsci as he engaged in the mental labour of crafting his <italic>Prison Notebooks</italic> in Mussolini’s fascist prison. Peter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0309132512448831">Thomas (2009b</xref>) makes the somewhat rash claim that the entire notebooks can be seen as an extended meditation on these 11 concise notes that were originally intended to be notes Marx wrote to himself (and, according to Engels, notes that Marx posted above his writing desk). Whether or not this is the case, Gramsci’s understanding of the activity that mediates the metabolic interaction between human and non-human is as open as that found within the <italic>Theses on Feuerbach</italic>. Indeed this understanding of the importance of historically and geographically specific practices can be seen to foreground the particular theorization of the fusion of theory and practice within Gramsci’s philosophy of praxis.</p>
<p>Gramsci’s own life was defined by multiple forms of labour through which he aimed to ‘modify the environment’, inclusive of the ‘ensemble of relations’ that he participated in. He was influenced deeply by his training in linguistics, which informed his role as theatre critic for <italic>L’Ordine Nuovo</italic>. He also had direct experiences of the Factory Councils emerging within the increasingly Taylorist production lines of Fiat within Turin. Gramsci also grew up among forms of peasant production still present within Sardinia. Thinking through Gramsci’s early experiences within the raw landscape of central Sardinia, John Berger writes, in a letter to Subcommandante Marcos, of how ‘[Gramsci’s] special patience came from a sense of a practice which will never end’, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309132512448831">Berger (2001</xref>: 233) reminds us should not be misunderstood as ‘indolence or complacency’. Berger relates this to the practice of ‘living with stones’, especially the <italic>nuraghis</italic> (stone structures) that surrounded Gramsci’s birthplace in Ghilarza. While Berger perhaps overlooks Gramsci’s more critical comments on rural life, he helps identify how a patient understanding of a practice that will never end, and the becoming of the person in the making of new landscapes shapes Gramsci’s awareness of the multiple forms in which human activity appropriates nature, whether through mental, physical or scientific labours, and enables a reading of Marx that is similarly attentive to the shifting emphases throughout the latter’s oeuvre. Thus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0309132512448831">Gramsci (1971</xref>: 353) writes that:<disp-quote>
<p>The ways in which the single individual enters into relation with nature are many and complex, since by technique one should understand not only the <italic>ensemble</italic> of scientific ideas applied industrially (which is the normal meaning of the word) but also the ‘mental’ instruments, philosophical knowledge. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0309132512448831">Gramsci, 1971</xref>: 353)</p>
</disp-quote> The diversity of activities that defined Gramsci’s life become articulated in a conceptual vocabulary here as he stresses the diverse relations that define individuals’ engagements with nature. Gramsci thus provides us with a theoretical vocabulary, and a life, that emblematically captures material and symbolic production of nature.</p>
<p>Reclaiming a sense of the concrete determinations of human practice in different historical moments and in different geographical situations is not only crucial to theorizing the present and the past, it is crucial for envisioning a new metabolic interaction between human and non-human in the future. In short, a creative vision of what emancipated human activity <italic>could be</italic> is absolutely crucial to any theorization of the production of nature within a future communist society. The reduction of human activity to abstract labour, although in some (but never in all) senses historically achieved by capitalism, cannot provide the sole base for envisioning alternatives. Abstractions, although necessary if we want to avoid lapsing into a form of endless empiricism, are themselves to be fought and superseded, not reinforced by our academic practice. Gramsci’s philosophy of praxis thereby pushes us to look elsewhere and to historicize (always geographically) the specific practices of making natures.</p>

<title>3 The historicizing impulse: against guarantees</title>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Political Economy tends to etherealize, universalize and de-historicize the relations of bourgeois production. But what follows if, as Marx does, we insist on starting with a principle of historical specifications? Do we then, nevertheless, assume that there is some common, universal practice – ‘production-in-general’ – which has always existed, which has then been subject to an evolutionary historical development which can be steadily traced through: a practice which, therefore, we can reduce to its common-sense content and employ as the obvious, uncontested starting-point for analysis? The answer is, no. Whatever other kind of ‘historicist’ Marx may have been, he was definitely not a historical evolutionist. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0309132512448831">Hall, 2003</xref>: 117)</p>
</disp-quote>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0309132512448831">Smith (1984</xref>: 34) opens his discussion of the production of nature through advocating for Marx’s ‘logico-historical methodology’, which seeks to derive a number of theoretical abstractions from concrete facets of social life before seeking to reconstruct the concrete in thought. In the case of volume one of <italic>Capital, </italic>this ‘methodology’ pushes Marx to start with the commodity and then explore the abstractions of exchange value, use value, value, and socially necessary labour time in order to reconstruct within the concrete in thought an understanding of the production, distribution and consumption of commodities, labour and capital. Smith states that he wants to follow this treatment of the commodity and yet refract it through a discussion of the production of nature. However, in order to achieve the reconstruction of the concrete totality, further determinations are necessary.</p>
<p>To develop an account of the production of nature – devoid of the guarantee that an abstract, universal subject does the work of making new natures – it is necessary to ceaselessly historicize the processes and relations that come to bear on the production of nature. In other words, an account of the production of nature without guarantees must also constantly historicize labour. To historicize, as Stuart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0309132512448831">Hall (1980</xref>) suggests, involves detailing the specific forms of political, economic and cultural relations in place and time. The contour and character of these relations ‘cannot be deduced, a priori’, but rather ‘must be made historically specific by supplying those further delineations which explain their differentiae’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0309132512448831">Hall, 1980</xref>: 322). To historicize is to challenge the naturalizations and ethereal claims that abound within bourgeois political economy. Hall builds on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0309132512448831">Gramsci (1971</xref>: 465) who argues that ‘it has been forgotten that in the case of a very common expression, historical materialism, one should put the accent on the first term – “historical” – and not on the second, which is of metaphysical origin’. In Gramsci’s absolute historicism, just as in the <italic>Grundrisse</italic>, the challenge is to account for the contingency – rather than the universality – of specific relations, including labour histories and geographies. This involves accounting for difference and the historically and geographically situated processes driving differentiation. Accounts of the production of nature will be analytically and politically stronger – indeed more concrete – if such a method is held as a central part of both theory and practice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0309132512448831">Gramsci’s (1971)</xref> method of historical study helps us accomplish such a project. For Gramsci, political and social theory does not exist in a realm separate from the ebbs and flows of history and geography. Concepts gain their efficacy, and concreteness, when they emerge out of, and reflect back upon, the practices and ideologies of particular historical conjunctures. Joseph Buttigieg offers one of the most lucid explanations of this relationship between particular histories and larger theories in Gramsci’s work, arguing that:<disp-quote>
<p>When fragments or particular pieces of information or specific observations lead to some general or generalizing insight, the generalization does not acquire the status of an overarching theory which endows the particulars with a stable meaning while remaining itself autonomous from them. The [concepts] always point to different synthetic combinations, but without ever settling into a final definitive synthesis; and they always call for a return to the particular details, the fragments which retain their historical specificity even as they induce new and more complex concepts that are linked to one another in an increasingly dense and ever more extensive shifting network of relations. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309132512448831">Buttigieg, 1990</xref>: 66)</p>
</disp-quote> The crucial insight in this passage is that ‘theory’ emerges out of the particular, is never stable and must always return to particular histories which, in turn, demand further conceptual developments that produce the concreteness of our ‘theories’. Implicit within Gramsci’s method then is a dual sense of the concrete as both a point of departure (from the imagined concrete) and a site of arrival (as a reproduction of the concrete in thought). To follow Gramsci requires never settling on an ‘overarching theory that endows the particular with a stable meaning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309132512448831">Buttigieg, 1990</xref>: 66) but, rather, restlessly returning to fragments of historical and geographic life which ‘induce new and more complex concepts’. Following Buttigieg – and Gramsci – it is necessary to examine ‘increasingly dense and ever more extensive shifting networks of relations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309132512448831">Buttigieg, 1990</xref>: 66) through which nature is produced.</p>

<p>Recently, there has been a new interest in Gramsci’s relevance to environmental politics. Much of this work has sought to analyse concrete histories of environmental change and struggles through a Gramscian lens. This research has built on these concrete engagements to build a Gramscian sensibility to environmental politics stressing an integral approach that addresses the intertwining of science, culture, ideology, art and direct action. We take a different tack in this article and examine the conceptual and methodological relevance of his work to our understanding of the production of nature.</p>
