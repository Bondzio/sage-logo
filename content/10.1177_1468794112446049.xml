<abstract>
<p>This essay prefaces a collection on revelatory moments of fieldwork engagement. Drawing upon brief vignettes from our own research experiences, we argue for the methodological significance of memorable events encountered in ethnographic studies. In addressing this relational production of knowledge, we are particularly interested in the role of emotion, discomfort and surprise in ‘fieldwork’ as understood in anthropology. The case materials illustrate moments of experience drawn from three studies conducted in different decades between 1980 and 2011, thereby marking important shifts in the methods and aims of the discipline, conceptions of where fieldwork is appropriately done, and the role of self-knowledge on the part of the researcher. We make the case for the value of revelatory moments and the epistemological approach that enables their apprehension.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This collection emerges from a panel titled <bold><italic>Revelatory Moments of Fieldwork Engagement</italic></bold> held at the 2010 meeting of the Australian Anthropological Society.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1468794112446049">1</xref></sup> In framing the panel, and eliciting the subsequent development of articles, the editors were drawn to the idea that revelatory moments in ethnographic fieldwork are experiences that may be productive of more than a particular set of data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468794112446049">Landén, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468794112446049">Shweder, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468794112446049">Tsing, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1468794112446049">West, 2005</xref>). Certain aspects of fieldwork enable understanding of society and culture through the researcher’s apprehension of their own subjectivity, as they negotiate what can be intense and transformative entanglements with the people and settings of the study. The researcher’s emotional life during fieldwork can be instructive and revealing of understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468794112446049">Davies and Spencer, 2010</xref>) as are at times the awkward and painful aspects of some fieldwork experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468794112446049">Hume and Mulcock, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we seek to foreground and illustrate the notion and value of a <italic>revelatory moment</italic> – as an epistemic unit – within a broader milieu of changing methodological trends. Focused on anthropological fieldwork, but with resonance for similar approaches in related disciplines, we examine how intense subjective experiences on the part of the ethnographer can be instructive in their import for the results of projects – albeit at times in an initially confusing and ambiguous way. We find that the articles in this collection address ethical dimensions of such moments, as well as the personal and professional values they may have. Each of the authors move beyond the literal representation of the event(s) described to extract the social significance implicit in the fleeting moments they record (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468794112446049">Feldman, 2011</xref>: 381).</p>
<sec id="section2-1468794112446049">
<title>Revelatory moments and the field</title>
<p>To focus on the idea of revelatory moments in qualitative research asserts the distinctive centrality of the ‘field’ in ethnographic endeavour. Revelatory moments are derived from the social and material field of the researcher’s experience. In the multiple short case materials we give here, and those presented throughout this collection, such moments have arisen from lengthy immersion, engagement and related periods of participant observation. In anthropology, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468794112446049">Geertz’s (1973)</xref> article on the Balinese cockfight, replete with experiential moments that proved significant for his understanding, is a classic exemplar of revelations drawn from intense engagements in a particular locale. However, as the field of anthropology has developed, and its questions shifted, there has been some debate about whether valorising such forms of discovery may create a misleading impression of the processes by which contemporary anthropological knowledge is produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468794112446049">Faubion and Marcus, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468794112446049">Hamilton, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468794112446049">Hannerz, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Do the realities of current ethnographic practice facilitate the ‘field’ as the core site for the production of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468794112446049">Faubion and Marcus, 2009</xref>)? George <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468794112446049">Marcus (2006</xref>: 115), for example, suggests that in contemporary anthropological studies, the empirical findings from fieldwork are decreasing in significance, producing ‘a derivative of the existing knowledge of others’. He asserts that the value of fieldwork in the process of producing ethnography may now be that it ‘provides stimulation and ideas, but is relatively “thin” in materials, […] it is the diffuse efforts to come to terms with the lacks and failures of fieldwork afterwards that provide the richest and “thickest” materials’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468794112446049">Marcus, 2006</xref>: 115). Accounts of his students’ fieldwork, exhibiting the shift in knowledge production from the field to post-fieldwork reflection, support this proposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468794112446049">Faubion and Marcus, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Jennifer Hamilton is one such student who describes how her ethnography <italic>Indigeneity in the Courtroom: Law, Culture, and the Production of Difference in North American Courts</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468794112446049">Hamilton, 2008</xref>), while arising out of what she terms a ‘Neo-Malinowskian methodological orientation (“go there” and “just do it” ethnography)’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468794112446049">Hamilton, 2009</xref>: 75), was not substantially based on ‘fieldwork data’. Hamilton describes her empirical material as falling mainly into one of two categories: that which was ‘unproductive’ – information she could have scripted beforehand – and that which was ‘unusable’ – information told to her off the record. However, while her resultant ethnography did not draw heavily on fieldwork data as such, and instead was based on the proceedings of key court cases and media commentary, she nevertheless asserts that ‘the dissertation and the book that followed could not have been produced without those data and that experience [derived from fieldwork]’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468794112446049">Hamilton, 2009</xref>: 73). The productive value of fieldwork is thereby suggested but arguably not defined with specificity. Thus, the shifts Marcus describes may be taking place.</p>
<p>However, contemporary ethnographic work continues to demonstrate the value of unpredictable and sometimes surprising fieldwork happenings. In the preface of <italic>Friction: An Ethnography of Global Connection</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1468794112446049">Anna Tsing (2005</xref>: x) describes how she ‘first became excited by the possibilities of studying environmental connections across difference when […] [she] stumbled upon a curious misunderstanding during 1994 fieldwork in Indonesia’. Tsing writes of uncovering and exploring a series of systematic misunderstandings that existed among different groups of actors who nevertheless collaborated successfully in a campaign to expel a logging company. Drawing upon multiple sources of data (and methods of collection), but nevertheless set against a backdrop of long-term participant observation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1468794112446049">Tsing (2005</xref>: xi) makes clear the extent to which her ethnography is built upon her cross-cultural ‘ethnographic learning’. In her writing, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1468794112446049">Tsing (2005</xref>: 10) articulates how ‘knowledge claims emerge in relation to concrete problems and possibilities for dialogue – the productive features of friction’. Thus, through this spontaneous fieldwork event, Tsing is led to see the limits of relying expectedly on the revealing of <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge. Instead, she learned to train her focus on how the researcher’s engagement with certain frictional–relational moments both <italic>produces</italic> and <italic>transmits</italic> the knowledge she develops.</p>
<p>Moving substantially away from conventional ‘naturalistic’ recording of empirical data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468794112446049">Hammersley and Atkinson, 1989</xref>) – material on which much anthropology has been founded – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468794112446049">Deeb and Marcus (2011)</xref> focus almost solely on the <italic>productive</italic> aspects of interpretive knowledge in their formulation of the idea of a <italic>para-site</italic> for investigation. In this fieldwork, a mode of investigation that produces understanding through a kind of focus group inquiry, a workshop setting facilitates investigators and study participants to come together. Researchers and subjects
<disp-quote>
<p>[…] go beyond the data-gathering or rapport-promoting interview or conversation. In an anticipatory way, what is transacted shapes directly the evolving analytic frames and conceptual apparatus that figure in the results of research. […] [The] purpose is to risk interpretations together. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468794112446049">Deeb and Marcus, 2011</xref>: 51)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This type of ‘fieldwork’ experience in a <italic>para-site</italic> is one aimed explicitly at producing interpretive knowledge relationally with those studied rather than searching to reveal information that is unambiguously present prior to the researcher’s intervention.</p>
<p>In the study of experimental fields that facilitate the production of such knowledge, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468794112446049">Marcus (2009</xref>: 22) explicitly questions the extent to which narratives of ‘surprise and discovery’, occurring within a naturalistic fieldwork setting, are intrinsic or valuable components of ethnographic endeavour. Taking a contrasting position, however, is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468794112446049">Marilyn Strathern (2000)</xref> who continues to celebrate the value of surprise in ethnography:
<disp-quote>
<p>To the extent that people’s interpretations of one another’s actions are central to social life, the practice of ethnographic interpretation, description, holds a very particular place in social science. Narrative and interpretation both imply some kind of interaction or dialogue between persons, imagined or not, a crucial source of social indeterminacy. […] Keeping open a place for the unpredictable or contingent can be taken as one of the <italic>achievements</italic> of anthropological-style ethnography. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468794112446049">Strathern, 2000</xref>: 286–287)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Strathern stresses the value of what we would term naturalistic observation both for the collation of knowledge recorded from informants and the interpretation of social relations. The unpredictability of social life supports the value of maintaining open-ended approaches to the data gathering that do not rest on preordained or methodologically foreshadowed analytical purposes. Whether through classical fieldwork modalities of long-term participant observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468794112446049">Evans-Pritchard, 1951</xref>), or contemporary interview-based ethnography that one of us has argued is best characterised as ‘participant listening’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468794112446049">Forsey, 2010</xref>), our own research experiences position us in sympathy with Strathern’s view. Moreover, at a time when bureaucratic and organisational auditing processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468794112446049">Strathern, 2000</xref>) increasingly require the ethnographer to define in detail, and in advance, one’s planned research outcomes and related methods, we think it is important to demonstrate the value of an open and inductive epistemological orientation that also provides space for ‘creative imagination and some disciplined intuition’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468794112446049">Shweder, 1997</xref>: 154).</p>
<p>While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468794112446049">Deeb and Marcus’s (2011)</xref> <italic>para-site</italic> is arguably a mode of investigation where realisations of a certain kind may be produced, for us, what distinguishes a revelatory moment in fieldwork is that which is instructive for reasons beyond (or that sit behind) the production of discourse. Specifically, we wish to articulate and embrace the importance of significant moments in fieldwork as intrinsically emotional, or <italic>felt</italic>, processes, concern for which emerges in most of the papers presented in this collection. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468794112446049">Fernandez (1986</xref>: 215) asserts that anthropology begins with what he calls ‘revelatory incidents’ – highly charged events in human relationships that are ‘pregnant with meaning’. While this collection of articles is built around such energised moments, we do not suggest that these sorts of ‘social dramas’ are a necessary part of all anthropological inquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468794112446049">Fernandez, 2010</xref>: 249). Instead, we point simply to the fact that the emotion of <italic>feeling</italic>, particularly when coupled with disciplined intuition, should be seen as sitting equally alongside seeing and hearing as ethnographic senses that matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468794112446049">Forsey, 2010</xref>). Such analytical harnessing of feelings can range from informing simple awareness, to the ‘clicking’ into place of previously diffuse concepts, to highly instructive emotional experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468794112446049">Davies and Spencer, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>By elevating the status of <italic>feeling</italic> in a revelatory fieldwork moment, we re-articulate the importance of a fieldworker’s subjectivity and/or auto-ethnographic insight as analytically important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468794112446049">Hedican, 2006</xref>). As with our defence of the value of ‘surprise’, acknowledging emotional/subjective responses (and reflexivity in general) as a legitimate aspect of research can be problematic in the broader epistemological milieu in which ethnographic knowledge is consumed. An example is social research in environmental studies, where what is taken to constitute ‘good’ data and/or evidence is overwhelmingly that which is ‘objective’, in contrast to narrative impressions infused with the subjectivity of the researcher. In this area, in fact it is quantitative data that are held to be the gold standard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468794112446049">Head et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468794112446049">Meurk, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet the emotional content of the ethnographic vignettes presented in this collection also underlines how the dispositions of researchers, and their findings, are significantly unearthed and reshaped in the moments described. The accounts point squarely to the way that fieldwork encounters of relatively small pieces of social interaction can influence considerably the fieldworker’s emergent understanding. Brief illustrations from our own anthropological research, drawn from three consecutive decades over which there has been considerable change in ‘fieldwork’ locations and research objectives, set the tone for the articles that follow. Given the subjective experiences we seek to depict, first person narratives are apt.</p>

<title>The ethnographer’s ensorcellment: fieldwork in the 1980s (David Trigger)</title>
<p>In the course of research with an Aboriginal population in north Australia, my revelatory moment depicted here was neither planned nor pleasant, yet the incident revealed much about acceptance among research subjects. It was also deeply instructive about local beliefs that are typically hard to elicit in formal conversation or interviewing. During fieldwork at the Aboriginal town of Doomadgee in the early 1980s, I was ‘ensorcelled’, or had sorcery performed against me. This occurred after several bouts of fieldwork, totalling at the time to some 4 months, when I was a young anthropologist studying traditional relations to land and postcolonial race relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468794112446049">Trigger, 1992</xref>). A trip by road to another community approximately 300 km to the west had been planned over a few weeks. Some seven adults and two children were to accompany me. However, in the course of picking up the group, an altercation occurred at the dwelling of a particular senior man after I said I could not take the quantity of possessions he wished to load on to my vehicle. These included parts of his humpy dwelling itself and he took great offence when I refused his efforts to load them. Aware of him loudly complaining, I got into the driver’s seat, and prepared to move off with the other passengers seated both in the cabin with me and on the back of the vehicle. What was about to be revealed was that in a rage this man then ‘chucked a wind’ at me – an expression in the local Aboriginal–English vernacular that was that designated a highly dangerous form of social action.</p>
<p>Amid the yelling coming from the old man, and immediately following his angrily smashing a heavy stick into the galvanised iron sheets forming a wall of his humpy, a woman on the back of the vehicle stood and screamed that he ‘bin chuck’im wind la this boy, he bin open’im arse la this boy’. From the driver’s seat, I had seen the man present his back to the vehicle and lift one leg and buttock, while yelling in his language that I could not understand. The elderly woman called loudly from the tray of the vehicle to her husband who was several streets away as people dismounted while I remained seated at the steering wheel. I knew at the time this woman stood to me in fictive kin terms as ‘(cousin)-mother’ as I had been gradually learning about the extraordinarily inclusive idioms of Aboriginal kinship in the southern Gulf Country. She and the others quickly assembled off the vehicle to face the old man who (I eventually discovered) was being accused of seeking to harm me with sorcery.</p>
<p>People began to congregate around us. Several other older people supporting me announced what had happened, that this old man had ‘chucked a wind’ at me. At the time, I had little understanding of what this meant. Then there was an argument. A battle of words took place with me as the young fieldworker at the centre. I remember remaining largely silent and waiting to be told what to do next, though I also recall being confused about what was going on. Eventually, after some 30 minutes of loud exchanges, the senior people travelling with me got back into the vehicle and said it was safe to drive off. We took a few days to travel from Doomadgee to the destination town of Borroloola where my travelling companions were to meet relatives and we were to discuss my work mapping traditional landscapes. Not long after our departure I was warned that the old man’s brother lived at Borroloola and was potentially an even more dangerous purveyor of sorcery.</p>
<p>A senior man sat closely next to me as we drove from Doomadgee, indicating his role as protector. Another mature man on the back of the truck sat facing towards where we had come from, with his legs looped over the rear tray. As he explained it this was in order to turn back any sorcery forces that might come from that direction. Before leaving, he had assured me that he had songs piled up to the top of his throat, gesturing vigorously with his hand held against his chin, and that he could turn back any sorcery winds that might try to overturn our motor vehicle.</p>
<p>On the first night away, when we camped in the bush, some of the people present sat up all night to keep a watch, and as they said at the time, to protect me. My ‘mother’, the woman who had first called out after the sorcery wind was expelled in my direction, chided me for musing over whether we might have gone back later to placate the old man. She made it clear that you do not make concessions after being attacked in the way that had happened. Through the night, as various bush sounds startled my companions, their concerns and the whole event made me apprehensive; I recall doing what I was told and sleeping with my .22 rifle next to me! The rifle and the off-road vehicle that had become embroiled in my ensorcellment were part of the equipment recommended for fieldwork by some of my anthropologist mentors. The licensed firearm was to be used for hunting and perhaps for a sense of security in the remote region. On the night in question, however, I recall having little clarity as to exactly what I might end up shooting at.</p>
<p>My reflections on these events, more than 30 years after my first major bouts of fieldwork, are about where significant lessons for the ethnographer may be derived. The incident I have recounted was revelatory in prompting a key stage in my interpretations of the lives of my research participants. It revealed that I had achieved a substantial degree of incorporation among those with whom I was living. While my communicative competence in local idioms had a long way to go to facilitate comprehensive understanding of beliefs about the spiritual and imaginative worlds of my interlocutors, intense intimacies were articulated through being both attacked and defended. My revelatory moment confirmed, if not prompted, an understanding that ethnographic fieldwork hardly ensured always being on good terms with all persons who are encountered in a study. In fact, one indication of a degree of acceptance and success in fieldwork could be when people feel sufficiently close to dispute and fight with you.</p>
<p>The event highlighted the tricky balance one must negotiate between being a participant and an observer and how this process is not entirely within the control of the fieldworker. Could I ever be enculturated to the extent that I became a ‘believer’ in the sorcery practices I had encountered? I recall how some months later, when a rear wheel came off my vehicle while driving on a dirt road, people commented that this was the sorcery wind eventually catching up with me. My own thoughts were whether I had failed to properly tighten the nuts when changing the wheel earlier that day – the convictions about spiritual forces that could be marshalled and repelled were too distant intellectually for me to embrace. Some anthropologists may well decide differently. A colleague who has worked in the same region for many years has written that he remains silent when asked by Aboriginal people if he ‘believes’ the knowledge revealed to him. Unlike me, he leaves open the question of the researcher embracing the convictions of his fictive kin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468794112446049">Bradley, 2010</xref>: xix). Indeed, this anthropologist has documented for the community of his Aboriginal teachers in faithful detail the very method of performing the sort of dangerous sorcery attack that was used against me. Chucking a wind was established in the religious mythology of ‘the Dreaming’ when an ‘old Spirit Man’ became angry with his companions, bent over, ‘pulled his buttocks apart and let out an enormous fart of fire from his anus’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468794112446049">Yanyuwa Families et al., 2003</xref>: 166). In the mythical account, the victims were burned to death, but the story holds resonance of a spiritual as well as a physical assault.</p>
<p>Following my intense period of fieldwork over some 5 years in the region my writing was oriented towards the politics of race relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468794112446049">Trigger, 1992</xref>). However, the incident I have described now signals for me the early phases of a long relationship with Aboriginal communities of the southern Gulf Country. Long-term ethnographic fieldwork can generate close and enduring social relationships. Despite the fact that I moved a long way away, living on the western side of the Australian continent for 20 years, I have gone back regularly, often for difficult practical issues, to work on land negotiations, native title claims or mining resource development issues (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1468794112446049">Trigger, 1997a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468794112446049">1997b</xref>). My ‘cousin-mother’, who sounded the alarm when I was ensorcelled, passed away in the mid 1990s, but I remain a kinsperson for her children and grandchildren. Her intervention to defend me, so long ago, prefigured my understanding of what is possible through ethnography, including its value beyond solely a means of data collection. My reflections now of how I was spiritually attacked and defended confirm for me the strengths of qualitative methodology through in-depth fieldwork – a methodology that focuses on interpretations of society that find the ‘great’ in the ‘small’, and the revelatory in the midst of intense and emotional social interaction.</p>

<title>Vampires and vote rigging: fieldwork in the 1990s (Martin Forsey)</title>
<p>My fieldwork account concerns a vampire (or at least a young woman dressed as one) and my role as an accomplice to vote stacking at a high school ball (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468794112446049">Forsey, forthcoming</xref>). Rather than constituting the beginning point of my doctoral PhD research, this particular revelatory moment came very much at the end of it, marking the final night of my qualitative inquiries. My ‘field site’ was a high school located in the city of Perth, the capital of Western Australia.</p>
<p>While this first period of major research encompassed a broad study of neo-liberal reform in the context of a government high school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468794112446049">Forsey, 2007</xref>), the particular incident reported here marked a return to the conceptual focus of my original research intentions. The initial aim was to understand how social and cultural differences were negotiated among students. I came to the school ball moment via a project I helped instigate, which sought to elicit student views on the cultural groups of their cohort. As it turned out, the event revealed a small but highly instructive tear in the otherwise established social fabric of the Year 12 group who had formed a core of the research subjects among whom I had done fieldwork.</p>
<p>In discussions and inquiries with the students I had become aware that there was some unhappiness about the organisation of the upcoming school ball. More importantly, before the event itself, I had sensed that this discontent might manifest in an interesting way. One student in particular (‘Cindy’) informed me about a number of her non-conformist plans in advance, including her intention to attend, not in a ball gown but dressed as a vampire. She also intended to break from the expected pattern of student groups travelling in hired limousines and arrive at the ball by public transport.</p>
<p>The evening’s festivities included voting for a number of awards – the Beau and Belle of the ball, ‘the Most Outrageous Person’ and ‘the Best Couple’ – and it was here that I became an accomplice to the instance of ball-night vote rigging. Having offered my assistance to the organisers I was deputised to the role of vote counter for the prizes. It was quickly apparent to me that Cindy and her friends were executing a plan to influence the outcomes by ballot stuffing. They were effective in this task and I knowingly tallied the fraudulent votes and delivered the unexpected results to a somewhat confused organising committee. Students who had positioned themselves on the margins of established style and attitudes to the ball as a formal celebratory occasion had apparently achieved popularity.</p>
<p>Coming at the end of my fieldwork period of some 12 months, this event was a productive ‘surprise’ that prompted my subsequent and ongoing critique of the concept of resistance as a theoretical lens for understanding school culture and student practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468794112446049">Forsey, forthcoming</xref>). The school ball revealed a somewhat unusual set of power relations in the field, and not just with respect to the students themselves. As an adult who was positioned ambiguously between teachers and students, I was pressed (albeit willingly) into the service of a marginal, if not often subjugated, group of students led by a teenage female. Thus, the researcher’s positioning was embedded in this momentary upheaval of established small-scale power relations.</p>
<p>The announcement of the highly unlikely Belle and Beau, and then also the Couple of the Ball, drew no visible shock, no boos, no catcalls and no great sense of surprise, as I have written about this event:
<disp-quote>
<p>As soon as the award ceremony, such as it was, was completed the band struck their chords and the dancing continued with renewed vigour. Only some of us knew the details of what had just happened. I saw it as a minor triumph for Cindy and her friends; I wrote a quick note about ‘the unpopular ones winning’ and of ‘the normal power base being ignored and divided’. I then joined the crowd on the dance floor. It was a night of fun for me in various ways, and, as already indicated, it was a neat way to finish off my fieldwork. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468794112446049">Forsey, forthcoming</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This temporary rent in the fabric of social relations among high school students produced no long-lasting effects that I am aware of. Unlike the account from David Trigger above, I have not maintained contact with any of my research subjects over the years following the completion of the study. However, the minor rebellion by a fringe group at the end of fieldwork had a timely revelatory import for my understanding of group dynamics as I was forming the final stages of understanding in the research project setting. It showed that the structure of relations of dominance among students could be challenged on occasion. My presence, and minor incorporation into the small protest by Cindy and her cohort, partly enabled the outcome of prizes being given to those who would normally have not been expected to win them. Hence my surprise at witnessing a momentary change in the pattern of status relations that I had been studying.</p>
<p>If I had not been present at the events of the school ball, I believe my resulting writing about the culture of educational institutions would have been less comprehensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468794112446049">Forsey, 2007</xref>). Beyond the usual expectation that fieldwork involves the potential for surprise, and the possibility of unpredictable rupturings of emergent analytical conclusions, I could not have planned this fieldwork experience in advance.</p>

<title>Between euphoria and the ethics committee: fieldwork in the 2000s (Carla Meurk)</title>
<p>My revelatory experience (and I understood it as such at the time) was quite pleasant when it happened – euphoric in fact – and it taught me a great deal. In this way, the moment I describe stood in stark contrast to the bulk of my doctoral research, which up to that point had ranged from demoralising, to frustrating, to fairly traumatic. Broadly speaking, my doctoral study set out to examine a ‘mysterious impasse’ in the wet tropics of Far North Queensland, Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468794112446049">Meurk, 2011</xref>: xii). My aim was to understand why a long-term institutional plan for feral pig management remained elusive in a sociopolitical context where it appeared there was a high degree of agreement on a number of pertinent issues. An early scoping visit to my field site sparked an interest in pig hunting when I was told that hunters, Euro-Australians resident in the region, had supposedly vandalised a live-catch pig trap deployed by government employees seeking to manage the environment.</p>
<p>My interest in pig hunting was, at the outset, independent of any particular subjective opinions; I was curious about, yet relatively ambivalent towards, such practices. The purported vandalism event justified to me the relevance of incorporating pig hunters as ethnographic subjects of study in the broader work on feral animal management. However, I had some difficulty gaining supervisors’ and funders’ support to have White Australian pig hunters recognised as a valid group to study. My ability to pursue this avenue was facilitated after making some changes in supervision and shifting my disciplinary allegiance from a school of animal studies to anthropology. At the university, I gained human ethics and school approval to conduct a study that would be based on interviews, focus groups, participant observation with the local state employed pig trapper and an analysis of key texts (including pig hunting magazines and scientific articles on environmental management). However, following two ethics applications, two ethics committees and a long wait, I was denied approval to be a participant observer at actual hunting events.</p>
<p>Drawing on the relevant correspondence, I can indicate the reasons given in the ruling against my request to include hunting events in my ethnographic fieldwork. The decision was that
<disp-quote>
<p>[…] Hunting pigs with dogs and knives is by its nature adrenalin charged and is not conducive to considered observance of any previously agreed safety measures and procedures. […] To participate in/observe the culmination of the hunt, the researcher will need to be quite close to the pig, the dogs and the hunters and therefore must be at some risk. The use of firearms at the culmination of the hunt presents an additional risk.</p>
<p>[…] The activity of pig hunting (with guns and knives) is contentious. Apart from the element of risk to participants, the issues of animal welfare and the broader community standards need to be considered. Although the researcher proposes to ‘observe’ a hunt and not be physically involved in the actual hunt itself, it may be argued that her voluntary presence as an observer nevetheless [sic] compromises her integrity and makes her an ‘accomplice’ to a contentious activity. […]</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Among other things to note here is that, some 20–30 years following David Trigger’s fieldwork described above, firearms had been unequivocally transformed from tools of anthropology to objects of unreasonable risk.</p>
<p>I was advised that, should I wish to pursue this matter, I would need to create a set of legally binding forms to the satisfaction of the university. These forms, to be filled out and signed by hunters I wished to accompany, were to include (but were not limited to) the following:</p>
<list id="list1-1468794112446049" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>A brief description of the safety record of the gatekeeper’s [hunter’s] organisation or group of participating colleagues – including specific details of injuries suffered by any of these individuals during their previous five pig hunting expeditions.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>An undertaking that no alcohol will be consumed by hunters accompanying the investigator during the day of the hunt – up to the time of full completion of hunting activities.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Confirmation that a competent and experienced hunter, armed with a suitable rifle, will be designated to guide and protect the investigator at all times during the hunt – to the complete exclusion of any other involvement in the proceedings […]</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Ultimately, however, while refusing human ethical clearance largely for reasons of occupational health and safety, the committee acknowledged the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>[…] we recognise that the committee does not have jurisdiction to direct the student in matters where she acts in her private (ie, non-student) capacity. On this we simply say that she should nevertheless ensure her safety in any activity engaged in of her own accord and that she does so at her own risk.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>I began PhD study in 2006; however, it was not until late 2009 that I finally went pig hunting, having determined that any such trips I went on were to be noted as in my own time, that is, not in my capacity as a student.</p>
<p>At about 3 pm one Sunday afternoon, acting in my non-student capacity and having paid my own public liability insurance, I arrived at the house of hunters I planned to accompany. It was during, and shortly after, one hunt that I experienced an event I considered revelatory. We were to go hunting through the sugarcane fields with dogs. The shooters, with me shadowing one, positioned themselves around the outside of a paddock in which pigs were feeding, seeking to place themselves close to the exit routes of the pigs to be flushed out by dogs. Standing in anticipation and silence, wondering what was going to happen, I eventually heard the sound of pigs snapping the cane – a very distinctive, crisp, clear and clean snap. Then, as the dogs had disturbed them, I heard a melodic wooden, hollow noise that signalled pigs moving through the tubes of cane. I could hear them coming towards us and my senses of where I was and what I was doing sharpened. Because of the density of the cane, I could not see them and I had no idea where they would come from until all of a sudden they appeared, racing out of the cane only metres away from us moving swiftly along the exit routes the hunters had identified. I was keenly aware of my knees shaking. My mind became completely clear and intently focused on these animals. I was hypersensitised to my body and the pigs to the exclusion of all else. It was exhilarating and I felt euphoric. Due to a malfunction of weaponry this hunting trip was, in fact, altogether unsuccessful with respect to killing the pigs. But this lack of success had no bearing on the intense emotions I experienced.</p>
<p>After the hunt, I went back to my accommodation. In my euphoria, I could hardly sit still to write notes. Literature on hunting practice draws upon sexual metaphors and imageries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468794112446049">Dizard, 1994</xref>; Kerasote, 1993) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468794112446049">Michael Pollan (2006)</xref> likens the feelings of hunting to experiencing a drug induced high. My notes from immediately after the event allude to the intense pleasure I felt. However, they also document quite explicitly the intensity of my anger that spilled out at this moment. The event had strongly validated my belief that participant observation of hunting was a necessary part of my study, and I documented in my notes my anger at those on the university committees who I thought had obstructed me in pursuing this research and would have denied me such experience.</p>
<p>In terms of the event’s effects on my ethnographic research, most important was that through this experience, including my intense <italic>feelings</italic> and the manner in which they were derived, I came to understand how hunting practice was incommensurate with the worldviews of ecologists and managers, and in relation to Australian cultural norms among people distant from my research setting. Specifically, my experience arose from actions that were incongruous with the calculations of risk and techno-scientific definitions of animal welfare that dominate important environmental bureaucracies and animal protection legislation. This is not to say that the hunters I accompanied were not concerned about ensuring their safety (and mine) and their protection from liability, nor that they were unconcerned with the welfare of the pigs and dogs involved in the hunt – they most certainly were. Rather, what became clear in my fusion of exhilaration and anger was how I was caught between dissonant subcultures where distinctive meanings of concepts such as ‘welfare’ and ‘risk’ were underscored by different life experiences.</p>
<p>The moment in the cane fields further served as an important point from which I retrospectively interpreted and clarified my feelings of resentment about the circumscribed conditions of my fieldwork. Indeed, the intersection of emotions led me to a feeling of alignment with the marginalisation experienced by hunters who were my research participants, for my desire to conduct participant observation with them had been similarly marginalised by the ethics committees I had dealt with. I have, thus, come to see both what was happening to me as a researcher seeking to break free of rules bounding my fieldwork experience and the relationships of hunters with the environmental ‘management’ bureaucracies as analytically revealing of predominant values among an urbane professional class in Australia.</p>
<p>The event solidified for me a clear normative orientation, one that had not existed prior to the event. I became disposed towards supporting the validity of hunting practice in some form. I also came to see deficiencies in a number of legally enshrined cultural values relating to animal and environmental management. Although I would now not comfortably present myself as ‘pro-hunting’ in any unqualified way, the experience in the cane fields with hunters and similar events, which followed during my fieldwork, instilled an appreciation that risk and death were not ‘bad’ but rather, in some instances, could be regarded as necessary and fulfilling parts of human existence.</p>
<p>With the emotional experiences I detail being readily identifiable in the existent literature, what I consider to be most significant about the understanding, including sensory knowledge, produced in my research was that it resulted from my ‘circulat[ing] in some way that <italic>mattered</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468794112446049">Hamilton, 2009</xref>: 77). The circumstances leading to my engagement with hunters have led me to reflect on how certain processes enculturate us to see difference as abhorrent, to marginalise those who are unfamiliar, and to construct certain practices as deviant. To elevate the value of my subjective and sensory experience with hunters to such an extent, however, raises some tricky issues for communication. These auto-ethnographic insights present a form of knowledge likely to be poorly received (if not dismissed altogether) by the natural scientists and ecologists with whom I continue to engage. For me, as a researcher who wishes to facilitate conversations across disciplinary divides, such considerations remain an unresolved problem.</p>

<title>Conclusion: fieldwork moments, instructive and revelatory</title>
<p>We offer these brief illustrations of the fieldwork moments we have found strikingly instructive for understanding the settings in which we have worked. By extension, we present the ethnographic method, and its commitment to the idea of ‘fieldwork’, as valuable in enabling such events to emerge in ways that could not have been planned with precision. This is to return to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468794112446049">Strathern’s (2000)</xref> point that a certain openness to surprise in fieldwork, and the social engagements therein, are potentially productive of understanding that cannot be elicited through interviews or formal conversation.</p>
<p>The cases highlight robust interpersonal dynamics between the researcher and the social fields that form settings for our studies. It is evident that fieldwork can involve continuously shifting dynamics of influence and reputation between ethnographers and those they study. Fieldwork generates its own politics of relationships such that some individuals will commonly be closer in personal ways to the researcher than others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468794112446049">Boccagni, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468794112446049">Bott, 2010</xref>). This fluctuation of the fieldworker’s standing in the social field can, as we have seen from our own cases, encompass considerable drama. To this extent, the more the researcher engages personally with people, the more likely that intensely experienced revelatory moments will arise.</p>
<p>Our point in this introductory essay and in the contributions to this collection is that dramatic events, at times involving discomfort and awkwardness at significant moments during fieldwork, can be highly productive. Such issues generally remain under-theorised, yet they can be usefully diagnostic for our attempts at achieving cultural understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468794112446049">Hume and Mulcock, 2004</xref>: xii, xvi). Revelatory moments are likely to involve considerable emotional investment on the part of the ethnographer. Our own case materials given here, and the articles to follow, demonstrate the mix of distance and intimacy during ethnographic fieldwork. Finding a way through this complexity of social interaction is not achieved without considerable intellectual and practical effort, and the authors represented in this collection illustrate how they have addressed this challenge.</p>
