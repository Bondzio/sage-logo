<p>Accepting that information and communication technology (ICT), as one of the most well-known manifestations of current technology, has been constantly transforming the delivery and dissemination of information and how people, organizations and even governments interact with each other, that it has been penetrating most of the activities and aspects of contemporary life and that the rate of its spread is increasing relentlessly, means that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267323112441288">Heidegger’s (1977b)</xref> famous saying, ‘technology is relentlessly overtaking us’, has come true. Alongside this, certain frequently used and interwoven terms like third wave, information society and digital revolution have been coined in attempts to characterize ICT and its transformative power. In a word, we have been progressively witnessing the emergence and diffusion of digital phenomena under the shadow of the three aforementioned terms. To keep up with such an unprecedented and unique condition, many ideas, theories and discussions produced by a variety of individuals have been disseminated in the form of formal channels of communication like conferences, journals, reports, articles and books. In line with the emerging issues and new horizons that occur in relation to digital phenomena, writing and publishing works regarding the subject are necessary and important. Here the focus is on two related books dealing with ‘digital solidarities’ and ‘digital spaces’.</p>
<p>The first, written by Raboy, Landry and Shtern, looks at the emergence of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) and its two phases, held in Geneva in December 2003 and in Tunis in November 2005, with an emphasis on the second phase and its consequences, and addresses the legacy, players, structures and themes of the WSIS, especially for the global governance of communication. The latter, edited by Kalantzis-Cope and Gherab-Martín, deals with a broad range of digital spaces and issues, aiming to highlight the features and properties of digital technologies in order to discern various cultural, social, economic and political outcomes in contemporary society.</p>
<p>The <italic>Digital Solidarities</italic> book consists of nine chapters in the form of three foundational parts. Part I, ‘A summit in context’ (three chapters), deals generally with the different dimensions of the WSIS institutional and organizational structure; the differences and similarities between the two phases of the Summit; the themes and issues discussed; the role of civil society (CS) and its related organizations in the WSIS, particularly during the second phase; the ways in which Phase II was formed, followed up and organized; and the evaluation of performance of CS as a stakeholder. Part II (three chapters), ‘WSIS Phase II issues and outcomes’, posing the question ‘Can the political consensus occurred in WSIS Phase II truly contribute to the eradication of the digital divide, connect marginalized populations to networks, and integrate networked information and communication technologies into an international development framework?’, concerns the attempts and decisions made by WSIS, especially in Phase II, to meet financing as one of the prerequisites of realizing digital solidarity in the form of information society and as the very basis of the social legitimacy of a globalized information society; CS’s position in developing financial mechanisms; Internet governance as a core issue of the information society agenda from the WSIS perspective; the implementation and follow-up of the principles declared in, and learned from the WSIS phases; and the responsibilities and challenges faced by CS on the road of WSIS implementation and follow-up. Part III, ‘Civil society and global communication governance beyond WSIS’ (three chapters), which has a post-WSIS view, mainly examines the realization of global communication governance after the conclusion of the WSIS. In this line, in discussing the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) as a stakeholder created for addressing Internet governance and policy issues at the global level within the United Nations system, the evolutionary role(s) played and expanding activities done by CS in leading respective international organizations like UNESCO, OECD, WIPO, ITU, etc. are highlighted. It is notable that at the end of Part III, in the ninth and the last chapter of the book, entitled ‘Multi-stakeholder global governance at the WSIS and beyond’, the authors pose some fundamental questions, including ‘What is the legacy of the WSIS?’, ‘Does the WSIS represent a rebranding of existing practices, or a new politics?’, ‘Will the WSIS merit more than an asterisk in the history books?’, ‘Did the WSIS bring about a cultural change in the way people see democratic global governance?’ and ‘What has changed as a result of CS involvement in the WSIS?’ They also try to respond to these broad questions. This is also an overview on the fruits of WSIS–CS linkage in the shadow of the multi-stakeholderism approach.</p>
<p>The edited collection, <italic>Emerging Digital Spaces in Contemporary Society</italic>, comprises 56 chapters divided into 14 parts (each part embraces four chapters), which are anchored by experienced experts, including the editors. Part I, ‘Digital communication’, framed by Robin Mansell, begins with a theoretical chapter entitled ‘Technology, innovation, power, and social consequence’, dealing briefly with analytical perspectives regarding innovations, changes and social consequences occurring as a result of the emergence of new ICTs in society, and especially in everyday life. The chapter is accompanied by three others which can be considered as indicative of the relationship between technology, innovation and social consequence. They report three case studies relating to Arabic websites and their role in e-governance; e-participation and e-democracy in Gipuzkoa (the Basque Country); and collaborative learning at MIT, respectively. The section implicitly posits that the main social transformation which has been occurring around digital technologies is communication.</p>
<p>Part II, ‘Defining new media’, anchored by Carlos Elias, revolves around Gilles Lipovetsky and Jean Serroy’s saying: ‘Life is more and more about being glued to the screen or being online’ (p. 37). Such a view emphasizes the emergence of convergence culture formulated by Web 2.0 philosophy (i.e. interactive and participatory culture), new paradigms in the profession of journalism and the field of mass communication. Illuminating the theme of this section are chapters on CitizenShift and Parole Citoyenne, social media networks considered as community-driven spaces within the Canadian film industry; Barack Obama’s use of Twitter in relation to the changing nature of political communication between the US president and his tech-savvy followers; and the reshaping of the relationship between objects stored in museums and their virtual viewers using digital technologies. Part III, ‘The texts of digital publishing’, led by John B Thompson, considers academic publishing and university presses in the face of their rude awakening to the new world of digital publishing. Taking both a retrospective and prospective overview of the field of academic publishing, and highlighting the cultural and political economy of digital book production influenced by the place of books as communal artefacts in the digital age, this section refers to the open or free textbook movement at Flat World Knowledge – <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.flatworldknowledge.com">www.flatworldknowledge.com</ext-link> – which is the world’s largest publisher of free and open college textbooks. It also considers the benefits of the open-access publishing business model, and the movement from traditional printing and periodical publications to the e-incunabula as a solution for instantaneous scientific communication.</p>
<p>Part IV, ‘The digital citizen’, under the headship of Timothy W Luke, focuses on the ways in which digital networks are reshaping traditional concepts of rights, identity, space (place), action and duties. Accordingly, noting that the definition of citizenship and thus of the state as well as the identity of citizens has changed, new terms such as netizens and netropolitan community that indicate new conditions are debated. As complementary chapters which discuss the political uses of digital technologies and networks, readers are provided with the applications of Facebook in political activism and the formation of a new political sphere in Egypt; the role of Facebook and YouTube in self-publicity and coalition-building in facilitating global grassroots political movements; and the contribution of ICTs in realizing functional diversity and equality of social participation in digital society. In Part V, ‘Power, knowledge, surveillance’, anchored by David Lyon, it is stated that systematic surveillance has became a routine and inescapable part of everyday life in modern times and is now, more often than not, dependent on ICTs (p. 107). Hence the explosion of personal data associated with the prevalence of technoculture and the end of privacy originating in the increased use of surveillance technologies to promote the power and control of governments are extensively discussed. Topics include the ICT-assisted tactics applied by the New York Police Department (NYPD) to realize full spectrum surveillance; the notion of ‘post- surveillance society’ stemming from the role of mobile technologies in the emergence of the technological gaze; and digital identification through face digitization performed by face-recognition technologies.</p>
<p>Part VI, ‘Digital property’, introduced by Phillip Kalantzis-Cope, aims at contextualizing the unfolding debates and visions for social justice arising from digital intellectual property rights, and the broader question of the ownership of intellectual goods in general. Its general concern is with intellectual property and its related issues in post-industrial society. In this line, five interesting paradigms for interpreting intellectual property (i.e. information protectionism, information exceptionalism, information terra nullius, network distributionism and information materialism) are mapped and defined. This is followed by three case studies that deal with the emergence of the free and open source software movement (FLOSS: Free Libre Open Source Software) and peer-to-peer production as ethical concerns concerning digital property within the digital sphere; the construction and follow-up of intellectual property rights in the ongoing process of addressing the global politics of the Internet under the United Nation’s agenda; and local health traditions in Kerala (southwestern India) alongside some considerations on local intellectual property rights. Part VII, ‘The digital commons’, starts with a chapter written by John Willinsky in which he presents a study of how a new generation of open-access scholarly resources is being taken advantage of by those contributing to popular sources of knowledge. His study explores Wikipedia’s citation of the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP). Afterwards, a project managed by the French Institute Pondicherry is reported. Its goal is the preparation of a historical atlas of south India, from pre-historic times to 1600 <sc>CE</sc>, in digital format, through a combination of maps, photographs, illustrations, texts and geographical information system (GIS) functionalities. Additionally, two other chapters attend to the positive role of open source software and wireless networks in reinforcing digital inclusion and diminishing the digital divide in the US and Africa, and the development of academic information literacy skills on the basis of the common language of contemporary learners – digital natives.</p>
<p>In Part VIII, ‘New infrastructures of science’, hosted by Karim Gherab-Martín, it is argued that following in the footsteps of Web 2.0, science is embarking on a course that will transform it into Science 2.0 (p. 181). Inspired by the term ‘prosumer’ (coined by Alvin Toffler), ‘open access’ in scientific publishing and ‘open reuse’ in science are emphasized. The discussion is supported by three case studies indicating the interoperability between science and technology which has been leading to the emergence of new infrastructures of science. The main issues covered are the democratization of the science of risk management in drinking water systems in Canada, using a bottom-up, democratic and enduser-driven approach; the recent debate regarding transgenic corn in Mexico, which resulted in public debate on science and technology, especially in the fields of bioengineering and biotechnology; and the ways in which the new web-based ways of publication might be efficient as well as reliable in at times displacing traditional models of scientific knowledge validation in digital knowledge communities, and most specifically in the mathematical community.</p>
<p>Part IX, ‘Digital aesthetics’, framed by Sean Cubitt’s chapter posing the concept ‘fabrication’, looks at the relationship between the aesthetic experience of digital technologies and the material world. It also reports a couple of case studies regarding digital art and digital aesthetics and their application in real life. Throughout, this section tacitly urges the need to develop digital aesthetics as an interface between imagination and reality. As its name bears out, the next section on ‘Digital labor’, anchored by Eran Fisher, pays attention to the networked digital labour known also as network production. Highlighting the formation of a new, post-capitalist society in which a bottom-up form of power in the hands of digital or net workers working for information wealth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267323112441288">Mohammadi and Isfandyari-Moghaddam, 2008</xref>) is a tangible presence, it offers three case studies which focus on the emergence of a digital service economy within the UK telecommunications industry; the approaches the US government has chosen in order to achieve balance between its digital labour force and the national interest; and the ICT graduate job market in Malaysia.</p>
<p>Part XI, ‘Technology, culture, and society’, initiated by David Hakken and Maurizio Teli, gives an empirical grounding to the argument for broadening the ways in which computing is considered, and emphasizes the necessity of applying a technosocial standpoint to computing. Factually, the authors focus on the balance between a purely technological base for computing studies, and what they call a ‘socially conscious computing’ or ‘technosocial’ approach. Then, three case studies discuss the impact of digital technologies on the politics of culture; the formation of digital heritage rooted in the entrance of museums into the digital world; and the application of ICT (e.g. virtual modelling and simulation) in teaching and learning international relations. Part XII, ‘Digital identities’, anchored by Marcus Breen, discusses the formation of identity in digital spaces including the Internet. In addition to indicating some interesting theoretical issues, the three case studies of this section consider the formation of identity on the Internet. They outline the uses of the Internet as a venue in which bisexual subjects share their experiences; the development of the UsMob (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.usmob.com.au/homw.php">www.usmob.com.au/homw.php</ext-link>) as a mediator between indigenous and non-indigenous people in Australia; and some considerations on the gender gap in IT education and employment. Jan Nederveen Pieterse leads Part XIII, ‘Information globalism’. His chapter takes a critical look at the logic of ICT for development (ICT4D) and its relationship to the spread of digital capitalism fired by market expansion and market deepening, and studies the relationship between digital capitalism and cyber utopianism. Based on the section’s key theme, the three case studies here present the application of ICT for closing the development gap in Malawi; dot.com marriages and virtual matrimonials in India; and the state of the digital divide in Bangladesh and Kuwait. In the final part, ‘Reading machines’, Jean-Claude Guédon opens his anchor discussion by reviewing the social and technological ecologies around e-readers (devices). He accepts the shift of relationship between humans and documents. Hence, the iPad as a possible template for e-readers is analysed and the shape of a possible template is put forward. Furthermore, the e-book market in the Spanish context is examined from a cultural perspective, along with the problems and shortcomings of current e-readers, and the capabilities of Inanimate Alice (www.inanimatealice.com) as a digital novel.</p>
<p>Both of these books start with an introduction which has an overview on the topic and a brief explanation of the contents. They both include general themes and more specialized studies. Bibliographically they are somewhat uneven, but they do both contain an index. The edited collection offers biographical profiles of its 50 or so contributors as well as a general concluding section. Different terminologies and concepts are used in both books for describing the various transformations influenced by the ICT revolution, such as post-industrial society, post-capitalist society, information society, knowledge society, the Third Wave, post-modern society and so on. The increasing spread of information, or more precisely, information-centrism, which has made information such an integral part of every person’s, organization’s and nation’s development is frequently highlighted in the content of both works.</p>
<p>Heidegger once noted (1997a) that ‘only God can save us from the juggernaut of progress’. This juggernaut has now been extensively refuelled by the ICT revolution. The issues, projects, experiences, lessons and case studies considered in the books indicate that human endeavours, whether individual or collective, national or international, may appear to bear out Napoleon’s saying that ‘the sword is beaten by the mind’ and Churchill’s declaration that ‘empires of the future are the empires of the mind’. The books deal with the various activities which are attempting to manage the juggernaut, to tame the ‘technological beast’, and to ensure that ICTs are steered along the right path on the basis of wisdom, intellectual reason and an open future. The first title criticizes the WSIS and its two phases by stating that ‘much more could have been achieved’. Yet, taking a retrospective and narrative approach, it attempts to promote, protect and preserve the knowledge accumulated in WSIS history for the sake of a better tomorrow. The second book, on the other hand, has taken a successful stride in theory and practice, and reminds us to think more critically about the properties of new technologies and to take a multidimensional view with regard to them. The study of technology, ICTs and generally the ‘digital revolution’, which has resulted in many debates and issues, is a field that requires those who practise it to have a broad understanding covering many areas. Overall, studies that offer helpful insights into best practices are of value for a variety of audiences including state authorities, policy-makers, decision-makers, IT managers, students, professors, researchers, IT personnel and so forth. Attending to both these books will present readers with many opportunities and new horizons for developing interesting research approaches and topics.</p>
