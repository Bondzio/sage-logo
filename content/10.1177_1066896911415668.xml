<abstract>
<p>A 48-year-old woman presented with chest symptoms. Multiple lesions seen on chest imaging were found to be pulmonary chondromas following surgical resection. Whole body magnetic resonance scan performed to investigate the possibility of Carney triad demonstrated a gastric lesion. This was resected and found to be a gastrointestinal stromal tumor. No evidence of paragangliomata was found on imaging. A diagnosis of incomplete Carney triad was made. Carney triad is a rare multiple neoplastic association of pulmonary chondroma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, and paraganglioma. At least 2 tumors are required for diagnosis. Most patients are young women. No genetic cause has been identified. Management involves surgical resection of tumors and follow-up for recurrence and investigation for other elements of the triad.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Carney triad (CT) is a rare multiple neoplasia syndrome first described in 1977 by J. A. Carney, an Irish pathologist. It was initially described as an association of pulmonary chondroma (PCH), gastric epithelioid leiomyosarcoma (later renamed gastrointestinal stromal tumor [GIST]) and paraganglioma (PGL).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896911415668">1</xref></sup> Two other tumors were subsequently added to the syndrome, esophageal leiomyoma (OL), and adrenocortical adenoma (AA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911415668">2</xref></sup> At least 2 of the tumors are required for diagnosis. The triad may be complete or incomplete. We present another case and discuss the etiology, diagnosis, and management.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 48-year-old woman presented with pleuritic chest pain and breathlessness for 2 months. Plain chest radiograph revealed 2 lung nodules. Computed tomography of the thorax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896911415668">Figure 1</xref>) demonstrated 4 pulmonary nodules with benign appearances of peripheral rim calcification. Two of the nodules were resected by pulmonary thoracotomy and the histology showed PCHs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1066896911415668">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>A diagnosis of Carney triad was considered and whole body magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1066896911415668">Figure 3</xref>) arranged to investigate this possibility. This demonstrated the previously seen PCHs and also revealed a 3.5-cm soft tissue mass in the gastric fundus. In the context of Carney triad, this was clinically felt to represent a GIST.</p>

</fig>
<p>The patient had reported intermittent upper abdominal pain, back pain, and abdominal bloating but no hematemesis, melaena, or weight loss.</p>
<p>There was no evidence on MR of extra-adrenal paragangliomata in the head and neck, thorax, or abdomen, and no esophageal or adrenal lesions were detected.</p>
<p>Staging computed tomography of thorax, abdomen, and pelvis and a bone scan were performed, which showed no evidence of metastatic spread. The gastric lesion was completely excised by partial gastrectomy. The tumor was oval shaped, measured 36 × 48 mm and was centered within the muscularis propria. It had a lobulated pinkish-tan cut surface with areas of hemorrhage. Histology confirmed an epithelioid GIST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1066896911415668">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1066896911415668">4B</xref>). It focally ulcerated the overlying gastric mucosa. The tumor cells were diffusely positive for CD117 (dilution, 1:500; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), DOG1.1 (dilution, 1:5; Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO), CD34 (dilution, 1:50; Dako), and h-caldesmon (dilution, 1:200; Dako). It had 6 mitoses/50 high-power fields and was therefore put in the intermediate risk of progressive criteria (using the Fletcher et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911415668">3</xref></sup> modification of the National Institutes of Health consensus criteria). It was staged as pT1N0M0. Molecular studies did not show any coding sequence abnormalities of the c-KIT and PDGFRA genes. A diagnosis of incomplete Carney triad was made. Absence of metastatic spread meant no adjuvant therapy was necessary.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Carney triad is a rare multiple neoplasia syndrome of unknown cause. A GIST and at least one of PCH, PGL, OL, or AA are required for diagnosis. Of 104 patients examined by Carney most were young women but no positive family history was identified in this group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911415668">4</xref></sup> Only one fifth of patients had a complete triad of tumors. GIST and PCH was the most common combination for those possessing 2 of the tumors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896911415668">5</xref></sup> The cause of the triad has not yet been identified but a genetic basis is suspected. A recent analysis of genetic material from known patients with CT demonstrated loss of chromosome 1q and 1p in GISTs and PGLs but no specific genetic cause for the tumors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896911415668">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>PCHs are benign tumors of bronchial cartilage. They are generally detected by chest imaging, either incidentally or as part of the screening for other components of CT. CT PCHs are usually asymptomatic but may present with symptoms related to mass effect on surrounding lung tissues. Differential diagnosis from imaging includes other primary lung lesions such as pulmonary hamartoma, granuloma or lung carcinoid, or metastases from distant tumors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066896911415668">7</xref></sup> Surgical resection may be curative although new lesions can develop.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066896911415668">8</xref></sup> These tumors do not metastasize and are not responsible for the mortality associated with CT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066896911415668">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>GISTs develop in the stomach in CT. They tend to present with symptoms related to mass effect and tumor hemorrhage. They usually present in younger, mainly female patients, are multiple and are more commonly located in the gastric antrum. This is in contrast with sporadic GISTs, which are usually single, occur more commonly in the body, have approximately equal sex distribution, and occur in older patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911415668">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Histologically, GISTs in CT are more commonly of epithelioid cell type, as in our case. The clinical and histological differential diagnosis includes leiomyosarcoma, nerve sheath tumors, and melanoma. GISTs in CT may display overproduction of the cKIT receptor tyrosine kinase with positive immunohistochemistry staining for CD117. Mutations in the KIT, PDGFRA, and SDH genes are negative however, excluding this as a cause for GISTs in CT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896911415668">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>GISTs are separated into no, very low, low, intermediate, or high risk of progressive behavior categories using modified National Institutes of Health consensus criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911415668">3</xref></sup> Local recurrence post–surgical resection may be treated by re-excision. Metastases to lymph nodes, peritoneum, liver, lung, and bone can occur, especially with tumors larger than 10 cm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896911415668">10</xref></sup> Death may result from metastatic GIST in CT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896911415668">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) targets KIT and PDGFRA and has shown promise in controlling local recurrence and metastases from GISTs in general. The same response has not been observed in the KIT- and PDGFRA-negative GISTs of CT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896911415668">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>PGLs develop from paraganglia associated with the autonomic nervous system in the head and neck, chest, and abdomen. They may produce symptoms from pressure effects or catecholamine release, or be detected on imaging as part of screening for CT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896911415668">5</xref></sup> Screening should include computed tomographic scan of thorax, abdomen, and pelvis, and MR scan of head and neck. Positron emission tomography and other isotopic scans have also been used in the screening and diagnosis of PGLs, as well as GISTs, in CT. These tumors have been shown to express CD117 and produce c-KIT protein, suggesting a developmental link with GISTs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066896911415668">11</xref></sup> PGLs are very vascular tumors that can not only be resected but also treated with radiotherapy and transarterial embolisation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066896911415668">12</xref></sup> Around 10% of PGLs have been shown to metastasize. Unresectable and metastatic PGLs are a cause of mortality in CT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896911415668">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 2009, Carney<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896911415668">5</xref></sup> followed up his original cohort of patients. Around 20% had died, half of these from metastatic GIST and in some cases metastatic PGL, the remainder because of other causes.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Carney triad is a rare association of GIST, PCH, PGL, and in some cases OL and AA. No cause has been identified although a genetic component is suspected. Screening for the other components of the triad is recommended on diagnosis of one of the tumors. Histological material should be analyzed for genetic mutations. Management involves surgical resection of the tumors and follow-up for recurrence and metastasis.</p>
