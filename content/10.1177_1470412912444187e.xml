<body>
<p>Published in the early 1970s, <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> had already acquired the quaint sheen of a dated text when I read it as an undergraduate in the mid-1980s. As a Yale University student with a working-class background I delighted in encountering Berger et al.’s analysis of the way visual perception is tied to, and indeed reinforces, social hierarchy. Having recently emerged from Vincent Scully’s introductory course in art history, where I had genuinely enjoyed engaging with Wölfflin et al., I was ready to agree that obfuscation in the language that attached itself to fine art might be tied to institutional privilege, to the creation and maintenance of a gated ‘cultural elite’, and to the power relations underlying class difference. I decided to take a degree in philosophy – not exactly an escape from obfuscation in language but, it seemed to me, a better way to understand knowledge in relation to power. I suppose it was my enduring interest in representation that ultimately brought me back to writing and teaching about art and visual culture, and to assigning <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> in some of my early introductory classes.</p>
<p>With its references to mass distribution and advertising, <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> was an empowering example of cultural analysis that allowed for a cross-disciplinary excursion, deftly trampling over the tidy barriers that had been erected around medium specificity and historical genre in the discipline of art history and the tradition of art criticism. Its somewhat masculine, heterosexual attention to then-emerging feminist concerns about representations of women’s bodies was a truly important contribution to critiques of popular culture, and to classroom pedagogy. Its irreverence was part of its appeal, and that appeal continues today.</p>
<p>At the same time, there seemed to be an effort to avoid making the text <italic>too</italic> radical. Striking to us today, at both the visual and textual level, is the almost total omission of any critical analysis of race discourse in <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic>. I say ‘almost’ because there are some minor and important moments in the text where reference is made to ‘non-European traditions’ and to works depicting colonial power and slavery. The first instance is a moment in Section 3 when a comparison is made between the supine nude in European painting and women ‘in Indian art, Persian Art, African Art and Pre-Columbian art’ where ‘nakedness is never supine in this way. And if, in these traditions, the theme of a work is sexual attraction, it is likely to show active sexual love as between two people, the woman as active as the man, the actions of each absorbing each other’ (p. 53). In working through the gender and sexual biases inherent in European images, the ‘cultural other’ is held up as an alternative, perhaps even an ideal, to emulate.</p>
<p>In the discussion of Holbein’s <italic>The Ambassadors</italic>, Berger writes, ‘To colonize a land it was necessary to convert its people to Christianity and accounting, and thus to prove to them that European civilization was the most advanced in the world. Its art included’ (p. 95). Opposite, under an image of de Witte’s painting <italic>Admiral de Ruyter in the Castle of Elmina</italic>, he writes ‘The African kneels to hold up an oil painting to his master. The painting depicts the castle above one of the principal centres of the West African slave trade’ (p. 95). On the following page, next to an anonymous painting titled <italic>India Offering Her Pearls to Brittania</italic>, we read a short summation of mutual distrust between colonizer and colonized:
<disp-quote>
<p>These relations between conqueror and colonized tended to be self-perpetuating. The sight of the other confirmed each in his inhuman estimate of himself. The circularity of this relationship can be seen in the following diagram – as also the mutual solitude. The way in which each sees the other confirms his own view of himself. (p. 96)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Below this text, a simplified sketch shows two profiles with lines of sight extending from the eyes to the figure opposite. Hastily and almost illegibly hand-written down one side is the phrase ‘less than human’ and on the other ‘omnipotent’. Of course, colonized subjects probably didn’t think of themselves as either less than human or omnipotent. Again, the image is really drawn from the perspective of the colonizer’s fantasy conception of the colonized imaginary (and his own). It is also clearly erroneous to presume that the exchange of gazes is ‘mutual’ and ‘circular’. As scholars before (Franz Fanon, <italic>Black Skins, White Masks</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470412912444187">1952</xref>) and immediately after (Edward Said, <italic>Orientalism</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470412912444187">1978</xref>) have argued, there is nothing ‘mutual’ or equivalent in the gazes between colonizer and colonized, not only because of the conditions of unequal power, but also because practices of looking are always culturally specific.</p>
<p>That relations of unequal power are recognized in <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic>, and yet under-theorized in terms of cross-cultural or cross-racial ‘looking’, is historically revealing. It isn’t as if John Berger lets us forget that racial and ethnic bias drive the structure and content of images in oil painting and mass culture, it is more that he carefully avoids mentioning it directly. The same holds true during the TV series where, for example, a street poster depicting Angela Davis, or an advertising image of two nearly-nude black women holding a veil over a nearly-nude white woman are shown in passing, but not discussed. Commentary regarding cultural difference is reserved for a close reading of newspapers and magazines that pair, for example, an advertisement of British wealth on the same page as the image of poverty in Pakistan, but it remains a class analysis for Berger (p. 152). The visually racist residues of colonialism, and by extension advertising, apparently go without saying and, perhaps at that historical juncture, had to go without saying.</p>
<p>Race politics in England hit a fever pitch right at the time <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> was published and broadcast. The government had greatly restricted immigration by the 1970s, carefully crafting laws that would make it easier for white Commonwealth citizens to obtain permanent residency passports than black Commonwealth citizens. Despite the new restrictions, 83,000 immigrants settled in the UK between 1968 and 1975, largely through gaining work permits or obtaining permission to join relatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470412912444187">BBC, 2002</xref>). In 1972, 28,000 African Asians were also admitted to the UK in a period of only two months when expelled from Uganda during the dictatorship of Idi Amin. The fall-out of colonialism and the rapidly transforming demographics in England could not have gone unnoticed by Berger. The British journal <italic>Race Today</italic>, launched in 1969 by the Institute of Race Relations, was a leading voice of black political journalism, and given its Marxist bent must have been well known to leftist scholars of the time. By the early 1970s, popular culture in the US included mainstream television shows like <italic>Chico and the Man, Sanford and Son</italic>, and <italic>The Courtship of Eddie’s Father</italic> that depicted Latino, Asian American and African American characters, not to mention major epics about the history of slavery such as Alex Haley’s <italic>Roots</italic>. There were fewer racially diverse programs in England: an early exception, <italic>The Dark Man</italic> (1960), followed the life of a West Indian cab driver; still, terms like ‘wog’ and ‘coon’ were in use in television shows like <italic>Till Death Do Us Part</italic> popular in the early 1970s.</p>
<p>So, why the relatively limited discussion of race? I do not excuse Berger’s oversight, but merely invite us to consider that it might have been calculated, given the context in which the book emerged. Understating matters of racial difference was perhaps the most effective and least alienating gesture that could have been made at the time to a majority white audience. I can only guess that this was the reason that relations of race and ethnicity are so effectively repressed in the published text. William Blake’s <italic>Europe Supported by Africa and America</italic> (1796), which pictures a nude Europe embracing her darker skinned sisters, or Rembrandt’s <italic>Two Negros</italic> (1661) juxtaposed with portraits of slave owners <italic>Princess Rakoscki</italic> and <italic>Charles, Third Duke of Richmond</italic> invite a comparative discussion, but the images remain largely unidentified on the page and entirely untheorized. It is disheartening to have this tantalizing handful of disturbing and compelling images operating as so many free-floating signs to be enjoyed or ignored as the reader pleases, without the sustained analysis of the bodies on display offered elsewhere. <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> continues to have real relevance, but in my opinion can be used responsibly in the classroom today only if put into dialog with a more sophisticated critical discourse on race and visual culture. Indeed, the book may be more useful to us now as a sign of its own times and the social politics, overt and covert, at play in the text.</p>
