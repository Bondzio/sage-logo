<p>Since its inception 13 years back, <italic>Global Business Review</italic> (GBR) has been a trusted and an essential reading resource for researchers and serious academicians committed to the pursuit of a high level of scholarship in management education cutting across geographic zones and time spans. GBR started as a bi-annual journal in January, 2000 with a dedicated focus that emphasized on the production of high-quality original research papers in the field of management education. In 2010, complying with popular demand in 2010, GBR became a tri-annual journal. An excellent research tool, this journal is now considered as a must-have for researchers, academicians, consultants and corporate houses. The journal has also published over 30 original research papers per annum in its tri-annual issues published in February, June and October. Despite this, there is a growing demand by academicians and business practitioners to increase GBR’s reach to use it as a channel for disseminating their research output. This demand is accentuated by the fact that the journal receives a significant amount of research papers for consideration from across the world. As part of the procedure, all submitted research papers are subjected to a peer review process by a panel which comprises a pool of international referees. Given this process, the present backlog for a paper to be accepted and published in the GBR is about one year.</p>
<p>After a review of the above scenario, we from GBR are pleased to announce that the journal will henceforth be published on a quarterly basis beginning 2013. The four issues will be ready for distribution at the end of March, June, September and December of each year. This extremely tight production schedule of the issues demands a highly coordinated and well orchestrated chain of events; every link of which needs to be robust.</p>
<p>As in the past, we are indebted and place on record our appreciation and gratitude to a group of highly talented individuals such as referees, academicians and practitioners as well as the technical and support staff from both IMI and SAGE Publications for their help in bringing the journal in its current form as well as the newly proposed quarterly form beginning 2013.</p>
