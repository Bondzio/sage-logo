<p>Group diabetes education classes are as varied and wide-ranging as the people in them. Some sessions are more clinical, focusing on the delivery of diabetes-related knowledge, while others are structured like support groups and tackle the psychological and emotional side of the disease. Diabetes educators work in many different settings and have widely differing patient populations, so it is only natural that there is no one-size-fits-all formula for structuring and implementing a group diabetes education session.</p>
<p>However, there is one tool that can be used in every group session, no matter the setting, and that tool is good conversation. Good conversation is not always easy to facilitate. Group dynamics, participant interest in the subject matter, and the educator’s own communication style can all influence a group session positively or negatively. Fortunately, there are skills that educators can develop that will help them create an environment that is conducive to creating good conversations in any practice setting. Here, three diabetes educators share their experiences and tips for facilitating effective interactions in group patient education classes.</p>

<p><bold>Shelley Mesznik, MA, RD, CDE, CDN</bold>, is a Registered Dietitian in private practice and a Certified Diabetes Educator who also teaches counseling skills at Teachers College, Columbia University in the Nutrition Program.</p>
<p>Mesznik believes that “Conversation can generate real behavioral change when the diabetes educator engages patients in the behavior change process and uses group dynamics to encourage participants to help teach each other.”</p>
<p>Counseling skills are critical for diabetes educators to develop in order to effectively facilitate group diabetes education and generate quality conversations. “Education is more than just being good at explaining things. It’s about engaging patients in the behavior change process and encouraging participants to help each other,” Mesznik said.</p>
<p>Mesznik notes, “When you’re part of a group, one person’s comments trigger your own thoughts and comments. And when you offer help to another member, you are practicing how to better understand the whole picture and come up with an idea. When my graduate students, as part of their coursework, experience group dynamics, they can see the advantages of productive group interactions and understand what they are trying to accomplish in their own practices.”</p>
<p>Mesznik recommends starting off every group session with a rapport-building activity. Be sure everyone knows each other’s name and feels connected as a group. She also recommends having a general topic or theme for the session that helps participants identify their individual concerns and lends some structure to the discussion.</p>
<p>“I find that having a common focus for the discussion is helpful and still leaves a lot of room for the participants to guide the discussion. For instance, if the topic is food and participants are asked what they struggle with that relates to that topic, one person may say holiday eating; if the topic is how to manage your diabetes during a difficult time, like a natural disaster, one might say remembering to take my medications. There will be a wide variety of answers, each of which makes for an engaging discussion,” said Mesznik.</p>
<p>Techniques such as Motivational Interviewing or evoking change talk, open-ended questions, reflective listening, and summarizing are extremely useful in educational group settings. If an educator is leading the discussion and is doing most of the talking, participants are not necessarily going to understand their own behavior.</p>
<p>Mesznik says, “The educator’s role is to help participants focus on ideas and solutions to a member’s problem. When you hear advice or ideas from a person just like you, it can be more meaningful than straight from the educator. And group participants feel good when they can give an idea and help someone else find a solution to their problem. You want people to engage with each other in the group, not just with you.”</p>

<p><bold>Joe Solowiejczyk, RN, MSW, CDE</bold>, is Manager, Diabetes Counseling &amp; Training, at the Johnson &amp; Johnson Diabetes Institute. He works with educators on a national and international level to help them learn to incorporate behavior change techniques into their interactions with patients and their families. Like Mesznik, he believes that creating the right group dynamics is essential for successful group diabetes education sessions.</p>
<p>Solowiejczyk says, “When organizing group classes, it is critical to pay attention to the composition of the group. In my experience, the most effective groups are those that have participants in all different stages of behavior change and disease management . . . and those that include family members and loved ones. The group conversation is more dynamic then, and participants who have been through challenges and learned how to manage them can serve as mentors to others in the group.”</p>
<p>He notes, however, that one of the diabetes educator’s key priorities should be creating a safe, respectful, and open environment for the group. He begins his classes by setting the ground rules and asks participants to introduce themselves, share how many years they’ve had diabetes, and what they are struggling with in their diabetes management. He also shares his own diabetes story.</p>
<p>“I tell my groups that I’ve had type 1 diabetes for 52 years, and I briefly share my story. By doing this, I am modeling for them how to be open and vulnerable in a group session, and I can encourage them to do the same,” he says. “Even if you are leading a specific educational session, and not a support group, psychosocial principles must factor into the educator’s planning. So much of diabetes management relies on behavior change, and no amount of lectures will get people to change behaviors. Group dynamics can help participants and their families experience an epiphany and learn to cope with the emotional issues related to diabetes.”</p>

<p>Solowiejczyk maintains that “Group diabetes education sessions are really about helping people determine where they are and where they want to get to. It’s the role of the educator to provide an environment where patients and their families can have change experiences . . . and then guide them to resources to help them get to where they have determined they need to go.”</p>
<p>He recommends that in addition to diabetes-specific resources, educators should turn to the National Association of Clinical Social Work and the American Psychological Association for resources and studies related to facilitating groups and individual behavior change.</p>

<p>Solowiejczyk adds, “You can’t just pull a group together and have it lead itself. Facilitating successful group interaction is a skill and it’s helpful to have formal training. In addition to informal resources, educators can also check into their local colleges and universities for psychology courses that would be helpful to them in practice. In the future, I hope more webinars and training programs will exist to help educators develop these vital skills.”</p>

<p><bold>Barb Schreiner, PhD, RN, CPLP, CDE, BC-ADM,</bold> has over 35 years of clinical experience and is now in the academic world. When she was in clinical practice, she worked with children and adolescents and their families in both group and individual settings. She was also very involved in diabetes camps, often leading group classes, some with up to 250 people. She notes, “The value of groups is that we learn best in a community. In a group with similar needs, you can truly come together and help solve problems on a greater scale than just one individual educator can.”</p>
<p>She adds, “No matter what type of group session you are leading or what type of setting you are in, groups always have an emotional level . . . and the goal is to get people talking and relating to each other, while you—the educator—actively listen. The person doing the talking is the person doing the learning.”</p>
<p>However, Schreiner believes that you must assess the learner’s needs, preferences, and learning style before adding them to a group session. “Not everyone is cut out for a group session. Every individual is different. Some are more private and do not want to disclose in a group, while others need that social interaction and thrive in a group dynamic.”</p>
<p>This difference in style and needs also extends to the educator. She says, “To be an effective leader in a group setting, you must have a naturally inquisitive and curious personality. You must be a responsive listener, and you must be okay with other people doing the talking. You have to listen with an open mind and a full heart, and hear what they are saying, without jumping in to solve the problem or offer advice. Many times the patients know the solution, and as educators, we just have to be quiet and wait for them to come to it on their own—or with help from the group.”</p>
<p>The good news is that a lot of these skills can be learned, even if they do not come naturally. One resource that Schreiner recommends is the Foundation for Critical Thinking, which can help educators come up with probing questions that will lead to deeper conversations in a group setting. She also encourages educators to explore online resources and curricula about group processes, find a mentor to offer guidance and advice for effectively listening during patient interactions, and even take the time to observe other educators’ groups.</p>
