<p>This edited collection is indeed timely. The debate over the United State’s controversial ‘leave no child behind’ policy, the recent UK protests regarding changes to higher education and the educated youths leading the so-called ‘Arab Spring’ all speak to the need for critically re-examining education philosophically and empirically. To do so through the theories of Habermas is thus precipitous and potentially enlightening. In this respect, <italic>Habermas, Critical Theory, and Education</italic> admirably succeeds in bringing the multifaceted but connected ideas of Habermas to bear on a wide range of contemporary educational thought and practices. It is equally focused and expansive, concentrating on issues of education as part of a broader social, political, and economic context. Nevertheless, it at times fails to comprehensively engage with the theoretical and political difficulties of this approach, therefore weakening its overall effect.</p>
<p>The book is separated into three main sections. The first is an extended introduction by Mark Murphy and Ted Fleming which nicely summarizes Habermasian thought and its often underexplored relevance to current educational debates. The second entitled ‘Key Issues and Debates in Habermas and Education’ interrogates this relationship from various philosophical, conceptual, and epistemic perspectives. Thomas Englund begins the section by cogently, though perhaps slightly unrealistically, arguing that a Habermasian inspired form of deliberative democracy could be realized by the construction and institutionalization of education as a space for ‘deliberative communication’ within an egalitarian and inclusive society. This is followed by Marianna Papastephanou’s article in which she contends that Habermas provides a basis for limited utopian thinking, one manifested in the educational realm where it is linked not simply to the achievement of a ‘right order’ but the instantiation of a correct and ideal treatment of the other.</p>
<p>The proceeding contribution by Sigmund Ongstad adopts a slightly more critical tone, championing the communicative elements of Habermasian theory as essential for comprehending how social knowledge should be introduced into various educational disciplines, while challenging the thinker for not emphasizing fully enough how every ‘utterance’ necessarily refers back to a set of macro-social understandings. Raymond A Morrow addresses a different and more culturally oriented type of concern, defending Habermas against charges of ‘Euro-centrism’ in noting that all knowledge (indigenous, western, or otherwise) is formed through the matrix of cross-cultural deliberation. Finally, Mark Murphy’s article concludes the section by maintaining that critical theory, especially associated with Habermas’ ideas of shared deliberations between intellectual traditions, should be applied not only in the service of ideological critique but also as a foundation for questioning public services (notably education, health, and social work) in order to improve and transform the public sector.</p>
<p>The third section of the book departs from these abstract considerations in favour of a sustained shared investigation of how Habermasian ideas can be applied to currently existing educational issues. John Bamber begins the section by drawing on Habermas’ ideas of competence, understood as emerging from a deliberative process of social construction between community members, to reorient the undertaking of professional development of community educators in Scotland. Moving onto themes of higher education, Ted Fleming proposes that universities should reflect a deeper vision of democracy as a ‘learning society’, existing as a space for questioning and re-thinking national and global practices. The next article by Stephen Brookfield focuses on adult education, maintaining that the emphasis Habermas places on critical reflection and dialogical learning can contribute to individuals’ continuing ability to question ideological aims generally and better solve the three ‘crisis’ of contemporary western society introduced by Habermas—namely the collapse of the public sphere, the decline of civil society, and the ‘invasion’ of our unconscious ‘lifeworld’.</p>
<p>In a somewhat similar vein, Clarence W Joldersma and Ruth Deakin Crick look at the importance of ‘communicative competence’ for citizen education. Carola Conle applies Habermasian ideas to these of narrative—exploring how a ‘narrative discourse’ can contribute to educational practices and interactions. Turning to the sphere of social work, Barry Cooper draws upon Habermas to critique the ‘strategic instrumentalism’ dominating social work education, one which concentrates on targets and outcomes based on market inspired evaluative criteria of ‘efficiency’ and ‘effectiveness’. Finally Jan Sumner examines the potential synergies of Habermasian thought for the nursing sector through stressing the significance of communication in order to better provide for a mutually enacted and egalitarian process of ‘care’ between health professionals and patients.</p>
<p>The strengths of this collection are abundant. It nicely makes Habermas accessible to a wider audience while having much to say to those already familiar with his theories. Further, its focus on education is well served, showing from a diverse range of perspectives the potential relevance of Habermas for contemporary educational thought and policies. Lastly, it excellently connects this educational focus to broader social themes and problems, revealing its relevance for a large and expansive set of social concerns outside the immediate realm of the classroom. In this respect, education is equally understood as a specific social institution and part of the public sphere as well as a deeper process permeating and shaping all social relations. The editors should be therefore commended for highlighting the importance of Habermas for critically reimagining and invigorating existing public spaces both nationally and globally. Overall this is a welcome and needed contribution to current debates particular to education and society generally.</p>
<p>Yet despite these positive qualities, the book is by no means flawless. Critically, while touched on tangentially, there is not a deep enough engagement with questions of power. Specifically problematic is that, whereas it may be normatively easy to agree with a Habermasian agenda as presented in its various permutations here, there is less attention given to the ideological, political, and practical difficulties of implementing such a project. One is left to wonder at points how to concretely manifest these insights, given present power relations resistant to such radical changes. This speaks hence to more fundamental questions of the degree to which these ideas ultimately are utopian or at the very least overly idealistic, ignoring not only current realities but the very ways in which societies are constructed, evolved, and transformed. There seems to be a too easy dismissal of theorists such as Foucault who provide a more sensitive engagement with the formation and actual empirical reproduction of power relations. Consequently, at least in this writer’s view, there appears to be a certain critical lack in the analyses detracting from the value of its ideas and proposed social solutions.</p>
<p>Further, and related to this criticism, there is little to no real sustained engagement with other theorists within the critical tradition who could perhaps constructively challenge and in doing so expand upon Habermasian thinking. The tone appears rather to be one of defending Habermas against his detractors. Whilst such a defensive is often called for they prevent the emergence of a productive dialogue between these various theorists and Habermas for interrogating and addressing the contemporary world. There is accordingly a certain irony prevalent throughout the collection, where priority is granted to the need for deliberation on the one hand and an almost implicit rejection of such communicative action in regards to the possibility for real theoretical dialogue between Habermas and existing critical thinkers. For instance how might Laclau and Mouffe’s ideas of ‘discursive hegemony’ and radical democracy deepen Habermasian views of consensus and deliberative democracy respectively?</p>
<p>At the more practical level, there remains questions as to the ways these ideas could be concretely realized even if one where to accept their political feasibility. Socially, the question of how individuals and institutions can decide collectively which issues should be made available for critical deliberation, especially given the multiplicity of viewpoints and beliefs potentially existing within any given community, is largely left unaddressed. Put differently, the book would have benefited from some discussion of the actual processes involved in agenda setting. Instead, the pieces seem to share an unrealistic and unreflective embrace of the need to extol the values of open discussion and the political potential communicative action. This is of course not true uniformly. Pappastephanou and Fleming’s pieces especially come to mind in this respect, yet in terms of its overall effect it appears that egalitarian, pluralistic, and deliberative principles are romantically championed without interrogating in a similarly comprehensive way the hard and complex difficulties of making these ideals a practical reality.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this is an immensely valuable collection. It should be highly recommended to all those interested in Habermas, education, and society. Whilst not perfect it has much to offer academics policy makers and a popular audience alike.</p>
