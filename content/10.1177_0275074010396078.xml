<abstract>
<p>In this article we investigate the influence of emotional labor on job satisfaction and burnout across a range of public service occupations. While prior studies in this genre have primarily focused on human services, occupations in this analysis range from routine clerical interactions to emotionally intense first-responder jobs. Despite this range, structural equation modeling shows that (a) emotion work increases job satisfaction as well as burnout; (b) emotive skills lead to an upsurge in job satisfaction and are inversely associated with burnout; and (c) the deleterious effect of emotional labor mainly occurs not with its performance, per se, but when workers must fake their feelings. It is this circumstance that produces an elevated risk of burnout.</p>

<p>Street level public service delivery is labor intense, requiring face-to-face or voice-to-voice exchanges between workers and citizens. In these communications, emotional labor enables the transaction: workers make split-second decisions based on the emotive state of the citizen and adjust their own display of emotion to elicit the desired response from the citizen. This interactive responsiveness relies on multiple facets of emotive behavior, one of which requires authentic expression of the worker’s emotional state, while another requires workers to behave in ways that they may not actually feel, such as when they must seem nicer-than-nice or, conversely, tougher-than-tough. Successful performance of this work is important, for it affects the citizen’s satisfaction with services, just as satisfaction with a retail transaction is measured by a sale.</p>
<p>Much of the research on emotional labor<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0275074010396078">1</xref></sup> has focused<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0275074010396078">2</xref></sup> on the private sector but recent work in public administration is emerging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0275074010396078">Guy &amp; Newman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0275074010396078">Guy, Newman, &amp; Mastracci, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0275074010396078">Hsieh &amp; Guy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0275074010396078">Jin &amp; Guy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0275074010396078">Meier, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0275074010396078">Meier, Mastracci, &amp; Wilson, 2006</xref>). Most individuals who work as first responders, street-level bureaucrats, frontline service employees, and human service volunteers, encounter emotions—their own as well as citizens’—in the performance of their jobs. It is the grease that turns the wheels. But research that investigates this is limited by small samples that focus on one occupation in a particular agency or larger samples that fail to account for respondents’ work experience. In this article, we overcome these constraints by analyzing findings from a variety of public service settings. Before describing the analysis, we review the dynamics involved in the performance of emotional labor.</p>
<sec id="section1-0275074010396078">
<title>The Nature of Emotional Labor in Public Service Work</title>
<p>Emotion work is similar to knowledge work in that employees own their own means of production. They govern the display of their own emotions and affect the emotions of the other. For instance, workers face many circumstances where they must perform emotional labor in order <italic>not</italic> to show an emotion. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0275074010396078">Hochschild (1983)</xref> identified two strategies for doing this: <italic>surface acting</italic>, which corresponds to managing observable expressions so as to meet the agency’s display rules, and <italic>deep acting</italic>, which corresponds to managing one’s own feelings to actually experience the required emotion. Acting at either of these levels requires workers to be able to alter their own feelings to overcome the conflict between work-appropriate emotions and genuine emotions.</p>
<p>It has long been assumed that burnout results from human service jobs that involve emotional intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0275074010396078">Maslach, 2003</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0275074010396078">Guy et al.’s (2008)</xref> work indicates that such acting does not necessarily cause burnout among direct service providers and neither does it necessarily have a negative influence on job satisfaction. Additional evidence indicates that workers’ ability to perform emotion work positively influences job satisfaction even when performing clerical-type functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0275074010396078">Jin &amp; Guy, 2009</xref>). Moreover, such work is empowering, gives workers the sense that their personal performance matters, and makes a difference in citizens’ lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0275074010396078">Leidner, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0275074010396078">Stenross &amp; Kleinman,1989</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0275074010396078">Tolich, 1993</xref>). Clearly, the link between the emotive aspect of one’s job and the level of job satisfaction that workers experience is not well understood. What is the relationship between emotional labor, job satisfaction, and burnout, regardless of specific job demands? It is to this that we focus our analysis.</p>
<p>Job satisfaction is the positive emotional state resulting from the appraisal of one’s work. It is linked to the characteristics, demands, and outcomes of one’s performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0275074010396078">Arches, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0275074010396078">Butler, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0275074010396078">Kirshef, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0275074010396078">Locke, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0275074010396078">Smith, Kendall, &amp; Hulin, 1969</xref>). The satisfaction that staff derive from their work is central to an organization’s effective use of human capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0275074010396078">Koeske, Kirk, Koeske, &amp; Rauktis, 1994</xref>). But because emotion work has been assumed to be stressful and to increase psychological distress and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0275074010396078">Pugliesi &amp; Shook, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0275074010396078">Wharton, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0275074010396078">1996</xref>), research has focused on how it threatens job satisfaction (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0275074010396078">Ashforth &amp; Humphrey, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0275074010396078">Conrad &amp; Witte, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0275074010396078">Morris &amp; Feldman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0275074010396078">Rafaeli &amp; Sutton, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0275074010396078">Waldron, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0275074010396078">Wouters, 1989</xref>). Early studies of emotional labor emphasized its harmful effects, but more recent studies suggest that its consequences are not uniformly negative. In fact, there are indications that it increases job satisfaction, personal fulfillment, and self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0275074010396078">Pugliesi, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0275074010396078">Strickland, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0275074010396078">Tolich, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0275074010396078">Wharton, 1993</xref>); feelings of psychological well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0275074010396078">Ashforth &amp; Humphrey, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0275074010396078">Conrad &amp; Witte, 1994</xref>); decreased stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0275074010396078">Conrad &amp; Witte, 1994</xref>); task effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0275074010396078">Ashforth &amp; Humphrey, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0275074010396078">Connellan &amp; Zemke, 1993</xref>); and a sense of community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0275074010396078">Shuler &amp; Sypher, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Generalizations are difficult in a body of research that produces such a variety of outcomes. Perhaps these contradictory findings occur because studies fail to comprehend the multiple facets of emotional labor. This quandary is hinted at by more sophisticated work that gives evidence of three facets of emotional labor (i.e., emotion work, personal efficacy, and false face acting). As advised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0275074010396078">Guy et al. (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0275074010396078">Jin and Guy (2009)</xref>, we speculate that perhaps these dimensions of emotional labor have distinct effects on job satisfaction.</p>
<p>Contrary to the salutary aspects of job satisfaction, burnout, also referred to as “vicarious traumatization” has received a lot of attention in the helping professions. It is characterized by the inability to disengage from work, coupled with feelings of overwhelming pressure, hopelessness and apathy, and the inability to maintain a professional perspective. It coincides with feelings of futility and the inability to manage one’s own emotions when interacting with clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0275074010396078">Zapf, Seifert, Schmutte, Mertini, &amp; Holz, 2001</xref>). Burnout is pivotal in worker performance because it is related to decreasing performance levels of formerly productive workers, absenteeism, turnover, increased use of sick leave, psychological withdrawal, aggression, alienation, depersonalization, and dysfunctional coping mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0275074010396078">Pines &amp; Aronson, 1988</xref>). This is germane to public service because most human services are delivered by governmental and nonprofit agencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0275074010396078">Hasenfeld, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>If we are to understand the link between emotional labor and burnout, we need to know which work contexts rely on the former and of those, which give rise to the latter. And if we are to understand the mediators that cause emotional labor to produce either job satisfaction or burnout, we must study a range of public service jobs, not just those that involve direct personal interaction with citizens. To accomplish this, we take advantage of three separate studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0275074010396078">Guy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0275074010396078">Hsieh &amp; Guy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0275074010396078">Jin &amp; Guy, 2009</xref>), each of which focused on different public service occupational groups. These studies had employed the same survey instrument and had used the same 7-point Likert-type scale for responses, thus facilitating the combination and meta-analysis. All respondents were state, local, or nonprofit workers engaged in direct service delivery when surveyed.</p>
<p>The three studies whose data were aggregated were as follows. First, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0275074010396078">Guy et al. (2008)</xref> data included responses from 308 public service workers. The sample included child protective workers whose professional identification included social workers, attorneys, and law enforcement officers; corrections officials whose occupations included prison warden, counselors, guards, and teachers; and 911 call-takers, some of whom had law enforcement training and some of whom had no formal occupational identification. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0275074010396078">Hsieh and Guy (2009)</xref> study was based on a sample of 86 caseworkers employed by a nonprofit, statewide organization that delivered social services to troubled youth. Unlike the other two studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0275074010396078">Jin and Guy (2009)</xref> collected responses from 59 workers in a state agency whose mission is to resolve consumer complaints. The work involves communicating to citizens primarily via correspondence rather than face-to-face to resolve complaints from citizens when businesses do not fulfill their warranties or obligations.</p>
<p>Using these separate studies as a starting point, we list hypotheses in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0275074010396078">Table 1</xref> that capture questions about the relationship between emotional labor, job satisfaction, and burnout. Associated with each hypothesis is notation of whether these studies had tested it. Combining data from these studies has the advantage of including a robust range of occupations while producing a large enough sample that structural equation modeling can be used for model testing. The SEM Result column reports the results after combining data from the three studies and testing each hypothesis.</p>

<title>Research Design</title>
<p>To have the largest possible sample of public service workers from a variety of occupations, we combined raw data from the three studies described above, each of which employed different samples but all of which used the same questionnaire and 7-point Likert-type scale. The GNM Emotional Labor Questionnaire (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0275074010396078">Guy et al., 2008</xref>) contains 48 survey items and these questions are measured on a 7-point Likert-type scale with “1” indicating <italic>strong disagreement</italic> and “7” indicating <italic>strong agreement</italic>.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0275074010396078">Table 2</xref> displays the demographics of the combined sample. A total sample of 453 participants was generated.

<title>Emotion work</title>
<p>This latent variable represents the nature and characteristics of emotional labor. It is used to investigate whether different occupations vary in the degree to which workers must perform it to get the job done. A sample item is “My job requires me to guide people through sensitive and/or emotional issues.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0275074010396078">
<title>Personal efficacy</title>
<p>The next perspective on emotional labor involves workers’ assessments of their own emotive skills. This construct queries the degree to which workers perceive and engage in managing the emotions of others and their own assessment of their effectiveness. A sample item is “I am good at getting people to calm down.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0275074010396078">
<title>False face acting</title>
<p>The next variant of emotional labor relates to the requirement for workers to suppress their own emotions while publicly expressing a different emotion. In other words, this factor probes the worker’s ability to act as if he or she feels one way while actually feeling another way. A sample item is “My job requires that I pretend to have emotions that I do not really feel.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0275074010396078">
<title>Job satisfaction</title>
<p>Another means for examining the consequence of emotion work is to look at job satisfaction. One of the chief sources of satisfaction at work comes from the dynamic interaction between individuals and their work environment. Thus, five survey items are included in this index to assess the harmonious relationship between individual and environment. A sample item is “My work is satisfying.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0275074010396078">
<title>Burnout</title>
<p>This scale assesses the degree to which respondents report symptoms of exhaustion at work, which is the well-established negative outcome of emotional labor. A sample item is, “I leave work feeling emotionally exhausted.”</p>
<p>In addition to the study variables, five control variables (gender, age, educational level, tenure, and agency type) are included as statistical controls. To determine if these variables have any impact on the proposed model, we employed the analytical steps previously used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0275074010396078">Kim and Wright (2007)</xref>. That is, we first tested the model with the controls included. Then we constrained the paths from the control variables to job satisfaction and burnout to zero when the model was run once more. Finally, the chi-square difference statistic was used to test the statistical significance of the decrement between the two models so that we were able to determine if the controls held any meaningful explanatory power to the original model.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0275074010396078">
<title>Analytic Method</title>
<p>To probe the relationship between emotional labor and its consequences, structural equation modeling was employed to test and estimate the hypotheses. SEM is a convenient tool not only for testing construct validity but also for representing complex causal relations in multivariate data, such as when one variable’s effect is mediated by another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0275074010396078">Burnette &amp; Williams, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0275074010396078">Kline, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0275074010396078">McDonald &amp; Ho, 2002</xref>). In this analysis, mediation likely exists in the relationship among three facets of emotional labor (i.e., emotion work, personal efficacy, and false face acting) and their impacts on job satisfaction and burnout. Therefore, SEM is superior to multiple regression analysis, which was the primary analytical technique used for the individual studies.</p>
<p>Like many SEM users in public administration (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0275074010396078">Kim, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0275074010396078">Pinho &amp; Macedo, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0275074010396078">Vandenabeele, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0275074010396078">Yang &amp; Pandey, 2009</xref>), we performed a two-step SEM process. However, steps employed here slightly differ from what is recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0275074010396078">Anderson and Gerbing (1988)</xref>. Although it has been widely used by researchers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0275074010396078">McDonald and Ho (2002)</xref> argue that the two-step approach of Anderson &amp; Gerbing may not reveal the adequacy of the proposed theoretical model. Thus McDonald and Ho suggest a revised two-step procedure. With this analytical process, we first tested the fit and convergent and discriminant validity of the construct for the proposed measurement model, also called confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) model. Once a satisfactory CFA model was obtained, the second step was to test the structural model using as input the correlations among the latent variables obtained from the CFA process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0275074010396078">Williams, Vandenberg, &amp; Edwards, 2009</xref>). We employed EQS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0275074010396078">Bentler, 2006a</xref>), a popular SEM software program, to test the proposed model.</p>
<p>A combination of multiple model fit indices is reported later in this article, such as chi-square, the comparative fit index (CFI), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR). The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is used to deal with missing data.</p>
<p>In addition, maximum likelihood (ML) estimation was employed for analytic procedures. However, multivariate nonnormality—the joint effect of a set of variables that are not normally distributed—may affect the accuracy of ML estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0275074010396078">Finney &amp; Distefano, 2006</xref>). Thus multivariate normality was checked prior to SEM analyses. For this purpose, a coefficient of multivariate kurtosis proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0275074010396078">Mardia (1970)</xref> is reported so as to determine whether or not ML estimation is an appropriate method for evaluating the model fit.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<sec id="section11-0275074010396078">
<title>Results of Two-Step SEM process</title>
<p>The initial CFA indicated that the constructs used in this study may be partially invalid in terms of content validity (the extent to which items selected to constitute a measure correspond to its conceptual definition) and convergent validity (the extent to which indicators of a specific construct share a high proportion of variance in common; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0275074010396078">Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson, &amp; Tatham, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0275074010396078">Table 3</xref> reveals that some individual items may be problematic when assessing the correspondence between these items and their represented concepts. For example, Q28 does not precisely match the theoretical description of false face acting. Dealing with unfriendly people does not mean that one must suppress undesired emotions while expressing another emotion for the purpose of the transaction. Also, Q17 is to capture the variety of work-related emotions and therefore different from other items in the same construct. Finally, Q29 seems to be logically related to personal efficacy instead of emotion work, per se. These suggest that measurement modifications are required.</p>
<p>The CFA process also reveals the concern for convergent validity among the survey item measures. Scholars suggest that the size of factor loading is an important consideration for convergent validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0275074010396078">Hair et al., 2006</xref>). A rule of thumb is that standardized factor loading estimates should be .5 or higher. A loading of less than .5 represents that more than 75% of the variance of the item is unexplained by the factor. In the initial model, some of the item measures fall below the cutoff value, which demonstrates some degree of convergent invalidity.</p>
<p>To address the above problems, we adopted an iterative respecification process. Model respecification was based on logical adjustments in specific parts of this model and overall evaluation of the model fit. We also estimated the covariances for the error terms of observed variables to obtain an acceptable model fit. This step required theoretical reasons since we assumed that these indicators shared a common cause unexplained by their factor. In our respecified CFA model, we added covariances among errors of Q10, Q11, and Q13 and between errors of Q20 and Q48 because (a) EQS’s model modification indices suggested adding these covariances and (b) we believed that they represented the concepts of “career development” and “management of emotion in coworkers” respectively, which was not fully reflected in the general job satisfaction or personal efficacy construct. When a satisfactory CFA model was obtained,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0275074010396078">3</xref></sup> we then stopped the respecification process. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0275074010396078">Table 4</xref> reports the standardized solution of the respecified item measures.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0275074010396078">Table 6</xref> reports model fit indices for structural models. For the original model, CFI, RMSEA, and SRMR satisfy the commonly accepted thresholds for these fit indices, that is, CFI ≥.9, RMSEA ≤.08, and SRMR ≤ .1. Based on these statistics, we conclude that our hypothesized model has a nearly perfect fit. In the analyses, we also consider the assessment of model equivalence to include all alternative explanations of the relationships among variables other than our hypothesized model.

<title>Evaluation of Hypotheses and Effect Decomposition</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0275074010396078">Figure 1</xref> displays the standardized estimate of the hypothesized structural model and its equivalent models. In the figure, path coefficients of the hypothesized model suggest the significance of some of the hypotheses: First, emotion work contributes positively to employees’ assessments of their level of personal skill at managing the emotions of others (H1) as well as the extent to which employees report that their jobs require them to suppress their true feeling and express emotions they do not feel (H2). However, these findings are not conclusive because of the presence of Equivalent Models 1 and 2. The different variations of modeling results suggest that emotion work, personal efficacy, and false face acting are correlated as three facets of emotional labor but no causal relations among them can be affirmed in our analyses.</p>
<p>Second, the three predictors, emotion work, personal efficacy, and false face acting, are all significantly related to self-reported job satisfaction and burnout but in different directions as formulated in hypotheses H4, H5, H6, H7, H8, and H9. In the hypothesized model, for example, the level of job satisfaction goes up as the degree of emotion work (β = .19) and personal efficacy (β = .37) increases. On the contrary, however, false face acting (β = –.34) decreases the likelihood that employees report satisfaction with their jobs. These results are consistent with hypotheses H4, H5, and H6. The other three hypotheses, H7, H8, and H9, which represent the effect of emotional labor on burnout, are also confirmed through the SEM process. That is, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0275074010396078">Figure 1</xref> (refer to the hypothesized model), emotion work (β = .33) and false face acting (β = .41) will deteriorate employee stamina and result in emotional exhaustion, whereas personal efficacy (β = –.17) is inversely associated with burnout.</p>
<p>Finally, job satisfaction is a significant predictor of burnout and vice versa. In other words, the causality cannot be determined in our analyses. While H10 (the path “job satisfaction → burnout”) has been demonstrated in the hypothesized model, Equivalent Model 3 illustrates that the path “burnout → job satisfaction” is equally valid from a mathematical standpoint. Both paths are theoretically meaningful: Some studies indicate that job satisfaction has a negative impact on burnout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0275074010396078">Dolan, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0275074010396078">Faragher, Cass, &amp; Cooper, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0275074010396078">Kalliath &amp; Morris, 2002</xref>), but others suggest that high burnout results in reduced job satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0275074010396078">Burke &amp; Greenglass, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0275074010396078">Kim &amp; Wright, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0275074010396078">Um &amp; Harrison, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0275074010396078">Wolpin, Burke, &amp; Greenglass, 1991</xref>). This finding complicates the relationship between emotional labor, job satisfaction and burnout. For example, the reciprocal influences between job satisfaction and burnout heighten the effects of two emotional labor constructs (i.e., personal efficacy and false face acting) on these outcome variables. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0275074010396078">Figure 1</xref>, the standardized total effects of personal efficacy and false face acting on burnout are –.27 and .50 respectively. In addition, the impact of emotion work on job satisfaction and burnout weakens because emotion work may indirectly decrease job satisfaction or burnout through its influence on the other outcome variable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0275074010396078">4</xref></sup></p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to test a model for job satisfaction and burnout as each relates to the performance of emotional labor among a broad spectrum of public service jobs. The findings advance the dialogue and theory building surrounding the subject. Even across a broad range of public service jobs, employees who perform emotion work reported higher degrees of personal efficacy in terms of their ability to manage their own emotions as well as the emotions of citizens seeking their services to achieve their desired work outcome. And, since the performance of emotion work often requires workers to put on a “false face” by suppressing their own feelings while expressing another emotion for the purpose of service completion, it is consistent that the results show a positive, significant relationship between “emotion work” and “false face acting.”</p>
<p>The SEM results of the hypothesized model also suggest that workers’ who perceive that their job requires emotion work tend to positively rate their skill to provide service to others. Since “personal efficacy” and “false face acting” were significantly related to the degree to which workers must perform emotional labor and to its relationship to job satisfaction and burnout, these variables serve as mediators in the relationship between emotion work and its consequences.</p>

<title>Consequences of Emotional Labor</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0275074010396078">Guy et al. (2008)</xref> found that when employees engage in emotion work, they experience higher job satisfaction. They also found that workers’ ability to manage the emotions of others and their effectiveness at doing so was positively related to job satisfaction and negatively associated with burnout. Third, they found that jobs that require workers to act as if they feel one way when they actually feel another tended to reduce job satisfaction and increase the risk of burnout. And <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0275074010396078">Jin and Guy (2009)</xref> found that emotion work correlates with higher levels of job satisfaction even when the work does not involve a social services–like helping relationship. What these studies did not comprehend was the role of personal efficacy and false face acting in mediating the relationship between emotion work, job satisfaction, and burnout. Using a larger, more varied sample of public service workers, along with more sophisticated analyses, this study reveals what is inside the black box mediating the two most important consequences of emotional labor: job satisfaction versus burnout.</p>
<p>To summarize, this analysis shows that</p>
<list id="list1-0275074010396078" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Across all types of public service work, the level of job satisfaction goes up as the amount of emotion work increases. And, the performance of emotion work is positively related both to the worker’s efficacy at performing it and to the worker’s ability to engage in false face acting. In other words, the better a worker is at performing emotion work, the better the worker is at emotive expression as well as emotive suppression.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Contrary to more simplistic analyses, the effect of emotion work on burnout appears to be more complicated than expected. It not only has a direct impact on burnout but it also relates to burnout indirectly through personal efficacy, false face acting, and job satisfaction. By decomposing these effects, we found that the deleterious effect of emotional labor mainly occurs not with its performance, per se, but when workers must fake their feelings. That is, the more one engages in false face acting, the more likely it is that burnout will occur. The statistical significance of these paths, “emotion work → false face acting → burnout” and “false face acting → burnout”, indicates that it is the demands of pretending to feel one way when actually feeling another that contributes to burnout, not the performance of emotion work that allows emotional expression consistent with the worker’s actual feelings. Results also indicate, however, that the risk of burnout can be mitigated by workers’ skill and effectiveness at performing emotion work as well as positive attitudes toward their jobs. Therefore, training aimed at developing such skills and efforts dedicated to improving the appraisal of one’s work may help to ward off the untoward effects of such work.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There is an inverse relationship between false face acting and job satisfaction. This means that the more workers must engage in false face acting, the more their job satisfaction is reduced. To improve individual well-being and employee retention, we suggest that supervisors be sensitive to worker–citizen transactions that require emotional inauthenticity, which is another term for false face acting. Counseling services, such as employee assistance programs (EAPs), provide a helpful intervention to help employees deal with the emotional inconsistencies of such work. Professional training and social supports from other members in the workplace, such as regularly scheduled debriefings, can also be helpful to address this downside to emotion work. Moreover, performance rewards that applaud workers who are able to cope with the demands of emotional labor can be reinforcing.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Probing the relationship between emotional labor and its consequences is fertile ground for additional research. For example, the nonsignificant path between personal efficacy and false face acting in the model deserves further attention. The lack of significance may be explained by other paths not included in our model. In addition, since equivalent models exist, we must acknowledge that there are alternative explanations of the relationships among these studied variables. For instance, Equivalent Model 1 raises a possibility that employees who have confidence in their emotive skills are more likely to stay in these service jobs and perform emotion work. In addition, Equivalent Model 2 suggests that service workers may first adjust observable emotional expressions before they are able to manage the emotions of others at work. Finally, Equivalent Model 3 reflects there is no decisive conclusion of the relationship between job satisfaction and burnout in literature. Although these equivalent models enrich our understanding of these studied relationships, it is suggested that there should be further examination of these findings before they are conclusive.</p></list-item>

<p>This study analyzed a large sample of state, local, and nonprofit employees. By examining the responses of public service providers across a broad range of occupations and settings, we were able to examine whether or not the relationship between emotional labor and its consequences suggested by prior work remains. The larger sample also improves the generalizability and validity of what has been known so far. In fact, the analysis reported here confirms prior findings and offers additional insights into the mediating effects of two important skills: sensing the emotive state of the citizen being served as well as expressing and suppressing one’s own emotive state.</p>
<p>Emotional labor is an essential dynamic in public service delivery. The more comprehensive our understanding is of it, the better our theory of emotional labor will be. The better that theory is, the better equipped human resource executives and agency administrators will be when it comes to understanding human capital, public performance, and citizen responsiveness.</p>
<p>Should this work advance the dialogue about emotional labor in public service, the field’s understanding of work skills required in public service delivery will be enhanced. As with all good research, this study invites further investigation as to the consequences of emotion work that public service workers perform on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Hochschild defines emotional labor as the management of feeling to create a publicly observable facial and bodily display (1983). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0275074010396078">Guy et al. (2008)</xref> distinguish the subtle difference between emotional labor and emotion work. While emotional labor is the type of labor to be performed, as contrasted with cognitive labor, emotion work is a term used to refer to the actual performance of emotional labor. Thus the two terms are almost synonymous.</p>

<p>The ML-based fit statistics for the respecified CFA model are χ<sup>2</sup>(138) = 512.656, CFI = .926, RMSEA = .078, and SRMR = .072. Note that the resulting normalized estimate for Mardia’s coefficient is 14.5630 for the model. This implies multivariate nonnormality since, in practice, values greater than 5 are indicative of a nonnormal distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0275074010396078">Bentler, 2006b</xref>). While nonnormality occurs, interpretations based on the ML-based statistics may be problematic. Thus we performed robust estimates to accommodate this problem. The fit indices computed based on robust estimate methods are χ<sup>2</sup>(138) = 473.4428, CFI = .923, and RMSEA = .073, which still indicate a good fit.</p>
