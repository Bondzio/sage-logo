<title>Subjects:</title>
<p>Eighty-five subjects with lower limb hypertonia received 200 U (<italic>n =</italic> 28) or 300 U (<italic>n =</italic> 28) of onabotulinumtoxinA or saline (<italic>n =</italic> 29) injection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability among adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215511432016">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215511432016">2</xref></sup> Hemiparesis may be associated with altered sensation, weakness, loss of selective muscle control, increased muscle fatigability and hypertonia. Hypertonia, defined as increased resistance to passive muscle lengthening,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511432016">3</xref></sup> can result from changes in soft tissue morphology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215511432016">4</xref></sup> and involuntary activation of muscles including stretch-induced contraction (spasticity), sustained unwanted contraction (dystonia) and/or abnormal co-contraction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511432016">5</xref></sup> Moderate to severe focal muscle overactivity, particularly with associated soft tissue shortening, can limit functional ability and have a profound impact on independence and quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215511432016">6</xref></sup> Botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) has become the treatment of choice to reduce the neurogenic component of focal hypertonia by weakening targeted muscles, thereby facilitating stretching and ease of passive function and, potentially, improving movement control in the antagonist to the treated muscle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215511432016">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215511432016"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215511432016"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511432016"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511432016">11</xref></sup> The peak clinical benefit is seen within 4–8 weeks, and treatment effects generally wane at about 12 weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511432016">12</xref></sup> A large literature supports BoNT-A usage for upper limb hypertonia and pain, as well as to improve passive function and caregiver burden after stroke; however there is less evidence for a clinically significant effect on active function of the treated arm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511432016">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another common target for BoNT-A treatment after stroke is muscle overactivity causing equinovarus ankle deformity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511432016">11</xref></sup> Investigators have reported significant improvements in hypertonia, active and passive range of ankle motion, and limb pain, as well as less dependence on walking aids in BoNT-A-treated patients versus controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511432016">11</xref></sup> Again, however, the evidence for a functional benefit, such as improved gait or balance, is limited.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511432016">11</xref></sup> Only one large, randomized controlled trial (RCT) has previously investigated the efficacy of onabotulinumtoxinA (as opposed to other BoNT-A formulations) in stroke survivors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511432016">14</xref></sup> Subjects studied had severe ankle equinovarus deformity (mean Modified Ashworth Scale at baseline 3.26 ± 0.44). Significant between-group differences were seen for ankle Modified Ashworth Scale scores at evaluation up to 8 weeks after injection but not at 12 weeks. Small mean improvements were seen in all subjects for gait quality and speed, with no difference between groups. The authors concluded that this may have reflected the chronicity of subjects studied, as the mean time since stroke for the cohort overall was over six years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511432016">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The present study sought to investigate the safety and efficacy of a single cycle of two BoNT-A regimens (200 or 300 U onabotulinumtoxinA) versus same volume placebo for moderate to severe plantarflexor/invertor muscle overactivity (Ashworth Scale Score ≥2) after stroke. A broader range of outcome measures were utilized, with a longer follow-up period than previously reported for onabotulinumtoxinA treatment of ankle equinovarus deformity following stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511432016">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511432016"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215511432016"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215511432016"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215511432016">18</xref></sup> The impact of a second injection cycle, where clinically indicated, was also investigated to reflect a commonly utilized clinical practice.</p>

<sec id="section9-0269215511432016" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This multicentre trial comprised two phases: a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-injection controlled trial, with a follow-up open-label phase. In the randomized controlled trial, the effect of 200 U or 300 U of onabotulinumtoxinA on overactivity of the plantarflexor/invertor ± toe flexor muscles including spasm frequency and associated pain, as well as range of ankle dorsiflexion and gait dysfunction after stroke was compared with that of same volume saline injection. In the open-label phase, the effect on the same variables of injection or re-injection of onabotulinumtoxinA, to a maximum dose of 300 U, was examined.</p>
<p>Institutional ethics approval was received at all participating centres. Medically stable individuals, aged 15–85 years, with history of a stroke at least six weeks prior to randomization and moderate to severe plantarflexor/invertor hypertonia (Ashworth Scale score ≥2) who were in inpatients or attending outpatient services at participating centres were invited to be involved in the trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269215511432016">Figure 1</xref>). Written informed consent was obtained from each study participant prior to enrolment. Exclusion criteria were: pregnancy or at high risk of becoming pregnant during the study; fixed contracture or profound atrophy of the affected lower limb; concurrent local or systemic infection; previous BoNT-A or phenol injection or surgery to the affected limb; diagnosis of neuromuscular disease, or concurrent use of aminoglycoside antibiotics or other agents that could augment the effects of BoNT-A on neuromuscular transmission.</p>

<p>At the first visit, eligible subjects were assessed and randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups using a computer-generated number sequence. Randomization was based on a block size of 6 per investigational site with a 2 : 2 : 1 : 1 ratio comprising 200 U onabotulinumtoxinA (10 mL) : 300 U onabotulinumtoxinA (15 mL) : 10 mL of normal saline : 15 mL of normal saline. Group allocation was stored in sealed envelopes available only to pharmacy staff involved in provision of vials for injection. At the second visit, subjects were re-assessed and the allocated study treatment was administered. The sponsoring company prepared identical vials of onabotulinumtoxinA and sterile saline that were indistinguishable, and these were issued by a pharmacist at the participating hospital according to the code allocated to that subject. Subjects, injectors and assessors were blinded to group allocation. All vials were reconstituted with 5 mL of normal saline (dilution of 20 U/mL for onabotulinumtoxinA). This dilution was selected to achieve an optimal therapeutic effect in larger muscles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215511432016">19</xref></sup> All subjects received intramuscular injections into the posterior tibialis, 3.5 mL (70 U when active) or 5 mL (100 U when active) and soleus, 4 mL (80 U when active) or 6.25 mL (125 U when active) and either the flexor digitorum longus or medial gastrocnemius, 2.5 mL (50 U when active) or 3.75 mL (75 U when active), as clinically indicated. These muscles were chosen based on previous clinical experience of the investigators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215511432016">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Injections were undertaken using electromyographic or electrical stimulation guidance. All study sites were instructed on using a standardized injection technique for each muscle, widely infiltrating each muscle with two injection sites per muscle. Oral antispasmodic medications, if used, remained unaltered throughout the trial.</p>
<p>Pretreatment assessments were performed 2–4 weeks apart to assess the stability of the variables measured. In the randomized controlled trial phase of the study, assessments were also conducted at 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks post injection. All evaluations were undertaken by trained assessors who were blinded to group allocation. Wherever possible, study visits were scheduled at the same time of the day to minimize the impact of diurnal variations in muscle overactivity. Patients whose plantarflexor Ashworth Scale scores had not returned to the baseline by week 12 continued to be assessed every four weeks, to a maximum of 32 weeks.</p>
<p>Once return to baseline was documented, consenting patients were entered into the open-label phase of the study. The treating physician could be made aware of the group allocation and dose administered in the randomized controlled trial phase, if so requested. In the open-label phase, either 200 U or 300 U onabotulinumtoxinA was injected, based on the physician’s perception of the patient’s clinical presentation and the observed response to treatment during the randomized controlled trial. Assessments were again conducted at four-week intervals for at least 12 weeks post injection during this open-label phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269215511432016">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0269215511432016">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>The primary outcomes in this study were incidence of adverse events and reduction in hypertonia in the ankle plantarflexors at 12 weeks post injection using the Ashworth Scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215511432016">21</xref></sup> The number of patients reporting an adverse event were documented for each treatment group. An adverse event was defined as any untoward event occurring during the study, without regard to causality. Any worsening of the disease/condition under evaluation, outside of normally expected variations, was also documented as an adverse event.</p>
<p>Secondary evaluations of muscle overactivity included self-reported spasm frequency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215511432016">22</xref></sup> and the treating physician’s rating of hypertonia severity, based on a 7-point Likert scale (−3 markedly worse, 0 no change, +3 markedly better). Clinically significant change was defined a priori as an improvement, compared with baseline, of ≥1 grade on the Ashworth Scale and/or the physician rating of hypertonia severity.</p>
<p>The presence or absence of pain in the affected lower limb was recorded at each visit. If present, subjects were asked to rate the severity of their pain at that time, using a 100 mm visual analogue scale ranging from ‘no pain’ to ‘worst pain imaginable’. Clinically significant reduction in pain intensity was defined a priori as ≥20% of baseline pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215511432016">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>The range of active dorsiflexion of the affected ankle was measured using a standardized goniometric technique, with the patient seated and the hip and knee flexed to approximately 90°. Clinically significant change was defined a priori as an improvement of ≥5° of active ankle dorsiflexion motion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215511432016">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally, video recordings of the patient’s gait were made prior to injection and at each of the subsequent study visits. Qualitative rating of a range of components of gait was conducted using the Physicians Rating Scale (−1 = worse than baseline, 0 = same as baseline, +1 better than baseline).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269215511432016">25</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section11-0269215511432016">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Power calculations identified that 25 subjects were needed in each group to detect a difference of one point on the Ashworth Scale, assuming a SD ±1 and power of 80%. An intention-to-treat analysis was used for all efficacy analyses. Descriptive statistics were utilized to characterize the study cohort. Paired (within-treatment comparisons) or unpaired (between-group comparisons) <italic>t</italic>-tests were used for analysis of continuous data. Sign test and Fisher exact tests were used for analysis of categorical data. The level for significance was set at <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05. Data from the spasm frequency scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215511432016">22</xref></sup> were coded as follows: category 0 (no spasms) = 0; category 1 (1 or 2 spasms per week) = 1.5; category 2 (3–5 spasms per week) = 4; category 3 (6–10 spasms per week) = 8; category 4 (more than 10 spasms per week) = 12.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Data were collected in seven neurological rehabilitation centres around Australia between March 1996 and May 2000. Two subjects randomized to receive onabotulinumtoxinA 200 U were not injected (one deceased prior to baseline visit 2 and one had a persistent infected rash in the injection area). Therefore, the analysis was based on the 83 subjects who received the allocated treatment regime (onabotulinumtoxinA <italic>n =</italic> 54, placebo <italic>n =</italic> 29). Tibialis posterior and soleus muscles were injected in all subjects, while 52/83 (62.7%) received injection to medial gastrocnemius and 31/83 (37.3%) to flexor digitorum longus muscles. Baseline data for onabotulinumtoxinA injected and control groups are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269215511432016">Table 1</xref>. Differences between the baseline assessments were not statistically significant, hence a decision was made to use data from visit 2 as the baseline measure for each patient. Two patients recorded a score of Ashworth grade 2 for the plantarflexors on the first test occasion and grade 1 on the subsequent evaluation. They were nevertheless considered to meet the study inclusion criteria due to other clinical indicators of moderately severe plantarflexor muscle overactivity.</p>

<p>At 12 weeks post injection, there was no significant between-group difference in the number of subjects who had improved by at least 1 grade on Ashworth scores for ankle plantarflexors (16/54 versus 5/29, <italic>P</italic> = 0.22). However, when the subgroup of patients with a more severe presentation at baseline (Ashworth Scale scores ≥3) were analysed, 14/31 (45.2%) in the onabotulinumtoxinA group were classed as ‘responders’, versus 1/17 (5.9%) receiving placebo injection (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01). The likelihood of being classed as a ‘responder’ was not affected by the patient’s age, gender or time since stroke. Ashworth scores had not returned to their baseline value in 16 of the 77 patients who completed the 16-week visit (13/54 onabotulinumtoxinA and 3/29 placebo-injected subjects). These subjects continued to be assessed until up to 32 weeks post injection.</p>
<p>The incidence of adverse events between the onabotulinumtoxinA and placebo groups was not significantly different (<italic>P</italic> = 0.61), with 22 non-serious adverse events reported overall. The most commonly reported events were injection-site pain (onabotulinumtoxinA cohort: 7/54; placebo cohort: 7/29), convulsions (onabotulinumtoxinA: 2/54; placebo: 2/29) and incoordination (onabotulinumtoxinA: 2/54; placebo: 2/29). Ten serious adverse events were reported, none of which were considered by the investigators to be related to the study treatment. Two serious adverse events occurred in patients receiving onabotulinumtoxinA 200 U (a cerebral infarct and a prostatic disorder), four in patients receiving onabotulinumtoxinA 300 U (two reports of falls, one seizure and one further stroke), and three in patients receiving placebo (vascular anomaly requiring surgical intervention and one seizure, and concussion associated with ethanol intoxication and pneumonia resulting in hospitalization in the same patient).</p>

<sec id="section14-0269215511432016">
<title>Part II (open-label phase)</title>
<p>A total of 70 patients entered the open-label phase of the trial. Those subjects who received a second onabotulinumtoxinA injection (<italic>n =</italic> 44) were designated ‘second injection group’, while those receiving their first onabotulinumtoxinA injection (<italic>n =</italic> 26) were designated ‘first injection group’. Sixty-two patients (88.6%) completed the open-label phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269215511432016">Figure 1</xref>). In 53 patients (75.7%), the onabotulinumtoxinA dose regimen was determined by the patient’s clinical presentation alone. All assessors remained blinded to part I allocation. The treating physicians requested the study drug allocation in the preceding randomized controlled trial for the remaining 17 patients. For these patients, assessors other than the treating physician remained blinded to initial group allocation. Sixty-three patients (90%) received 300 U onabotulinumtoxinA in the open-label phase.</p>
<p>In this phase, the main outcomes of interest were again plantarflexor Ashworth scores at 12 weeks post injection and incidence of adverse events. Those receiving a second onabotulinumtoxinA injection were much more likely to record an improvement of ≥1 grade on the Ashworth Scale versus those receiving their first onabotulinumtoxinA injection (20/44 versus 7/26, <italic>P</italic> = 0.005). Sixteen of the 70 re-injected patients (12 of whom had received a second injection) did not return to their baseline Ashworth score by 12 weeks and continued to be reassessed for up to 20 weeks. Patients receiving a second onabotulinumtoxinA injection also had a significant reduction in spasm frequency compared with entry to this phase of the study (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002), but the difference between groups did not reach statistical significance (<italic>P</italic> = 0.08).</p>
<p>Pain was reported by 17 of 70 (24%) subjects prior to re-injection at the start of the open-label phase. Pain rating improved in both treatment groups over the 12-week assessment period without significant difference between the groups. The number of patients recording an increase in active ankle dorsiflexion of ≥5° was not significantly different between groups. The number of subjects coded as having an improvement in gait quality was significantly greater in the cohort receiving a second versus first onabotulinumtoxinA injection (17/44 versus 11/26, <italic>P</italic> = 0.002).</p>
<p>One or more adverse events were reported for 22/44 patients (50%) in the second injection group, and 12/26 of patients (46.2%) in the first injection group. Of these, 85% were classified as mild or moderate in severity. The overall incidence in adverse events was not significantly different between the two groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.24). The most frequently reported adverse events were general pain (second injection group = 7/44, first injection group = 4/26) and injection site pain (second injection group = 5/44, group, first injection group = 4/26). Serious adverse events were reported in five patients. None were considered to be related to the study treatment. Four of these were in the second injection group (myocardial infarct resulting in death, pharyngitis/abscess resulting in hospitalization, seizure, transient ischaemic attack) and one was in the first injection group (second stroke).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This double-blind, multicentre randomized controlled trial, with an open-label extension, provides additional support for the safety of onabotulinumtoxinA in the management of plantarflexor/invertor muscle overactivity after stroke. Those adverse events thought to be treatment related were consistent with the known safety profile of onabotulinumtoxinA, were self-limiting, generally mild to moderate in severity, and were primarily localized to the site of administration.</p>
<p>Our results did not support the premise that a single treatment cycle of onabotulinumtoxinA would produce a clinically significant greater reduction in plantarflexor/invertor hypertonia, as measured by the Ashworth Scale, than placebo injection. Further, the assumption that a larger onabotulinumtoxinA dose (300 U) would be associated with a greater reduction in hypertonia than a lower dose (200 U) was not confirmed in this study.</p>
<p>The Ashworth Scale has been used widely as the primary endpoint in a number of studies of BoNT in the treatment of hypertonia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511432016">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511432016">13</xref></sup> However, the relative insensitivity of this scale may have contributed to the failure to detect a between-group difference in the current study, despite enrolling a larger number of subjects than indicated by our power calculations (83 subjects enrolled versus an estimated sample of 75 subjects). Previous investigators have reported mean Ashworth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215511432016">17</xref></sup> or Modified Ashworth data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511432016">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215511432016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215511432016">18</xref></sup> or the area under the curve for mean Ashworth Scale change from baseline.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511432016">14</xref></sup> Because the Ashworth Scale is an ordinal rather than continuous scale, it is appropriate to report the number of subjects in each group making clinically significant change (determined prior to the study to be ≥1 grade) rather than to apply averaging techniques to these data. In the present study, the number of subjects demonstrating a clinically significant decrease in Ashworth Scale scores for the plantarflexors at 12 weeks post injection was not significantly different between groups.</p>
<p>It is well established that the Ashworth Scale is unable to distinguish neurogenic and biomechanical sources of resistance to passive lengthening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215511432016">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215511432016">27</xref></sup> Furthermore, this scale has been shown to have poor inter-rater reliability when used to measure hypertonia at the ankle, compared with other joints.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215511432016">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269215511432016"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269215511432016">30</xref></sup> Recognizing these limitations, we employed other instruments to assess this aspect of treatment outcome, including self-reported spasm frequency, physician assessment of hypertonia severity, and self-reported pain, which may be related to sustained muscle tension. For each of these variables, the onabotulinumtoxinA-treated group demonstrated significant improvement relative to placebo-injected subjects (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215511432016">Table 2</xref>). In addition, for those patients with more severe plantarflexor hypertonia at baseline (Ashworth score ≥3), there was a significant between-group difference in response rates, favouring the onabotulinumtoxinA treatment group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01). This reflects the clinical finding that those with more severe focal muscle overactivity, and related limb dysfunction, are more likely to benefit from BoNT treatment.</p>
<p>The open-label component of the study was included for a number of reasons. First, best practice guidelines for BoNT use recommend that patients should be re-evaluated at about three months post injection and, if clinically indicated, offered a subsequent injection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511432016">13</xref></sup> Second, it was considered ethically important for subjects receiving placebo injection to have the option to cross over to the active group. Finally, this approach provided the opportunity to examine the cumulative benefit of a second injection, since this is common clinical practice. Consistent with our clinical approach at the time, subjects had to return to their baseline plantarflexor Ashworth Scale score to be eligible to enter the open-label phase. In some cases, this did not occur until 32 weeks after the initial treatment; consequently a true assessment of the cumulative effects of two onabotulinumtoxinA treatments was unable to be conducted. Nevertheless, even considering the variable hiatus between the two treatment cycles, a higher proportion of those receiving a second onabotulinumtoxinA injection achieved improvement in hypertonia and gait quality than those receiving their first onabotulinumtoxinA injection during the open-label phase. It is possible that some subjects receiving 200 U in the randomized controlled trial were under-dosed; however, with the exception of medial gastrocnemius muscle, doses utilized in both phases of the study were within the range recommended by a recent international consensus statement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511432016">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this study, changes in range of active ankle dorsiflexion and gait quality were also evaluated as markers of the functional impact of treatment. Although assessment of functional outcomes following BoNT injection in the lower limb has primarily focused on improvement in gait speed,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511432016">11</xref></sup> changes in gait quality can be an important indicator of positive treatment outcomes. Improvements documented by assessors blinded to group allocation included better foot clearance during swing phase and increased heel contact on initial stance. In addition, more subjects in the onabotulinumtoxinA-treated group achieved improvements of active ankle dorsiflexion ≥5° compared with saline-injected controls. These changes may have reflected decreased plantarflexor hypertonia, which was observed in some individuals, as well as the potential for the antagonist to the injected muscles to be more easily activated, due to centrally mediated effects of BoNT injection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511432016">12</xref></sup> We postulate that these changes may be associated with increased confidence in mobilizing, reduced fear of falls, as well as reduced likelihood of falls associated with tripping. However, further investigation of changes in gait speed and functional mobility, such as transfer ability and community ambulation, as well as falls rates, is warranted to establish and further define the functional benefits of BoNT injection to treat overactivity in the plantarflexor and invertor muscles following stroke.</p>
<p>In this trial, 22.4% of subjects entered the study less than six months post stroke. This may have increased the within-group variability as hypertonia is known to evolve during this time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215511432016">6</xref></sup> However, the median time since stroke in this cohort was 2.1 years and outcomes did not correlate with duration since stroke. There is no consensus on the optimal timing of BoNT therapy; however increasingly it is not seen as a last resort option, but rather as an appropriate component of subacute rehabilitation post stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215511432016">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215511432016"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215511432016"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511432016"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511432016">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511432016">13</xref></sup> It can be postulated that there is a greater likelihood of improving functional outcomes following BoNT intervention if treatment is commenced before compensatory movement patterns have become well established. However, our data support the contention that some benefits can still be achieved in chronic stroke, and we propose that BoNT injection should be offered at any stage post stroke, providing there are no contraindications to treatment, clear goals of treatment can be agreed upon and outcomes of treatment are measured to guide evaluation of efficacy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511432016">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511432016"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511432016">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our study has a number of limitations. First, several of the outcome measures used have not been shown to be valid and reliable in stroke populations. The Physicians Rating Scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269215511432016">25</xref></sup> was developed for assessment of gait dysfunction in children with cerebral palsy, and its use in stroke has not been widespread. Similarly, although self-reported pain intensity using the VAS has been previously utilized in studies of onabotulinumtoxinA for post-stroke ankle equinovarus,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215511432016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215511432016">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269215511432016">31</xref></sup> the validity and reliability of this scale has been questioned by some authors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269215511432016">32</xref></sup> Despite this, it was considered important to include perspectives reported by patients and their treating physician/therapist on treatment outcomes, as these may more accurately reflect the real clinical impact of treatment than evaluation at the level of impairment. It is acknowledged that achievement of functional goals, evaluated via instruments such as the Goal Attainment Scale,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269215511432016">33</xref></sup> can provide important insights into the utility of an intervention and can help to guide patient-focused, goal-directed treatment using BoNT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511432016">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511432016">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>This was a multicentre trial, conducted over seven sites across Australia. While considerable effort was expended to ensure consistency in patient selection and assessment, injection techniques, data collection and recording, individual results will have varied according to the experience and skill of the treatment team. The optimal regimen of adjunctive treatment of foot and ankle muscle overactivity post stroke is yet to be elucidated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511432016">11</xref></sup> While it is recommended that BoNT treatment should occur as part of an integrated multidisciplinary service, with physiotherapy treatment being a core component,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215511432016">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215511432016"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511432016"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511432016"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511432016"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511432016">13</xref></sup> adjunctive treatment in the present study was not standardized and fewer than half of the enrolled subjects were receiving physiotherapy concurrently (although physical and oral antispastic treatments were unchanged during the study period). It is proposed that this reflects common practice in clinical settings where physicians with variable skills and experience administer BoNT injections, with or without adjunctive therapy, and with inconsistent follow-up. Therefore, while acknowledging these limitations of the study, the data generated are potentially more generalizable to clinical practice in a range of settings than investigations that have used a standardized regime and a single, highly skilled injector.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511432016">15</xref></sup></p>
