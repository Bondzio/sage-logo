<abstract>
<p>Policies delegating control of educational policy to the local level are widespread, yet there has been little examination of the effects of such distributed decision making in the area of advanced education programming. We used propensity score matching to examine the effectiveness of locally developed policies for identifying intellectually gifted children identifying themselves as Black or from low-socioeconomic backgrounds across one large U.S. state (Florida) that has a state-level gifted education mandate. Ongoing underrepresentation of traditionally marginalized groups in gifted education was evident, even among districts with policies specifically designed to ameliorate disproportional representation. However, the presence of such a policy reduced the degree of underrepresentation.</p>

Despite long-standing concerns about the underrepresentation of African American learners, students from low-socioeconomic (SES) backgrounds, and English learners, information about the impact of policy changes related to underrepresentation remains scarce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1932202X12463511">Baldwin, 1978</xref>). Consequently, there is little guidance available to inform decision makers at the state and district level in their efforts to address these long-standing trends in gifted program representation rates.</p>
<p>There is a paucity of literature examining policy issues in gifted education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1932202X12463511">Dai, Swanson, &amp; Cheng, 2011</xref>), though policy efforts and their implementation have been recognized as critical to the underrepresentation dialogue for decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1932202X12463511">Russo, Harris, &amp; Ford, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1932202X12463511">VanTassel-Baska, 2003</xref>).

S. Matthews &amp; Shaunessy, 2010</xref>) or evaluated systematically the outcomes of policy implementation at any level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1932202X12463511">Baker &amp; Friedman-Nimz, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Limited English Proficient (LEP) Learners in Gifted Education and Advanced Academics</title>
<p>In U.S. schools, speakers of languages other than English are overrepresented in classes for the learning disabled, disordered, and educable mentally retarded, and underrepresented in classes for the gifted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1932202X12463511">Oller, Kim, &amp; Choe, 2000</xref>). Much of the difficulty in identifying students categorized as LEP to receive gifted program services is likely due to testing issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1932202X12463511">Gonzalez, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1932202X12463511">Valdés &amp; Figueroa, 1994</xref>). Although best practices for testing learners from linguistically diverse backgrounds have been disseminated for at least a decade (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1932202X12463511">Joint Committee, 1999</xref>), these often are not followed in practice, or data collection practices limit the analyses that can be performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1932202X12463511">M. S. Matthews &amp; Kirsch, 2011</xref>). Some possible reasons for schools’ failure to follow best practices in assessment of linguistically diverse learners might include limitations in staff expertise, the low availability of published measures with satisfactory norms in other languages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1932202X12463511">Solano-Flores &amp; Li, 2006</xref>), and concerns about what to do with these learners in the gifted classroom setting if they were to be identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1932202X12463511">Golden, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1932202X12463511">Kogan, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Although nonverbal measures such as the <italic>Test of Nonverbal Intelligence</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1932202X12463511">Brown, Sherbenou, &amp; Johnsen, 1997</xref>) have been widely recommended for the purpose of assessing linguistically diverse learners for gifted program placement, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1932202X12463511">Oller and colleagues (2000)</xref> note that “primary (native) language skills have been regarded as central to intellectual abilities by mental measurement specialists from the beginning” (p. 343). These authors contend that the culture-fair, language-independent nature of nonverbal tests has been overrated. They question the adequacy of pantomimed instructions to complex tasks, and they note the existence of an experimentally verified link between verbal (linguistic and semantic) concepts and complex nonverbal tasks, suggesting that these may be more closely related than is commonly believed.</p>
<p>In addition to calls for new assessment measures, other authors have argued for different conceptualizations of what giftedness is and how it should be assessed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1932202X12463511">Bernal and Reyna (1974)</xref> developed the first instrument for identifying gifted learners of Mexican American heritage, and various authors have proposed connecting language education with gifted education to serve bilingual youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1932202X12463511">Castellano &amp; Pinkos, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1932202X12463511">M.

Matthews &amp; Matthews, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1932202X12463511">Valdés (2003)</xref> has built a compelling case for interpretation as a marker of gifted ability among immigrant youth. To date, the assimilation of these efforts into educational practice generally has not been widespread.</p>

<title>Low-SES Learners in Gifted Education and Advanced Academics</title>
<p>Although the attention devoted to gifted learners from low-SES environments has grown dramatically in the last two decades (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1932202X12463511">Borland &amp; Wright, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1932202X12463511">L. Coleman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1932202X12463511">Frasier, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1932202X12463511">Shaunessy, Karnes, &amp; Cobb, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1932202X12463511">Swanson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1932202X12463511">VanTassel-Baska &amp; Stambaugh, 2007</xref>), much of the scholarly attention in gifted education remains focused on racial and ethnic differences. As with other areas of gifted education research, most attention in this area has focused on assessment and identification issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1932202X12463511">Shaunessy et al., 2004</xref>), student characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1932202X12463511">Frasier, 1991</xref>), and programming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1932202X12463511">L. Coleman, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>We suggest that although the idea may be unpopular in some settings, it has long been known that much of the variation ascribed to race or ethnicity also can be accounted for by (or covaries with) SES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1932202X12463511">J. S. Coleman et al., 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1932202X12463511">Schultz, 1993</xref>). Therefore, researchers must devote more attention to SES in seeking to explain observed variation in educational outcomes. Because of the high correlation between race/ethnicity and SES, educational policies that successfully increase the number of low-SES learners who receive gifted services will also increase the number of racially and ethnically diverse learners in these programs, unless systematic biases exist against the inclusion of specific racial or ethnic groups. It should also be noted that at the secondary level, participation by all groups in advanced academics (in the form of Advanced Placement (AP) coursework) has grown dramatically in recent years. However, despite the growth in participation in AP coursework, disparities remain evident across racial and ethnic groups in terms of pass rates on the AP exams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1932202X12463511">College Board, 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Black Learners in Gifted Education and Advanced Academics</title>
<p>A relatively large literature base has developed over recent decades about African American (or Black; we use both terms interchangeably for consistency with the literature) learners in academically advanced or gifted education settings. This literature often has been nonempirical or descriptive in approach, and has focused primarily on identification, assessment, and recruitment issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1932202X12463511">Ford &amp; Whiting, 2011</xref>), though it also has drawn valuable insights about affective issues from research in general education settings. Among these insights have been the issue of “acting White” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1932202X12463511">Fordham &amp; Ogbu, 1986</xref>), Ogbu’s theory of voluntary and involuntary minorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1932202X12463511">Ogbu &amp; Simons, 1998</xref>), multicultural education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1932202X12463511">Banks, 1995</xref>), racial identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1932202X12463511">Cross, 1995</xref>), stereotype threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1932202X12463511">Steele, 1997</xref>), and cultural awareness, sensitivity, and competency (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1932202X12463511">Ford, Moore, Whiting, &amp; Grantham, 2008</xref>). Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1932202X12463511">Ford and Whiting (2011)</xref> also have suggested that peer pressure and gender are important factors for research and practice to consider. Some study also has focused on the experiences of Black students who are successful in advanced academic settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1932202X12463511">Grantham, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1932202X12463511">O’Connor, Mueller, Lewis, Rivas-Drake, &amp; Rosenberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1932202X12463511">Whiting, 2006</xref>). Little research appears to have evaluated the impact of policy on the representation of these learners in gifted or advanced academic programming.</p>

<title>Policy Studies and Underrepresentation</title>
<p>Standardized testing, and intelligence testing in particular, often are assigned the blame for disproportional representation in exceptional student education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1932202X12463511">Flynn, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1932202X12463511">Gallagher, 2007</xref>). However, we concur with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1932202X12463511">Callahan (2005)</xref> that in addition to assessment and identification issues, educational policies enacted by states and districts also make an important contribution to the observed rates of representation of different groups in programs for academically advanced learners.</p>
<p>There has been substantially more attention devoted to assessment, identification, and other issues than to educational policy in the gifted education literature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1932202X12463511">Ziegler and Raul (2000)</xref> examined all 90 of the empirical studies published in five gifted education journals in 1997 and 1998. They grouped these publications thematically, finding a minority of articles concerning program evaluation (5.6%), environment (6.7%), and neuropsychological aspects of giftedness (one study, 1.1%). The majority of articles analyzed fell into the broad areas of achievement (14.4%) or personality (32.2%), or treated more than one of these specific themes (40%). None of the studies analyzed by Ziegler and Raul were specifically focused on educational policy.</p>
<p>There have been a handful of policy-related studies published that relate specifically to gifted education. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1932202X12463511">Baker and Friedman-Nimz (2004)</xref> analyzed states’ distributions of funding and opportunities for gifted learners in relation to their schools’ enrollment rates of low-income learners. These authors found that states with greater involvement (i.e., those having mandates and funding for gifted education) in gifted education, in general, were more likely to have funding policies that awarded more aid to schools with fewer low-income students.</p>
<p>Calls for using results of research to inform educational policy have increased in recent years, in the United States as well as in other countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1932202X12463511">Whitty, 2006</xref>). However, lawmakers may respond to other forces in preference to evidence-based practices, making it difficult in practice to connect these two realms.</p>

<title>National and State Efforts to Address Underrepresented Populations</title>
<p>Since at least the early 1980s, equitable inclusion of diverse populations in advanced academics programming has been underscored as an educational challenge in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1932202X12463511">Frasier, 1991</xref>). In the 1990s, a national report lamented how children from impoverished, disadvantaged, and minority backgrounds continued to be overlooked in programs for the gifted, and reminded readers that “outstanding talents are present in children and youth from all cultural groups, across all economic strata, and in all areas of human endeavor” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1932202X12463511">U.S. Department of Education, 1993</xref>). This landmark work addressed the shortcomings of American schools in educating the gifted and talented, emphasizing how the needs of children of color, economically challenged, and English language learners (ELLs) remain largely neglected. National efforts to address the educational needs of “traditionally underserved groups in gifted education including economically disadvantaged, [and] limited English proficient (LEP) [students]” have—until recently—been funded through the Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Students Act of 1988 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1932202X12463511">U.S. Department of Education, 2007</xref>, p. 7). Despite the significance these federal funds had in supporting research to increase the participation of underrepresented groups, the National Research Council (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1932202X12463511">Committee on Minority Representation, 2002</xref>) reported that differences between the proportions of culturally diverse students identified for participation in gifted and talented programs and those of the majority population remained substantial.</p>

<title>Policy Efforts to Increase Participation by Special Populations in Florida</title>
<p>Gifted education for intellectually gifted students was mandated in Florida beginning in 1975 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1932202X12463511">Florida Department of Education [FL DOE], 2010</xref>), and in 1977, the Florida Administrative Code outlined eligibility criteria for gifted program services for students in Grades K-12 who (a) demonstrate program need, (b) exhibit the majority of characteristics of gifted learners according to a checklist, and (c) score 130 or above on an individually administered IQ test. An addendum to the Florida Statute in 1991 allowed districts the option of establishing local alternative identification plans targeting underrepresented groups (a definition that includes students from low-SES families, classified as “Limited English Proficient,” or from “racial/ethnic backgrounds . . . other than white non-Hispanic”; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1932202X12463511">Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability [OPPAGA], 1996</xref>, p. 2).</p>
<p>In 2002, racial/ethnic background was no longer included as a population targeted in the alternative plan policy, though students other than White non-Hispanic remained underrepresented in programs for the gifted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1932202X12463511">M. S. Matthews &amp; Shaunessy, 2010</xref>). The alternate identification provision in the state rule specifies that such plans must be approved by the State Department of Education and include “evaluation procedures to document the minimum evaluation requirements” (FL DOE, p. 6); no additional specifications for the development of alternative plans or specific criteria, approaches, instruments, or procedures are indicated as required elements of the optional alternative identification plan.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1932202X12463511">
<title>Aims of the Current Study</title>
<p>In this study, we considered the implementation of an alternative identification policy designed specifically to increase the representation of students historically underrepresented in Florida. This investigation helps address the need for policy research in gifted identification, as identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1932202X12463511">Baker and Friedman-Nimz (2004)</xref>. Specifically, we examined the outcomes of district-level policies from Florida, which under state law were permitted for the purpose of increasing the representation of these students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1932202X12463511">FL DOE, 1998</xref>, p. 1).</p>
<p>Due to their numbering in state law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1932202X12463511">Florida Department of State, 2007</xref>), these alternative gifted identification procedures colloquially have become known as “Plan B” policies since becoming a part of Florida law in 1991 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1932202X12463511">OPPAGA, 1996</xref>), and this name has persisted through these plans’ subsequent modification in 2002. This study explored the relationship between having a Plan B document and the relative rate of representation of students identifying themselves as Black and students from low-SES families in gifted education programming. We hoped to determine whether the existence of a Plan B document as used in Florida schools positively affects representation of two historically underrepresented populations in gifted education.</p>
<p>In the first phase of our twofold study, we retrieved 42 district plans (out of the 46 developed) within a state with 67 school districts. As reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1932202X12463511">M. S. Matthews and Shaunessy (2010)</xref>, the quality of these alternative plans was evaluated according to national benchmarks for quality of the identification process described in the NAGC’s PreK-Grade 12 Gifted Program Standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1932202X12463511">Landrum, Callahan, &amp; Shaklee, 2001</xref>, p. vii). In this article, in the second phase of the investigation, we examine the relationships between rates of identification for students addressed in the state’s current underrepresentation policy (students from low-SES families) and one population of students formerly included in the policy (Black students) to determine the effectiveness of the policies in increasing the representation of these respective groups, both of which have been underrepresented in Florida and in gifted education programming across the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1932202X12463511">Pierce et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1932202X12463511">Yoon &amp; Gentry, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Data Sources</title>
<p>As detailed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1932202X12463511">M. S. Matthews and Shaunessy (2010)</xref>, the FL DOE provided information about the number of districts with a 2005-2006 Plan B policy; state records indicated 46 of the 67 districts had such plans. Copies of 42 alternate plans approved by the FL DOE for the 2005-2006 year were obtained directly from the districts. Plans for the other four districts were determined to be unavailable.</p>
<sec id="section11-1932202X12463511">
<title>Local education agency (LEA) profiles</title>
<p>District-level enrollment rates in general education and gifted education were obtained from the FL DOE website as public records. These LEA Profiles included the percentage of PreK-12 students identified as intellectually gifted in each district, as well as the number of students overall, disaggregated by race/ethnicity, free- or reduced-price lunch (FRL) eligibility, and ELL status. We retrieved profiles for all 67 districts in the state for the academic year 2005-2006, regardless of whether districts reported having a Plan B.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>In keeping with the process documented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1932202X12463511">Donovan and Cross (2002)</xref> in their analysis of minority learners in programs for students with exceptionalities (including students identified as academically gifted), we calculated odds ratios to relate the proportion of students receiving gifted education services to the representation of the same student groups in the overall school population with respect to race, SES, and linguistic background. To facilitate additional analyses using these data, we transformed the odds ratios using a logarithmic conversion (natural log) to correct for non-normality.</p>
<sec id="section13-1932202X12463511">
<title>Propensity score matching (PSM)</title>
<p>PSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1932202X12463511">Guo &amp; Fraser, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1932202X12463511">Rosenbaum &amp; Rubin, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1932202X12463511">1984</xref>) was utilized to measure the effects of Plan B policy implementation. PSM is a technique that allows for the estimation of causal effects in observational (i.e., nonexperimental) designs when certain restrictive assumptions are met. Its chief advantages over linear regression are that the estimation of the causal effect does not rely on assumptions regarding the functional form (typically linear) of the relationships between covariates and the outcome, and that inference is only provided within a region of common support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1932202X12463511">Stuart, 2010</xref>) wherein similar treated and control cases are found. PSM results in unbiased causal estimates when the assumption of ignorability (Stuart) is met, meaning that the entire set of selection variables is measured and included in the propensity score model. This is similar to controlling for all relevant covariates in a linear regression model. When the ignorability assumption is satisfied, selection into treatment is a random process conditional on the selection variables. In such a case, the observational study resembles a randomized study in which each participant has a (potentially) different but known probability of being treated. The advantage of PSM over linear regression is that the PSM model does not require that the selection model be correctly specified with respect to functional form to yield unbiased estimates of treatment effects.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1932202X12463511">
<title>Considerations in using PSM</title>
<p>There are many different ways of using PSM methods. Propensity scores can be used as weights (so-called inverse probability of treatment weights; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1932202X12463511">Stuart, 2010</xref>), for matching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1932202X12463511">Guo, Barth, &amp; Gibbons, 2006</xref>), or to form strata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1932202X12463511">Rosenbaum &amp; Rubin, 1984</xref>). Furthermore, there are many methods of matching, including nearest neighbor matching, full matching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1932202X12463511">Stuart &amp; Green, 2008</xref>), kernel matching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1932202X12463511">Heckman, Ichimura, &amp; Todd, 1998</xref>), and others. Little methodological work has compared results from different PSM approaches. Therefore, it is wise for researchers to use multiple methods of PSM as a sensitivity check to ensure that the obtained results are insensitive to the specific PSM method chosen. This analysis was performed using uniform kernel density matching with a bandwidth parameter of 0.2 and with one-to-one nearest neighbor matching with a caliper of 0.2. These moderately restrictive choices for bandwidth and caliper ensured that treated and control cases who differ on the log-odds scale propensity score by more than 0.2 could not be matched together, thus ensuring that matched cases meet a minimum standard of similarity on the propensity score. Recent methodological work has shown that causal effects estimated in PSM may be biased when mismatches occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1932202X12463511">Abadie &amp; Imbens, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1932202X12463511">Field &amp; McBee, 2011</xref>). Standard errors in both cases were computed using bias-corrected accelerated bootstrap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1932202X12463511">Efron, 1987</xref>) with 1,000 repetitions to account for uncertainty in the propensity score as well as sampling error.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1932202X12463511">
<title>Computation</title>
<p>Propensity scores were computed using logistic regression to predict which districts would have a Plan B policy. The selection variables in the propensity score model included the district population, the proportion of residents in the district aged 5 to 17, the proportion of 5- to 17-year-olds living in poverty, the median household income, and the district high school graduation rate. Data on selection variables were collected either from the 2005 American Community Survey or from reports made to FL DOE by the school districts themselves.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Results are organized as follows. First, the results from the logistic regression analysis from which the propensity scores were computed will be presented. Next, covariate balance statistics from the kernel density and nearest neighbor matching procedures will be shown. Because of the nature of bootstrapping, wherein many different subsamples with replacement were drawn from the original sample, there is some ambiguity regarding which bootstrapped repetition should be presented. Therefore, the logistic regression and balance statistics will be presented from the full sample with the accompanying asymptotic theory-based standard errors. Furthermore, Rubin and others have argued that significance tests are inappropriately sensitive to sample size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1932202X12463511">Rubin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1932202X12463511">Stuart, 2010</xref>) for assessing covariate balance after matching, so Rubin’s standardized bias statistics will be presented instead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1932202X12463511">Rubin, 2001</xref>). The bias statistic is a very simple computation of the percentage difference in means between the treatment and control groups before and after matching. This number can sometimes inflate very small absolute differences in means. Finally, estimates of the average treatment effect for the treated (ATT) and the overall average treatment effect (ATE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1932202X12463511">Guo &amp; Fraser, 2010</xref>), along with their bootstrapped standard errors and hypothesis tests, will be provided.</p>
<sec id="section17-1932202X12463511">
<title>Logistic Regression Results</title>
<p>Logistic regression was used to compute the propensity scores by regressing treatment assignment status on the selection variables. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1932202X12463511">Table 1</xref> provides the results from the logistic regression analysis. Only the population variable reached statistical significance in the logistic regression, but the presence or absence of statistical significance is not a valid test of whether a variable belongs in the selection equation. The fundamental test for the propensity score model is the extent to which matching on or weighing by the estimated propensity score yields balance on the selection variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1932202X12463511">Stuart, 2010</xref>). The overall model correctly classified 76.67% of districts as having adopted a Plan B policy or not. Following model fitting, propensity scores (model-implied probabilities of treatment) on the log-odds scale were saved for matching.</p>

<title>Matching and Covariate Balancing</title>
<p>Next, treated and control districts were matched to one another on the basis of the estimated propensity scores. Two matching algorithms were used. Uniform kernel matching was the first algorithm selected. Kernel matching involves the construction of “virtual” counterfactuals by taking a weighted mean of cases lying within some distance (the bandwidth) of the case to be matched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1932202X12463511">Heckman et al., 1998</xref>). The uniform kernel means that all cases falling within the bandwidth are equally weighted. The bandwidth was specified to be .2 units on the log odds scale of the propensity score, which was determined to yield good covariate balance while resulting in a relatively large number of matched cases. All 55 of the districts were successfully matched via this procedure.</p>
<p>The other matching procedure was one-to-one nearest neighbor matching without replacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1932202X12463511">Guo et al., 2006</xref>), which is the most intuitive procedure because it matches each treated case with the most similar remaining control case. Each case can be used only once. Because cases can only be matched once, the distance between matched cases tends to increase as the procedure continues because fewer cases are available for matching. Therefore, it has been recommended to sort the cases into a random order before using nearest neighbor matching to ensure that the matching precision does not vary systematically with covariates. Furthermore, a caliper of .20 was enforced for matching, meaning that cases separated by more than .20 units on the propensity score could not be matched with one another even if they were the optimal remaining matches. This criterion resulted in 53 of 55 cases being used in the analysis. Balance statistics for the two approaches are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1932202X12463511">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1932202X12463511">3</xref>. An examination of the tables reveals that both procedures resulted in a close balancing of the covariates between Plan B and non-Plan B districts.</p>

<title>Treatment Effect Estimates</title>
<p>The final step was to compute estimates for the treatment effects. Two treatment effects were estimated: the ATT and ATE. The two estimates answer slightly different questions, so we report both here. The ATT describes the difference in potential outcomes between the districts that had Plan B policies versus the outcome that those districts would have obtained without the policies. In other words, the ATT is an estimate of the benefit of the Plan B policy for the districts that have the policy. The ATE is an estimate of the marginal effect of treatment; in other words, it provides an estimate of the expected change in the representation ratios of students receiving FRL and Black students for a randomly selected district adopting a Plan B policy. The ATE is similar to the typical treatment effects estimated in randomized studies. Treatment effect estimates are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1932202X12463511">Table 4</xref>.</p>

<p>All estimates of the treatment effects for the Black and FRL outcomes are statistically significant according to the bootstrapped significance tests. The point estimates are very similar across the two approaches, providing strong evidence that our treatment effect estimates are relatively robust to the choice of matching method. The standard errors for nearest neighbor matching are slightly smaller, indicating that this approach was more efficient. For the FRL outcome, the odds ratio for the ATE was about 2.03, indicating that if a randomly selected school were to adopt Plan B, the identification probability for FRL students would be expected to double. The odds ratio for the ATT was 1.95, again pointing to a near-doubling of the probability of identification for FRL students in schools that had actually adopted Plan B. The close similarity of the ATE and ATT treatment effects suggests that the no special characteristics of the schools that adopted the plan rendered the plan especially effective in that school; in other words, that Plan B could be expected to be equally effective for all schools.</p>
<p>For the Black outcome, the odds ratio for the ATE was 1.65, whereas the odds ratio for the ATT was 1.69, pointing to an approximate two thirds increase in the probability of identification for Black students in school districts with Plan B policies. Although Black students do not appear to have benefited from the Plan B policy quite as much as FRL students in general, it is important to note that we have not conducted statistical tests comparing the differences in treatment effects.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The philosophy of local control is deeply entrenched in educational practice in the United States, and this is especially true in the area of gifted education given the lack of a federal mandate for these services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1932202X12463511">Brown et al., 2006</xref>). This state’s practice of permissive alternate identification policies for students historically underrepresented in gifted education has apparently benefitted the group currently mentioned in the state’s policy—students from low-SES backgrounds—as well as learners who identify themselves as Black, even though they were no longer included in the state’s Plan B policy language. Districts that developed these alternative policies demonstrated a higher rate of identification of both of these special populations in programs for gifted education. Our work represents one of the first policy papers to have identified such a relationship, and as such it provides initial support for the development of such alternative pathways for the identification of underrepresented learners. Our results also seems consistent with findings about gifted programming in general, where <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1932202X12463511">Baker and Friedman-Nimz (2004)</xref> have documented that program mandates and funding are effective in producing additional opportunities for gifted children.</p>
<p>Strikingly, although Black students had not been included in the state’s policy between 2002 and 2006, these findings suggest that alternative plans designed to benefit students from low-SES households also were beneficial in districts’ efforts to address racial/ethnic disparities among Black students. Although much attention in gifted education has focused on identification and on minority learners (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1932202X12463511">Ford, Grantham, &amp; Whiting, 2008</xref>), these efforts have suggested deficit thinking by teachers as the primary underlying cause of underrepresentation in gifted programming. Although teacher perceptions likely do make an important contribution to the underrepresentation of specific groups in gifted education settings, we suggest that the development of effective policies should be the first step states and districts take in their efforts to promote equitable participation in gifted programming.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, data for other racial/ethnic groups in the present study proved insufficient to allow analysis. Specifically, the practice of masking data for groups having representation rates below 5% or above 95% resulted in the loss of large amounts of data related to less prevalent populations such as gifted ELLs and gifted American Indian students. As our findings suggest that policies designed to benefit one broadly construed category (i.e., students from low-SES households) also were beneficial for Black students, it seems reasonable to infer that other historically underrepresented populations may also benefit in the absence of a policy addressing each specific racial/ethnic group in isolation.</p>
<sec id="section21-1932202X12463511">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>There are multiple limitations to the present study, perhaps the most important of which is a lack of knowledge about the fidelity of implementation of these procedures at the school and classroom levels. Although potentially serious, it is also possible that the locally developed nature of these plans may have resulted in better fidelity than a state-imposed, uniform policy would have yielded; teacher perceptions of control and their relationship to fidelity of implementation of local and state-level policies would be a relevant topic for future study. In addition, it remains unclear whether the less effective policies we observed may have been constructed intentionally to be ineffective, rather than simply being planned poorly or with insufficient resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1932202X12463511">M. S. Matthews &amp; Shaunessy, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Methodologically, the study also has important limitations. The use of PSM procedures provides some protection against the consequences of violating the assumptions invoked when the typical covariate adjustment via linear regression is used to adjust estimates for imbalance on confounding variables. Although this protection may result in causal estimates that are “less wrong” than what would be obtained otherwise, the degree to which the estimates represent the true causal effects of the policy depends on whether the assumption of ignorability was satisfied; because there is no statistical test of ignorability, the presence of it must be argued on theoretical or logical grounds. In this case, the relatively small set of selection variables included in our model must surely omit one or more potential confounders. We hope that any omitted variables would at least be correlated with variables that are already included in the model, so those variables would contribute little unique information and therefore result in little change in the matched districts.</p>
<p>A further limitation of the study relates to the small sample size. There are several reasons why large sample sizes are preferred in PSM: Larger samples improve the performance of the logistic regression used to generate the propensity scores, larger samples tend to result in closer matches between treated and control participants (as more are available), and of course larger samples result in smaller standard errors and tighter confidence intervals around treatment effect estimates. Although our PSM performed well according to all the criteria we examined, a larger sample would certainly have been preferred.</p>
<p>Finally, our study represents only a cross-sectional “snapshot” of a dynamic system, where events, policies, and organizational cultures developed in prior years certainly affect the policies and performances of districts in the 2005 year examined in the study. Unfortunately, we found that record-keeping was insufficient to allow us to conduct a more sophisticated longitudinal analysis or a more nuanced analysis of the procedures implemented among districts with Plan B documents. We hope to identify states or groups of school districts with more systematic, detailed record-keeping for future efforts.</p>

<title>Implications for Future Research</title>
<p>The effects of policy decisions at state and local levels are under greater scrutiny as accountability efforts increase and policy makers continue efforts to understand the return on education spending provided by investments such as funding for gifted programming. To provide stakeholders with accurate, meaningful data about policy efforts in gifted education, more attention is needed in detailing local efforts to identify and serve underrepresented populations. Although the current study provides an initial understanding of one state’s policy initiatives to increase the representation of gifted learners from underserved populations, much more information is needed to guide more complex and nuanced understandings. Such efforts might include investigations of specific efforts to increase representation, including information such as whether districts had a full-time gifted coordinator, the educational training and years of experience of the gifted coordinator, the type of assessment approaches included in the alternative efforts (i.e., portfolios, performance tasks, nonverbal measures), and other data that may inform efforts to understand educational practice in this area.</p>
<p>Consideration of efforts by districts in Florida to increase representation should be specified in the state’s regulations for evaluation of gifted programs, which, although optional at present, should be required in reporting of efforts for districts electing to develop a Plan B policy. A more detailed accounting of steps taken to reduce underrepresentation can assist stakeholders in understanding the effectiveness of specific efforts beyond simply having developed an alternate identification plan. As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1932202X12463511">Brown et al. (2006</xref>, p. 12), “mandates matter”; likewise, accountability of and reporting about policy implementation also matters if stakeholders are to discern the effectiveness of policy in practice.</p>
