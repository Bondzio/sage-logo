<p>Taxonomies of psychological and emotional disorder have long grappled with distress emanating from exposure to traumatic life events. There are numerous scholarly exchanges and commentaries on what exactly constitutes a “trauma” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145445512452201">Weathers &amp; Keane, 2007</xref>), whether specific traumatic events warrant separate diagnoses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145445512452201">Rix, 2000</xref>), and how trauma-related disorders should be categorized relative to other recognized disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145445512452201">Friedman et al., 2011</xref>). It appears that the psychiatric clinical research community is on the verge of yet another momentous shift in how traumagenic distress is understood, discussed, and treated. Proposed changes in the forthcoming edition of the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (5th ed.) include removing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from its current status as an anxiety disorder and grouping it with a number of other event-precipitated variants of disorder in a newly established category—trauma and stressor-related disorders. Accordingly, we deemed this to be a particularly important time to consider emerging conceptualizations of posttraumatic pathology and innovative approaches to treatment. Although fear and anxiety-based responses to trauma—and their corresponding exposure-based treatment approaches—are certainly apt and generally appropriate, there is increasing recognition that trauma can produce much more varied symptom manifestations that may require alternative treatment approaches (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145445512452201">Litz et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, we edited this special issue of <italic>Behavior Modification</italic> to reflect emerging, novel conceptualizations and treatment approaches for psychological trauma.</p>
<p>Several articles in this issue were selected because they, collectively, address the diverse phenomenology and etiology of traumatic distress that is oft-overlooked by a monolithic focus on anxiety symptoms. It is an oversimplification, for instance, to assume that the numerous and severe experiences associated with combat invariably result in PTSD when disordered functioning occurs. Stein and colleagues (2012 [this issue]) propose a schematic for categorizing the diverse forms of combat exposure. Certainly, life threat in the context of combat can and typically does evoke fear and sustained anxiety, and this is amply documented. But, what of traumatic loss and grief, or participation in or witnessing atrocity? As this contribution illustrates, these experiences can be reliably and empirically differentiated from one another, and, importantly, they appear to be associated with different emotional consequences.</p>
<p>Reflecting the dimensionality of traumatic stress, Steenkamp and colleagues (2012 [this issue]) apply latent class analysis to the clinical interview sample of the National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Study and demonstrate that a substantial portion of trauma-exposed individuals do not develop diagnosable PTSD but still have sufficient persistent symptoms that cause significant distress and functional impairment. Their analyses replicate prior research showing that three groups result from trauma exposure: a group with pervasive symptoms, with all members meeting PTSD diagnosis; a group with intermediate symptoms; with a significant fraction of members meeting diagnosis; and a group with few symptoms and no diagnoses. This work also extends prior empirical findings by demonstrating that symptom presentation associated with these latent classes varies.</p>
<p>Because of the nearly singular focus on anxiety symptoms following traumatic event exposure, etiological models and corresponding treatments for PTSD generally highlight reexperiencing and avoidance symptoms. Although dysphoria and numbing symptoms are included in PTSD diagnostic criteria, they have, until fairly recently, garnered much less empirical scrutiny and conceptual attention. As reviewed by Hassija and colleagues (2012 [this issue]), a number of recent investigations of Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans show that these symptomatic manifestations of trauma are associated with significant psychosocial and physical health impairments. As noted, these symptoms call for additional treatment focus, including but not limited to behavioral activation, interpersonal functioning, and emotion regulation skill development. These approaches are not, of course, incompatible with conventional exposure-based therapy, and yet they rarely appear in the clinical treatment literature. This contribution serves to advance more nuanced treatment planning for combat veterans. Finally, from a conceptualization standpoint, Nosen and colleagues provide an elegant laboratory study depicting the interplay between trauma-related affect and alcohol craving in an alcohol-dependent, treatment-seeking population. This investigation underscores the bidirectional relationship between PTSD and substance use disorders, and helps explain the role of positive and negative affective processes that contribute to this relationship.</p>
<p>In terms of treatment advances, Ariel Lang and colleagues provide a review and provocative case for the use of meditation to address trauma-related distress. As noted in this contribution, frontline treatments are sometimes not effective or well-received by patients, and attrition is common, as well. Thus, there is a need to identify or develop alternative treatment approaches. This article addresses likely mechanisms of action for meditation—based on the relevant etiology of PTSD—reviews promising empirical support for meditative approaches, and delineates an agenda for future research efforts.</p>
<p>The final two contributions speaking to treatment advances provide creative solutions for connecting clients with evidence-based treatments. Bragdon and Lombardo (this issue) show that written exposure-based therapy for PTSD can be effective even when utilized with complex populations (i.e., comorbid PTSD and substance use disorder patients). Symptom improvements resulting from a written disclosure intervention were significant and maintained some time after the intervention. As these authors note, given that this exposure-based treatment requires very minimal therapist contact, it is arguably a highly cost-effective treatment option. Finally, Paul and colleagues (2012 [this issue]) review technological advances that hold tremendous promise in connecting underserved populations with state-of-the-art treatments that are otherwise unavailable to them. Specifically, telemedicine, virtual reality, and Internet-delivered treatments are all capable of bridging the divide that has historically prevented best practice treatments from reaching rural and/or indigent populations. These systems for delivering existing interventions will surely become more prominent and widespread in years to come.</p>
<p>In sum, although excellent treatments exist for PTSD, there is still ample room for improvement where treatment efficacy and availability is concerned. Furthermore, there are increasingly recognized variants of posttraumatic distress that are not adequately captured by anxiety and fear-based conceptualizations, and accordingly, they are not optimally treated using conventional exposure-based approaches. Our hope is that the articles collected for this issue serve to illustrate advances in our understanding of posttraumatic distress and emerging treatment approaches that should ultimately identify and then return more PTSD victims to pretrauma functioning.</p>
