<p>Teen dating violence (TDV) is a pervasive public health problem that includes physical, emotional, or sexual abuse and stalking and can occur in person or through electronic communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078390313484801">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011</xref>). Physical dating violence is experienced by an estimated 9.4% of teens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078390313484801">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011</xref>), and psychological dating violence is experienced by nearly 30% of teens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078390313484801">Halpern, Oslak, Young, Martin, &amp; Kupper, 2001</xref>). In one study, more than half the teens receiving care in a pediatric emergency department were found to have a history of TDV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078390313484801">Carroll, Raj, Noel, &amp; Bauchner, 2011</xref>). Exposure to TDV has negative mental health implications, including depression, lower scholastic achievement, and suicidal ideation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078390313484801">Banyard &amp; Cross, 2008</xref>). Additionally, teens in dating violence relationships are more likely to engage in risky behaviors, including substance abuse, unhealthy eating patterns, high-risk sexual activities, and physical altercations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078390313484801">Ackard, Eisenberg, &amp; Neumark-Sztainer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1078390313484801">Silverman, Raj, Mucci, &amp; Hathaway, 2001</xref>). Furthermore, researchers have shown that TDV is linked to adult intimate partner violence (IPV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078390313484801">Black et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Ending Violent Dating Relationships</title>
<p>Despite the fact that TDV is linked to numerous negative health outcomes, the majority of adolescents do not seek help if they are in a violent relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078390313484801">Ashley &amp; Foshee, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078390313484801">Carroll et al., 2011</xref>). In one study, 60% of teen victims and 79% of teen perpetrators reported not seeking help from adults or peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078390313484801">Ashley &amp; Foshee, 2005</xref>). Researchers have identified a number of barriers to teens’ help seeking. They often do not believe that help is needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078390313484801">Carroll et al., 2011</xref>), are inexperienced with dating relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078390313484801">Connolly &amp; Friedlander, 2009</xref>), view dating violence as the norm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078390313484801">Edwards et al., 2012</xref>), believe that others would not be helpful or would minimize the violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078390313484801">Carroll et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1078390313484801">Weisz, Tolman, Callahan, Saunders, &amp; Black, 2007</xref>), are concerned that disclosing violence would be detrimental to others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078390313484801">Carroll et al., 2011</xref>), are reluctant to reveal bidirectional violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078390313484801">Draucker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1078390313484801">Reeves &amp; Orpinas, 2012</xref>), and fear disapproval of others for allowing the abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078390313484801">Gallopin &amp; Leigh, 2009</xref>), loss of confidentiality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1078390313484801">Noonan &amp; Charles, 2009</xref>), and retaliation by the dating partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1078390313484801">Noonan &amp; Charles, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Although much is known about teens’ reluctance to seek help to manage dating violence, less is known about if or how teens end violent dating relationships in other ways. Adults in helping roles have primarily focused on teaching teens to prevent and/or recognize dating violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078390313484801">Avery-Leaf, Cascardi, O’Leary, &amp; Cano, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078390313484801">Foshee et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1078390313484801">Wolfe et al., 2009</xref>). Most prevention efforts have been directed to all teens primarily in school settings. Two programs, Safe Dates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078390313484801">Foshee et al., 2000</xref>) and The Fourth R: Skills for Youth Relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1078390313484801">Wolfe et al., 2009</xref>) are empirically validated and widely used. All programs focus on developing communication skills and identification of violence in relationships, and most encourage help-seeking behaviors when relationship violence occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1078390313484801">Whitaker et al., 2006</xref>). Although some emphasis has been placed on teaching teens effective methods to end violent relationships safely (see the Expect Respect website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://weexpectrespect.com/Home.html">http://weexpectrespect.com/Home.html</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1078390313484801">Wolfe et al., 2009</xref>), little is known about how teens end violent dating relationships without assistance from others.</p>
<p>Researchers have identified factors that predict if, why, and when women leave abusive relationships. Women experiencing IPV are more likely to leave abusive relationships if they had left a relationship in the past, experienced a violent episode that resulted in the involvement of law enforcement or emergency medical care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1078390313484801">Koepsell, Kernic, &amp; Holt, 2006</xref>), had high self-esteem or internal locus of control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1078390313484801">Kim &amp; Gray, 2008</xref>), or had achieved some level of financial stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078390313484801">Anderson &amp; Saunders, 2003</xref>). Research has shown that the reasons women do not end violent relationships are financial dependence, fears for their safety, and low self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1078390313484801">Kim &amp; Gray, 2008</xref>). Ending abusive relationships is typically a process that evolves over time. Women tend to move from not acknowledging the abuse as problematic to considering leaving when they experienced anger at their partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1078390313484801">Shurman &amp; Rodriquez, 2006</xref>). In addition, research shows that women who successfully leave violent relationships obtain support from community agencies, whereas women who do not obtain these services are less likely to leave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1078390313484801">Koepsell et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, teens who experience dating violence do not usually seek assistance from adults or peers to end the violence. Furthermore, the primary focus of most TDV programs is on the identification and prevention of TDV rather than on the development of strategies to end violent relationships. Factors associated with the ending of abusive relationships by adult women have been identified, but less is known about the processes by which these relationships end. In addition, very little is known about how adolescents end dating relationships that have become violent or abusive.</p>

<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to determine the common ways in which teens end violent dating relationships. The research question was the following:</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The findings reported here represent the final phase of a grounded theory study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078390313484801">Charmaz, 2006</xref>), the purpose of which was to develop a theoretical framework to describe, explain, and predict how TDV begins, unfolds, and ends. In earlier phases of the study, we identified several types of TDV relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078390313484801">Draucker et al., 2012</xref>) and the patterns by which TDV unfolds across the teen years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078390313484801">Martsolf, Draucker, Stephenson, Cook, &amp; Heckman, 2012</xref>). The purpose of the final phase of the study was to determine how they end violent teen dating relationships.</p>
<p>Ninety young adults, 18 to 21 years old, who had experienced TDV when they were 13 to 18 years old, were recruited into the larger study. For the current study, 83 of these participants were included. Seven of the participants in the larger study were excluded in this sample because the recordings of their interviews were inaudible (<italic>n</italic> = 2) or they did not discuss ending dating relationships despite probing by the interviewers (<italic>n</italic> = 5). The sampling area included 12 socioeconomically and ethnically diverse communities in Northeastern Ohio representing urban, suburban, and rural areas. Research associates, trained by the investigators, canvassed the 12 communities and talked with community members, business leaders, church officials, and community leaders to inform them of the project and to enlist their support.</p>
<p>The research team members distributed recruitment flyers throughout each community, announcing a study on TDV. The flyers provided examples of TDV that ranged from occasional put-downs, name calling, emotional abuse, and slapping or hitting to unwanted sexual contact and physical assault. The flyers indicated that individual interviews would be conducted in local community settings by mental health professionals and that participants would receive a $35 incentive at the end of the interview. We included a toll-free number on the flyer for volunteers to contact the researchers. Flyers were placed at businesses, organizations, and facilities frequented by young adults in the 12 communities.</p>
<p>Potential participants called the toll-free number and were screened by the research associates, who were mental health clinicians holding at least a master’s degree. The research associates screened the potential participants for the following inclusion criteria: (a) current age 18 to 21 and (b) experienced TDV between the ages of 13 and 18. The research team developed a screening protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078390313484801">Draucker, Martsolf, &amp; Poole, 2009</xref>) to assess the following exclusion criteria: (a) recent hospitalization for mental health concerns, (b) experiencing significant current stressors, and (c) potential danger if anyone became aware of study participation.</p>
<p>The research associates scheduled interviews in the participants’ communities at places that were convenient and offered private interview space (i.e., meeting rooms in churches, libraries, and social service agencies). Institutional review board approval was obtained from the first author’s university. Participants signed informed consent forms, and the research associates screened them for undue distress before, during, and after the interview (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078390313484801">Draucker et al., 2009</xref>). The research associates began the interviews by posing the following question: “You have indicated that you experienced dating violence as a teen. Would you please tell me about the violence that you experienced?” The researchers did not define <italic>dating violence</italic> beyond the variety of examples provided on the flyer; rather, participants were invited to define and describe the term from their own experiences. Because one aim of the study was to describe how teens end violent dating relationships, the research associates asked the participant to describe how the relationship ended if that information was not provided spontaneously by the participant. Interviews lasted between 60 and 90 minutes and were audiotaped and transcribed.</p>
<p>The research team used grounded theory methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078390313484801">Charmaz, 2006</xref>) to guide the study. Research team members read the transcripts of the interviews with the 83 participants to get a sense of the whole of each narrative. For the results reported here, the third author extracted all text units (sentences, paragraphs, stories) from the narratives in which participants described how they and/or a partner had ended a violent dating relationship. Most participants did not narrate their experiences with TDV in chronological order of events. Rather, text units about how the relationships were ended were interspersed throughout each transcript. The text units varied in length from several sentences to several pages in the transcript.</p>
<p>A total of 156 text units describing how participants ended their violent dating relationships were extracted from the 83 transcripts. The first and third authors independently read the text units, compared and contrasted them within and across transcripts, and grouped them into categories. These team members refined their categorizations until they were able to place each text unit describing a dating relationship ending in only one of six categories. The first and second authors then read the text units about ending the relationships and named and defined the six categories. Finally, the first author recategorized the 156 text units based on the labels and definitions of the categories. The researcher was easily able to place each text unit in a single category, signaling the adequacy of the categorization.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>Eighty-three young adults (48 females, 35 males), 18 to 21 years old, provided data about how they ended their violent dating relationships. The racial composition of this group was 42 Caucasians, 30 African Americans, 8 mixed race, and 3 reported as other. Family-of-origin income was less than $10,000 (<italic>n</italic> = 11), $10,000 to $19,999 (<italic>n</italic> = 7), $20,000 to $49,999 (<italic>n</italic> = 28), $50,000 to $99,999 (<italic>n</italic> = 19), more than $100,000 (<italic>n</italic> = 9), and not reported (<italic>n</italic> = 9).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1078390313484801">
<title>Ways of Breaking Up</title>
<p>Most of the participants referred to ending their violent dating relationships as “breaking up.” Some had multiple breakups in the same relationship, and others had multiple relationships with breakups. Individuals who experienced multiple violent relationships with breakups (<italic>n</italic> = 10) ended each relationship in a different way. The research team found no gender differences in the ways in which teens break up. The team identified six common ways in which teens break up and labeled them as follows: (a) deciding enough is enough; (b) becoming interested in someone else; (c) being on again, off again; (d) fading away; (e) deciding it’s best for both of us; and (f) moving away. The six ways of breaking up are described and illustrated with examples from participant data.</p>
<sec id="section7-1078390313484801">
<title>Deciding Enough Is Enough</title>
<p>Of the 156 text units in which participants described breaking up, 41 were coded as “deciding enough is enough.” Participants described an “aha moment” when they suddenly realized the relationship could no longer continue. Some gained the insight that their dating relationships were abusive, and therefore unhealthy, by listening to the opinions of important peers or adults in their lives. Others indicated that the level or duration of the violence had become intolerable and served as an impetus for them to decide that they had had enough of the violence and therefore the relationship. The types of violence experienced by the participants varied (physical, verbal, emotional, sexual, stalking). Some participants indicated that constant put-downs and frequent disparaging remarks were the impetus for “deciding enough is enough.” Other participants described breaking up after experiencing physical violence necessitating third-party involvement.</p>
<p>One 20-year-old male described the moment when he decided enough was enough. He told his violent partner, “You know what? I’m done. This is, this is over. We’re through.”</p>
<p>Similarly, a 21-year-old female expressed her love for her ex-boyfriend but indicated that she could not continue on in a violent relationship with physical and verbal abuse. She explained, “I love him, but I don’t wanna be with him. I can’t keep going backwards. Enough is enough.”</p>
<p>Another 21-year-old female described deciding enough was enough in response to the following question: “When you finally left, what gave you the strength to leave?”</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I don’t know. I think that I was just tired . . . He wanted me to get up and fix him something to eat, and I didn’t. Then he kicked me in the face and just repeatedly kept kicking me in the face . . . His aunt . . . came down there and tried to get in the middle of it. He was fighting his aunt and his mom. Then, I was just like . . . I believe that you should treat your parents with respect even if y’all differ. Once, I had seen him hit his mom like he did, I realized that I didn’t have anything coming but violence. So, I just left.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1078390313484801">
<title>Becoming Interested in Someone Else</title>
<p>Of the 156 text units in which participants described breaking up, 32 were coded as “becoming interested in someone else.” Participants indicated that their violent dating relationships ended when they or their partner became involved with or attracted to someone else. Several participants had sex with another person as a way of triggering their partners to end the relationship.</p>
<p>A 20-year-old male participant described how his girlfriend neglected him for another guy and subsequently ended the relationship: “And she said something along the lines of ‘I’m more interested in this guy right now. I’m sorry that I didn’t do this earlier.’” A 21-year-old female told the following story:<disp-quote>
<p>I tried to break up with him a couple of times . . . And I told him the last time I tried. I was like “No we’re breaking up because I am 19 years old. I don’t want to be tied down for the rest of my life because there are other guys out there. I don’t know if you are the right guy for me because we have these problems.” He like wouldn’t let me break up with him. So I cheated on him and I told him like within 24 hours.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1078390313484801">
<title>Being on Again, off Again</title>
<p>Of the 156 text units in which participants described breaking up, 24 were coded as “being on again, off again.” Participants described breakups in which the couple ended the relationship only to “get back together” soon after. A number of these breakups were presumed or implied rather than clearly articulated, leaving an opening for an easy reunion. Many participants reported breaking up and getting back together two or more times, and some of these relationships were ongoing at the time of the interview. One participant reported breaking up with her violent boyfriend four times over 2 years of dating: “I finally broke up with him for the last time. I broke up with him over four times. I finally broke up with him for the last time this past summer.” Another 21-year-old female described the recurrent nature of her breakups of her violent dating relationship:<disp-quote>
<p>So like when we broke up I always knew that I was going to get back with him. But I just didn’t know when. Like I broke up with him a couple of times and he broke up with me a couple of times but it was never for like a long time. I’d say like it might be like a week or something like that or maybe like a month. Not too long.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1078390313484801">
<title>Fading Away</title>
<p>Of the 156 text units in which participants described breaking up, 23 were coded as “fading away.” Participants described ways in which they ended the relationship by gradually becoming more and more distant and eventually terminating all contact with their violent partners. In many of these relationships, the participants first stopped face-to-face interactions, then telephone contact by voice or text, and finally contact by e-mail and social media sites. A 19-year-old male participant described ending his violent relationship: “It just kind of ended. I don’t really remember how. It just . . . I didn’t call her no more, she wouldn’t call me no more . . . it just kind of drifted from that point on.” Another 19-year-old male stated, “I didn’t say I’m breaking up with you, I just like cut myself off really.” A 21-year-old female put it this way: “I stopped calling him and I stopped taking his calls. And I stopped telling him that I loved him on the phone.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1078390313484801">
<title>Deciding It’s Best for Us Both</title>
<p>Of the 156 text units in which participants described breaking up, 19 were coded “deciding it’s best for us both.” Participants reported breakups in which one or both partners decided that it was best for their relationships to end. One or both partners decided that they just did not want to be in a relationship, that the relationship was not healthy, that the partners were too young or ill-suited for one another, or that the relationship was not in the best interest of either partner. These breakups demonstrated good judgment on the part of the participants or their partners because they recognized the need to end the relationship, even if violence was not identified as the reason. One male victim described breaking up as being the best for both partners:<disp-quote>
<p>We broke up because I thought it was best for both of us. We just needed to sort out some things. We still stayed in contact though, as friends. I think that we just needed to get to know each other better. We needed to sort out what we really wanted, and all the fights just wasn’t healthy for the relationship.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A 21-year-old female, described breaking up sensibly: “We broke up and we really just realized we really weren’t meant to be together. So it wasn’t a bad break up or anything.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1078390313484801">
<title>Moving Away</title>
<p>Of the 156 text units in which participants described breaking up, 17 were coded as “moving away.” These participants capitalized on a physical separation to end the violent relationship. Many of the relationships occurred among teens in high school, and they used a move away to college as a convenient end to the relationship. A few relationships ended as one partner moved geographically for another reason, such as joining the military, moving into foster care, relocating with their family, or being incarcerated. A 20-year-old female participant indicated she may have gotten back together with her violent partner if he had not dismissed from school for violence: “So, they kicked him out officially and that was the last I heard of him.”</p>
<p>Other participants, however, expressed relief at the opportunity to move in order to find a reason to end the violent relationship. One 20-year-old male reported breaking up with his partner by moving out of the country:<disp-quote>
<p>I said to her . . . Now is the time to make some, you know, big changes about my life. I’m gonna, uh, try to, uh, get to, to the college in the states or to Belgium or to Brussels. . . . I just wanted to avoid unnecessary complications.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A 21-year-old female who described recurrent break ups indicated that the final breakup was accomplished by her departure for college:<disp-quote>
<p>That whole summer where like I told him that I didn’t like how the year went and that we weren’t going to stay together probably. Pretty much at the beginning of the summer I was fed up with him. And he kind of begged me over the summer to still talk to him. So like we went out a couple of times over the summer . . . At that point I had already made up my mind that I was really done with him . . . Then one weekend he came and visited me at my university and I told him that it wasn’t going to work like right then and there. So that was the end of it.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Teen dating behavior, including ending dating relationships, is affected by the developmental changes experienced during the adolescent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078390313484801">Collins, Welsh, &amp; Furman, 2009</xref>). Although teens are developing their sexual identity, they often lack experience with intimate relationships and may view TDV as the norm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078390313484801">Connolly &amp; Friedlander, 2009</xref>). Similarly, although they think more abstractly, their impulse control is underdeveloped until late adolescence. The processes used by adults to end violent intimate relationships, therefore, may not be available to teens. The research team concluded that the six common processes by which teens end violent dating relationships are related, in part, to their development stage.</p>
<p>Some participants listened to the opinions of others to help determine that their dating relationships were not healthy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1078390313484801">Martsolf, Draucker, Bednarz, &amp; Lea, 2011</xref>), but most did not. Some strategies the participants used to end violent dating relationships were sudden, whereas others were prolonged. Some of the strategies showed overall lack of investment in the relationships more generally. Several of the strategies were convenient ways to end the relationship, whereas others were more reasoned. A number of the strategies involved taking action, whereas others were passive.</p>
<p>Our findings are similar to those of other studies that found that teens do not tend to end violent dating relationships with the assistance of adults or peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078390313484801">Ashley &amp; Foshee, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078390313484801">Carroll et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078390313484801">Gallopin &amp; Leigh, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1078390313484801">Noonan &amp; Charles, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1078390313484801">Weisz et al., 2007</xref>). “Deciding that enough is enough” as a way to end TDV is found in the adult IPV literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078390313484801">Edwards et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1078390313484801">Shurman &amp; Rodriquez, 2006</xref>). Our finding that some breakups were often recurrent is similar to the finding of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1078390313484801">Koepsell et al. (2006)</xref> that adult women who experience IPV often leave more than one time. Our finding that some teens use distance to end violent relationships is consistent with findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078390313484801">Edwards et al. (2012)</xref> with female college students who left abusive dating relationships.</p>
<p>The research team identified several limitations to this study. We interviewed young adults who had experienced TDV as teens rather than teens who were currently experiencing TDV. Although interviewing teens would have eliminated the limitation of using retrospective data, it would have created other study limitations because teens younger than 18 would need parental consent to participate and the sample would have been limited to those teens whose parents were aware about the dating violence. Furthermore, we interviewed only one member of the couple and it is possible that differences may have existed between how both members of the couple viewed the end of the relationship. Identifying these differences may have affected the typology by eliminating or expanding some of the ways of breaking up. Although we interviewed young adults in urban, suburban, and rural settings, these interviews were conducted in one geographic region, which may have unique contextual factors affecting teen dating relationships. Finally, most participants did not describe how they ended their violent dating relationships in complete stories. Rather, they tended to narrate how they ended the relationship throughout the interview. Thus, the number of text units coded to each way of breaking up cannot be used to make inferences about the relative frequency with which teens use the six ways to end violent relationships.</p>
<p>Professionals who work with teens who are experiencing dating violence can use the study findings to develop a deeper understanding of the challenges teens face in leaving abusive relationships and how they address these challenges. Although teens use a variety of breakup strategies, some of these strategies may delay the breakup and expose the teens to more negative consequences. Researchers have shown that teens often do not initiate discussions with professionals, parents, or peers about their violent dating relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078390313484801">Ashley &amp; Foshee, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078390313484801">Carroll et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, it is important for professionals to initiate these discussions. In an earlier article, our research team reported findings on ways to effectively engage teens in dating violence prevention and intervention activities from the perspectives of professionals and young adults who experienced TDV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078390313484801">Martsolf, Colbert, &amp; Draucker, 2012</xref>). By facilitating discussion of the challenges and the emotional tolls of “breaking up,” professionals can help teens determine strategies that are feasible for them and in the best interest of their safety and their health.</p>
<p>Conversely, the findings suggest that professionals must respect the degree of willingness of the teens to end abusive relationships and not push them to end relationships when they are not ready to do so. The typology of the six ways of breaking up can be presented to teens as a springboard for discussions about the how teens commonly end violent relationships. Health care professionals, for example, could help teens sort out the challenges, advantages, and disadvantages of each of the “ways” of breaking up given their own unique circumstances. Once the teens decide if and how they wish to end a violent relationship, the professional can assist them in planning how to do so sensibly and safely. Teens might, for example, benefit from role-playing the conversation to initiate the breakup and practice strategies to deal with their partners’ attempts to subvert the breakup. Helping teens consider the possible consequences of breaking up, especially an escalation of the violence, and their experiences of loss, is critical.</p>
<p>The research team identified several areas for future research based on the findings of this study. The typology should be refined and strengthened through a study in which teens in focus groups offer their views on whether the six ways of breaking up accurately reflect their own experiences or those of their peers. Information gathered in focus groups could also be used to refine the descriptions of each of the ways of breaking up. These teens could also contribute information about whether the ways of breaking up are useful to safely end violent relationships. With sufficient refinement of the ways of breaking up typology, researchers could develop a tool to measure the extent to which teens use the six ways of breaking up. A well-developed tool to measure the ways of breaking up could be used to determine whether adolescents use single or multiple ways and whether they use alternative ways to end different violent dating relationships. Researchers could also determine whether the ways of breaking up are salient only for ending violent teen dating relationships or whether they accurately describe how teens end any type of dating relationship. Furthermore, the tool could be used to determine whether certain of the ways of breaking up are correlated with a variety of individual or environmental factors. Finally, researchers could examine whether the different ways of breaking up are predictive of future relational (e.g., recurring violent relationships) or psychological outcomes.</p>
