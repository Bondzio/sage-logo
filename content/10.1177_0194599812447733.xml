<sec id="section4-0194599812447733">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A Google keyword search was performed for 10 common otolaryngology problems including ear infection, hearing loss, tonsillitis, and so on. The top 10 search results for each were critically examined using the 16-item (1-5 scale) standardized DISCERN instrument. The DISCERN instrument was developed to assess the quality and comprehensiveness of patient treatment choice literature.</p>

<sec id="section5-0194599812447733">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 100 Web sites were assessed. Of these, 19 (19%) were primarily advertisements for products and were excluded from DISCERN scoring. Searches for more typically chronic otolaryngic problems (eg, tinnitus, sleep apnea, etc) resulted in more biased, advertisement-type results than those for typically acute problems (eg, ear infection, sinus infection, <italic>P</italic> = .03). The search for “sleep apnea treatment” produced the highest scoring results (mean overall DISCERN score = 3.49, range = 1.81-4.56), and the search for “hoarseness treatment” produced the lowest scores (mean = 2.49, range = 1.56-3.56). Results from major comprehensive Web sites (WebMD, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://EMedicinehealth.com">EMedicinehealth.com</ext-link>, Wikipedia, etc.) scored higher than other Web sites (mean DISCERN score = 3.46 vs 2.48, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>There is marked variability in the quality of Web site information for the treatment of common otolaryngologic problems.

<p>The use of the Internet to seek information about health-related topics by patients has and will continue to grow at a rapid pace. A recent study by the Pew Research Center shows that 8 of 10 Internet users seek health information while online.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812447733">1</xref></sup> The evaluation of the quality of health care information has been performed in some fields, but there are no published data on the quality of information in the field of otolaryngology. It is becoming a common occurrence that patients seek information about their condition prior to seeking care from a physician. More than half of patients seek contact with a medical professional because of information they have found online.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812447733">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The majority of patients (85%) seek health information via the use of search engines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812447733">2</xref></sup> Because of this, the quality of information that a patient encounters is highly variable. Studies have shown that the quality of health care information on the Internet is considered a problem.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812447733">3</xref></sup> In some cases the information found may actually be detrimental to the health of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812447733">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The objective of this study was to critically evaluate the quality of information that would be typically encountered by an otolaryngology patient (or parent) searching for information about common otolaryngology problems. This quality assessment was performed using the DISCERN instrument. The DISCERN instrument was developed at Oxford University and consists of 15 questions that were originally developed to judge the quality of written consumer health information. The DISCERN instrument has been shown to be reliable in multiple publications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812447733">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812447733"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812447733">7</xref></sup> Using the DISCERN instrument, we examined the quality and comprehensiveness of information on the treatment of common otolaryngologic diseases found via a Google Internet search.</p>
<sec id="section7-0194599812447733" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>This study was submitted to the Walter Reed Army Medical Center Institutional Review Board and was granted exemption.</p>
<p>Web sites to be included in the study were found by using the Internet search engine Google. Google was chosen because it is by far the largest Internet search engine, making up over two-thirds of Internet searches by volume.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812447733">8</xref></sup> Ten commonly treated otolaryngologic conditions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812447733"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>) were entered into the Google search engine followed by the word <italic>treatment</italic> (ie, tonsillitis was entered as <italic>tonsillitis treatment</italic>). The first 10 Web site results for each search were included in the analysis, yielding a total of 100 Web sites. Web sites that were primarily selling a product or whose sole purpose was hosting Weblogs, did not undergo analysis using the DISCERN instrument (see the appendix, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.discern.org.uk/discern_instrument.php">http://www.discern.org.uk/discern_instrument.php</ext-link>) but were included in the overall analysis of the searches. A total of 81 Web sites were analyzed using the DISCERN instrument.</p>

<p>The DISCERN instrument was used to analyze each of the 81 Web sites. The instrument consists of 16 separate questions that are rated on a scale of 1 (<italic>does not satisfy the question</italic>) to 5 (<italic>completely satisfies the question</italic>). Questions 1-8 pertain to the reliability of the information, Questions 9-15 evaluate specific details about the treatment choices, and Question 16 is an overall quality rating taking into consideration the previous 15 questions. Each Web site was evaluated, using the DISCERN instrument, by the 2 authors independently. The scores for each question were then averaged, giving an overall score for the Web site. These overall scores were used to further evaluate the results.</p>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed with computer statistical software (STATA Version 8.2, College Station, Texas, USA). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni correction and 2-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic> tests were used to assess differences in the DISCERN quality scores for the topics searched. The null hypothesis was rejected with a <italic>P</italic> value of less than .05.</p>

<sec id="section8-0194599812447733" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 100 Web sites were retrieved using the Google search engine, with 10 Web sites each for the 10 common otolaryngic problems that were selected (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812447733"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). Of these 100 Web sites, 19 were excluded from further analysis with the DISCERN instrument because their main purpose was a message board solicitation or advertisement for a product. The major medical Web sites such as WebMD, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://EMedicinehealth.net">EMedicinehealth.net</ext-link>, and so on were identified in several of the searches. Thus, the searches returned a total of 51 unique Web sites. The highest frequency occurred with the major medical information Web sites (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599812447733"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>), which made up 30 of 81 (37%) of the sites analyzed. The average DISCERN score for all Web sites was 2.85 (SD = 0.89) out of maximum of 5. The lowest score was 1.19 (out of a minimum of 1), and the highest was 4.69 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812447733"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). Of the 10 different otolaryngic topics that were evaluated, the treatment of sleep apnea yielded the highest average DISCERN score (3.48, SD = 0.84) and the treatment of hoarseness yielded the lowest (2.49, SD = 0.61) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812447733"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). ANOVA showed that there was no significant difference between the DISCERN score for the different topics searched.</p>

</fig>
<p>Overall, the quality and comprehensiveness of the located information were less than ideal. More than half of the Web sites (44 of 81, 54.3%) received a score of less than 3; 17 of these sites (38%) received a score of less than 2, indicating that the information that was provided was of exceedingly poor quality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812447733"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). These sites lacked basic information about the source of the information and the currency of the information and did not thoroughly discuss all treatment options. Only 8 of 81 Web sites (9.9%) received a score of 4 or greater, indicating a high-quality source of information. Major medical Web sites (mean DISCERN score = 3.46, 95% CI = 3.21-3.69) scored significantly higher (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001, 2-tailed <italic>t</italic> test) when compared with the other Web sites (mean DISCERN score = 2.48, 95% CI = 2.24-2.70). There was no significant difference between the major Web sites themselves (ANOVA, <italic>P</italic> = .978).</p>
<p>The Web site results for the chronic disorders were compared with the Web site results for acute disorders (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0194599812447733"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref>). Searches for more chronic problems like tinnitus, sleep apnea, and nasal congestion resulted in significantly more advertisement results (average 2.6 ads in the first 10 results) than more acute problems such as ear infections, sinus infections, and tonsillitis (average 0.4 ads in first 10 results, <italic>P</italic> = .03). The DISCERN scores were not significantly different for the chronic problem search results (mean DISCERN score = 2.91, 95% CI = 2.69-3.13) and the acute problem results (2.74, 95% CI = 2.34-3.14).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This review found the content of Web sites on the treatments of common otolaryngologic diseases to be overall moderate to poor. The low scores obtained suggest that patients or families of patients who are seeking treatment information on the Internet are likely exposed to a substantial amount of questionable information during their searches. It was, however, somewhat reassuring that the major health-related Web sites had statistically significant higher quality scores than the other Web sites that were analyzed. These findings allow practitioners to direct patients to the major health care sites when searching for information about their condition on the Internet.</p>
<p>It was found that the search results for more chronic conditions when compared to acute conditions returned a statistically significant higher amount of advertisements. This is not surprising as by their very nature chronic problems afflict many patients over an extended period of time and are thus more likely to draw the attention and efforts of advertisers and vendors selling products to potential patients who are looking for relief. Advertisements are inherently biased with the information that they provide and are not forthcoming about other treatment options. Often it was not immediately obvious that a Web site was advertising a single product. Practitioners should be aware of these findings and relay this information to patients who suffer from chronic conditions.</p>
<p>Because of the increasing reliance of individuals seeking health care information on the Internet, organizations such as JAMA have developed standards for evaluating Web sites for their quality. While the standards they have set are useful, it has been shown that Web sites that meet these standards can still be plagued with inaccuracies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812447733">4</xref></sup> This adds to the complexity as well as the confusion when attempting to analyze sites for quality information.</p>
<p>One of the main difficulties in analysis of sites for quality is that accuracy is not ensured. The task of evaluating a Web site for both quality and accuracy has been challenging. The goal of the DISCERN instrument is to give consumers the ability to evaluate for quality of treatment choices; it does not take into account the accuracy of the information. This is a shortcoming of the tool, as patients are likely to equate a high-quality source of information as being highly accurate. Because ensuring accuracy is difficult, practitioners should keep an open dialog with patients, making them aware that although some Web sites are better than others, they may still contain inaccurate information. Making patients aware of this fact is made all the more important from the findings that nearly two-thirds of patients do not discuss the health information that they found online with their doctor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812447733">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812447733">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The number of patients who use the Internet to seek health information about a condition affecting themselves or a family member will only continue to grow. Because of the large variety of Web sites offering health information and a large difference in the quality and accuracy of the information that they provide, it is the physician’s responsibility to help guide patients in their search. Therefore, physicians and health care practitioners need to be knowledgeable and well versed on Web sites that contain high-quality and accurate information in their field.</p>
<p>There are several limitations to this study that should be considered by the reader. The authors attempted to simulate the procedure that a typical otolaryngology patient (or parent) would follow to locate Internet information on typical otolaryngology problems. The wording that was used was composed of simple, common-language keywords for typical otolaryngology problems that were felt to be the most likely simple-description terms used by the majority of users. Obviously, there are nearly an infinite number of ways to describe these terms with different keywords, and each could produce slightly different results. Google was chosen as the search engine of choice in this study as it has been reported to be the dominant search engine by a large margin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812447733">8</xref></sup> However, other search engines are available and would be expected to produce other results. The search algorithms used by Google are proprietary but are known to be based on the search location. Thus, it would be expected that the search results would be somewhat dissimilar in different areas of the country. Also, it is possible that the previous searching habits of the computer user (spyware!) might also be recorded by Google and alter the search results. Regardless of the potential sources of bias and error, it would be expected that the major Web sites would be included in the search results for the great majority of patients and parents, despite these variables, and thus, the primary conclusion of the study that these Web sites generally have the most reliable information would still be valid. The final conclusion in this respect is left to the reader.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This review demonstrated that the quality of information available on the treatment on common otolaryngologic conditions on the Internet is of moderate quality at best. Major health Web sites did have a statistically higher level of quality than their counterparts, and searches on more chronic problems resulted in a higher proportion of biased advertisement Web sites. Further studies defining the behavior of patients in their Internet searches and the effects of the searches on their health are warranted.</p>
