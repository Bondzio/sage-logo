<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A ring chromosome is a chromosomal aberration, and it is usually formed by fusion of deleted ends by both chromosome arms. r(20) syndrome is characterized by cognitive impairment, behavioral problems, refractory epilepsy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059412451700">1</xref></sup> and repeated episodes of nonconvulsive seizures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1550059412451700">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1550059412451700">3</xref></sup> The episodes of nonconvulsive seizures usually last from several minutes to 1 hour and occur frequently, often daily, with a prolonged confusional state. EEG changes are characterized by long lasting bilateral high-voltage slow waves with occasional spikes, usually in the frontal regions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1550059412451700">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1550059412451700">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1550059412451700">5</xref></sup> This epileptic state may accompany brief motor seizures or convulsive seizures during sleep, presumably of focal origin associated with loss of consciousness, oro-alimentary automatisms, and hypertonia with frontal onset discharge of short duration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1550059412451700">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1550059412451700">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1550059412451700">7</xref></sup> The seizures are resistant to antiepileptic drugs.</p>
<p>Mild dysmorphic features like microcephaly have been reported in some patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059412451700">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1550059412451700">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1550059412451700">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1550059412451700">8</xref></sup> About 80 cases have been reported in the literature. Suggestions about the reason for phenotypes with cognitive problems and seizures were deletions of telomeric–subtelomeric regions or specific epilepsy genes on chromosome 20.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1550059412451700">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1550059412451700">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1550059412451700"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1550059412451700">11</xref></sup> Moreover, the ratio of mosaicism is considered in the generation of severe phenotypes, especially in rare familial cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1550059412451700">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1550059412451700">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Here we present the electroclinical features and cytogenetic findings of 2 siblings with the r(20) phenotype, one of which had r(20) mosaicism. Interestingly, the female patient with r(20) had no deletion in the subtelomeric regions of chromosome 20.</p>

<title>Case Reports</title>
<sec id="section3-1550059412451700">
<title>Patient 1</title>
<p>An 18-year-old girl presented with seizures which had begun at the age of 5. She experienced multiple nocturnal seizures characterized by a frightened expression, unresponsiveness, and bilateral arm abduction lasting 5 to 10 seconds. She was diagnosed with frontal epilepsy and followed by pediatric neurologists. Treatments with a combination of 2 to 3 antiepileptic drugs like carbamazepine, valproic acid, vigabatrin, lamotrigine, primidone, clonazepam, and levetiracetam were not successful.</p>
<p>The patient was born after an uncomplicated pregnancy by vaginal delivery. There was no consanguinity between her parents, but she had a brother with mental retardation.</p>
<p>On examination the patient manifested no dysmorphic features. Her head circumference was within normal limits. The neurological examination was normal except for mental retardation.<italic>  </italic>Until seizure onset her psychomotor development had been normal. Repeated neuropsychological assessments during 10 years’ follow-up confirmed the cognitive deterioration with years (from 70 to 50 total intelligent quotient [IQ] scores).</p>
<p>Video EEG monitoring identified 5 complex partial seizures characterized by fright and awakening with bilateral arm abduction with or without oral automatisms. She also had 2 secondary generalized seizures. The interictal EEG tracings demonstrated slow background activity with bursts or long trains of generalized bilateral sharp waves, spikes, or polyspikes followed by high amplitude slow waves up to 10 seconds. These bursts occurred predominantly over both temporal regions, but sometimes spread to both frontal regions with no behavioral changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1550059412451700">Figure 1A</xref>). All ictal EEGs of the 5 nocturnal seizures initially had brief attenuation periods after generalized epileptiform activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1550059412451700">Figure 1B</xref>). Rhythmic sharp waves in the left frontal region developed in 2 of the ictal EEGs. Bilateral frontal rhythmic discharges were shown after brief attenuation periods in other seizures.</p>

<p>Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized tomography were reported as normal. Routine laboratory examinations and screening tests for metabolic defects were normal. In follow-up, she received antiepileptic drugs including lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and valproic acid. However, her intractable nocturnal seizures continued.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1550059412451700">
<title>Patient 2</title>
<p>The 15-year-old brother of patient 1 has been followed at the pediatric neurology clinic because of his mental and motor retardation. He was able to walk at 2 years of age and speak at 3. His total IQ was 56 at the age of 3. His family complained that he had behavioral problems. He has not attended regular school because of these severe behavioral and educational problems, associated with daily recurrent periods of restlessness and distractibility. He had no convulsive seizures, but his EEGs have been reported as diurnal episodes of long lasting generalized epileptiform discharges with no clinical features. The patient had no history of perinatal injury. Examinations related to metabolic defects and lysosomal enzymes were normal. His cranial MRI was also normal. He received anticonvulsant treatment in addition to a special education program.</p>

<title>Cytogenetic Analysis</title>
<p>Cytogenetic analyses were performed on Giemsa stain (GTG-banded) metaphase spreads prepared from phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes and skin fibroblasts.  The karyotypes were described in accordance with International system for human cytogenetic nomenclature (ISCN).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1550059412451700">12</xref></sup> Chromosome analyses were done in 50 metaphases for each sample with a resolution of 550 bands.</p>
<p>Whole chromosome painting for chromosome 20 was done using commercially available probes (Vysis, Abbott Laboratories, IL, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
<p>The GTG-banded cytogenetic analysis of peripheral blood and skin tissue revealed that the karyotype of patient 1 was 46, XX, r(20)(p13q13.3)[22]/46, XX[28] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1550059412451700">Figure 2</xref>). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis using Whole chromosome painting (WCP) for chromosome 20 showed the ring chromosome formation with no deletion in the subtelomeric region. The karyotype of patient 2 was normal.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>These 2 siblings had similar phenotypes with mental motor retardation and serious EEG abnormality, which are described in the r(20) syndrome, but they had different cytogenetic findings. Patient 1 had r(20) without any subtelomere deletion and patient 2 had no ring chromosome. Patient 2 also had no structural and metabolic disease resulting in mental retardation and EEG abnormality.</p>
<p>The effects of different cytogenetic findings on the phenotypes of patients with r(20) were briefly discussed previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1550059412451700">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1550059412451700">10</xref></sup> Patients generally show mosaicism at a rate varying from 1% to 100%. The severity of epilepsy disorder and psychomotor developmental delay as well as the dysmorphic features were highly correlated with the level of mosaicism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1550059412451700">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1550059412451700">6</xref></sup> Our patient 2, however, who had no r(20), had severe clinical features similar to those of his sister, including mental motor retardation and diurnal episodes of long lasting generalized epileptiform discharges but without convulsive seizures. Therefore, the reason for the diurnal episodes of long lasting generalized epileptiform discharges with any clinical features and cognitive problems cannot be directly related to the ring formation of chromosome 20.</p>
<p>The mechanism that causes a seizure disorder in r(20) is not clear. Subtelomere–telomere deletions or interstitial deletions of specific epilepsy genes including <italic>CHRNA4</italic> and <italic>KCNQ2</italic> were considered.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1550059412451700">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1550059412451700">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1550059412451700"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1550059412451700">11</xref></sup> Additionally, types of deficiency like terminal deletion of 20qter or 20pter with different phenotypes with nonconvulsive or convulsive seizures were reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1550059412451700">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1550059412451700"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1550059412451700">15</xref></sup> Furthermore Villéga et al. reported 1 child with a telomeric deletion 20p13, with no epileptic symptoms and preservation of <italic>CHRNA4</italic> and <italic>KCNQ2</italic> gene activity was considered for this distinctive feature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1550059412451700">16</xref></sup> Although our patient 1 with r(20) had no subtelomere deletion, she had severe nonconvulsive and convulsive seizures. Similarly there are a few r(20) participants who have typical severe epilepsy disorder but have no telomere–subtelomere deletions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1550059412451700">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1550059412451700">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1550059412451700"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1550059412451700">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Familial cases are important for understanding the mechanism of pathophysiology in r(20) syndrome. There are 3 reports describing inherited r(20) syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1550059412451700">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1550059412451700">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1550059412451700">9</xref></sup> Back et al. described the 2 affected siblings with a carrier mother.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1550059412451700">8</xref></sup> Canevini et al and Herrgard et al also reported children along with their affected mothers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1550059412451700">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1550059412451700">9</xref></sup> Opposite to the children, carrier mothers were less severely affected with mild seizures or were clinically unaffected. Higher levels of mosaicism in succeeding generations were suggested for severity of phenotype. In our siblings, the male had no r(20), but he had clinical features similar to those of his sister having r(20). Although we had no more detailed chromosomal analysis of our patients, the epilepsy disorder and intellectual dysfunction may be speculated to be a result of undetermined microdeletion in chromosome 20 rather than in the subtelomere–telomere region. Similar to mosaicism in r(20), mosaicism in suggested microdeletions may lead to differences in clinical features. In female cases, this deletion or any other deletion may lead to ring formation. Moreover, the occurrence of ring formation with or without additional deletion may cause a more severe phenotype with refractory convulsive seizures in addition to nonconvulsive seizures. On the other hand, a reported carrier mother in the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1550059412451700">8</xref></sup> and ring formation in our female case may be speculated to show the easy formation of ring chromosome in females as a result of microdeletions.  </p>
<p>In patients with r(20) syndrome, a history of epilepsy or learning problems should be determined in family members although these relatives had no ring formation in chromosome 20. Detailed cytogenetic analysis of all these family members may lead to the definition of microdeletions resulting in the phenotype of r(20) syndrome with or without ring chromosome formation.</p>
