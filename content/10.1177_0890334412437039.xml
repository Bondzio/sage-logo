<title>Background:</title>
<p>The Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative began in 1991. In 2010, approximately 3% of United States (US) hospitals were Baby-Friendly certified. When collecting data for related studies, we noted that many maternity staff erroneously claimed their hospital was Baby-Friendly.™</p>

<sec id="section3-0890334412437039">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>In 2010-2011, we called all maternity hospitals in the US and asked to be connected to the maternity service. We then asked the person answering the maternity service phone: “Is your hospital a Baby-Friendly hospital?” and recorded the position of the respondent.</p>

<sec id="section4-0890334412437039">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>We called 2974 hospitals, and received answers on Baby-Friendly status from 2851. According to the Baby-Friendly USA Website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.babyfriendlyusa.org">http://www.babyfriendlyusa.org</ext-link>), 3% (75/2851) of these hospitals were Baby-Friendly. However, staff at 62% (1780/2851) stated their hospital was Baby-Friendly. Staff at 15% (424/2851) did not know what the caller meant by “Baby-Friendly hospital.” Accuracy of knowledge varied dependent on the respondent’s job title (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).

<title>Background</title>
<p>In 1991 WHO and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) launched the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) in an effort to improve breastfeeding rates worldwide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334412437039">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0890334412437039"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0890334412437039"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0890334412437039">4</xref></sup> A hospital or birth center receives Baby-Friendly designation when they demonstrate compliance with the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding, and associated required aspects of the International Code of marketing of breast milk substitutes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0890334412437039">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0890334412437039">5</xref></sup> In the United States, progress toward widespread Baby-Friendly certification has been slow when compared with some other regions of the world.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0890334412437039">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0890334412437039"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0890334412437039"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0890334412437039"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0890334412437039"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0890334412437039"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0890334412437039"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0890334412437039"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0890334412437039">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Baby-Friendly USA is the implementing body for the BFHI in the US, and the authority under which US hospitals/birth centers become Baby-Friendly certified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0890334412437039">6</xref></sup>; US Baby-Friendly sites are listed on the Baby-Friendly USA Website upon certification. However, an intuitive way to find out whether a hospital is Baby-Friendly would be to call the hospital in question, a practice that expectant mothers may follow, and potentially, a question researchers may ask when surveying hospitals about maternity care practices. When we collected data for recent studies on formula sample practices in US hospitals,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0890334412437039">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0890334412437039"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0890334412437039">17</xref></sup> staff respondents frequently volunteered the often erroneous information that their hospital was Baby-Friendly. The objective of our study was to determine whether US maternity staff in all 50 states and the District of Columbia could correctly identify whether their hospital was Baby-Friendly certified. As far as we are aware, no study has assessed the accuracy of staff knowledge on Baby-Friendly status among US maternity staff.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Between January 2010 and February 2011, research assistants at Boston Medical Center (BMC) telephoned all maternity hospitals in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Contact information was obtained from a previous study on maternity hospital practices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0890334412437039">16</xref></sup> Upon calling the hospital, we asked to be connected to the maternity service. We then asked the person answering the maternity service 2 questions: “What is your position in the hospital?” and “Is your hospital a Baby-Friendly hospital?” We compared hospital staff responses with data on certified birthing sites on the Baby-Friendly USA Website. Responses were marked as “correct,” “incorrect,” or if the respondent asked what a Baby-Friendly hospital was, “don’t know.” In further analysis, respondents who did not know were considered “incorrect.” To account for hospitals becoming Baby-Friendly during the study period, at the point in time when we started making calls to a specific state, we first checked to determine which hospitals in that state were listed on the Baby-Friendly USA Website as certified Baby-Friendly.</p>
<p>The study was exempt from ethical review because it collected publicly available data about routine hospital practices.</p>
<sec id="section10-0890334412437039">
<title>Statistical Methods</title>
<p>We ran Fisher exact tests to determine (1) accuracy of response in relation to the hospital’s status (Baby-Friendly or not) and (2) the likelihood of being correct by respondent job title. In addition, we performed a nonparametric Spearman correlation to determine whether a correlation existed between the proportion of accurate responses in a state and the proportion of Baby-Friendly hospitals in a state. Statistical tests were run using SAS (version 9.1.3, Cary, NC, Oct 2007).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We called 2974 currently operating maternity hospitals; 2851 were included in the final analyses. We excluded 123 hospitals for the following reasons: after at least 3 attempts at contact, 107 maternity units did not answer the phone, and 16 respondents refused to answer the Baby-Friendly question.</p>
<p>According to the Baby-Friendly USA Website, 3% of the hospitals we reached were Baby-Friendly. However, according to our survey, 62% of respondents said their hospital was Baby-Friendly, 23% said their hospital was not Baby-Friendly, and 15% did not know what “Baby-Friendly” was. Overall, 75% (2134/2851) of respondents gave an incorrect answer. Respondents at Baby-Friendly hospitals were significantly more accurate than those at non-Baby-Friendly hospitals: 96% of respondents at Baby-Friendly sites gave a correct response compared to 23% of respondents at non-Baby-Friendly hospitals (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0890334412437039">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although the BFHI was established over 20 years ago, most US maternity staff either incorrectly believed their hospital to be Baby-Friendly certified, or were unaware of the meaning of “Baby-Friendly hospital.” The deficit of knowledge among US maternity staff shows a need for education within hospitals about institutional breastfeeding support and Baby-Friendly certification. Our findings also imply that as more hospitals within a state achieve Baby-Friendly certification, staff at hospitals within that state are more likely to respond accurately as to their Baby-Friendly status. We hypothesize that because the concept and terminology are more prevalent in that state, they are better understood, and maternity staff generally are more aware of the meaning of “Baby-Friendly.” It is interesting however, that even in certified Baby-Friendly hospitals, not all respondents correctly identified their status.</p>
<p>Accuracy among type of staff person answering the question was somewhat predictable. For example, IBCLCs and unit directors/nurse managers would most likely be more knowledgeable about a breastfeeding designation than secretaries, who have a nonclinical role. The very high proportion of incorrect answers among RNs (77%) however, is of great concern. Unfortunately, not enough physicians answered the phones for us to be able to separately analyze their responses (they were included in the Other category).</p>
<p>A limitation of this study regards semantics. It is possible that some respondents misunderstood the question or incorrectly described their hospital as certified Baby-Friendly because of the phrase “Baby-Friendly.” Regardless of whether they actually knew about WHO certification, they may have wanted to report that their setting “liked babies” or was “friendly to babies.” It is also possible, given documented resistance to the changes represented by the Baby-Friendly process,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0890334412437039">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0890334412437039">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0890334412437039"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0890334412437039"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0890334412437039">21</xref></sup> that some staff answered obtusely, knowing that their hospital was not certified, but considering their hospital to be “baby friendly” nonetheless. Another limitation is that the BFHI is an international initiative, and we cannot generalize based on this study as to whether findings would be similar in other nations. Based on our findings, however, we suggest that in countries where the BFHI has been more enthusiastically adopted, or where there is a higher proportion of certified hospitals, staff responses may be more accurate.</p>
<p>Given the major inaccuracies we uncovered, we suggest that researchers avoid staff report as a way to assess Baby-Friendly status. Similarly, expectant mothers looking for a Baby-Friendly hospital need to be cautious about seeking this information over the telephone. If they call hospitals to inquire about Baby-Friendly status, they might be misled into believing that a hospital is Baby-Friendly when it is not.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0890334412437039" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The BFHI is an international initiative that has been widely embraced around the world for over 20 years. However, most grassroots maternity staff in US hospitals were not able to identify whether their hospital was certified, which thereby implies a serious and widespread knowledge deficit with regard to the Initiative. On a more optimistic note, in states where there BFHI was better established, staff knowledge was better. We suggest that these findings call for more education and a more systematic approach to Baby-Friendly implementation in the US.</p>
