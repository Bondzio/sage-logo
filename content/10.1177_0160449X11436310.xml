<p>This book examines an eclectic mix of topics related to the global division of labor through contributions from high-level academics, economists, and practitioners. These chapters were originally presented at conferences sponsored by the Cournot Centre for Economic Studies in Paris and later formalized into papers for this book. The Cournot Centre is an independent French research institute that seeks to inject relevant theoretical and empirical research into policy debates.</p>
<p>The global division of labor, as this book suggests through the chapter topics, appears to be a two-tiered system, with wealthy countries characterized by stocks of knowledge-intensive goods and services and intertwining networks of foreign direct investment concentrated within them, and poorer countries whose economies are largely based upon low-cost labor. This system is possibly causing unskilled workers in the richest countries to be in competition with workers in the less developed and industrializing nations and where divisions of labor based upon gender are breaking down.</p>
<p>With regard to national differences, the Chinese and Indian labor markets are explored in Richard Cooper’s chapter of the book. Cooper predicts that China will continue trying to move into the manufacture of more sophisticated products but will be stymied not only by its internal capacity to develop talent but also because its military modernization projects siphon away resources. India is less well positioned because of its lack of internal migration and social mobility, but it will continue to grow its information technology and back-office sectors. Increasingly, low-wage countries are competing with each other for low-cost manufacturing. India will also suffer from a brain drain of top talent to richer countries—especially English-speaking nations. Labor unions’ efforts to organize workers in these countries will continue.</p>
<p>This book contains a wealth of insight into topics related to the global division of labor. Unfortunately, some of the chapters focus less on global labor issues and instead deal with other aspects of business. Nevertheless, this is a very interesting book by senior contributors that will get the reader up to date on major concepts in international trade and labor issues.</p>
