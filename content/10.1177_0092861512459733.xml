<abstract>
<p>Use of blinded independent central review (BICR) has become more common in oncology phase 3 trials as progression-free survival (PFS) has been increasingly used as an endpoint for regulatory approval. Since PFS is primarily a radiographic endpoint, BICR has been implemented to assess and reduce potential bias in the local evaluation (LE) of PFS. Recent publications note an agreement between LE and BICR of the ultimate reported PFS treatment effect, which questions the need for costly and time-consuming complete-case BICR of PFS. A meta-analysis was conducted to systematically evaluate the relationship between BICR- and LE-assessed PFS based on FDA’s regulatory experience from 2005 to present. Our results support the claim that a complete review of all radiographs by BICR may not be necessary for oncology trials, and alternative methods should be explored to evaluate bias. One potential alternative is to use BICR as an audit tool to detect evaluation bias in LE assessments.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Progression-free survival (PFS) has increasingly become the primary endpoint in oncology clinical trials to support regulatory approval of new drugs. PFS is defined as the time from randomization to disease progression or death. Unlike overall survival, which can be objectively assessed, evaluation of progression is complicated by subjective factors, including variations in tumor measurement, selection of target lesions, failure to detect new lesions, and differing interpretations of progression between radiologists and clinicians.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861512459733">1</xref>
</sup> Subjectivity may affect endpoint assessment differentially across treatment arms.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861512459733">2</xref>
</sup> With open-label trials, the knowledge of an assigned treatment may lead to the introduction of bias in progression assessment. For example, an investigator may, due to unintended bias, either elect to maintain a patient on the investigational arm or assess progression early on the control arm. Bias in the assessment of PFS may be reduced if trials are blinded; however, blinding clinicians to oncology drug assignment may be difficult when differences in the toxicity profiles of drugs may lead to inadvertent unblinding.</p>
<p>Due to the subjectivity in the measurement and interpretation of PFS in unblinded trials, a BICR is frequently requested by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory authorities to evaluate bias and corroborate the results from the local evaluation (LE). A BICR, which may consist of several radiologists and clinicians, generally reviews the radiographs of all patients to determine their dates of progression. This inclusive process of assessing all patients and their radiographs represents a significant time and expense burden in the conduct of trials for regulatory approval.</p>
<p>A BICR, however, has its own limitations since it is often conducted in a prespecified but retrospective manner in which patients’ radiographs are reviewed after all assessments have been performed. Generally, no further assessments are available after progression has been declared by the LE, and the patients may have already moved on to new therapies (based on the investigator’s decision) before the BICR is conducted. This process may lead to a considerable number of patients declared to have progressive disease by the LE but censored by the BICR. Since these patients will be more likely to have disease progression by the next scheduled visit compared to patients not determined to have disease progression by the LE, their censoring by the BICR may be informative. Informative censoring may result in biased treatment effect estimates, especially if not balanced across treatment arms.<sup>

</p>
<p>Although discordant readings of progression between BICR and LE assessments for an individual patient are common, recent publications<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861512459733">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861512459733">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092861512459733">5</xref>
</sup> note an agreement between LE and BICR of the ultimate reported PFS treatment effect. This finding questions the need for, and utility of, costly and time-consuming complete case-by-case assessments of PFS by BICR. Reported herein are the results of a meta-analysis to systematically evaluate the relationship between BICR- and LE-assessed PFS based on FDA’s regulatory experience from 2005 to present. The objective response rate (ORR) as determined by BICR and LE is also evaluated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0092861512459733" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The meta-analysis was performed using summary, trial-level information from 28 randomized, phase 3 trials in solid tumors with either prospective or retrospective BICR- and LE-assessed PFS results reported. Data from these trials, from 2005 to the present, were submitted to the FDA as part of a new drug application (NDA) or a biologics license application (BLA). This time period was selected because FDA unified its review of oncology drug applications in 2005 under the Office of Oncology Drug Products (currently the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products). In addition, trials conducted prior to 2005 generally used overall survival as the primary efficacy endpoint with PFS relegated to a secondary endpoint; hence, BICR to evaluate PFS and ORR was not consistently employed.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0092861512459733">Table 1</xref> summarizes the characteristics of the 28 evaluated trials; 54% were double blind by design, 29% were randomized in a 2:1 ratio between experimental and control arms, 32% were based on interim analysis results, and 46% were trials for initial therapy of metastatic disease. These trials included various tumor types. A majority (57%) of the trials used either placebo or “best supportive care” (BSC) in the control arm. The median sample size was 716.5 patients. Hematologic malignancy trials were excluded in this analysis since progression criteria are often based on hematologic laboratory parameters rather than radiologic measurements.</p>

<p>Analyses were performed to examine the concordance of PFS treatment effect, as measured by a hazard ratio (HR), for BICR and LE. The correlation between BICR and LE log HRs was evaluated using the Pearson correlation coefficient (<italic>r</italic>). A linear regression model weighted by trial size was fit, from which the coefficient of determination (<italic>R</italic>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861512459733">2</xref>
</sup>) was calculated to assess the proportion of variability explained by the model. Similar to Amit et al,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092861512459733">5</xref>
</sup> a ratio of HRs (defined as the ratio of BICR HR to LE HR) was calculated to quantify the magnitude of agreement in the estimated PFS treatment effect. Assuming there is heterogeneity between the trials, the overall ratio of HRs and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) across all the trials was estimated using a random-effects model weighted by trial size with log HR as the outcome variable and trial as the random effect.<sup>

Comparatively, the corresponding association in MBC was numerically lower (<italic>r</italic> = 0.873 [95% CI: 0.497, 0.973]); however, note the wider CI, indicating greater variability in the results of the MBC trials.</p>

<p>Many recent oncology drugs (eg, agents that target tumor angiogenesis or tumor growth factor receptors) mainly delay tumor growth and stabilize disease rather than reduce the tumor size as evaluated by ORR.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092861512459733">3</xref>
</sup> Since both the evaluations of PFS and ORR generally use similar criteria (eg, response evaluation criteria in solid tumors [RECIST]), we also reviewed the association between BICR- and LE-determined ORR. Similar analyses conducted for PFS were performed on the subset of trials (25/28) with BICR- and LE-assessed ORR reported. Note that several trials had multiple cohorts or 3 treatment arms; thus, there were 30 randomized comparisons for the ORR meta-analysis.

<p>Overall, the degree of association between BICR and LE estimates of the ORR treatment effect was numerically lower than for PFS, but still relatively high (<italic>r</italic> = 0.897 [95% CI: 0.793, 0.950]). As reflected in the width of the CI and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0092861512459733">Figure 1D</xref>, a greater variability among the ORs for ORR, as compared to the HRs for PFS, existed. This may, in part, be due to the number of trials (N = 9) with either no or a single response on the control arm observed by either BICR or LE. Although a correction factor of 0.5 was added to each cell in these trials, the resulting ORs (and their CIs) were expectedly variable (and wide) even though the BICR and LE ORRs were similar. However, the treatment effects as measured by either the BICR or LE ORs for most of the trials were similar. The <italic>R</italic>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861512459733">2</xref>
</sup> value from the weighted linear regression model was 0.804 (95% CI: 0.693, 0.916), signifying that the model was able to explain about 80% of the variability.</p>
<p>The overall ratio of ORs (BICR vs LE) from the random-effects model was 1.20 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.41), indicating a 20% difference between the two evaluations. About 43% (13/30) of the trials had a less than 20% difference between BICR and LE ORs, while a similar amount (47%, 14/30) had a greater than 30% difference. The mean difference in BICR and LE ORR in the control and experimental arms was –2.6% (95% CI: –8.4, 3.2) and –3.7% (95% CI: –13.9, 6.6), respectively. In a majority of trials (80% on control, 70% on treatment), the LE ORR was higher than that evaluated by BICR. This result supports the need for BICR in trials with ORR as the primary endpoint.</p>

In general, given the aforementioned variability, the level of agreement between BICR and LE ORR ORs remained consistent across subgroups. Although there was larger variability among the blinded trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0092861512459733">Figure 1E</xref>), no significant difference in the concordance of BICR and LE estimates of ORR treatment effect between blinded and open-label trials was noted. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0092861512459733">Figure 1F</xref> plots the BICR and LE ORR ORs by tumor type; the association between BICR and LE in MBC, RCC, and MCRC was consistent. Comparatively, the corresponding association in the “Other” group was numerically lower (<italic>r</italic> = 0.813 [95% CI: 0.254, 0.965]). Since 5 of the 9 trials with 0 or 1 response on the control arm were in this group, the variability in the results of those trials was expectedly greater (as indicated by the wider CI).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As an increasing number of phase 3 trials in oncology use PFS as a primary efficacy endpoint, BICR has been implemented to corroborate LE results and evaluate potential bias. However, authors<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861512459733">1</xref>

</sup> have pointed out that BICR may also lead to bias through informative censoring of patients who progressed by LE but not BICR. Although sensitivity analyses may examine the impending effect of informative censoring, the potential biases can only be definitively eliminated by the implementation of real-time central independent review that may be impractical in global trials.</p>
<p>Bias must be distinguished from measurement variability.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092861512459733">5</xref>
</sup> Bias refers to systematic errors resulting in an inaccurate treatment effect estimate. Variability, on the other hand, relates to measurement error leading to uncertainty about the estimated PFS time for an individual patient. Measurement variability attenuates the treatment effect and reduces statistical power, but the treatment effect estimate remains unbiased. Discordant evaluations due to measurement variability, lesion selection, and perception of new lesions are expected when images are reviewed by different radiologists. Random, or nondifferential, discordant evaluations may lead to unreliable treatment effect estimates, but not necessarily biased estimates. Differential discordance, defined as the difference in discordance rates between treatment arms, is the mechanism that induces bias. A large magnitude of differential discordance can be associated with divergent estimates of treatment effect between the LE and BICR. The presence of bias is more concerning than that of measurement variability.<sup>

<p>BICR is both administratively and financially costly. Thus, given its increasing use, a reevaluation of the need for BICR in future oncology clinical trials is warranted. With this objective, we conducted a meta-analysis of all randomized, phase 3 trials in solid tumors submitted to the FDA since 2005. Only trials that reported both BICR and LE assessments of PFS treatment effect, as measured by a HR, were included. Our analysis results revealed a high level of agreement between BICR and LE assessments of PFS treatment effect. The results were also consistent across various subgroups, especially tumor type and whether the trial was blinded or open label.</p>
<p>The carcinoid tumor trial (trial 28) represents a trial where bias may have been present, as disclosed by a differential discordance in the evaluation of PFS by BICR and LE. This trial, a randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial in patients with carcinoid tumor, had a primary endpoint of PFS as determined by BICR. At the second interim analysis, a discordance in PFS between BICR and LE was observed. Specifically, the BICR PFS assessment had crossed the prespecified <italic>futility</italic> boundary, while the LE PFS assessment had crossed the prespecified <italic>efficacy</italic> boundary. This unprecedented result was discussed at the April 2011 Oncologic Drug Advisory Committee (ODAC) meeting.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0092861512459733">11</xref>
</sup> The BICR and LE PFS HRs from the final analysis were used in this meta-analysis. Analyses including and excluding this “outlier” trial were conducted. Because the results of both analyses were similar, this trial was included in all analyses presented.</p>
<p>Tang et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0092861512459733">12</xref>
</sup> conducted a meta-analysis to determine the variability in assessments between BICR and LE. This analysis included a total of 21 trials and focused primarily on differences in PFS medians and did not directly assess treatment effect concordance. The PFS data included were limited; only 8 of the 21 trials had BICR and LE PFS results. More recently, Amit et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092861512459733">5</xref>
</sup> published a meta-analysis quantifying the relationship between estimated PFS treatment effects based on BICR and LE, and suggested the use of BICR as an audit in future phase 3 oncology trials.</p>
<p>The meta-analysis presented here includes a more comprehensive list of trials, including various design features, lines of therapy, and solid tumor types. All trials used standardized PFS and ORR definitions and were reviewed by the FDA for integrity of trial conduct, including the implementation of BICR. In a subset of the trials, we examined the association between BICR and LE in the evaluation of ORR treatment effect as measured by an OR. Although the association was not as strong as for PFS, due to greater variability, the level of agreement between BICR and LE ORR treatment effects is supportive of the PFS results. In trials where the BICR and LE ORR ORs differed substantially due to either no or a single response on the control arm, the ORR between BICR and LE were similar. In addition, given that the LE ORR was higher than BICR in 70% to 80% of the trials, the need of BICR in trials with ORR as the primary endpoint may be warranted.</p>
<p>These results support the claim by several authors<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861512459733">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861512459733"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092861512459733">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092861512459733">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092861512459733">8</xref>
</sup> that a complete review of all radiographs by BICR may not be necessary for oncology trials and alternative methods should be explored to evaluate bias. One alternative is to use BICR as an audit tool to detect evaluation bias in LE assessments. The size of the audit will likely depend on the magnitude of the treatment effect. Larger differences in PFS between treatment arms are more robust and will usually require a smaller BICR audit. Both Dodd et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092861512459733">8</xref>
</sup> and Amit et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092861512459733">5</xref>
</sup> have proposed BICR audit methods. The primary role of BICR is to evaluate the existence of bias in LE assessments. The operational aspects and efficiency of the currently proposed statistics need further exploration and validation, and the applicability of these methods to other therapeutic indications not included in those analyses needs to be examined.</p>
<p>PFS, primarily an endpoint assessed by radiographic techniques, may not be the optimal primary efficacy endpoint in malignancies where radiologic measurement of disease progression is poorly assessed. The magnitude of treatment effect on PFS must be assessed in relation to the therapy’s safety profile in a risk-to-benefit analysis. Because of the subjectivity in evaluating radiographs, measurement variability between BICR and LE assessments of individual patients is expected and makes the demonstration of a treatment effect more difficult. Regulatory review of PFS should focus on the potential bias introduced in the clinical evaluation of this endpoint. Review of this endpoint by BICR should examine the least burdensome assessment of the presence or absence of bias.</p>
