      <p>In her book, <italic>Outsmarting the Riptide of Domestic Violence: Metaphor and Mindfulness for Change</italic>, Dr. Pat Pernicano provides metaphorical stories in order to help illuminate clients’ struggles with relational control or domestic violence. Each story is designed to be a stand-alone component to the therapeutic process. When used in conjunction with mindfulness meditation, the stories are expected to facilitate healing both by “altering core schemas” and by aiding women’s abilities to “calm down their over aroused neurobiology” (p. 7). In the book’s introduction, Dr. Pernicano draws connections among metaphorical stories, guided imagery, meditation, and the emotional and sensory areas of the brain. Using these methods to encourage brain integration is described as a valuable way to help women process complex traumas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0361684312469793">Briere &amp; Spinazzola, 2009</xref>). This type of process has also been supported by evidence of the effectiveness of Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) in the treatment of intimate partner violence; DBT uses mindfulness strategies to promote emotional regulation while enhancing interpersonal effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0361684312469793">Rathus, Cavuoto, &amp; Passarelli, 2006</xref>).</p>
      <p>By inference, a core assumption of this book is that conceptualizing women in domestically violent relationships as trauma survivors will advance the effectiveness of existing therapeutic interventions. This assumption maps onto traditional feminist conceptualizations of domestic violence as severe aggression perpetration by men against women; it is also consistent with research demonstrating the high rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) observed in women who are victims of intimate partner violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0361684312469793">Nathanson, Shorey, Tirone, &amp; Rhatigan, 2012</xref>). Theoretically, this book was also designed to be consistent with the tenets of Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0361684312469793">Cohen, Mannarino, &amp; Deblinger, 2006</xref>) as the author specifically indicates that the book’s metaphorical stories can be interwoven with the PRACTICE elements that form the cornerstone of TF-CBT. As such, these stories are designed to challenge women to face their choices, contemplate their options, and enact alternative ways of thinking and behaving in order to create healthy intimate relationships.</p>
      <p>However, different from what is suggested in the title of this book, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0361684312469793">Prochaska and DiClemente’s (1983)</xref> transtheoretical model—often called the stages of change model—plays a second and more obvious role in the book’s structure and orientation. Specifically, the five major book sections directly mirror the stages of change: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance. Metaphorical stories are included that reflect violence-related issues common to each stage of change. These clinically derived stories are followed by “Food for Thought Questions,” which can be discussed by the client and therapist post story presentation. Because the application of the transtheoretical model helps clients to become more motivated to change their behavior, this book can best be viewed as reflecting the feminist perspective of gender empowerment rather than feminist models of domestic violence that are more oriented to sociocultural issues of power and control. Confronting women in abusive relationships with their need to change themselves (e.g., increasing effectiveness at mate selection [p. 61], affect regulation [p. 161], codependency [p. 102]) has traditionally been controversial because it has been linked with victim blaming. However, because this is done through the use of metaphor and story-telling, and because it clearly arises from the work of a seasoned clinician, it seems likely these strategies will generate less client-generated defensiveness and avoidance. These strategies may also be more universally applicable to the substantial number of individuals who are in bidirectionally violent intimate relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0361684312469793">Langhinrichsen-Rohling, Misra, Selwyn, &amp; Rohling, 2012</xref>).</p>
      <p>In keeping with Pernicano’s stated purposes, she has carefully constructed visually stimulating stories that fit within each stage of change. For example, she includes eight stories and their corresponding therapeutic issues in the “Pre-Contemplation” section. They focus on the importance of investing in others, recognizing the extent of the problem, the need to tune in to self and others, why repeated exposure to trauma can be devastating to children, recognizing when there is purposeful engagement in unnecessary risk/finding one’s own riptide, and recognizing entitlement. She offers additional vivid stories for the stages of contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance. The wealth of stories and their thoughtful pairing with a corresponding stage of change will make it simpler for therapists to tailor this book to the positioning of each individual client.</p>
      <p>The intended readership for this book appears to be therapists and/or mental health workers who are working directly with female clients in destructive relationships. Some stories are most appropriate for those with a known history of trauma; others work better for women who are mothers. The book’s introduction provides a suggested procedure for introducing these stories. Chosen stories are to be shared in session as part of ongoing group or individual work. The rationale behind each story is provided prior to the actual story; these explanations will aid both beginning therapists and clinicians who have not yet used these tools to navigate each story’s purpose. The book is not a research-driven text nor is it a presentation of an evidence-based therapy. Rather, it is a compilation of stories gathered from a seasoned clinician in order to speak directly to central issues faced by women in domestically violent relationships. These stories can be used practically and immediately in the therapeutic relationship by mental health workers at any level of training.</p>
      <p>In this way, the book is filling a void in the field by providing clear and coherent metaphorical stories as illumination points for clients at any point in the process of considering self-specific or relationship-centered change. It is worth noting that these stories will encourage women to heal and empower themselves as recommended by many feminist scholars. Additionally, many of the included stories are consistent with models of intimate partner violence that emphasize the frequent occurrence of destructive bidirectional interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0361684312469793">Langhinrichsen-Rohling, 2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, the book’s title does not seem to accurately capture the organizational structure and important features therein. For example, the subtitle, <italic>Metaphor and Mindfulness for Change</italic> is somewhat misleading because the majority of direct connections to mindfulness interventions are located in Appendix A. Perhaps, a more appropriate subtitle might be simply “<italic>Metaphors for Change</italic>.” Likewise, direct reference of the book’s content to the “riptide” allusion in the book’s title is not readily discernible beyond the book’s introduction and one example story. This important metaphor could be better highlighted in the text. However, despite its somewhat misleading name, the content in this book is likely to inspire important and therapeutic exchanges between therapists and clients. It also brings a novel, conceptually exciting, and clinically applicable approach to the treatment of women struggling to make life changes that are related to their role in relationships characterized by intimate partner violence.</p>
