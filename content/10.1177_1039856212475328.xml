<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>It is interesting that in their report on the responses of three patients with postnatal depression to unilateral, ultrabrief pulse ECT, Levy et al. note that two of the patients were treated with doses barely above threshold and yet the patients recovered.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212475328">1</xref></sup> In the third case, threshold was not determined so it is not possible to know how suprathreshold these treatments were given. The authors state that at the time these patients were treated no protocols existed to guide dosage levels for ultrabrief pulse ECT. Sackeim et al.’s pioneering study into ultrabrief pulse width ECT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856212475328">2</xref></sup> demonstrated efficacy and cognitive sparing of unilateral ECT at 0.3 msec pulse width at six times threshold. Earlier studies demonstrated superior efficacy for unilateral brief pulse ECT when given at six times threshold or more.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856212475328">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856212475328">4</xref></sup> It is therefore puzzling that the patients described by Levy et al. responded at such low doses relative to threshold. One explanation may be that postnatal depression may be acutely sensitive to ultra-brief pulse ECT and that response might be expected even at very low doses relative to threshold. As pointed out by the authors, although empirical data are sparse, clinicians have long believed that postnatal mood disorders are particularly sensitive to ECT. This is therefore an important area for further research.</p>
<p>It would have assisted in understanding the three patients’ responses if some comment had been made about the quality of the EEG seizures during the treatment. Mean seizure duration is reported, but seizure duration of itself is not an adequate measure of seizure quality. It is generally acknowledged that the EEG seizure quality with ultrabrief ECT is often less robust than that usually seen with standard brief pulse ECT. This has led to the idea that EEG quality may not be as clinically useful in predicting response as once thought. My own clinical experience is that this is not so, and that patients do best with unilateral ultrabrief pulse ECT when good quality seizures are induced. My suspicion is that seizures induced by ultrabrief pulse ECT are more susceptible to the anticonvulsant effects of the anaesthetic induction agent than are seizures induced by standard brief pulse width ECT. Modifying the anaesthetic dose by lowering the dose of propofol or thiopental and augmenting with remifentanil to prevent awareness can be a successful strategy in producing better quality EEG seizures and improving efficacy.</p>
<p>The authors might also have explained why patient two required 20 treatments to recover. This is an unusually high number of unilateral treatments to give as a single course. It is generally suggested that if recovery is slow the electrode placement should be switched to a bilateral placement (bifrontal or bitemporal) after about six unilateral treatments. With unilateral ultrabrief pulse ECT, recovery can be slower and patients may need one or two more treatments than with a course of standard brief pulse ECT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856212475328">5</xref></sup> For this reason, switching to bilateral ECT can reasonably be delayed until after about eight unsuccessful treatments, but further delay in switching needs to be justified.</p>
