<p>The literary scholar Rob Nixon has written a book of importance to geographers studying environmental politics in a world of transnational corporate power and new forms of western imperialism. At the heart of his monograph is a concern to foreground the unrecognized forms of violence and death suffered by the globe’s marginalized populations – what Mike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309133311431670">Davis (2006</xref>: 72, quoted in <italic>Slow Violence</italic>, p. 34) calls ‘the global residuum’ – as a result of powerful environmental projects and disasters: the collusion between Shell Oil and Abacha’s Nigeria, Union Carbide’s explosion in Bhopal, and the use of depleted uranium by an imperially minded US state in the 1991 Gulf War are a few of his case studies. Nixon focuses on what he calls the socio-economic fall-out of these disasters, and the term ‘fall-out’ is key: it refers to the dispersed temporalities and spatialities of environmental violence.</p>
<p>At stake in all these examples and in Nixon’s analytical framework is the temporal (and spatial) boundary-work performed by concepts of environmental disaster and violence. As he writes in response to the use of chemical weapons in Vietnam by the US military, how can we talk about the war ‘ending’ when Agent Orange is still detectable in Vietnamese bodies? In other words, the concepts of postwar, postindustrial, or postdisaster are too often misnomers for vulnerable populations that continue to suffer the temporally extended effects of these ‘events’. This leads Nixon to develop the central concept of his book, ‘slow violence’, as a way of broadening common conceptions of violence as immediate and singular in time and space. He builds on the idea of ‘structural violence’ but with an important twist: Nixon emphasizes change and movement, the extensive temporalities, slow-moving mutations, and imperceptible ecological transformations that are constitutive of modern power structures, through which, as he puts it, ‘time becomes an actor’.</p>
<p>Slow violence poses specific representational challenges for those wishing to expose and contest it. How does one ‘capture’ or apprehend these kinds of gradual and wide-range processes, particularly in a media climate driven at the speed of the internet and captivated by the visibly spectacular? In light of this question (and because he is a literary scholar), <italic>Slow Violence</italic> also investigates the strategies of ‘writer activists’, a category he extends to Ken Saro-Wiwa, Arundhati Roy, Wangari Maathai, Jamaica Kincaid, and even James Baldwin for the ways they strategically dramatize or represent these spatially and temporally unwieldy forms of violence. Each chapter focuses on a particular place and the kinds of violence that come from its relationship to broad structures of capital and imperial power (this generally translates into a powerful set of actors in the Global North and social and environmental devastation for a community in the Global South). Nixon interprets each case study through the lens of one or several writer-activists’ texts and their particular dramatization of slow violence. His most interesting chapter, ‘Slow Violence, Neoliberalism, and the Environmental Picaresque’ (also published in <italic>MFS Modern Fiction Studies</italic> 55 – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309133311431670">Nixon, 2009</xref>) centers on Indra Sinha’s novelistic response to the Bhopal explosion, <italic>Animal’s People.</italic> Sinha represents the slow, cellular drama of toxic exposure as a result of transnational power relations (Union Carbide’s pesticide plant in Bhopal, India) through the protagonist’s deformed body. Bent double from a spinal abnormality, ‘Animal’ symbolizes the threat to the sovereignty of physical bodies and the Indian body politic through Union Carbide’s environmental catastrophe (and its subsequent evasion of responsibility).</p>
<p>Other chapters explore the South African writer Njabulo Ndebele’s account of visiting an eco-tourist lodge in his home country and his reflections on the erasure of brutal histories of dispossession constitutive of many ‘post’ colonial wildlife preserves; the executed Nigerian activist Ken Saro-Wiwa’s diary, <italic>A Month and a Day</italic>, and his strategic depiction of Ogoni dispossession by Shell Oil as a global predicament (‘in virtually every nation-state there are several ‘Ogoni’s’,’ Saro-Wiwa has said); and Rebecca Solnit’s essay on the Nevada test site in <italic>Savage Dreams: A Journey into the Landscape of the American West</italic>, in which she labors to ‘repopulate’ the perceived emptiness of the Nevada desert with the Native American tribes doubly dispossessed (through contamination of their sacred land and their very bodies) through US nuclearism.</p>
<p>Geographers may be frustrated by Nixon’s predominant focus on time and temporality, particularly given the scholarly work in the past few decades on the centrality of space to social processes and power relations. While Nixon is clear that slow violence is an inherently spatial process – as he puts it, ‘by slow violence I mean a violence that is dispersed across time and space’ (p. 2) – his project is primarily concerned with an analytics of temporality (or, in a more sexy phrasing, ‘the politics of speed’, p. 11). And yet this in itself may be beneficial for geographers interested in new forms of ‘time-space compression’. Precision-warfare and human-induced climate change are two examples of modern violences that work at varied scales <italic>and</italic> speeds that are difficult to represent. Perhaps rethinking the temporalities of violence can contribute to better geographic concepts of space and scale. At the very least, Nixon’s underlying predicament: how do scholars and activists ‘make recognizable’ these (out of synch and out of the way) forms of suffering – and in ways that motivate people to <italic>act</italic> – is relevant to a wide range of geographical work.</p>
