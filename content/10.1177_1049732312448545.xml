<abstract>
<p>Little is known about the psychosocial effects of facial disfigurement. We present the results of a qualitative study following 15 patients who had been surgically treated for head, neck, or eye cancer over the course of their first postoperative year. Taped nurse–patient conversations and individual interviews were analyzed using the grounded theory method. The findings revealed that the main concern of the patients was feeling isolated, which was resolved using a process of interactional integration. Interactional integration begins by breaking the silence to enable the progression from a disfigured person to a person with a disfigurement. The model explains the process of adjustment and demonstrates various elements that could be used in interventions targeting patients who experience psychosocial problems.</p>

<body>
<p>Facial disfigurement as a result of surgical treatment for head, neck, or eye cancer has a strong impact on the person who experiences it. Facial disfigurement differs from disfigurement of other parts of the body because it is impossible to cover up and is therefore particularly distressing as it interferes with the patient’s sense of identity and relationships with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312448545">Callahan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312448545">Rumsey &amp; Harcourt, 2004</xref>). Despite improvements in surgical procedures and their decreasingly disfiguring results, people generally look different from the norm after these surgeries, and this difference can persist for quite some time or indefinitely. Surveys have shown that the quality of life (QOL) of these surgical patients is affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312448545">Chandu, Smith, &amp; Rogers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312448545">Fingeret et al., 2011</xref>). Disfigurement and dysfunction resulting from the surgery are often related. Studies have shown that physiological dysfunction is less life altering than psychosocial concerns because patients often learn to adapt to dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312448545">Holloway et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Common problems related to facial disfigurement include depression, social anxiety, and isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312448545">Rumsey &amp; Harcourt, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312448545">Rumsey and Harcourt (2004)</xref> suggested that psychosocial concerns depend on a combination of social and individual factors. Cancer patients often experience a broad variety of bodily changes that can lead to both disfigurement and dysfunction. Although some have argued that posttreatment concerns cannot be viewed unitarily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732312448545">Semple, Dunwoody, George, McCaughan, &amp; Sullivan, 2008</xref>), Clarke argued that studies on facial disfigurement, independent of the medical diagnosis, can promote a better understanding of the difficulties experienced during social interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312448545">Clarke, 1999</xref>). Various intervention approaches targeting the psychosocial concerns of patients have been attempted. Although interventions have been proven to be effective in other cancer patient groups, interventions in patients with facial disfigurement have largely been unsuccessful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312448545">Bessell &amp; Moss, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732312448545">Semple, Sullivan, Dunwoody, &amp; Kernohan, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Because most researchers thus far have utilized quantitative measurements, there was a need for research that describes and explains the psychosocial processes that these patients undergo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732312448545">Rumsey &amp; Harcourt, 2005</xref>). Understanding these processes might provide a foundation for interventions that can improve the QOL of patients with facial disfigurement. A project that focused on investigating the behavioral patterns of patients adjusting to facial disfigurement was initiated. Qualitative research is useful for providing an in-depth understanding of the patients’ points of view, and this approach has been successful in creating a baseline for future interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732312448545">Zoffmann &amp; Lauritzen, 2006</xref>). Previously, we showed that disfigurement silences interactions between patients and professionals during the hospital stay in the immediate postsurgical period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312448545">Konradsen, Kirkevold, &amp; Zoffmann, 2009</xref>). This silencing process occurred in nurse–patient interactions in an otherwise protected environment before the patients were discharged. To learn what happens when patients return to their previous social lives, we followed the same patients and collected further qualitative data. The aim was to gain a better understanding of the ongoing process of how patients learn to live with disfigurement in the first postoperative year after receiving surgical treatment of head, neck, or eye cancer.</p>
<sec id="section1-1049732312448545" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>This was a qualitative study in which we used grounded theory methods for analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312448545">Glaser, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312448545">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>). The approach used was similar to that of several other authors who conducted research following the processes and stages that patients experience as they overcome challenges in health and life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312448545">Halle, Duhamel, &amp; Le, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312448545">Lalor, Begley, &amp; Galavan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732312448545">Taylor, Richardson, &amp; Cowley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732312448545">Wood, Connelly, &amp; Maly, 2010</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-1049732312448545">
<title>Sampling Procedure</title>
<p>The initial sampling took place in the hospital and included patients who had undergone head, neck, or eye cancer surgery. This research has been reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312448545">Konradsen et al., 2009</xref>) and explains the mechanisms of silencing disfigurement. However, in the present study, we investigated the patients’ transitions to everyday life. Therefore, we followed the same patients in a qualitative study using grounded theory methods of analysis. In this study we aimed to gain a better understanding of the ongoing process of how patients learn to live with disfigurement. A preplanned interview guide was not used, to allow the study to be kept open and follow the principles of the grounded theory approach. We remained open to the patients’ responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312448545">Glaser, 1998</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1049732312448545">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The initial data collection involved following 15 nurse–patient dyads while the patients were still in the hospital. These dyads consisted of patients who were admitted to either a surgical ear, nose, and throat department or an eye surgery department between 2007 and 2008 and nurses who were assigned as the patients’ primary caregivers on the day of data collection. The patients ranged from 25 to 78 years of age; 6 were women.</p>
<p>During the initial data collection (Time 1), we asked the nurses to record a conversation while the nurse spoke with the patient about discharge planning or while helping the patient with personal hygiene. We aimed to capture conversations discussing the issue of disfigurement. The duration of the recordings ranged from 10 to 40 minutes. Separate interviews were subsequently conducted with the patients and the nurses. The patients were initially interviewed a few days after surgery so that they could regain sufficient strength and energy to provide informed consent and participate in the study. These separate interviews ranged from 30 to 100 minutes and took place in a hospital room where participants could speak undisturbed with the researcher. During these interviews, the interviewer asked both the patient and the nurse whether any other conversations that they believed to be important had occurred and whether they could retell the conversation.</p>
<p>We then further followed these 15 patients along their trajectories. A second interview was conducted 6 months after the surgery (Time 2) in conjunction with a visit held either at an outpatient clinic or in the patient’s home. Patients were asked where and when they preferred the interviews to take place, and the interviews were accordingly conducted in a quiet room at the hospital or in the patient’s home. Twelve patients participated in the second interview; one from the initial group had died, and two were not physically strong enough to speak with the researcher. The remaining patients took part in the final interview, which occurred one year after surgery (Time 3). The interviews lasted 20 to 60 minutes and were audio-recorded and transcribed by the first author. At Times 2 and 3, the first author asked the patients how they were doing, summarized the previous interview, and asked, “Last time you mentioned. . . . What do you think about that now?” The purpose was to obtain data that would contribute to the constant comparison analysis. To explore emergent themes and ensure constant comparative analysis, the interviewer then asked, “Others have said that. . . . What do you think about that?”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049732312448545">
<title>Data Sources</title>
<p>The question of whether the patients remained disfigured after surgery is subjective, and the degree of disfigurement is difficult to measure. In this study, we considered disfigurement to be present when both the patient and others visually perceived a change. The patients had varying degrees of disfigurement, ranging from small scars after malignant glandule removal to partial removal of the cheekbone. Some participants were experiencing facial disfigurement for the first time, whereas others had previous surgical experience. Conversations were audio-recorded. It was difficult at times to precisely plan a conversation, and the conversations often included interruptions when other patients or professionals came into the room and spoke or did something. We anticipated this issue and asked the nurses to act normally in such cases. The first author listened to the recordings. The content of the interviews included small talk and discussions about physical assessments or practical advice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1049732312448545">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>The first author simultaneously collected and analyzed data. Initially, all data were coded openly, line by line. Substantive codes were identified and compared with categories to detect any similarities and differences. The first author identified the core category in the dialogue with her coauthors and conducted selective coding limited to the variables related to the core category. Finally, the second, third, and last authors were involved in a theoretical coding that conceptualized how the substantive codes related to each other and to the core category. To discover possible links between concepts, we used diagramming as memos and as part of the constant comparison. Other researchers have also found diagramming helpful in the process of clarifying relationships between categories in forms other than a narrative description (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312448545">Artinian, Giske, &amp; Cone, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Throughout the entire process, we constantly returned to the transcripts to ensure that the theoretical explanation was grounded in the data. This process continued until the data were saturated and the subcategories fit within the core category. The rigor within the process of developing a dynamic theoretical model was thus increased based on the core category and subcategories.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1049732312448545">
<title>Rigor</title>
<p>Prior to this study, we had already confirmed through grounded theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312448545">Konradsen et al., 2009</xref>) that our study patients had to meet the world with a silenced disfigurement. To be sensitive to what was happening in the field, a qualitative design was used to follow the original sample from the first study. The aim was to investigate what happened in the daily lives of patients when the shared starting point was a silenced disfigurement. Previous research using questionnaires had determined the specific times in the patients’ trajectories that were especially interesting, and the current study was influenced by this previous research. In this study, the interviews occurred over the span of a year. To ensure rigor in the study, the first author discussed the findings with the second, third, and fifth authors, acknowledging their vast experience as qualitative researchers. Together, all authors determined whether the findings had fit, work, and relevance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312448545">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>). To further test if the research findings explained what was going on, the first author read two autobiographies to examine whether the findings from the research could be recognized in those stories. The first author also presented findings at several meetings with other clinical professionals, discussing relevance, recognizability, and usefulness for practice.</p>

<sec id="section7-1049732312448545">
<title>Ethics</title>
<p>Because participation might have been stressful to more vulnerable patients, all participating patients were assessed by a health professional to ensure that they were physically and emotionally capable of participating in a research interview. Initially, a professional who knew the patient well, usually a nurse, made the initial inquiry about participation, and the researcher then approached the patient to obtain informed consent. Although some nurses were initially doubtful as to whether certain patients would be emotionally able to take part in the study, the patients always gave consent. The patients’ willingness to be involved in this research was consistent with that reported by previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312448545">Gysels, Shipman, &amp; Higginson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312448545">Mathews, Restivo, Raker, Weitzen, &amp; Disilvestro, 2009</xref>). The opportunity for patients to tell their story in an interview has been shown to be a helpful experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312448545">Campbell, Adams, Wasco, Ahrens, &amp; Sefl, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312448545">Holloway &amp; Freshwater, 2007</xref>). Several participants expressed this point of view during the interviews, and some stated that it was helpful to know that they might contribute to the development of better care and treatment for future patients. Prior to the interview, participants were again asked whether they wished to take part in the study. Despite the difficult situations, only two people decided not to participate in a second interview; the lack of participation was attributed to the patients’ physiological conditions. The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Copenhagen and the Danish Data Protection Agency.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>We identified a core category of interactional integration that explains how disfigurement is integrated through the interaction with others. It was evident that the patients had major concerns about being left alone with silencing disfigurements. Patients or others resolved this by breaking the silence and interacting with other people. In the process of integrating disfigurement, patients moved through the following three stages: (a) becoming disfigured, (b) being a disfigured person, and (c) becoming a person with a disfigurement (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049732312448545">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1049732312448545-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The stages occurred in two very different contexts. The first stage occurred in the protected area of the hospital setting, where the patients felt incorporated into a group under a similar situation. The second and third stages took place during the everyday lives of patients in the community, after discharge. Patients were then among other people, and their social lives influenced what happened. In the second stage, there were two psychosocial subprocesses, namely noticing and dissociating. When the patients left the protected hospital setting and returned to their everyday lives, others could not avoid noticing the disfigurement. People responded to the disfigurement with silence. Patients started noticing responses from others and were concerned that their own emotions caused these responses. As a result, patients began dissociating by avoiding, which enabled them to create a space where they felt protected or were able to temporarily forget. There was a constant but fragile alternation between noticing and dissociating, with uncertainty about the pace of movement between the subprocesses. Patients were sensitive to their disfigurement. This response time was short for some patients and as long as a year for others. The transition into the third stage occurred through breaking the silence, either by others or by the patient. Breaking the silence initiated a process of becoming a person with disfigurement, which occurred when the patient had considered the disfigurement and found its effects to be acceptable. This process happened relatively quickly for some, whereas it was a longer process for others, but this final stage was unstable. For instance, external events triggered patient vulnerability that caused regression to the second stage in some situations. In her final interview, a young woman who had an eye removed summarized her period after surgery as follows:
<disp-quote><p>I remember the day when I had the surgery; I just wanted to get it over with. . . . And then you find out that it just does not end, and there is no turning back. I do think some people could have helped me more than they did. . . . My boyfriend sometimes looks at pictures and says, “Look at us and how we were before and how you looked before,” and that is so hurtful, because I absolutely do not want to have my picture taken now. I think to some extent it is probably because I had some difficulty in accepting myself. (Time 3)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<sec id="section9-1049732312448545">
<title>Becoming Disfigured</title>
<p>Postoperatively, the hospital functioned as a protected area where the patients went through the first stage. There, patients were not markedly different from others, as they were among fellow patients with scars. Some patients even consciously maintained the hospital as a protected area. One woman, a single mother with an 8-year-old daughter, felt that her daughter should not visit her until the worst was over: “She has not been here to visit me, I will not have it. She can come when the blood has been washed off and the stitches have come out” (Time 1). In fact, visiting children disturbed the protection, as they were honest and unable to hide their feelings. One instance involved a man who began to cry when remembering a visit by his two grandchildren a few days prior: “My grandchildren came to visit. They just stood in the doorway; they did not want to give me a hug as they usually do when we meet” (Time 1).</p>
<p>The patients’ worries regarding leaving the hospital with a facial disfigurement were not shared by any of the professionals. As such, patient responses were silenced, both as a source of protection and as a means of further silencing the subject of disfigurement when professionals (on an untested basis) assumed that facial disfigurement was not important to patients who had survived a life-threatening disease. Although patients needed social support from others after leaving the hospital, they simultaneously dreaded the responses of others. A woman described how she waited until a friend came, and she dared to go out with him. However, the responses of others were not nearly as frightening as she had imagined: “Well, people do look, but then they smile and say ‘Hi.’ That is—acting happy and positive; there was nothing different at all” (Time 1). Nonetheless, after leaving the hospital, the consequences of the patients’ altered appearances were more prominent. Because facial disfigurement is obvious and creates the basis for first impressions, other people tended to change their behavior toward the disfigured person. This phenomenon marked the beginning of the second stage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1049732312448545">
<title>Becoming a Disfigured Person</title>
<p>Disfigurement was felt in the hospital as visitors from the outside world came to visit, and the act of returning to everyday life accelerated this occurrence. Facial disfigurement was so obvious that it immediately triggered a response from others. The responses, mostly nonverbal in terms of change in behavior, were noticed by the patients. Noticing these responses also meant that patients noticed their own emotions caused by these responses. Noticing a reluctant response was hurtful, as in the case of a man with multiple experiences of disfigurement. This participant reported feeling sad when he noticed how others changed their behavior toward him because they did not know what to say: “Sometimes when you meet people, they are afraid to say anything because they are afraid of hurting you . . . that is a bit sad” (Time 1).</p>
<p>The continued process of silencing was especially hurtful when experienced from those closest to the patient, although the response was perceived as a form of protection. A woman who tried to talk with her parents about her concerns was met with silence and felt that she was not being taken seriously. Consequently, she stopped talking about her disfigurement: “My parents won’t talk about it; I think it is because they do not want to make me feel sad. So then I do not talk about it, either. It feels like they do not take me seriously” (Time 3). Because noticing disfigurement was demanding, patients dissociated themselves from the problem. Sometimes dissociation was achieved by avoidance (i.e., either trying to avoid responses by deliberately altering their appearance or avoiding situations in which noticing would likely be extra demanding). At other times, disfigurement was temporarily forgotten when in a safe social environment or when interacting socially.</p>
<p>Avoidance was used in particular social situations in which the patient remained within safe social interactions. This strategy was sometimes chosen because of previous experiences. After several disfiguring surgical operations and having experienced the situation before, one man chose not to go to a wedding: “I will stay at home; I hate being the center of attention” (Time 1). Another patient expected that merely being confronted by other patients would trigger hurtful feelings and therefore avoided those situations: “I have pushed it away. Going to the patients’ club [for head and neck cancer patients] would just remind me and make me sit there and think about it” (Time 3). For some patients, the use of camouflage was a way of avoiding dealing with others’ responses to the disfigurement. Having the impression that her disfigurement would determine her interactions with other people, one woman covered herself up to avoid that situation: “I always wear a scarf to cover my neck every time I go out” (Time 1).</p>
<p>The quick shift between noticing and dissociating was illustrated by a woman who thought that starting work again would remind her of her disfigurement. A glimpse in a mirror made her notice once again how other people might perceive her as a person with a facial disfigurement. “Sometimes I catch a glimpse of myself in a mirror and then I sort of freeze and think, ‘Oh no!’” (Time 3). A woman described how the shift occasionally almost became a conscious act in a battle between dissociating and noticing: “If someone wants to take a picture of me . . . I have developed a technique of looking down. I must always remember that. When I am with friends, I can almost forget” (Time 3).</p>
<p>The influence of disfigurement continued when patients had multiple disfiguring surgeries. Having undergone a second operation, a young man described how striving to survive cancer can take place alongside interactional integration. Early in the interview, he said, “I do not think it’s too bad. These days, there’s a lot you can do to correct it surgically afterwards—and I mean, I want to live” (Time 1). Later on in the same interview, he talked about his first postsurgery days, noticing the responses of others and that his own emotions affected him and made him reluctant to interact socially: “At first, I did not like to go outside. . . . Of course I get sad if someone says something.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1049732312448545">
<title>Becoming a Person With a Disfigurement</title>
<p>When returning to everyday life, the patients often felt that their partners and close relatives failed to understand what living with disfigurement meant: “I must admit that I have been a bit disappointed in my son, sometimes even angry, for not taking my concerns seriously. I have really wished that family members would understand” (Time 2). The process of breaking the silence, which appeared to be important for moving forward into the next stage of the integration process (i.e., becoming a person with a disfigurement), remedied the feeling of being left alone with disfigurement. The process occurred by explicit verbalization of the disfigurement initiated by the patient or by others.</p>
<p>One patient managed to break the silence himself by proactively forestalling a difficult situation when meeting new people. He introduced himself by immediately explaining his appearance, thereby limiting the influence it might have on further interactions. He “set the scene” for further communication:
<disp-quote><p>I say it straight out when I meet new people, in a tone that will not embarrass them. I say, “My name is so and so, I do not look like this because I was out drinking yesterday.” I have never found that anyone will not talk to me then, although some do take a second glance. (Time 3)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Because his chosen strategy enabled communication with others, the patient continued to follow it. One woman used the first interview with the researcher to break the silence. Having undergone several disfiguring surgeries and having always worn a large scarf to cover her neck and jaw, she said she felt like she was trapped in a prison. Although the researcher only listened to her, this talk functioned as a way of breaking the silence that helped the woman move on and eventually change her behavior: “This summer I have tried going outside in a T-shirt, low-necked and all. It is a pretty wild thing to do. But it looks as though people can accept me as I am” (Time 2).</p>
<p>The power of breaking the silence appeared to be understood by the patients who had the courage to make experiments or contact people who could help them return to their normal life. For example, the woman mentioned above returned to her voluntary work in a secondhand shop: “At first I didn’t think they would want me back, but then the manager said, ‘You’re welcome.’. . . I am doing okay” (Time 3).</p>
<p>One woman pictured what it would be like to take her daughter to school. Putting her daughter’s feelings first, she did not allow herself to forget about her appearance: “I have to wear a hat when I take her to school; she has to get used to how I look as well” (Time 1). At the second interview, the patient spoke about this issue and how, noticing the reactions of the other children, she dared to challenge it by breaking the silence:
<disp-quote><p>Well I got home, and I went to my daughter’s school and told her classmates what had happened. Well, I had to. I have always been very extrovert and used to talk and laugh with all of them. They were almost scared when they saw me for the first time. I told them that I was still me. (Time 2)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Communicating openly with the children had the effect of allowing her to integrate disfigurement:
<disp-quote><p>It had the effect that many children and their parents came up to me and asked, “Why do you have short hair now?” “Why are you wearing that hat?” “Why is your face swollen?” “Did anything happen to you?” and so on. So from that day on, everything became normal. (Time 2)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Regaining the feeling of being a person, albeit a different person than before, for whom appearance played an acceptable role, helped her perceive the future with confidence. While undergoing a process of value clarification, integration was a visible prospect in the future:
<disp-quote><p>About my hair. My boyfriend says, “Wouldn’t you like to have long hair again?” I do not know. I feel okay about this now, I do not think about it. You learn a lot. You learn from having been down there where people couldn’t recognize you. It is only afterwards that you work it out. I have begun to prioritize my life differently now. (Time 2)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Breaking the silence had to occur in a language that the patient could understand. One man, for example, noticed that the size of his neck had increased as a result of lymphedema, but he did not think that this change was particularly visible to others until a doctor at an outpatient visit commented on it. After this, he felt hurt: “She said to me, ‘You have a turkey neck.’ What does she mean by that? It has been irritating me ever since” (Time 2).</p>
<p>Moving toward integration sometimes seemed to have its own natural pace. At the time of her surgery, during which one eye was removed, one woman was married and working in an office. On going back to work, she had the confident feeling that “all things will pass in time”: “It’s getting better. I still think of the prosthesis as a foreign thing attached to my head, but it’s getting better. I think that in another six months I will have gotten used to it” (Time 2).</p>
<p>While trying to integrate her disfigurement to the point at which her appearance could play an acceptable role, one patient confronted an emotionally challenging event when her husband asked for a divorce. Feeling abandoned by the person closest to her, she was pushed back into the stage of being a disfigured person again, and pictured how other men would interact with her as a woman with one eye:
<disp-quote><p>He’s left me. He couldn’t cope with the way the disease had affected me. Maybe I have changed, I do not know. Maybe I haven’t changed enough. . . . Now I have to go out and find a new boyfriend. That’s almost impossible with one eye. (Time 3)</p></disp-quote>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we explored how patients managed to live with facial disfigurement in the first postoperative year after surgical treatment for head, neck, or eye cancer. We found that patients experienced a main concern about being left alone with silencing disfigurements, and these concerns began to resolve when the patients or others broke the silence. Patients then started a process of integrating disfigurement through interactions with other people. They progressed at a variable pace, passing through the following three stages: (a) becoming disfigured, (b) becoming a disfigured person, and (c) becoming a person with disfigurement.</p>
<p>We conducted the study in a Danish context, but we believe that the findings have broad relevance internationally. Because we identified breaking the silence as an important category and asked patients to talk about their changed appearance, we cannot exclude the possibility that we influenced their trajectories. Although we found that the processes of integration occurred at different times in each patient’s trajectory, we confirmed that data collected at 6 months and 1 year postoperatively were sufficient for us to validate the findings across patient trajectories and longitudinally for each individual patient. By following the patients longitudinally, we benefited from the different paces of the patients’ trajectories in the constant comparison of data.</p>
<p>Our study did not include interviews with the patients’ families or close friends, and the study might therefore lack important input. Patients who were affected by the cancer diagnosis to a degree that prevented them from participating in the study were not followed. These patients might have had different opinions about the importance of disfigurement. Improvements in cancer treatment allow an increased proportion of patients to survive cancer surgery, and an increasing number of survivors will therefore have to face the challenges of living with disfigurement.</p>
<p>Patients in the protected setting of the hospital after the surgery did not share their worries with anyone; this contributed to the patients’ feelings of being left alone with a silencing disfigurement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312448545">Bowers (2008)</xref> recommended that patients start socializing during their postoperative hospital stay to experience how others react to them. The hospital could provide a relatively safe place to begin these experiences. Researchers have found that the most common problems related to disfigurement are rooted in social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312448545">Furr et al., 2007</xref>). In a study on information needs prior to surgery, researchers found that head and neck cancer patients returning to normal life reported feeling unprepared for the long-term changes that occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312448545">Newell, Ziegler, Stafford, &amp; Lewin, 2004</xref>). We observed that patients need to experience everyday life and notice the responses of other people as a necessary step in interactional integration when adjusting to disfigurement. We therefore believe intervention is required both during and after discharge.</p>
<p>When patients moved from the protected hospital setting into everyday life, they faced the reality of others’ reactions to their disfigurement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312448545">Anderson and Franke (2002)</xref> stated that the process of accepting disfigurement begins when the fear of death diminishes. In light of this finding, patients remained in the initial unstable space between noticing and dissociating when still threatened by the original diagnosis of cancer. Some of the patients in this study regarded themselves as cured of cancer, whereas others were still concerned about a possible recurrence of the underlying disease. These differing mind sets might have influenced the duration of the process. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312448545">Humphris et al. (2003)</xref> showed that many head and neck cancer patients feared recurrence and that this fear was related to anxiety and depression. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312448545">Hodges and Humphris (2009)</xref> showed that caregivers might be even more worried about recurrence than the patients themselves, which might increase the patients’ tendencies to silence disfigurement in their social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312448545">Konradsen et al., 2009</xref>). In a psychosocial process called <italic>transitional cancer survivorship</italic> identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732312448545">Miller, Merry, and Miller (2008)</xref>, the patients tried to adjust from acute survivors to extended or permanent survivors. It is not surprising that the ability to deal with emotions and responses from others varied over time. The variable pace and the ongoing, dynamic elements in the process might also be explained by the prominent facial disfigurements. Regardless of how well patients adjust, social situations in which they will be reminded of their disfigurement will always be encountered.</p>
<p>As several researchers have described, the patients in our study might have noticed the responses in social encounters during the phase of being a disfigured person. Such responses are behaviors or rules of social conduct that differ from the “norm” (e.g., a greater standing distance; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732312448545">Rumsey, Bull, &amp; Gahagan, 1982</xref>), staring and comments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312448545">Hagedoorn &amp; Molleman, 2006</xref>), or differences expressed in “silent language” such as body movements and gestures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312448545">Macgregor, 1990</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732312448545">Vickery, Latchford, Hewison, Bellew, and Feber (2003)</xref>, disfigurement influences how people perceive themselves, perceive others, and engage socially. Some patients isolate themselves because of fear of others’ reactions (Hagedoorn &amp; Molleman). The tendency of patients to use avoidance as an element of the dissociation of disfigurement might be a result of actually having experienced hurtful emotions after noticing the responses from others or imagining hurtful events in the future.</p>
<p>The patients increased their awareness of identity throughout the process of learning to live with disfigurement, and thereby showed that they adjusted to an altered sense of self, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312448545">Callahan (2004)</xref>. In a study of facial surgery, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312448545">Furness, Garrud, Faulder, and Swift (2006)</xref> named the process of adaptation <italic>coming to terms</italic>. When patients integrate through interaction, we accordingly see it as a social process that contributes to identity change, leaving the patients with a new self-image. In a number of studies, researchers have described the experience of cancer as identity challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312448545">Maliski, Rivera, Connor, Lopez, &amp; Litwin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312448545">Pascal &amp; Endacott, 2010</xref>), and have suggested that this change might have a strong impact on the patients’ relationships with close relatives and friends. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312448545">Hodges, Humphris, and Macfarlane (2005)</xref> indicated in a meta-analysis that early psychosocial intervention can prevent psychological distress in patients and caregivers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312448545">McLean et al. (2008)</xref> argued that we need to study interventions that could support both patients and caregivers. We argue that the findings of our research can provide a basis for such an intervention both in the hospital setting and after discharge.</p>
<p>The question of whether adjusting to facial disfigurement after surgical cancer treatment is different from adjusting to other sequelae of cancer treatment is untested; however, in this study, events that could trigger a shift back to noticing after successful dissociation were somewhat related to the visibility of the disfigurement. The study included patients with various degrees of visible change. Even minor facial scars have been shown to have a significant psychological impact on the self-consciousness of some patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732312448545">Tebble, Thomas, &amp; Price, 2004</xref>), which might explain why the process of noticing occurred independently of the degree of visibility of the facial disfigurement.</p>
<p>QOL studies indicate that patients stabilize their self-reported values after one year, but at a lower level than before the cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312448545">Abendstein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312448545">Murphy, Ridner, Wells, &amp; Dietrich, 2007</xref>), though these figures exhibit a large degree of variation. Social self-efficacy has been shown to mitigate the positive link between facial disfigurement and feelings of isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312448545">Hagedoorn &amp; Molleman, 2006</xref>) and might explain why the pace of adjustment was so variable and why the ability to interact socially was included when accepting disfigurement. Other reasons might be associated with the presurgical personality of the patient. For example, optimism can be a predictor of high QOL values after treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312448545">Horney et al., 2011</xref>). Other factors include the patient’s gender and the presence or absence of a supportive social network; men with a poor social network are at the greatest risk of experiencing low QOL after treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312448545">Karnell, Christensen, Rosenthal, Magnuson, &amp; Funk, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312448545">Llewellyn, McGurk, &amp; Weinman, 2005</xref>). Similar to this, the presurgical personality and choice of coping mechanism have been shown to be associated with postsurgical experiences of QOL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312448545">Aarstad, Aarstad, &amp; Olofsson, 2008</xref>), which are elements that were not investigated in this study.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Integrating disfigurement and learning to resocialize into society with a changed appearance are great challenges for cancer patients. The findings presented in this article represent a model of interactional integration of disfigurement, and suggest an empirically derived explanation for why breaking the silence is crucial to leaving the stage of being a disfigured person and entering the stage of becoming a person with a disfigurement. The model thereby also provides elements that, along with other research results, can form a basis for developing a successful intervention program that targets patients with psychosocial problems because of a disfiguring surgery.</p>
