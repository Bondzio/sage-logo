<abstract>
<p>A rapidly growing literature indicates that supportive social relationships are associated with better physical and mental health. However, this research further reveals that interaction with others may also be conflicted and unpleasant. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate negative interaction that arises within a social context that is important to many older Mexican Americans (i.e., negative interaction with a member of the clergy). Findings from a nationwide survey of older Mexican Americans indicate that more frequent interpersonal conflict with a member of the clergy is associated with less favorable self-rated health as well as more acute and chronic health conditions. However, these effects were observed among older Mexican American women but not among older Mexican American men.</p>

<p>A vast literature indicates that individuals who are embedded in supportive social networks tend to have better physical and mental health than people who do not maintain close interpersonal ties with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0739986313478998">Cohen, 2004</xref>). However, as this research began to evolve, it quickly became evident that social relationships are not always positive, and that social interaction may sometimes become conflicted, undesirable, and unpleasant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0739986313478998">Rook, 1984</xref>). Studying negative interaction is important because findings from a growing number of studies indicate that greater exposure to interpersonal conflict is associated with less favorable self-rated health (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0739986313478998">Newsom, Mahan, Rook, &amp; Krause, 2008</xref>), greater difficulty with physical functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0739986313478998">Krause &amp; Shaw, 2002</xref>), and more symptoms of depression over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0739986313478998">Lee, Hankin, &amp; Mermelstein, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>So far, most of the research on negative interaction has been conducted with members of the general population. And even when efforts are made to assess the effects of negative interaction on health in different racial or ethnic groups, investigators have focused solely on African Americans (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0739986313478998">Lincoln et al., 2010</xref>). The purpose of the current study is to see if negative interaction is associated with health among older Mexican Americans. In the process, an effort is made to contribute to the literature in two potentially important ways.</p>
<p>First, the analyses that are presented below assess negative interaction that arises with a member of the clergy. Research indicates that greater negative interaction with fellow church members exerts a deleterious effect on health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0739986313478998">Krause &amp; Wulff, 2005</xref>), but fellow church members make up only part of the social milieu of a congregation. Clearly, members of the clergy play a major role in the social life of the church, but relatively few studies have focused on informal social relationships with members of the clergy. And there do not appear to be any studies that assess the relationship between negative interaction with the clergy and health even though there is some evidence that interpersonal conflict can arise between members of the clergy and rank-and-file church members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0739986313478998">Krause, 2003a</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, researchers have argued for decades that the social networks that are maintained by women are larger and more supportive than the social networks that are maintained by men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0739986313478998">Umberson, Chen, House, Hopkins, &amp; Slaten, 1996</xref>). There is also some evidence that women experience more negative interaction than men and they appear to be more emotionally responsive to these negative interpersonal encounters than their male counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0739986313478998">Beals &amp; Rook, 2006</xref>). However, there do not appear to be any studies that assess gender difference in the relationship between negative interaction with a member of the clergy and physical health status. We aim to address this gap in the knowledge by seeing if older Mexican American women are more vulnerable than older Mexican American men to the potentially deleterious effects of interpersonal conflict with a member of the clergy.</p>

<title>Negative Interaction With the Clergy and the Physical Health Status of Older Mexican Americans</title>
<sec id="section2-0739986313478998">
<title>Negative Interaction With a Member of the Clergy</title>
<p>There are three reasons why older Mexican Americans may find that negative interaction with a member of the clergy is unsettling. First, as a number of researchers maintain, Mexican American culture is collectivist in nature and collectivist cultures place an emphasis maintaining harmonious relationships with in-group members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0739986313478998">Triandis et al., 1986</xref>). It is especially important to note that this collectivist orientation may be found in the places where Mexican Americans worship, as well. Research reveals that the wide majority (about 80%) of older Mexican Americans affiliate with the Catholic Church (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0739986313478998">Fernandez, 2007</xref>). The collectivist nature of Catholic congregations in the Mexican American community was captured succinctly by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0739986313478998">Goizueta (2002)</xref>, who argues that “. . . what Euro-Americans find most striking about Mexican American popular Catholicism [is] its decidedly communal character” (p. 121). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0739986313478998">Goizeuta (2002)</xref> goes on to point out that the, “. . . community is the very source of personal identity. Individuals are not building blocks of community; community is, instead, the foundation of individual personhood” (p. 122). If the collectivist orientation in Mexican American culture permeates the places where they worship, then older Mexican Americans should be likely to find that negative interaction with their pastors is disturbing.</p>
<p>Second, as the core tenets of expectancy theory suggest, reactivity to negative interaction with the clergy may involve more than this. Viewed broadly, expectancies refer to beliefs that people hold about a future state of affairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0739986313478998">Olson, Roese, &amp; Zanna, 1996</xref>). This theoretical perspective would suggest that people have certain expectancies or beliefs about the way they will be treated by their fellow church members. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0739986313478998">Krause (2008)</xref> points out, these expectancies are shaped to a significant extent by the formal tenets of the faith, which emphasize loving other people and taking care of those who are in need. Researchers have argued for decades that members of the clergy play a unique role in the church: they hold a position of authority, trust, and respect and they are expected to adhere more closely to the fundamental tenets of the faith than rank-and-file church members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0739986313478998">Lenski, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0739986313478998">Stark &amp; Bainbridge, 1987</xref>). So if older Mexican Americans expect their pastors to treat them with love and respect, then they may be deeply hurt when they encounter negative interaction with a member of the clergy instead. And as research with expectancy theory reveals, people will become psychologically distressed when the expectancies they embrace have been shattered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0739986313478998">Olson, Roese, &amp; Zanna, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, unlike rank-and-file church members, the clergy are perceived not as individuals, but as agents of the institution. So when negative interaction with a clergy member arises, it is likely to foster doubt in the institution and perhaps even doubt in religion itself. This is important because a longitudinal study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0739986313478998">Krause and Ellison (2009)</xref> suggests that greater religious doubt is, under certain circumstances, associated with less favorable self-rated health.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0739986313478998">
<title>Gender Differences in the Effects of Negative Interaction With the Clergy</title>
<p>There are two reasons why older Mexican American women are more likely than older Mexican American men to find that negative interaction is distressing. First, research reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0739986313478998">Beals and Rook (2006)</xref> indicates that boys are socialized to be more competitive and self-focused whereas girls are taught to be more communal and relationship focused. There is some evidence that these gender role socialization practices have been traditionally instilled in Mexican American culture, as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0739986313478998">Pavich, 1986</xref>). So if older Mexican American women are socialized to be more attuned to social relationships and they encounter negative interaction with a member of the clergy, then it follows that they should be more disturbed by this interpersonal conflict than older Mexican American men.</p>
<p>Second, recall that negative interaction with the clergy may be especially unsettling because the core tenets of the faith lead people to expect that significant others at church will love and care for them. However, this effect should be especially evident among those who adhere more closely to religious teachings should be the most vulnerable. There is some evidence that older Mexican American women are more deeply involved in religion than older Mexican American men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0739986313478998">Krause &amp; Bastida, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0739986313478998">Levin &amp; Markides, 1986</xref>). So if people who are more deeply involved in religion are more likely to be troubled when negative interaction arises and if older Mexican American women are more religious than older Mexican American men, then negative interaction with a member of the clergy should exert a more deleterious effect on older Mexican American women.</p>

<sec id="section4-0739986313478998">
<title>Negative Interaction With the Clergy and Health</title>
<p>One of the primary functions of religion is to provide people with a sense of meaning in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0739986313478998">Hood, Hill, &amp; Spilka, 2009</xref>). This is important because research indicates that a strong sense of meaning in life is associated with a range of health outcomes including better self-rated health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0739986313478998">Krause, 2004</xref>), enhanced psychological well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0739986313478998">Steger &amp; Frazier, 2005</xref>), a lower risk of experiencing major depression and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0739986313478998">Sternthal, Williams, Musick, &amp; Buck, 2010</xref>), the adoption of beneficial health behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0739986313478998">Homan &amp; Boyatzis, 2010</xref>), and avoidance of alcohol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0739986313478998">Krause, 2003b</xref>). Moreover, there is some evidence that people with a strong sense of meaning are able to cope more effectively with stressful life events than individuals who do not have a strong sense of meaning in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0739986313478998">Krause, 2007</xref>). We suspect that a sense of meaning is likely to be compromised when religious authority figures (i.e., clergy members) violate core religious precepts by engaging in negative interaction. And the end result may therefore be more physical health problems.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section6-0739986313478998">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>The data for this study was collected under the supervision of the first-listed author. The population for this study was defined as all Mexican Americans aged 66 and over who were retired (i.e., not working for pay), not institutionalized, and who spoke either English or Spanish. The sampling frame consisted of all eligible study participants who resided in counties in the following five-state area: Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, and California. The sampling strategy that was used for the widely cited Hispanic Established Population for Epidemiological Study (HEPESE) was adopted for the current study (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0739986313478998">Markides [2003]</xref> for a detailed discussion of the steps that were followed). All interviews were conducted by Harris Interactive (New York). The interviews were administered face-to-face in the homes of the older study participants. All interviewers were bilingual and study participants were given the opportunity to be interviewed in either English or Spanish. The wide majority of interviews (84%) were conducted entirely in Spanish. A total of 1,005 interviews were completed successfully. The response rate (i.e., the number of completed interviews over the number of eligible individuals) was 52%.</p>
<p>Negative interaction with a member of the clergy forms the focal point of the current study. When this study was being designed, the members of the research team felt that it did not make sense to ask study participants about interpersonal conflict with the clergy if they either don’t attend church at all or if they rarely go to church. Consequently, questions on negative interaction with the clergy were not administered to older study participants who indicated that they go to church services no more than once or twice a year (<italic>N</italic> = 342). After deleting these study participants from the sample, and after using listwise deletion to deal with item nonresponse, the analyses presented below are based on the responses of 604 to 636 older Mexican Americans (i.e., item nonresponse was no higher than 9.1%).</p>
<p>Preliminary analysis with the sample of 636 older study participants revealed that their average age was 74.5 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 6.2 years), approximately 39% were older men, 57% were married at the time of the interview, and 76% indicated that they affiliate with the Catholic Church.</p>

<sec id="section7-0739986313478998">
<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section8-0739986313478998">
<title>Self-Rated Health</title>
<p>A brief composite of self-rated health was created by summing responses to two questions. The first asked study participants to rate their overall health at the present time while the second asked them to compare their health with that of people their own age. These items are coded so that a high score denotes more favorable self-rated health. The correlation between the two measures is 0.429 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The mean is 4.9 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.3).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0739986313478998">
<title>Acute and Chronic Health Conditions</title>
<p>The older participants in this study were presented with a checklist that contained 13 acute and chronic health problems. A summary measure was created by adding the number of conditions that respondents said they experienced in the 12 months prior to the interview. Preliminary analysis suggests that the older Mexican Americans in this study have an average of 2.7 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.8) acute or chronic health conditions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0739986313478998">
<title>Negative Interaction With the Clergy</title>
<p>Three items that were developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0739986313478998">Krause (2002)</xref> were used to assess how often the older people in this study felt their pastor was critical of them, disagreed with them about how money was spent in their church, and failed to provide support when they were counting on it. A high score represents more frequent negative interaction with the clergy. The mean of this brief composite was 3.3 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.7). The internal consistency reliability estimate was 0.605.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0739986313478998">
<title>Religion Control Variables</title>
<p>Three indicators were used as religious control measures in the analyses presented below. The first deals with the frequency of church attendance, the second has to do with the frequency of private prayer, and the third reflects whether an older study participant affiliates with the Catholic Church (1 = affiliates with the Catholic Church; 0 = otherwise). The measures of church attendance and prayer were coded so that high score means more frequent religious involvement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0739986313478998">
<title>Acculturation</title>
<p>A measure of language acculturation was included in the analyses for the following reason. According to the theoretical rationale that was developed for the current study, older Mexican American women may be more vulnerable to the effects of negative interaction with the clergy because traditional gender role norms specify that women should be more attuned to interpersonal relationships than men. However, research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0739986313478998">Kranau, Green, and Valencia-Weber (1982)</xref> suggests that Mexican Americans who are more acculturated tend to have more liberal attitudes about the role that women should play. Therefore, a measure of language acculturation was included in the study models to take these variations into account.</p>
<p>Three indicators were used to assess language acculturation. The first had to do with the language that was used during the interview, the second assesses whether study participants prefer to speak Spanish with family members and close friends, and the third determines how often older respondents watch TV programs that are in Spanish. A high score stands for greater use of the English language. The mean was 4.6 (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.3). The reliability estimate for this brief composite was 0.812.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0739986313478998">
<title>Demographic Control Measures</title>
<p>The relationships among the variables that have been discussed up to this point were estimated after the effects of age, gender, and marital status were controlled statistically. Age is coded continuously in years. In contrast, gender (1 = men; 0 = women) and marital status (1 = currently married; 0 = otherwise) were scored in a binary format.</p>

<title>Data Analysis Strategy</title>
<p>The relationships between negative interaction with the clergy, gender, and the two health outcomes were evaluated with a hierarchical regression analysis. A hierarchical regression analysis was performed because the main hypothesis for this study specifies that there will be a statistical interaction effect in the data between negative interaction with the clergy and gender on the health outcomes. Tests for the proposed statistical interaction were performed in two steps. First, the measures assessing interpersonal conflict with the clergy, gender, and the control variables were entered into the model in Step 1. In the second step, a multiplicative term was added to the model. This cross-product term was created by multiplying negative interaction with the clergy by gender. Following the recommendations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0739986313478998">Aiken and West (1991)</xref>, all independent variables were centered on their means prior to estimating this equation.</p>
<p>If the hypothesis that was developed for this study is valid, then the pernicious effects of negative interaction with the clergy on health should be stronger for older Mexican American women than older Mexican American men. Three formulas were used to interpret and evaluate statistically significant interaction effects to see if they were consistent with this view. The first formula, which comes from the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0739986313478998">Aiken and West (1991</xref>, p. 12), provides unstandardized regression coefficients that represent the relationship between negative interaction with the clergy for older Mexican American women and (separately) older Mexican American men. The second formula, which also comes from the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0739986313478998">Aiken and West (1991</xref>, p.16), provides <italic>t</italic>-tests that assess whether these estimates are different from zero. The third formula produces standardized regression estimates for the coefficients that are derived from the first formula that is discussed above.</p>

<p>The data in the first column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0739986313478998">Table 1</xref> (see Model 1) indicate that for the sample taken as a whole, negative interaction with the clergy does not appear to exert a statistically significant effect on the self-rated health of older Mexican Americans (β = −0.078; n.s.). The same appears to be true when the measure of acute and chronic health conditions serves as the dependent variable (β = 0.075; n.s.—see Model 1). Taken at face value, these estimates would seem to suggest that interpersonal conflict with the clergy is not associated with the health of older Mexican Americans. However, as tests for the statistical interaction between negative interaction with the clergy and gender reveal, this may not be an appropriate conclusion.</p>
<p>The data in column two (see Model 2 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0739986313478998">Table 1</xref>) reveal that the proposed interaction between interpersonal conflict with the clergy and gender is statistically significant (<italic>b</italic> = 0.513; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; unstandardized regression coefficients are discussed when presenting interaction terms because the standardized estimates are meaningless in this context). Applying the formulas provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0739986313478998">Aiken and West (1991)</xref> helps clarify the nature of this interaction effect. More specifically, the data (not shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0739986313478998">Table 1</xref>) indicate that negative interaction is associated with less favorable health ratings among older Mexican American women (β = −0.196; <italic>b</italic> = −0.357; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), but not older Mexican American men (β = 0.085; <italic>b</italic> = 0.158; n.s.).</p>
<p>Essentially the same pattern of findings emerges when acute and chronic health conditions serve as the outcome. As the data in column three of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0739986313478998">Table 1</xref> reveal (see Model 2), the interaction effect between interpersonal conflict with the clergy and gender on acute and chronic health conditions is statistically significant (<italic>b</italic> = −0.567; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Subsequent computations (not shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0739986313478998">Table 1</xref>) with the formulas provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0739986313478998">Aiken and West (1991)</xref> indicate that older Mexican American women who encounter more negative interaction with a member of the clergy indicate they suffer from more acute and chronic health conditions (β = 0.164; <italic>b</italic> = 0.418; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). However, a statistically significant relationship between negative interaction with the clergy and acute/chronic health conditions failed to emerge among older Mexican American men (β = −0.058; <italic>b</italic> = −0.148; n.s.).</p>

<title>Supplementary Analysis</title>
<p>There are actually two ways to think about the way in which negative interaction with the clergy may exert a greater effect on older Mexican American women than older Mexican American men. The first has to do with the fact that older Mexican American women may encounter more negative interaction with the clergy in the first place. Second, rather than being exposed to more negative interaction, older Mexican American women may be more vulnerable to its effects. A preliminary test of the differential exposure view was conducted by estimating the correlation between gender and negative interaction with the clergy. This simple test suggests that older Mexican American women do not encounter more negative interaction with the clergy than older Mexican American men (<italic>r</italic> = 0.001; n.s.). When coupled with the findings presented above, these data indicate that instead of being exposed to more negative interaction with the clergy, older Mexican American women appear to be differentially vulnerable to it.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A substantial number of studies suggest that greater involvement in religion is associated with better physical and mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0739986313478998">Koenig, King, &amp; Carson, 2012</xref>). However, this research suffers from at least two problems. First, the wide majority of these studies have been conducted with either whites or African Americans while far less attention has been devoted to assessing the relationship between religion and health among Mexican Americans, especially those who are older. This is unfortunately because recent demographic predictions indicate that older Mexican Americans will soon surpass older blacks to become the largest ethnic group of older people in the nation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0739986313478998">Vincent &amp; Velkoff, 2010</xref>). Second, although greater involvement in religion may convey certain health benefits, most researchers have overlooked the fact that there is a “dark side” to religion and that certain aspects of religious life may be associated with more physical and mental health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0739986313478998">Ellison &amp; Lee, 2010</xref>). The purpose of the current study was to address both gaps in the literature by seeing whether negative interaction with the clergy is associated with physical health problems among older Mexican Americans.</p>
<p>The findings suggest that more frequent interpersonal conflict with a member of the clergy is associated with less favorable self-rated health and more acute and chronic health problems. However, the data further indicate that these potential health-related effects emerge only among older Mexican American women and not among older Mexican American men.</p>
<p>Even though we do not have the data to pursue these findings further, it may nevertheless be helpful to speculate on why older Mexican American women are more vulnerable to the effects of negative interaction with the clergy. These results may be driven by two factors. First, as discussed earlier, women are socialized to be more attuned to social relationships than men. This suggests that women may therefore be more vulnerable to interpersonal conflict when it arises in the church. Second, research reveals that women tend to occupy subordinate roles in the church (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0739986313478998">Heyer-Grey, 2000</xref>). This research reveals that men are more likely do things like lead prayers or read from the Bible during worship services while women are more likely to clean the church, staff the nursery, and cook church meals. Perhaps this subordinate status leads members of the clergy treat men and women differently. More specifically, they may “talk down” to women while “talking straight” to male members of the congregation.</p>
<p>Although the findings from the current study may contribute to the literature, a considerable amount of research remains to be done. A number of potential intervening mechanisms were identified earlier that may help explain how the noxious effects of negative interaction with the clergy may arise. For example, gender role socialization practices, expectancies regarding social relationships in the church, and meaning in life were evoked for this purpose. However, measures of these constructs were not included in the analyses that were presented above. Consequently, a high priority should be placed on seeing whether these factors help explain why negative interaction exerts a pernicious effect on health and whether they provide insight into why older Mexican American women appear to be more vulnerable to the effects of negative interaction with the clergy than older Mexican American men.</p>
<p>In the process of delving more deeply into these issues, research should pay careful attention to the limitations in the current study. One shortcoming is especially important. The findings that are reported in this study are based on data that have been gathered at a single point in time. Therefore, the relationship between negative interaction with the clergy and health was based on theoretical considerations alone. As a result, it is possible to propose that older Mexican Americans who initially suffer from physical health problems subsequently encounter more interpersonal problems with a member of the clergy. This issue must be more fully addressed with data that have been gathered at more than one point in time.</p>
