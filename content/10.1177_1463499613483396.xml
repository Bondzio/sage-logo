<abstract>
<p>This essay explores the semiotic processes by which speakers attribute sensuous qualities – e.g. lightness, dryness, straightness and others – to speech registers. Language ideologies create indexical relations linking linguistic forms to typical personae, activities and values in social life; they also construct other semiotic relations that enable speakers to attribute taste, texture, smell, sound, or shape to speech. Such extended, cross-modal, sensuous metaphors are taken up as lived experience, as part of larger frameworks of cultural value. By extending several Peircean concepts, the essay shows how speakers become persuaded that such sensuous properties of speech are existentially real. Two pedagogical genres from 19th and 20th century Hungary illustrate how properties of speech are reproduced, either via explicit instruction or as displayed in the parallelism of narrative. Both genres construct speech qualia as constitutive moves in moral and political projects that become more persuasive through the display of valued qualia.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1463499613483396"><title>Introduction<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1463499613483396">1</xref></sup></title>
<p>Sensuous qualities are often attributed to linguistic varieties by those who use them. Indeed, linguistic forms are frequently identified and objectified – that is, construed as separable units – on the basis of qualitative contrasts that they conventionally display for some group of people. This is clearest when metapragmatic labels for speech forms are drawn from a lexicon of qualities: ‘<italic>Hard</italic> words’ among the Kaluli, ‘<italic>plain</italic> speaking’ in American politics, ‘<italic/>talking <italic>straight</italic>’ among Jewish Israelis. Such terms always occur in contrast sets: Kaluli contrast hard with unhard; American plain speaking excludes what is deemed florid. Contrastive lexicons of quality may distinguish different versions of entire languages: ‘Catalan <italic>light</italic>’ and ‘Catalan <italic>heavy</italic>’ in Barcelona, ‘<italic>narrow</italic>’ vs. ‘<italic>embroidered</italic>’ Bergamasco in northern Italy, ‘<italic>sweet</italic> Hindi’ in a Fijian Indian community, ‘<italic>upside-down</italic> Walbiri’ or Tamil that is ‘<italic>Jasmine-scented</italic>’. These are characterizations from the perspective of those who use the speech forms. Qualities may also be projected onto speech by outsider perspectives: English speakers say they hear Italian as <italic>soft</italic>, German as <italic>harsh.</italic> For intellectual men in 19th-century Japan, schoolgirls’ speech was <italic>sugary, shallow</italic> and <italic>bouncing</italic>; Beijingers identify some of their own Mandarin as <italic>oily</italic> in contrast to southern speech, while the speech of trendy young people in Dublin sounds <italic>flat</italic> to other Dubliners.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1463499613483396">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>In these and many similar examples, linguistic forms seem to partake of abstract qualities associated with sense modalities including sound, texture, taste, smell, shape and spatial orientation. These are imputed to quite various aspects of difference in speech and practice: sounds, discourse markers, rhetorical form, grammar, lexicon, and others. Conversely, abstract properties that are said to characterize forms of speech are seen as typical attributes of objects and experiences in other media, ones that are recognized to have different physical properties than speech. Kaluli admire adult speech as <italic>hard</italic>. Mature teeth and bones are also valued for their hardness. <italic>Unhardness</italic> is devalued; it is characteristic of things that are immature or overly mature and decaying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1463499613483396">Feld and Schieffelin 1982</xref>). As Nancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1463499613483396">Munn (1986)</xref> has argued, contrasts in qualities of sense experience, enacted across many modalities and in diverse media, are key to wide-ranging systems of cultural value. Clearly, linguistic forms are often swept up in such systems. It is less obvious how contrasts in taste, smell, texture or shape are made palpable and persuasive to speakers as qualities of speech, or how speech comes to be experienced as similar to, say, food, cloth, and other objects or built forms.</p>
<p>My goal in this essay is to explore some of the semiotic processes by which such sensuous metaphors – qualitative similarities across modalities and media that are derived from or extended to linguistic practices – are created and made existentially real to speakers. I draw on three of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1463499613483396">Peirce’s (1940)</xref> intersecting semiotic trichotomies to analyze the cultural construction of such similarities: First, his distinctions among icon, index, and symbol differentiate the way signs are related to the objects they represent, always within some uptake or ideological framework. As a second distinction, Peirce proposed that a sign relation may be represented as iconic rather than indexical (or both), depending on presuppositions in the discursive framework (interpretant) through which it is interpreted. Finally, in a third trichotomy, he considered signs to differ in their ‘degree of reality’. In Peirce’s usage, qualities (Firsts) are ‘abstract potentialities’ that can be experienced only when embodied in material occurrences and objects (Seconds). Real-time instantiations of abstract qualities are necessarily shaped by conventions (Thirds), that is, by cultural categories. The embodied, conventional and hence experience-able forms of abstract qualities he termed ‘qualia’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1463499613483396">Peirce 1998 [1903]</xref>). These can become signs. These are what I called ‘attributed qualities’ in the earlier examples. This last set of distinctions provides clues to how qualities are experienced, but has not been much explored in studies of linguistic variation.</p>
<p>In the next section, I discuss ways that the three sets of distinctions do different yet intersecting analytical work. Then I turn to two brief examples of this intersection that suggest how perceived sensuous qualities of linguistic forms are identified and put to social uses. Qualities of speech, projected onto social categories, emerge from and are harnessed to political projects. The justification or explanation for those projects – their ability to motivate action – hinges in part on the taken-for-granted, self-evident experience of contrasting qualities and the values that such qualities signify.</p>
<p>The first example takes up the writings of a late 19th-century Hungarian publicist who gave his readers precise instructions on how to experience the Magyar language as different in qualities from other European languages. He pointed to specific aspects of linguistic form that he claimed were also palpable in other areas of life. The second example is the analysis of a brief conversation I recorded in the 1990s in a German-Magyar bilingual town of southern Hungary. In retrospect, this too was a genre of instruction. An elderly woman showed me how to hear a qualitative difference between two registers of German. Significantly, language was not the topic of our talk; the interaction was part of her moral project, explaining villagers’ actions during the Second World War. Yet, the textual parallelisms evident in her narrative revealed, through contrast, the conventional qualia of food which were also considered characteristic of the two linguistic varieties. Hence my title: tastes of talk. The juxtaposition of these two cases highlights different sites at which ideological frameworks are evident: Qualia may be named in metapragmatic discourse. In addition, conventionalized qualities (qualia) can be displayed and made palpable in the poetics of interaction even if they are not labeled nor widely discussed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1463499613483396"><title>Icons, rhemes, qualia</title>
<p>That linguistic forms are endowed by speakers with sensuous qualities typical of other media than speech is, of course, not news. Yet, the ubiquity and frequency of this phenomenon would not have been so obvious in the past, when my list of examples would have been divided into separate categories of variation such as standard languages, geographical and social dialects, ritual and political registers, accents and styles. The phenomenon becomes striking when, for purposes of analysis, all these fit within the broad concept of register (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1463499613483396">Irvine 1990</xref>). Recent work on enregisterment has focused on <italic>indexical</italic> aspects of the process. Combinations of signs, linguistic and otherwise, are unified by a metasign (e.g. a metapragmatic label) and function as a register when their distinction from other such combinations is typified and recognized by a population of language users as indexical of particular categories of space, time, and personae, along with their imputed characterological attributes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1463499613483396">Agha 2007</xref>). Registers are reflexive models that are invoked in interaction, so that social types are not only performed but also troped upon, via creative indexes, in real-time speech activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1463499613483396">Silverstein 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to this key focus on indexicality, the sign relation of iconicity has also been important in conceptualizing registers. Icons are signs that represent by being taken as in some way similar to their objects. So the question is: How are registers similar to the speakers they index and hence represent? Like indexes, icons too must be picked out, formulated and conventionalized within metapragmatic, language ideological, frameworks. As philosophers have long argued, similarity (iconicity) never simply inheres in objects, whether the objects are linguistic, cultural or more broadly material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1463499613483396">Goodman 1971</xref>). Phenomena are similar to each other within or by virtue of some frame of relevance. Speech and speech forms, like other materialities, have innumerable potentially noticeable properties. In any actual, sociohistorical case, some potential material qualities are ignored or denied while others become the focus of individual, circumstantial or cultural attention. Some properties come to be recognized, elaborated, and sometimes conventionalized within a particular framework or perspective.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1463499613483396">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Put another way: It takes an active ideological, hence semiotic, process to create a similarity, and the necessary concomitant of similarity: differentiation. Judith T. Irvine and I have emphasized that similarities (iconic relations) are construed in the context of differentiations. Registers are the products of contrast, of differentiation. Two (or more) sets of personae (and times, places, events), each indexed by a linguistic form, are perceived as parallel indexicalities. Two or more such indexicalities are similar in that they have the same relations among their parts. They constitute a diagrammatic icon. As Irvine and I have argued, in construing diagrammatic icons, a semiotic process characteristic of language ideologies makes ‘linguistic features that index social groups or activities appear to be iconic representations of them… picking out qualities supposedly shared by the social image and the linguistic image’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1463499613483396">Irvine and Gal 2000</xref>: 37). We have dubbed this process <italic>rhematization</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1463499613483396">Gal 2005</xref>), drawing on the second set of Peircean distinctions mentioned earlier, in which a <italic>rheme</italic> is ‘a Sign which, for its interpretant, is a Sign of qualitative possibility, that is, is understood as representing such and such a kind of possible Object’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1463499613483396">Peirce 1940</xref>: 103). Parmentier clarifies: ‘rhemes are signs whose interpretants represent them as being icons’ (1994: 17). In short, the relation of sign and object is taken to be not (only) indexical but (also) a similarity. The concept of rhematization captures the way registers that are taken up as indexes of social personae from one ideological perspective can also be construed as icons, or can be construed as icons in another ideological frame.</p>
<p>For example, Western Europeans considered a variety of linguistic practices in the early 20th century to be indexical of (pointing to) Macedonians, in contrast to their own conventional image of themselves as (ideally) monolingual. Western observers also took a further step: Presuming their own forms of monolingualism to be the natural practice, Westerners perceived Macedonian linguistic practices as chaotically heterogeneous and assumed this reflected a similar disorderliness in Macedonian society and psyches, again in contrast to their own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1463499613483396">Irvine and Gal 2000</xref>: 64–5). In other words: starting with a set of established indexicalities, Western observers picked out a perceived contrast in the qualia of the signs (here: chaos/heterogeneity in Macedonian linguistic practice vs. orderliness in Western practice) and looked for qualitatively similar objects for each such sign (here: ‘discovering’ that object as a supposed chaos in Macedonian society and psyche, in contrast to Western orderliness). Peirce’s emphasis on ‘possibility’ highlights the speculative aspect of this process: From the Macedonian perspective, the iconic sign’s ‘object’ attributed to them – chaos in mind or society – was not a property of Macedonians at all but an ideological projection by others. Yet it was experienced by Westerners as a reality and shaped Western policy in the Balkans.</p>
<p>In the creation of such sign-object similarities, a further semiotic step deserves more attention: What exactly counted as ‘chaos’ in speech and psyche? How do some features of linguistic and social phenomena come to ‘count as’ exemplars of some abstract quality, for some speakers?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1463499613483396">4</xref></sup> Actually existing events or objects are identified as instantiations of the shared abstract quality, and thus are taken as iconic signs of each other. The third Peircean distinction conceptualizes how abstract qualities are linked to experience-able, conventionalized qualia. Cultural stories about resemblances are important, but not enough. Systematic and institutionalized forms of instruction also provide guidance that allows social actors to pick out and perceive some acts or practices as real-time instances of a quality, and thus to be able to enact and possibly contest and transform them. Observers can document how participants learn what aspect of practices instantiate or embody the same quality in diverse media. Several forms of such ‘instruction’, which demonstrate how abstract categories can be recognized in multi-media experiences, are illustrated in my two examples. In each case a further question is raised, to which I shall return: why do these speakers care at all about the qualia of speech?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1463499613483396"><title>Qualia of Magyar in Europe</title>
<p>Perhaps the most popular journalist of Hungary at the end of the 19th century was Rákosi Jenő (1848–1929), also poet, editor, and playwright. It was during his lifetime that those who struggled to make multilingualism the norm in multi-ethnic, multilingual Hungary were definitively defeated and the hegemony of Magyar was assured. Budapest became largely Magyar-speaking for the first time, and Rákosi was part of this process. He was born into a German-speaking family and educated in German until he encountered Magyar linguistic nationalism as an adolescent in the 1860s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1463499613483396">Sajó 1930</xref>). During that decade, after the failed revolution of 1848 against Austria, the Hungarian political class and their erstwhile enemies in Vienna reached a power-sharing agreement known as the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. As a result, Viennese suppression of cultural production in Hungary ceased and intellectual life in Hungary opened up again for those who embraced a Magyar-centered yet moderate nationalist line, perhaps especially if they hailed from non-Magyar-speaking families. In journalism, Rákosi took up many topics, but arguably his favorite was the Magyar language, for which he advocated tirelessly.</p>
<p>Writing in Magyar, as an amateur linguist, he addressed educated readers, elaborating and popularizing widespread views. In an 1882 magazine piece, <italic>A nyelv kultusza</italic> [The worship/cult of the language], Rákosi claimed Magyar to be superior to two highly prestigious languages of Europe: German and Italian. He judged Magyar to be more <italic>nyugodt</italic> [calm], <italic>logikus</italic> [logical], and <italic>egyszerű</italic> [simple]. To do this, he reminded his readers that German and Italian have stress patterns ‘jumping every which way’, with ‘swallowed’ and ‘bitten off’ syllables. Magyar, he wrote, is not fancy [<italic>cifra</italic>] with diverse stress patterns, but rather hits the first word hard and lines up the rest in a ‘dignified tempo’ [<italic>méltóságos tempóban</italic>]. Unlike the ‘despair-inducing’ variations in German and Italian vowels and their ‘unbelievably ground down’ consonants, Magyar vowels are clear, matched within words, high with high, low with low. The consonants, when they occur together, are also matched to each other, lined up in order, according to place of articulation. Inflectional patterns also show Magyar’s calmness and logic. While the verbs of German and Italian are twisty and turny [<italic>csavarodott</italic>], and the root word is ‘broken into’ [<italic>töri át</italic>] and ‘bent’ [<italic>hajlitják</italic>= they bend it, inflect it], Magyar retains the wholeness of words, attaching one suffix after the other to the main verb.</p>
<p>These differences – but without the qualitative valuations – were noted by language experts at the time and continue to be recognized by linguists as features of Magyar. The organization of suffixes described by Rákosi makes Magyar an agglutinative language, the phonological ordering he alludes to is usually called vowel harmony, the prosody relies on a regular, initial-syllable stress pattern. In these ways Magyar is recognized to differ from most other European languages, including German and Italian.</p>
<p>In addition to linguistic features, Rákosi described the kinds of houses in which, by stereotype, German and Italian were spoken. The imagined houses and languages were typified; abstract qualities were said to be shared by each pair of language + house type. Analytically we can see that the contrasting pairings of a language as index of a house-type (and vice versa) formed a diagrammatical icon. In that configuration, a rhematizing move recast each such pair of language + house type as in contiguity and sharing some similar quality, thus iconic of each other. Rákosi constructed that similarity. In a further step, he made the constructed similarity palpable and persuasive as experience by guiding his readers to qualia they could locate for themselves in visual and aural modalities, in the media of speech and housing.</p>
<p>Thus, calmness, order and simplicity were not only attributed to Magyar in contrast to German and Italian; readers were instructed in how to ‘find’ these qualities in actually occurring speech and in visible or recallable houses. Ignoring features that would fail to distinguish Magyar from German and Italian, Rákosi focused on grammatical and architectural details that did contrast and that could be construed or constructed as instantiations of the abstract qualities. Just as the verbs of Italian and German are twisty and turny, he wrote, and their stress irregular, so it is ‘well-known’ that the houses in which their speakers live have turrets, juttings out, rambling compartments, combined any which way. The regularity of Magyar stress and the linear order of Magyar agglutination, he asserted, are matched by the Magyar peasant house, where – he rightly pointed out – the ordering of functional spaces is (ideally) always the same. As ‘everyone has seen’, he wrote, the living quarters in Magyar farm houses are on the street and behind these, always in this order, are the stable, the pigsty, the chicken coop, the doghouse.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1463499613483396">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>A familiar European theory of national types in language and culture inspired Rákosi’s writings. Human characteristics – calm Magyars vs. excitable Italians – unified his model. As Rákosi went on to explicate, the properties of national linguistic forms are stamped on the minds of speakers and hence on all they create. In this way, the theory seemed to explain the similarities that it enabled Rákosi to pick out and thus ‘find’.</p>
<p>One must ask why the qualities of calm, logic and simplicity seemed apt to Rákosi when, during his period, as in earlier eras, Magyars were widely thought by many to be ‘fiery’ and likely to ‘die by the sword’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1463499613483396">Stanzel 1999</xref>). Clearly, at the end of the 19th century, the qualities typical of Magyars were matters of dispute and politically significant. One would want to know what political stances were supported by each image, and I will return to this question below. But whatever the dynamics of the political scene, an understanding of the role of linguistic stereotypes implies, as prerequisite, the analysis in focus here: how discussions of linguistic forms and their properties can prepare speakers to find specific qualia in their own speech, their artifacts and selves, and thereby make one rather than another set of political actions and positions more congruent and comprehensible experientially.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1463499613483396"><title>German registers in Bóly, Hungary</title>
<p>The conventions for construing qualia of speech need not be the topic of discourse, as in Rákosi’s didacticism. In my second example, evidence of instruction is found at another site of ideology. Qualia of food, speech and personae were arrayed as parallel during a brief interaction recorded in the 1990s. It is through the interaction that they were displayed as similar in quality. The incident was part of my education, as much in local politics as in local linguistic stereotypes.</p>
<p>The ancestors of current residents in the town of Bóly/Bohl migrated to southern Hungary from German-speaking territories in the mid-18th century. Currently, about half of the 5000 people of Bóly are descendants of those original migrants. This part of the population is bilingual in German and Magyar, although younger people are more fluent in Magyar, the national language. For the elders – born before 1925 – their sense of linguistic difference is focused <italic>not</italic> on German and Magyar but on what they call their two German languages (M: <italic>nyelv,</italic> G: <bold><italic>sproch</italic></bold>), named after stereotypical speakers: farmer’s speech (M: <italic>paraszti</italic>, G: <bold><italic>schwäwisch, bäuerisch</italic></bold>), as opposed to artisan’s speech (M: <italic>iparos,</italic> G: <bold><italic>handwerkerisch</italic></bold>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1463499613483396">6</xref></sup> Although all migrants are considered descendants of the same early settlers, these two complementary social types were seen to be vastly different on the basis of their values, type of work and consequent way of life. From the 1870s to the 1950s, when the system was destroyed by communist rule, the two metapragmatic linguistic labels organized a moiety-like model of society that typified and institutionalized distinctions among personae, activities and forms of expression. The exemplars of the distinction were rich artisans and rich farmers, whose leadership was justified by their embodiment of contrasting, admired values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1463499613483396">Kovács 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1463499613483396">Gal 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>In the model, artisans valued knowledge of the wider world gained by traveling for apprenticeships across Austria-Hungary. Farmers valued land and the restraint in consumption that would allow its accumulation. For farmers, talking contrasted with real (farm) work, while for artisans, speaking with a wide array of customers and other skilled craftsmen was a crucial part of their expertise and hence of work itself. The frugality of farmers and what we might call the connoisseurship of artisans were legendary. Creating and inhabiting these stereotypes, during the heyday of the system in the 1920s and 1930s, rich farmers ate amply but their food varied little, and the women wore dark, distinctively local dresses and kerchiefs; for celebrations they always hired brass bands playing German ‘folk’ music. Rich artisans, by contrast, delighted in exploring novel styles and varying their housing, clothing, and food. They extended their entertainment to ‘Gypsy’ musicians and jazz bands. Neither perspective accepted the judgments of the other. The existence of the poor – those lacking land and workshops who made up most of the town – was ignored or neglected (erased) in the focus on the dominant model that contrasted artisans and farmers.</p>
<p>Registers of German – Bäuerisch and Handwerkerisch – also seemed to display these co-constitutive cultural principles. Neither variety was primary; both were stigmatized in the schools, which taught in Magyar. Everyone understood both registers and could, on occasion, speak at least a bit in both registers, voicing, troping on, sending up or merely quoting roles they did not claim to inhabit. The two registers differed in lexicon and in frequency of phonological, lexical and syntactic features, as described by linguists for other settlements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1463499613483396">Wild 2003</xref>). In the Handwerkerisch of Bóly, a wider variety of address pronouns, titles, and degrees of politeness were in use than in Bäuerisch; and it was said that when Magyar was new to Bóly, at the end of the 19th century, artisans were more likely to learn it and borrow from it. In short, the two registers indexed not only different personae but different times (past/future) and places.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1463499613483396">7</xref></sup> Values like expressive restraint (sticking to the old) and elaboration (liking variety and the new) had their linguistic counterparts, many of which together created cultural images of personae. Artisans and their speech were most frequently characterized by all as G: <bold><italic>now’l</italic></bold> (fancy), while farmers were said to be <bold><italic>echt</italic></bold> (genuine, real), or <bold><italic>echt schwäwisch</italic></bold> (real Swabian). As an articulate and observant old farmer said: ‘The farmers have tradition, the old customs; the artisans always want the new, they want to be better than us.’ His ironic tone made it clear: No farmer would credit the artisans’ claim.</p>
<p>The semiotic form of this folk model is familiar: two registers each indexed a range of cultural objects, images and activities. Two sets of indexical relations in contrast formed a diagrammatic icon: the parts of one analogous to the parts of the other. Rhematization occurs in the context of such conventionalized diagrammatic icons so that in some aspect of each indexical relation, participants can find not only a contiguity but also an imagistic similarity. Ideological frameworks, explanatory stories, narratives of origin guide participants in how to pick out and construct such similarities, thereby creating iconic relations. In Bóly, the values of elaboration and restraint were instantiated in linguistic qualia, for instance, as I have suggested, in the relatively greater number of variants in certain practices of Handwerkerisch. But I also expected sensuous contrasts such as those instanced in the examples that opened this paper. Over many months of fieldwork I asked and listened in vain for these.</p>
<p>This is where a segment of talk with a woman of about 70 and her 50-ish daughter proved revealing. In the summer of 1997, sitting in the kitchen of the elderly Kati néni,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1463499613483396">8</xref></sup> matriarch of a formerly wealthy farming family, I was asking her about land inheritance. Even though there had not been land or other property to inherit for over 50 years – all land holdings and workshops were lost under communism – this and other features of the interwar years were a hot topic in the 1990s, in Bóly, as in the national press. The fall of communism provided a chance to discuss the earlier era more openly, especially the positive role of the German national group in Hungary’s 18th and 19th century history, contrasting with a quite troubled, more recent past in the 20th century.</p>
<p>After the Second World War, German-speakers in Hungary had been accused of war crimes and deported/expelled in large numbers, without trial. Roughly half of Bóly was forcibly resettled in east or west Germany. During the war, many people in Bóly had joined the <bold><italic>Volksbund</italic></bold>, a Nazi organization that recruited among Germans in Hungary as part of the war-time alliance between Nazi Germany and Hungary. But there were also many German speakers in Bóly who refused these efforts, claiming loyalty to Hungary. After the war, amidst official government condemnations and recriminations – all designed to distance post-war communist Hungary from its own brutal wartime past – the issue of the expulsions, and of who had joined the Volksbund and why, had remained a lively if hidden topic in Bóly and other German settlements. Finally, in the late 1980s and ’90s the stories could be retold even to outsiders in ways previously suppressed by fear of official censure.</p>
<p>Therefore, it should not have come as a surprise to me that in talking about inheritance in the interwar period (in German) Kati néni needed no transition as she launched into a story (partly in Magyar) about the expulsions and an impoverished woman who had joined the Volksbund. Her daughter saw the connection between these two topics immediately. She muttered a kind of caption for her mother’s story: <italic>Hitler széditette őket</italic> (Hitler hoodwinked them [the poor]). Kati néni’s own summary of her point came later: <italic>mert ő nem azért volt volksbund mer ő a Hitlert éltette hanem ő valami jobbat, hogy ő is hogy, hogy jobban éljenek, úgy gondolták hogy könnyebb lesz az életük</italic> (because she [the poor woman] did not become a Volksbund [member] to support Hitler, but for something better, to live better, they thought their lives would be easier). This explanation was a commonplace in Bóly. The daughter had certainly heard the story before. The narrative’s action-clauses consisted entirely of reported speech in German: the impoverished woman’s hysterical announcement that they were all going to be expelled, forcibly resettled, followed by Kati néni’s shocked incredulity.</p>
<p>More revealing for our purposes than the action-clauses is the orientation that begins the story and which divides into two parts. The orientation is transcribed and glossed in the following extract. The analysis of such a text segment would usually start with attempts to interpret the codeswitching between Magyar and German forms. But I propose that we consider first how the significance of those variants is made evident through the poetics of the text. I have therefore organized the transcript unconventionally to display the parallelisms that underpin the story and, I argue, ultimately undermine the narrator’s explicit version of its import. In the center of the page and underlined are the chronotopic labels – types of persons, key activities, times, and locations – that are made parallel and juxtaposed by the narrative itself. These are thus easy to locate as one scans down the transcript.</p>
<p>The first part of the orientation introduces a time, ‘the expulsion’ and the characters: ‘these people’, the ‘Volkbund’, the ‘day-wagers’. These latter are landless people doing farm work for daily wages. All these terms are parallel and in contrast with ‘farmers’ for whom they work and on whom they rely for free services. One might expect that a cultural system that assigns values according to forms of work might well align farmworkers with farmers. Hence the significance of the further information that this poor family, like other ‘such poor nobodies’, later worked not only for ‘farmers’ but also for ‘rich artisans’. Farm activities are named in Magyar, artisanal work in German, perhaps highlighting that they are very different kinds of work. The narrative has only two categories of highly valued people: ‘farmers’ and ‘rich artisans’. The poor (‘nobodies’) who are pointedly shown doing both kinds of work, are not said to be ‘working’ at all, but ‘scraping’ together a house. They belong in neither category of what is presented here. Rather, they are pointedly excluded, here as everywhere, from the town’s major axis of differentiation, the farmer/artisan distinction. Despite the ostensible focus on a poor woman and her family, the story itself accomplishes their social irrelevance, their erasure.</p>
<p>The second part of the orientation follows after the daughter’s interjection, in which she provides the caption for the story. This second part is where the scene is set spatially, and the narrator also appears as a figure – rich farmwife – who lives at the top of a hill, while the poorer woman lives at the bottom and brings the terrible announcement. The narrator describes what she herself, a character in the story, was doing at the moment she heard the news. The elderly narrator’s aside (marked by arrows in the transcript) about what she was cooking, makes the story vivid. It shows the intrusion of a brutal, now historical event into an everyday domestic one. But for the purposes of my analysis, and I suggest perhaps for the narrator as well, its significance lies in two other features. First, as I will show, it once again brings the farmer/artisan distinction into central place. Second, it introduces a set of contrasting qualia – in both food and speech – that instantiate the otherwise rarely discussed sensuous differences between the categories of farmer and artisan.</p>

</p>
<p>The transcript segment marked with arrows focuses on reflexive commentary about a Magyar term – <italic>palacsinta –</italic> used also in Handwerkerisch<bold><italic>.</italic></bold> It names a food delicacy made of eggs, flour, milk and water, ideally paper-light, much like the French <italic>crêpe</italic>, which it resembles. It is usually filled with sweets, and has long been famous all over Austria-Hungary and further afield, where artisans are said to have traveled to expand their horizons and increase their craft knowledge. There is no distinctive term for this dish in Bäuerisch. <bold><italic>Pfannakucha</italic></bold> is a farmers’ term for a somewhat similar dish best glossed as pancake, thought by German speakers in Bóly to originate in western Germany, like the settlers themselves. In this segment, then, contrast in food-type and lexicon indexes and invokes contrasts in typified personae and space.</p>
<p>The utterance of the Magyar term, <italic>palacsinta,</italic> is immediately followed by a striking self-repair. This consists of several simultaneous shifts: a switch to German, increase in speech volume, change in prosody, and a command. These changes produce the effect of another and imperious voice ordering the narrator to use a different term: (‘Never palacsinta, pfannkucha is said!’) The next line continues in German to explain why <italic>palacsinta</italic> was neither said nor cooked. The explanation has a high concentration of Bäuerisch features, including a verb form that is a shibboleth of Bóly’s Bäuerisch register [kann ge + V-t]: ‘We could never have made <italic>palacsinta</italic> it was way too fancy.’ And ends with another command: ‘<bold><italic>Pfannkucha!</italic></bold>’ The descriptive term used here, <bold><italic>now’l</italic></bold> (fancy), is the most common characterization of the artisan category. The voice in Bäuerisch – the typified voice of the rich farmers – commands rejection of the making/saying of palacsinta as ‘fanciness’. Obedience to the voice figurates or enacts the farmers’ rejection of (fancy) artisan values, thus exercising its own central value of restraint. The close co-occurrence and hence indexical linkage among speech registers, person-types, foods and even space-time are displayed – not denoted – by the parallelisms of the story. They are available for uptake by those with the requisite cultural framework, who understand the town’s moiety system.</p>
<p>‘Fanciness’ as an abstract quality was one way of talking about the general stylistic elaboration that was thought typical of artisans. How is this turned into more clearly sensuous experience? What counts as its instantiation? In this story-segment, the qualia of <italic>palacsinta</italic> are presumed to be generally known, those of <bold><italic>pfannakucha</italic></bold> are described by the narrator for the outsider. The two dishes are made of the same ingredients, cooked and filled the same way. Yet they are said to differ in qualia: <bold><italic>pfannakucha</italic></bold> are denser and thicker than <italic>palacsinta.</italic> Note the parallels: Just as the two types of people are understood to be of the same origin or stock, so the foods are made of the same ingredients. Yet the two categories of foods, like the matching categories of people, differ in crucial ways. And these differences are presented in lexical, phonological and syntactic forms that are themselves contrasted: identified as Bäuerisch on the one hand and Handwerkerisch/Magyar on the other.</p>
<p>The diagrammatic icon formed by the simultaneous contrast of people types, linguistic forms, and food types allows for rhematization. Listeners instructed to experience <bold><italic>pfannakucha</italic></bold> as denser and thicker are also implicitly invited – by the force of analogy – to pick out the same contrasts of qualia in the similarly contrasting speech forms used to describe the scene and its personae. In the case of speech, Bäuerisch palatalizes sibilants where Handwerkerisch does not, in preconsonantal or morph-final positions, as in <bold><italic>erst</italic></bold> vs <bold><italic>erscht</italic></bold> (first), <bold><italic>anders</italic></bold> vs <bold><italic>andersch</italic></bold> (other). It typically lowers medial vowels where Handwerkerisch does not: B: <bold><italic>steck</italic></bold>, H: <bold><italic>stick</italic></bold> (piece). Such differences could well be ‘heard’ as thickness and denseness, or taught to be construed in that way. As I have noted, these descriptive terms – translated here as ‘dense’, ‘thick’ – were never used to characterize people, though the analogy in this narrative clearly makes that attribution. I suspect that today these terms are not flattering, and may be avoided in earshot of outsiders. In the interwar period they doubtless had the positive connotations of strength and endurance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1463499613483396">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>My observations so far concern the parallelisms created in the narrative, through the events recounted. If we turn now from story told to the story-telling event, we can see the continuing yet changing significance of these co-occurring contrasts. The use of Magyar suggests this is a species of pedagogical event. Kati néni herself was educated in Magyar only; her daughter was also educated entirely in Magyar; she is speaking to younger people, who are stereotypically expected to know Magyar better. With my presence, the story was surely expected to circulate further in Hungary. Rather than answering my questions about inheritance, Kati néni sketched the interwar stereotypes and enacted – through that domineering and intrusive voice of self-repair – the experience of living under the discipline of the farmer/artisan contrast. To be sure, the striking change in prosody and volume of that command, <bold><italic>Pfannakucha</italic></bold>!, suggest double voicing. She was representing but also somewhat parodying farmers of the past for policing each other about trivialities. Yet, in the story, by representing her own enactment of the strict rules, she is shown to be an obedient instantiation of the system, different than the day-waging woman who was neither farmer nor artisan.</p>
<p>Listeners are invited to infer from the details of this narrative that it was not only poverty that made the day-wager susceptible to what is now seen as the dubious morality of Nazism. It was also, decisively, her social marginality. In Hungary, starting in the 1990s, a public discourse supported a revisionist narrative of the Second World War and a revalorization of the previously stigmatized German minority in Hungary. Implied in Kati néni’s story was a parallel, local revisionism: Only those outside the town’s discipline succumbed to the temptations of the Volksbund. Projecting the interwar farmer/artisan model as an image not only of social order but also of moral discipline and orderliness, this elderly narrator echoed the national discourse of the 1990s. As an interactional move, the story instructs the ethnographer to see the narrator as iconic of that old moral order, so that she and her proper, moiety-sustaining, town <italic>must have been</italic> against the Nazis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1463499613483396">10</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec5-1463499613483396" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Scholars of linguistic variation have been notably successful in showing how registers are created when language ideologies construct indexical sign relations linking typified linguistic forms to typical personae. Indeed, whole models of social life linked to speech styles can be picked out as differing within such a contrast set. I have emphasized how these indexical relations also enable speakers’ attribution of sensuous qualities to their own and others’ speech practices. Qualities drawn from diverse modalities – taste, texture, smell, sound, shape – are projected onto speech varieties and matched with other cultural objects and media such as food and built form. All three of Peirce’s semiotic trichotomies help us understand precisely how such extended sensuous metaphors are created and taken up as lived experience. Diverse instructional genres guide speakers to recognize qualia of speech, and to perceive them as existentially real and thus to make them powerful motivators of action.</p>
<p>Defining the properties of speech is an endeavor that always partakes of speakers’ broadly moral <italic>projects</italic>. Sometimes the imputation of qualities can be analyzed, following Nancy Munn’s classic work, as a cultural system in which the impetus to increase one quality over another explains the logic of multiple activities and practices. But my examples show that such cultural frames are reproduced as they are called upon by speakers – in realtime interactions or writings – for use in frankly political, time-sensitive and often adversarial projects.</p>
<p>Rákosi, the publicist, was conscious of participating in a battle not only for the hegemony of Magyar in Hungary but also for the definition of its qualities. These could justify a place for the Magyar-led state within the monarchy and in Europe. And, as noted above, there was no unanimity about its qualia. Calmness and orderliness, presented as signs of high value, were in direct contrast with the images of Magyar offered by Austrian elites who feared further revolutions. Ironically, the Austrian image of Magyars as ‘poised to fight’ and easily aroused matched the qualia preferred by those Magyar elites who would have participated gladly in another uprising. The contrast, therefore, was not only Magyar as against German and Italian as languages but also, at the same time, a more subtle conflict about the Magyar language waged among Magyar elites. One could explore these rivalries and their politico-military-administrative consequences through the representations of the Monarchy’s ethnic groups in newspapers, encyclopedias and ethnographic writings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1463499613483396">11</xref></sup> The semiotic processes by which qualia were projected onto cultural activities would have to underpin any such effort.</p>
<p>A more complex process is instanced in my second example. For Kati néni, the display of artisan and farmer qualia – as speech, food, and character – was reproduced from a distant past for current use, in the process of staking a position in the politics of the moment. Kati néni’s story is a self-justifying claim, valorizing not any linguistic registers but rather an entire moiety-system. Through that evoked model, stereotypes of ‘good’ and ‘bad’ Germans, as defined in the mass media of the 1990s, could be implied and made present, yet remain unnamed. They are enacted on the local scene and made evident within the storytelling event. Projects that instruct about qualia occur in elderly farm women’s discourse, just as in that of nationally famous intellectuals. Both require us to attend to the justification, explanation and motivation of action through semiotic processes that reproduce frameworks for ‘finding’ qualia, thereby bestowing value on everyday material objects, including speech.</p>

Harkness (this issue) describes how a single sound gained its qualie.

<fn id="fn3-1463499613483396"><label>3</label><p>Even the most apparently self-evident material qualities of speech – such as the character of sounds – are filtered through cultural frameworks. See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1463499613483396">Silverstein (1994)</xref> for a discussion of how ‘sound symbolism’, far from being universal, is mediated for native speakers by a particular language’s phonological structure as well as cultural principles of discourse practice. Although in the US most speakers of all regions experience southern accents as being somehow ‘slower’ than northern ones, linguists’ counts of speed in articulation rarely show such differences. Other features and their ideological construal explain the effect. On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1463499613483396">Irvine (1990)</xref> shows that when stereotypes are enacted, the resulting performances can produce effects that are measurable even by those outside the cultural system.</p></fn>

<fn id="fn5-1463499613483396"><label>5</label><p>Just as Rákosi ignored the many features that the Magyar language shares with German and Italian, so he ignored the shared features of house norms and stereotypes.

<fn id="fn6-1463499613483396"><label>6</label><p>In further examples italics signal Magyar and bold italics all kinds of German, with English glosses in parentheses, if these are necessary. The transcription of Magyar is in standard spelling. For German transcription I have adopted the partly conventionalized system most often used for writing what the relevant scholars call Ungarndeutsch (i.e. the non-standard German forms spoken in Hungary). It deliberately allows for easy reading by non-specialists by relying on some standard German spelling rules, and is quickly learned by native speakers of the local forms, who were my transcribers. Distinctions between the farmers’ and the artisans’ registers are most often matters of frequency and degree and are discussed but not specially marked in the transcription.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn7-1463499613483396"><label>7</label><p>I have not detailed the spatial aspect, which is certainly present: German in Hungary is called <bold><italic>schwäwisch</italic></bold><italic>,</italic> on the basis of the mythical source of the migrants from Swabia in the German lands. Historical evidence shows that they came from many different regions, very few from Swabia, but the story lives on. There is a further conceit, supported by many intellectuals and some linguists, that the speech of artisans originates from their travels in Austria and thus has a different source, despite the shared origin of the speakers themselves. The most detailed linguistic work rejects this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1463499613483396">Hutterer 1991</xref>).</p></fn>
