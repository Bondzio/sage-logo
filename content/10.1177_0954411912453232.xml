<abstract>
<p>The hamstrings are considered stabilizers of the anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knee; however, anterior cruciate ligament injury primarily influences tibiofemoral kinematics near full extension, where the hamstrings have the least influence on kinematics. Ten knees were tested at multiple flexion angles <italic>in vitro</italic> to directly compare the influence of anterior cruciate ligament injury and hamstrings activation on tibiofemoral kinematics. Tibiofemoral kinematics were measured for three testing conditions: (1) anterior cruciate ligament intact, with forces applied through the quadriceps muscles (596 N), (2) anterior cruciate ligament cut, with forces applied through the quadriceps, and (3) anterior cruciate ligament cut, with forces applied through the quadriceps and hamstrings (200 N). Based on repeated measures comparisons performed at each flexion angle, cutting the anterior cruciate ligament significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) increased tibial anterior translation, medial translation, and internal rotation at 0° and 15° of flexion by approximately 2.5 mm, 1 mm, and 2°, respectively. Internal rotation also increased significantly at 30°. With the anterior cruciate ligament cut, loading the hamstrings significantly decreased anterior translation, medial translation, and internal rotation at 45°, by approximately 2 mm, 2 mm, and 4°, respectively. Loading the hamstrings caused kinematic changes in the opposite direction of the anterior cruciate ligament injury, but the changes occurred at deeper flexion angles than those at which anterior cruciate ligament injury influenced tibiofemoral kinematics.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury alters tibiofemoral kinematics and contact. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies with simulated muscle loads have indicated that ACL injury tends to increase the anterior and medial translation of the tibia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912453232">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411912453232">2</xref></sup> as well as the internal rotation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411912453232">3</xref></sup> and valgus rotation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411912453232">4</xref></sup> <italic>In vivo</italic> studies utilizing computational reconstruction and dual-plane fluoroscopy have also shown increased anterior translation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411912453232">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912453232"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411912453232">7</xref></sup> medial translation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912453232">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411912453232">7</xref></sup> and internal rotation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912453232">6</xref></sup> owing to ACL injury during various activities. These previous studies have indicated that the variations in kinematics related to ACL injury primarily occur with the knee near full extension. The altered kinematics, and the resulting altered tibiofemoral contact,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411912453232">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411912453232">9</xref></sup> are believed to contribute to early osteoarthritis that is common following ACL injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411912453232">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411912453232">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The role the hamstrings can play in stabilizing ACL-deficient knees is unclear. While <italic>in vivo</italic> studies have indicated that hamstrings activation increases following ACL injury,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411912453232">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411912453232">13</xref></sup> the increased activation typically has not improved the ability of patients to cope with an ACL injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411912453232">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411912453232"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411912453232">16</xref></sup> Computational studies performed to simulate knee function have provided conflicting information, with studies showing activation of the hamstrings both can<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411912453232">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954411912453232">18</xref></sup> and cannot<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954411912453232">19</xref></sup> restore normal tibiofemoral anterior translation following ACL injury. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have shown that forces applied by the hamstrings decrease anterior translation, internal rotation, and valgus rotation of the tibia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954411912453232">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954411912453232"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954411912453232">22</xref></sup> producing kinematics changes in the opposite direction of those caused by ACL injury. Unlike ACL injury, however, the influence of the hamstrings has typically been smallest near full extension, which could be a primary factor limiting the ability of hamstrings activation to correct abnormal kinematics caused by ACL injury.</p>
<p>The current <italic>in vitro</italic> study focuses on the influence of hamstrings loading on tibiofemoral kinematics within ACL-deficient knees. Unlike previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, the current study was performed to directly compare kinematics changes caused by ACL injury with those caused by activation of the hamstrings at multiple flexion angles. The hypothesis of the study is that ACL injury and hamstrings activation influence tibiofemoral kinematics at different flexion angles.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Ten cadaveric knees from ten separate donors were tested <italic>in vitro</italic>. Each specimen was examined with an arthroscope to exclude knees with ligament injuries or exposed bone within the tibiofemoral joint. The median age was 80 years (range 52–88 years), with five male and five female donors. Each knee was stored at −20 °C prior to dissection. Dissection was performed to remove skin and subcutaneous tissues, with the ligaments of the knee, the joint retinaculum, the patellar tendon, and the tendon attachments for the quadriceps muscle group; the semimembranosus and the biceps femoris was left intact. The tendon attachments for the quadriceps were separated into the vastus medialis obliquus (VMO), the vastus lateralis (VL) and the combination of the vastus intermedius/vastus medialis longus/rectus femoris (VI/VML/RF). The VML was grouped with the VI and RF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954411912453232">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954411912453232">24</xref></sup> owing to the fiber orientations of the VML and VMO differing by approximately 30°.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954411912453232">25</xref></sup> The fibula was secured to the tibia with a cable tie.</p>
<p>Each knee was secured to a previously evaluated testing frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411912453232">Figure 1</xref>) with the femur oriented horizontally.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954411912453232">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0954411912453232">26</xref></sup> A smooth rod made of garolite was inserted into the tibial diaphysis. The tibial rod was passed through a slot in a nylon fixture on a plate that controlled the flexion angle. Each knee was tested with the plate positioned to set the tibiofemoral flexion angle at approximately 0°, 15°, 30°, and 45° of flexion. Contact between the tibial rod and the slotted fixture held the flexion angle, but the rod was free to slide and rotate within the slot, leaving no constraint for the other tibiofemoral degrees except for the relatively low friction between the rod and the slotted fixture. The knees were kept moist with 0.9% saline solution while on the testing frame.</p>

<p>The ACL was sectioned using a scalpel and dry arthroscopy without altering the fixation of the femur to the testing frame. Forces were applied through the quadriceps and hamstrings muscles using a weight-and-pulley system, with the loading cables secured to straps sutured into the tendons. The cable for the VI/VML/RF was aligned along the axis of the femoral shaft. The VMO cable was oriented approximately 47° medial to the long axis of the femur in the coronal plane, with the VL cable oriented approximately 19° lateral to the same axis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954411912453232">25</xref></sup> The VMO and VL cables also represented the anatomical orientation in the sagittal plane. As described previously, forces were applied to produce a physiologically realistic extension moment and distribution of forces among the muscles of the quadriceps group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954411912453232">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0954411912453232">26</xref></sup> The VI/VML/RF, the VL, and the VMO were loaded to 420 N, 116 N, and 60 N, respectively. When loaded, the cables for the semimembranosus and the biceps femoris were parallel to the femoral shaft,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954411912453232">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954411912453232"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954411912453232">22</xref></sup> with 100 N applied through each muscle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954411912453232">22</xref></sup> based on a previously measured ratio of quadriceps to hamstrings forces during weight-bearing knee extension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954411912453232">27</xref></sup> on a dynamic knee simulator.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954411912453232">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>The position and orientation of the tibia with respect to the femur were characterized for each test. Sensors from a pulsed d.c. magnetic tracking system (trakSTAR, Ascension Technology, Burlington, VT) were secured to the femur and tibia of each knee with nylon sensor holders and nylon set screws, with the transmitter fixed near the distal end of the tibia. To minimize the influence of metal on the magnetic field, the only metal components between the sensors and the transmitter were the screws holding the loading frame together. Orthogonal reference axes were defined for the femur and tibia with the knee in full extension using a separate sensor fixed to a digitizing probe. The probe was used to record the coordinates of previously described anatomical landmarks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954411912453232">22</xref></sup> The transepicondylar axis (<italic>x</italic>-axis) was determined by digitizing the most medial and lateral points on the femoral epicondyles, with the femoral origin midway between the medial and lateral points. The long axis of the femoral shaft was determined by digitizing points along the midline of the posterior surface of the femur. The anterior axis (<italic>y</italic>-axis) was perpendicular to the other two axes, with the <italic>z</italic>-axis perpendicular to both the <italic>x</italic>- and <italic>y</italic>-axes. Similarly, the reference axes for the tibia were determined from an axis connecting the most medial and lateral points on the tibial epicondyles, with the tibial origin midway between the points, and the long axis of the tibia. During testing, the position and orientation of the tibial and femoral reference axes were determined by the output from the sensors. The floating axis coordinate system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0954411912453232">28</xref></sup> was used to characterize the orientation of the tibia with respect to the femur (rotations), based on the orientations of the tibial reference axes with respect to the femoral axes. The position of the tibia with respect to the femur (translations) was determined by projecting the vector from the origin of the femur to the origin of the tibia along the axes of the floating axis coordinate system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0954411912453232">28</xref></sup> The analysis focused on tibial translations in the lateral direction along the transepicondylar axis and in the anterior direction along the floating axis, as well as internal rotation about the tibial long axis and valgus rotation about the floating axis. Unloading and reloading the knee showed that the standard deviation about the mean for repeated kinematics measurements is in the order of 0.4° for rotations and 0.1 mm for translations.</p>
<p>Kinematics measurements were compared between the testing conditions at the individual flexion angles. A repeated measures of analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine if any significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) differences existed between the three conditions at each flexion angle. A repeated measures Student–Newman–Keuls post-hoc test was used for individual comparisons between the three testing conditions, determining if the variations, owing to ACL injury and hamstrings loading, were statistically significant.</p>

Knee kinematics were quantified during <italic>in vitro</italic> simulation of knee function, producing previously noted increases in anterior translation, medial translation, and internal rotation of the tibia with respect to the femur as the flexion angle increased from 0° to 45°.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912453232">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411912453232">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411912453232">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0954411912453232">29</xref></sup> Kinematics quantified through <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging and reconstruction has shown similar variations with the flexion angle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912453232">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0954411912453232">30</xref></sup> For the current study, sectioning the ACL significantly increased anterior translation, medial translation, internal rotation, and valgus rotation of the tibia, primarily at 0° and 15° of flexion. At these flexion angles, with the hamstrings nearly parallel to the tibia, loading the hamstrings had minimal influence on tibiofemoral kinematics. The influence of the hamstrings on kinematics increased as the angle between the tibia and the line of action of the hamstrings increased. At 30°, ACL injury significantly increased tibial internal rotation, and the decrease in rotation owing to the loading the hamstrings nearly reached the level of statistical significance (<italic>p</italic> = 0.051). Hamstrings activation significantly decreased anterior translation, medial translation, and internal rotation at 45°, where the kinematics differences between the intact and ACL-deficient knees were minimal. Hamstrings activation did not significantly influence valgus rotation. Because the current study and previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912453232">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954411912453232">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0954411912453232">29</xref></sup> indicated that ACL injury has minimal influence on tibiofemoral kinematics at deeper flexion angles, no tests were conducted beyond 45° of flexion.</p>
<p>While previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have focused on the influences of ACL injury and hamstrings activation on tibiofemoral kinematics, the two effects have not previously been directly compared within a model of an ACL-deficient knee. Similar to the current study, multiple previous studies have indicated that ACL injury causes increased anterior and medial translation of the tibia during simulated knee function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912453232">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411912453232">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0954411912453232">29</xref></sup> Increased internal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411912453232">3</xref></sup> and valgus rotation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411912453232">4</xref></sup> of the tibia have also been noted. These studies have indicated that the kinematics variations related to ACL injury primarily occur with the knee near full extension. Also similar to the current study, multiple <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have indicated that forces applied by the hamstrings tend to decrease anterior translation, internal rotation, and valgus rotation of the tibia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954411912453232">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954411912453232"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954411912453232">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0954411912453232">29</xref></sup> The previous studies did not identify a decrease in medial translation owing to hamstrings loading, as observed for the current study. The changes induced by the hamstrings were typically smallest near full extension. The previous studies focused on the hamstrings were primarily performed with intact knees. Kinematics variations attributed to hamstrings activation in the intact knee do not necessarily translate to the ACL-deficient knee owing to the altered tibiofemoral motion following ACL injury. One of the previous studies noted that ACL injury increases tibial anterior translation from 0° to 30° of flexion with the hamstrings unloaded and loaded,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0954411912453232">29</xref></sup> so the benefit of hamstrings activation was not identified. The current study advances the understanding of the ability of the hamstrings to counter the effects of ACL injury by directly comparing how ACL injury and hamstrings activation influence multiple tibiofemoral translations and rotations.</p>
<p>Some previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have focused on the influence of hamstrings loading on the ACL. These studies indicated that activation of the hamstrings decreases the strain and force within the ACL for flexion angles ranging from 10° to 90°.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954411912453232">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0954411912453232">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0954411912453232">32</xref></sup> The data from these studies can be used to assess the role of hamstrings activation in preventing ACL injuries. The current data focuses on the post-injury condition and should not be extrapolated to address the role of the hamstrings in preventing ACL injuries.</p>
<p>Computational simulation studies have directly addressed the influence of hamstrings activation on tibial translation following ACL injury, with mixed results. Multiple studies have indicated that activation of the hamstrings can restore normal tibial anterior translation during gait following ACL injury,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411912453232">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954411912453232">18</xref></sup> but an inability to restore normal anterior translation has also been found.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954411912453232">19</xref></sup> Computational modeling provides the advantage of simulating more dynamic activities than can be tested <italic>in vitro</italic>, but includes simplifications and assumptions necessary to represent the tissues mathematically. The simulation studies also each created a single representation of the knee, while the <italic>in vitro</italic> studies evaluated multiple specimens and provided statistical analysis of trends.</p>
<p>Several <italic>in vivo</italic> studies have focused on activation of the hamstrings muscles following ACL injury, with limited data supporting a benefit provided by hamstrings activation. Similar to the current study, <italic>in vivo</italic> studies focused on multiple weight-bearing activities have identified increases in anterior translation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411912453232">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912453232"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411912453232">7</xref></sup> medial translation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912453232">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411912453232">7</xref></sup> and internal rotation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912453232">6</xref></sup> caused by ACL injury. The level of hamstrings activation has been reported to be elevated following an ACL injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411912453232">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411912453232">13</xref></sup> One study showed a trend for the elevation in hamstrings activation during gait to be even larger in subjects determined to cope well without surgery following ACL injury,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0954411912453232">33</xref></sup> although another showed that the increased hamstrings activation, with the knee near full extension during gait, did not prevent increased anterior tibial translation related to the injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0954411912453232">34</xref></sup> Other studies have noted no differences in hamstrings activation between copers, non-copers and uninjured controls during gait<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411912453232">14</xref></sup> and stair descent,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411912453232">16</xref></sup> and hamstrings activation has been shown to be higher for non-copers than copers during jogging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411912453232">15</xref></sup> The current study helps address issues related to hamstrings function following ACL injury that cannot be fully addressed <italic>in vivo</italic> owing to difficulty controlling application of hamstrings forces <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>The experimental methods included three loading conditions designed to directly compare the influence of ACL injury and hamstrings loading on kinematics. Starting with the case of the ACL intact and the quadriceps loaded, the ACL was cut and the hamstrings were added, showing the flexion angles at which each individual change influenced the kinematics output. Similar to studies performed with previously described <italic>in vitro</italic> testing frames, the knees were tested at individual flexion angles instead of dynamically.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954411912453232">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954411912453232">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954411912453232">27</xref></sup> The loading condition was directly changed from quadriceps only, to quadriceps plus hamstrings at each flexion angle, with no other changes applied to the knee, minimizing the experimental error within the assessment of the influence of the hamstrings on tibiofemoral kinematics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954411912453232">22</xref></sup> The knees were cycled through all tests with the ACL intact before testing with the ACL cut, but the knee was left on the testing frame to cut the ACL. The standard deviation about the mean for repeated measurements in this condition is in the order of 0.4° and 0.1 mm for tibiofemoral rotations and translations, respectively. Therefore, the repeated measurements comparisons detected significant differences on the order of 1° and 1 mm, even though the standard deviations among all the knees were in the order of 8° and 5 mm.</p>
<p>Some of the limitations associated with <italic>in vitro</italic> testing should be noted. Although the magnitudes and orientations of the forces used to load the knee through the quadriceps and hamstrings are based on published estimates of <italic>in vivo</italic> loading conditions, <italic>in vivo</italic> loading conditions cannot be fully represented <italic>in vitro</italic>. Ground reaction forces and accelerations that occur for dynamic activities, such as jumping or running, and even gait to a lesser extent, also were not represented. While the change from the ACL intact to cut condition simulates ACL injury, the change from the hamstrings unloaded to fully loaded exaggerates an improvement in hamstrings strength. A longer period of hamstrings activation during an activity is better represented by the experimental conditions. <italic>In vivo</italic>, increased activation of the hamstrings would likely be balanced by additional activity of the quadriceps to balance the flexion moment, which could possibly increase compression and limit translation of the knee. Specimen availability also required using cadaveric knees from elderly donors, while ACL injury and rehabilitation typically occurs in a younger patient population.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study indicates that activation of the hamstrings causes kinematics changes in the opposite direction of ACL injury, but the changes primarily occur at deeper flexion angles than those at which ACL injury influences tibiofemoral kinematics. Therefore, improving the strength of the hamstrings or increasing the time of activation does not provide the desired improvement in kinematics during routine daily activities following ACL injury. The data indicates that training the hamstrings is not likely to restore nearly normal knee function in ACL-deficient patients.</p>
