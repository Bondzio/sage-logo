<p>Welcome to the March edition of the JCU where I am sure you will find a huge amount of interest whatever your subspecialty field.</p>
<p>You will have seen from the cover that there are some significant and important highlights in this issue and I would draw your attention to the first in a series of three specially commissioned articles relating to medico-legal practice. These articles have been commissioned from the MPS and the first one addresses the role of the expert witness. Many colleagues will be familiar with the practice of both personal injury and medical negligence work but as we are all aware, the vast majority of these cases do not end up in the court room and hence our familiarity and experience with being an expert witness will be less than complete to say the least. This coupled with an increase in claims, (over 6500 medical negligence claims per year in the UK), makes an understanding of the role of an expert witness even more crucial than ever and this article clarifies and demystifies the entire role.</p>
<p>Our CME articles continue, this time with an overview, from the Urological perspective, of pelvic organ prolapse. This is clearly an aspect of practice which is not going to disappear quickly and it is becoming increasingly clear that management of such pathology lies within the remit of the urologist with a sub-specialist interest in female urology. This CME review is an excellent foray into this often neglected arena and I am certain will prove to be one of the most useful articles we have published to date.</p>
<p>You will find in this issue a news update from BAUS which I urge you all to read, digest and probably read again – now that revalidation is upon us, however diluted the final version may be compared to the initial conceptual model, further directives and initiatives are afoot and the inside track to this is inside!</p>
<p>In addition there are a number of exciting and interesting original articles all relating to clinical urology within the UK health care system - just as it says on the cover!</p>
<p>Thank you all for your positive comments regarding your new journal and its content and design, please do keep them rolling in, complimentary or constructive, they are all gratefully received. Please also do contact me should you wish to review manuscripts for the <italic>JCU</italic>, it is a great opportunity to contribute to the journal’s success and I’m sure you will find the experience both worthwhile and enjoyable.</p>
