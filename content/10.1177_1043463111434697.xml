<abstract>
<p>This paper explores the effects of collective identity on protest behavior by applying an extended version of the theory of collective action. Hypotheses are derived about the following questions that are rarely addressed in the literature: Are there situations in which collective identity diminishes protest? The standard assumption is that collective identity increases protest behavior. Does collective identity have indirect effects – via the determinants of protest – on protest behavior? Are there feedback effects of protest participation on collective identity? The hypotheses that address these questions are tested with a three-wave panel study. Three findings are of particular interest: (1) the overall direct additive effects of identity on protest behavior are statistically not significant. (2) Evidence is provided that in solidary groups identity does not raise but reduce protest. (3) The major effects of identity are indirect: identity influences the determinants of protest.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Identity has become a magic variable in the social sciences. It is used to explain almost everything: cooperation in social dilemma situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043463111434697">Chase, 1992</xref>), ‘exit’ or ‘voice’ if the product quality of a firm declines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043463111434697">Hirschman, 1970</xref>), work effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043463111434697">Akerlof and Kranton, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043463111434697">2010</xref>) and social movement participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1043463111434697">Polletta and Jasper, 2001</xref>) are among the phenomena that are supposed to be influenced by collective identities. There are, however, also critical voices that principally call into question the fruitfulness of the identity concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043463111434697">Brubaker and Cooper, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043463111434697">Huddy, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In this paper, I address the effects of identity on a specific kind of behavior: the issue is to what extent collective identity generates political action. The widely held view in the social movement literature is that identity is an important factor that influences protest behavior – I call this the <italic>identity-proposition</italic>. Although there is an extensive and still growing literature about this proposition several issues are still not resolved. One concerns the theoretical link between the identity variable and political protest: which theory would lead us to expect that identity affects political action? One important advantage of explicitly applying a theory is that it may provide an answer to another largely unanswered question: although it is generally assumed that identity is not the only factor that has an impact on political protest, these other factors that are proposed in the literature are not based on a clear theory either. Furthermore, applying a theory may lead to new predictions. This paper argues that the identity-proposition can be integrated into the theory of collective action. Furthermore, this theory is systematically applied and extended to explain political action.</p>
<p>Proponents of the identity-proposition often claim that the causal direction is not only from identity to protest, but that protest generates or strengthens collective identities. Is there always such a reciprocal effect or only under certain conditions? I suggest several propositions that address this question.</p>
<p>Most of the literature on identity assumes that identity has a direct effect on protest action. But identity might affect protest indirectly – via other determinants of protest. For example, if individuals have developed a strong collective identity they may feel a strong obligation to protest, which, in turn, affects protest. Are there such indirect effects? This question is addressed in this paper as well.</p>
<p>The impact of identity on collective political action is investigated in a new field of study: in most of the work on identity in political sociology, social movements are the subject of study. The question addressed in this literature is the extent to which a social movement identity affects the emergence and development of social movements and of individual social movement participation. But social movements are only a very special kind of group. If the identity-proposition is correct it should hold for any group for which collective identities exist. There is no plausible reason why the effects of a social movement identity should differ from the effects of other collective identities. In this paper, I focus on regional groups such as residents of a rural or urban area. The application of the identity-proposition to these groups implies that a strong identification with these groups should lead to political action on behalf of these groups, as will be shown in detail below.</p>
<p>I tested my propositions with a representative three-wave panel survey that was conducted in the city of Leipzig and a rural area in Saxony. The details of the study will be described below.</p>
<p>‘Identity’ and ‘collective identity’ are among the most elusive concepts in the social sciences that have various meanings and are often defined ambiguously (for details see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043463111434697">Huddy, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043463111434697">Brubaker and Cooper, 2000</xref>). It is not possible and not necessary either to enter into a detailed discussion of the various definitions. Instead, I have chosen a definition that captures one aspect of most extant definitions of ‘collective’ or ‘social identity’ in the literature (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043463111434697">de Weerd and Klandermans, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043463111434697">Howard, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043463111434697">Hunt and Benford, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1043463111434697">Opp, 2009</xref>, chapter 8; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1043463111434697">Polletta and Jasper, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1043463111434697">Stryker, Owens and White, 2000</xref>). I use the term <italic>identification</italic> instead of ‘identity’ because the former concept has fewer connotations than the latter. I define ‘identification with a group’ (or, equivalently, collective or group identification) as a positive attitude toward or an emotional attachment to a group. Apart from the use of this definition as part of many identity concepts in the literature another reason for choosing this definition is that it is clear. Furthermore, the identity-proposition seems plausible if this definition is adopted: the more strongly individuals are emotionally attached to a group, the more likely there is a strong motivation to act on behalf of the group.</p>

<title>Theory</title>
<p>The general structure of the theoretical model is displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1043463111434697">Figure 1</xref>. The starting point is the identity-proposition (arrow 1). It is assumed that, apart from identification, other factors – called incentives – affect protest behavior as well (arrow 2). Identification may not have only a direct effect on protest but indirect effects as well: increasing identification may change the determinants of protest (arrow 3). For example, assume that the preference for certain public goods is a determinant of protest. If individuals have developed a strong identification with a group, they will be particularly concerned with the well-being of the group, and this concern will therefore be particularly strong.</p>

<caption><p>The basic model.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1043463111434697-fig1.tif"/></fig>
<p>So far, the causal effects run from identification to protest. However, there may be reciprocal effects. First, the determinants of protest may affect identification (arrow 4). Second, individuals’ involvement in social movement participation (or participation in favor of a group) may influence identification with the group (arrow 5).</p>
<p>The next task is to propose hypotheses which specify in detail the determinants of protest participation and the interrelationships between these determinants, protest and identification.</p>
<sec id="section3-1043463111434697">
<title>Identification as a variable of the theory of collective action</title>
<p>In this section it is argued that group identification is a selective incentive and, thus, a variable of the theory of collective action. Then other incentives will be specified that are supposed to affect collective action, based on the existing literature.</p>
<sec id="section4-1043463111434697">
<title>Identification as a selective incentive</title>
<p>The theory of collective action explains under what conditions individuals contribute to the provision of a collective or public good. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1043463111434697">Olson (1965)</xref> argues that one condition for contributing is the individual’s <italic>preference for the public good</italic> that is insufficiently provided. However, a preference for a public good is only a condition for contributing if the individual’s <italic>influence</italic> on providing the good is not negligible. One of Olson’s major propositions is that an individual’s impact on the provision of a public good is negligible in large groups. If nonetheless members of large groups contribute this is due to <italic>selective incentives</italic>. These are benefits or costs that are obtained or incurred only if an individual contributes or defects. In contrast to the utility of a public good that everybody can enjoy if it is provided, the provision of selective incentives is dependent on an individual’s contribution.</p>
<p>This theory has given rise to extensive theoretical discussions and numerous empirical studies. In the field of collective political action, two empirical findings are of particular importance in this context. (1) Although Olson assumes that an individual’s actual influence in a large group is perceived correctly, research has shown that many individuals overestimate their political influence, and that perceived political influence varies among the members of a group (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043463111434697">Finkel <italic>et al.</italic>, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043463111434697">Gibson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043463111434697">Klandermans, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1043463111434697">Muller and Opp, 1986</xref>). This implies that even in large groups preferences for public goods matter because many people think that their contribution makes a difference. (2) Olson mostly focuses on material incentives. However, especially in the field of political action non-material incentives such as a felt obligation to protest, i.e. a protest norm, or integration in political groups where social rewards for political protest are obtained from important others, instigate political action (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043463111434697">Chong, 1991</xref>, pages 93–100; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043463111434697">Klandermans, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043463111434697">Muller, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1043463111434697">Opp, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1043463111434697">1989</xref>).</p>
<p>‘Identification’ can only be a variable of the theory of collective action if it refers to costs and benefits. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043463111434697">Hirschman’s theory (1970)</xref> clarifies this relationship. He argues that people’s reactions to the decline of a product depend, among other things, on ‘loyalty’ to the firm or organization. This concept is defined as ‘attachment to an organization’ (pages 77–78) or as ‘affection for an organization’ (page 78). This is exactly the meaning of ‘identification’ as it is used in this paper. Hirschman assumes that ‘loyal’ customers will less likely ‘exit’ (buying a product from another firm), but prefer to act in order help the firm to recuperate (i.e. to choose ‘voice’). Loyalists will be ‘unhappy’ (page 88) if they do not stay with ‘their’ organization. In other words, loyalty is a ‘penalty for exit,’ which is ‘internalized’ (page 98). Loyalty to a group thus means an <italic>interest in the well-being of the group</italic>. That is to say, a strong identification with a group is related to a strong interest in the well-being of the group. If there is such an interest, then action on behalf of the group (i.e. ‘voice’) is rewarding as well. Thus, if individuals strongly identify with a group they get high (internal) benefits if they act in order to improve the situation of the group, and they incur costs if they are inactive.</p>
<p>This is consistent with dissonance and balance theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043463111434697">Festinger, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1043463111434697">Heider, 1958</xref>) as well: assume an individual likes (or identifies with) a group and believes that ‘voice’ would make the organization better off. In this case, it would be dissonant and psychologically costly if the individual would not act to support the group.</p>
<p>Is identification a selective incentive or a public goods incentive? ‘Selective incentive’ means that the costs and benefits must depend on the behavior of the individual. This is clearly the case: as was said, internal benefits obtain if the individual who identifies with the group supports the group, otherwise internal costs originate. The previous argument thus provides some theoretical support for the identity-proposition that is the first proposition that will be tested:</p>
<list id="list1-1043463111434697" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>Proposition 1</bold>: The stronger individuals identify with a group, the more likely they engage in action in support of the group.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The assumption in the social movement literature is that protest is the major action that people choose to increase the welfare of a group.</p>
<p>Another often implicit assumption is that identification leads to protest only if the group is in trouble or if its situation is, from the perspective of those who identify it, in need of improvement. This is always the case for the groups that are selected for study. This holds for the regional groups the present study focuses on as well.</p>
<p>The argument that identification has something to do with costs or benefits is controversial. It is argued that identity is a factor that is incompatible with the theory of rational action which underlies the theory of collective action. It is held that there are <italic>two paradigms of explanation</italic>: one is based on identity, the other on interests (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1043463111434697">Anthony, 2005</xref>). A similar argument is advanced in the social movement literature. For example, it is argued that ‘there is much more in being a movement participant than perceived costs and benefits’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043463111434697">Klandermans, 2004</xref>, page 364), and this ‘much more’ is social identity. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1043463111434697">Stürmer <italic>et al.</italic> (2003</xref>, page 73; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043463111434697">Klandermans, 2004</xref>, page 364; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1043463111434697">Simon <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>, page 656) suggest ‘a model that specifies two independent pathways to social movement participation … one pathway is based on the calculation of the costs and benefits of participation; the other is based on identification with the social movement or SMO [Social Movement Organization].’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1043463111434697">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>This view raises two questions. One is whether individuals who identify with a group do actually not weigh costs and benefits. Authors who advance this view do not provide empirical evidence. However, it seems plausible that in situations where much is at stake individuals deliberate. For example, if a brutal police action is expected those who identify with a movement will consider the option not to participate, and weigh the costs and benefits of participating or abstaining.</p>
<p>But let us assume that those who identify with a movement do not weigh costs and benefits. The second question is whether this implies that I need two <italic>theories</italic> to explain protest participation, one that includes costs and benefits and the other identity (and not costs and benefits) as independent variables. If this question is answered in the affirmative one would like to know what the latter theory would look like. The literature provides no answer to this question.</p>
<p>It is interesting that Stürmer <italic>et al.</italic> include costs and benefits as well as identification as independent variables in their research. Thus, it seems, both pathways do not exclude each other. But it is not clear what the overarching theory is if ‘there is much more in being a movement participant than perceived costs and benefits’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043463111434697">Klandermans, 2004</xref>, page 364).</p>
<p>It is one of the widely held misunderstandings in the ongoing debate about the theory of collective action and rational choice theory to believe, that these theories presuppose that individuals always weigh costs and benefits (i.e. calculate). This assumption is not part of a relatively wide version of a rational actor model that is increasingly applied in the social sciences (for details see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1043463111434697">Opp, 1999</xref>). Here it is held that individual behavior is governed by costs and benefits and not that there is calculation of these costs and benefits. Such a hypothesis would indeed contradict all we know about human behavior. Leading economists also subscribe to this wide version of the theory of rational actions. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043463111434697">Gary Becker (1976</xref>, page 7) emphasizes: ‘the economic approach does not assume that decisions units are necessarily conscious of their efforts to maximize.’</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1043463111434697">
<title>The other factors</title>
<p>We saw that public goods preferences are among the determinants of protest behavior. What are the kinds of public goods that may motivate protest participation in our research setting? Our subjects are residents of a rural and an urban area. The assumption is that the public goods that motivate protest behavior of these individuals are the living conditions in the area. If there is concern about the living conditions, protest behavior becomes more likely. However, this holds only if an individual’s protest is supposed to have an impact on the provision of the public good. Research has shown, as was noted above, that not actual but perceived <italic>personal political influence</italic> matters; that is to say, if individuals believe that their participation makes a difference. It is thus to be expected that there is an interaction effect of public good preferences referring to the local living conditions and perceived personal influence to change these living conditions by engaging in protest behavior.</p>
<p>Besides identification there are two other selective incentives that have been shown in empirical research to be conducive to political action: the perceived moral obligation to participate, i.e. <italic>acceptance of a protest norm</italic> (see the literature cited above) and <italic>membership in political groups</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1043463111434697">2</xref></sup> These are groups in which protest action is encouraged. I thus assume:</p>
<list id="list2-1043463111434697" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>Proposition 2</bold>: The more intense public goods preferences, perceived personal influence, acceptance of a protest norm and integration in political groups are, the more likely individuals will participate in protest behavior.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Research on political protest and social movement participation has employed a vast number of independent variables.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1043463111434697">3</xref></sup> A researcher who wants to test a model explaining political protest must decide what factors to use. Our decision is based on the fact that the variables mentioned before are consistent with the theory of collective action that is applied throughout this paper. Furthermore, the factors I have chosen are widely used in the literature, although sometimes the terminology is different. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1043463111434697">Verba <italic>et al.</italic> (1995</xref>, pages 117–120) examine the effects of ‘civic gratifications’ on political action which square with our concept of protest norm. The model by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043463111434697">Klandermans <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref> includes, among other factors, ‘social embeddedness’ which refers to ‘membership in organizations’. This is at least very close to our ‘membership in political groups’. Ultimately, the decision to include variables in a model can only be justified after the test of the model: if the model is confirmed the decision was correct. In regard to our model, this is largely the case, as will be shown later on.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1043463111434697">
<title>An extension of the theory of collective action</title>
<p>So far we have discussed relationships 1 and 2 of the basic model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1043463111434697">Figure 1</xref>). The assumptions so far are that there are no interaction effects of identification and other variables, and that identification always has a positive effect on protest behavior. In what follows I will develop hypotheses that modify these assumptions. I will then address the indirect effects of identification on protest – via the other incentives (relationship 3 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1043463111434697">Figure 1</xref>), and the effects of protest and its incentives on identification (relationships 4 and 5 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1043463111434697">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section7-1043463111434697">
<title>When does identification reduce political participation?</title>
<p>The standard scenario in the social movement and political protest literature assumes that there is a confrontation of a social movement and a target (mostly a government). The target is only willing to adopt the movement’s agenda (and, thus, to provide a larger amount of a public good or remove a public bad) if enough people are mobilized. In this scenario, protest is in the interest of the movement and the aggrieved group. Furthermore, the movement participants consider collective action an efficient means to make the aggrieved group better off. It is plausible that the identity-proposition holds in this scenario because protest may reduce the grievances of the groups involved.</p>
<p>The condition for the validity of the identity-proposition is thus that protest helps the aggrieved group. The identity-proposition will be wrong if that condition is not met. This holds for highly <italic>cohesive</italic> or <italic>solidary</italic> groups, i.e. if there are close-knit relationships between the group members. This implies close ties between citizens on the one hand and the administration or government on the other. Thus, citizens have <italic>access to decision makers</italic>, and decision makers listen and are interested in solving problems by collaborating with the citizens. In such a scenario, there will be no confrontations in the form of demonstrations or other forms of protest. There is no incentive to organize or participate in a demonstration or initiate other kinds of protest against the government. This is much more costly than organizing a meeting with the representatives of the government where the problems can be discussed. There will thus be <italic>negotiations</italic> between citizens (or groups of citizens) on the one hand and major decision-makers on the other. Protest would not make sense at all: if politicians grant the citizens to be heard, why should they first stage protests? Such confrontations seem superfluous if one can directly address the government. Confrontations will even lower the likelihood of being heard because the government will feel offended by the ‘inadequate’ behavior. One does not stage a demonstration against good friends, if friends are in difficulties or cause trouble – which may happen even in a close friendship.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1043463111434697">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The question arises whether there may be protest at all in a solidary group. This question is clearly to be answered in the affirmative. Here are some examples. A group of citizens may demand that more public money is to be invested to restore historical buildings. Parents in a school may wish that new computers are provided, and that this should be paid by the government. Due to an economic upswing, traffic increases on major roads which leads to an increase of the noise level. Residents who suffer from this may demand a speed limit. There may be increased violence in schools, and teachers want to discuss measures with the local police. Thus, there may be numerous problems or grievances even in highly cohesive groups.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even in a solidary group there may be individuals who are not well integrated and who thus do not want to negotiate. However, a social movement in this scenario will be rather marginal. Nonetheless, even such a movement will have access to major decision makers and may realize that its goals may be better achieved when it meets with decision makers and cooperates to reduce grievances instead of engaging in confrontations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1043463111434697">5</xref></sup> It is likely that some compromise is found.</p>
<p>In this situation, it is to be expected that the identity-proposition will not hold: strong identification with the community will not instigate protest. Instead, identifiers will protest less. The reason is that protest behavior will not help the group but rather hurt it. Negotiation will be regarded as a more efficient alternative.</p>
<p>This second scenario can also be described in terms of the political opportunity structure approach: it is a situation where access to the government and thus <italic>political opportunity structures</italic> are rather open and, therefore, protest is rather infrequent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043463111434697">Eisinger, 1973</xref>). Eisinger does not address the effects of identification. It seems plausible that in a situation where political opportunity structures are rather open identification with residents of a region reduces protest for the reasons described above.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, in the standard scenario of the social movement literature the target is an out-group, whereas in the second scenario the target is the in-group, if there are grievances or problems. My hypothesis – that may be called the <italic>solidarity-proposition</italic> – thus reads:</p>
<list id="list2-1043463111434697" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>Proposition 3</bold>: If individuals are members of a solidary group and if there are problems in the group, identification with the groups will prompt individuals not to choose protest but choose non-confrontational means to solve the problems.</p></list-item>

<title>Identification as a determinant of incentives to protest</title>
<p>Identification with a group may not only have a direct effect on protest behavior, but also indirect effects by influencing the determinants of protest. Social identity theory assumes that under certain conditions those who are dissatisfied with the status of their group neither exit nor protest but choose ‘cognitive restructuring’ (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1043463111434697">Tajfel and Turner, 1986</xref>). This may happen if those who are dissatisfied with the status of their group also identify with their group. I hypothesize: if the group is considered to be in trouble, identifiers are more dissatisfied with the situation of the group than non-identifiers. The reason is that identification provides a strong motivation to deal with the situation of the group. The consequence is that problems of the group become particularly salient to identifiers, because the latter are more sensitive to the grievances of the group. Assuming that in each group – especially in the regional groups our research focuses on – there is some degree of discontent I predict:</p>
<list id="list3-1043463111434697" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>Proposition 4</bold>: If there is concern about the situation of a group: the more individuals identify with a group, the higher is their dissatisfaction with the situation of the group and the stronger is their motivation to contribute to provide the public goods for the group.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>I further hypothesize that a strong identification with a group leads to a high perceived influence to change the situation of the group. Those who identify with a group will have an intrinsic interest to know something about the situation of the group. Furthermore, everyday conversations will address the situation of the group, and having information about relevant events that concern the group is expected. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043463111434697">Downs (1957)</xref>, one will only invest in getting information about politics when one is influential. The voter in a large group is not influential and, thus, engages in ‘rational ignorance’. Being not influential is thus a negative incentive to deal with the situation of the group one identifies with. It is plausible that being not influential is a highly dissonant situation for those who strongly identify with a group: these individuals are concerned about the situation of the group, have an interest in acting in the interest of the group, and are well informed about the situation of the group. Feeling that one nevertheless cannot influence the wellbeing of the group is psychologically unpleasant, i.e. dissonant.</p>
<p>This dissonance can be reduced in different ways. One possibility is to change the identification with the group and stop acquiring information about the group. This would be consonant with low influence. Another possibility is to change the perception of influence. The latter seems the least costly reaction: only one cognitive element need to be changed and not two; furthermore, the perception of political influence is highly amenable to change because it is difficult to measure it objectively. This is suggested by the finding that people in general overestimate their political influence, as was noted above. I therefore hypothesize that those who strongly identify with a group feel relatively influential to improve the wellbeing of the group.</p>
<p>My research includes items that measure <italic>general</italic> political influence, not influence to change the situation in the urban or the rural area (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1043463111434697">Table 1</xref>). If the previous argument is correct I would expect that <italic>general</italic> perceived political influence for those who strongly identity with a group is low. In other words:</p>

</list>
<p>We thus expect that strong identification with Leipzig or the rural area, i.e. LR-identification, has a negative effect, but no positive effect on general perceived political influence.</p>
<p>Will identification with a group affect the acceptance of a protest norm? In general, if a strong identification is an incentive to protest and if group identification leads to a greater sensitivity for the grievances of the group the acceptance of a protest norm will be especially strong. The reason is that protest norms are conditional and that an obligation to protest is high if discontent is high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1043463111434697">Jasso and Opp, 1997</xref>). Another argument is in line with this proposition: if a strong identification with a group is associated with an interest in the welfare of the group it is highly consonant that an internalized norm develops that demands support of a group if the group is threatened.</p>

<sec id="section9-1043463111434697">
<title>Political action and incentives as causes of identification</title>
<p>Empirical research indicates that protest participation changes individual actors in various ways. The general proposition is that activism leads to fundamental changes in the beliefs, values, norms, and attitudes of the activists (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1043463111434697">Teske, 1997</xref>, chapter 4). The social–psychological effort-justification proposition suggests more specific propositions. The idea is that ‘people love what they suffer for’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043463111434697">Eagly and Chaiken, 1993</xref>, page 556). In other words, ‘the expenditure of effort increases the value placed upon the end sought’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1043463111434697">Milburn and Christie, 1990</xref>, page 239). This proposition can be applied to a situation where persons protest on behalf of a group. ‘People love what they suffer for’ may mean that people tend to love the group more when they have suffered for it. Why? Every group has some aspects that the individual who protests for the group does not like. If an individual has incurred high costs on behalf of the group, this is dissonant with the cognition that the group has some negative features. This dissonance may be reduced in two ways: the individual may depreciate the costs of the protests. However, the higher the costs are, the less likely this alternative is chosen because it would entail a strong distortion of reality and, thus, new dissonance. It is ‘easier’ to find the group more attractive. We might therefore expect that protest aiming at supporting the agenda of a group has a positive effect on identification with the group.</p>
<p>This argument holds if the costs of action for the group are high. If protest is a low-cost activity, as in our research setting, it is not dissonant if one protests for a group that has some negative features. We thus expect that protest has only a small or perhaps no effect on identification in my research. To summarize:</p>
<list id="list6-1043463111434697" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>Proposition 7</bold>: The higher the costs of protest on behalf of a group are, the more likely protest has a positive effect on identification with the group.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The mechanism described above – the dissonance of high costs of protest and attributing negative properties to the group increases identification with the group – implies that engaging in protest action affects identification, as proposition 7 states. But the mechanism also suggests that the costs and benefits, i.e., the <italic>incentives</italic> to protest, affect identification. I would thus expect as well:</p>
<list id="list7-1043463111434697" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>Proposition 8</bold>: The stronger the incentives to protest are, the stronger is the identification with a group.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Thus, engaging in high-cost protest as well as strong positive incentives to protest (i.e., a high net utility of protest) have a positive effect on identification with the group.</p>

<title>A summary of the model</title>
<p>The previous propositions consist of two models, as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1043463111434697">Figure 2</xref> shows. In one model the dependent variable is protest. This is the <italic>protest model</italic>. The identity-proposition suggests a positive additive effect of identification with a group on protest on behalf of the group (proposition 1). The other relevant factors are preferences for public goods that are not provided to a sufficient degree – in this research, this is interest in the quality of life, as will be shown below, perceived personal influence, acceptance of a protest norm and integration in political groups (proposition 2). However, I argue that identification has a negative effect on protest in solidary groups (proposition 3).</p>

<p>The second <italic>identification-incentives model</italic> looks at the causes and effects of identification on the incentives. It is first argued that identification with a group is high if individuals engage in high-cost protest behavior (proposition 7) and if the incentives to protest are strong (proposition 8). There are three effects of identification: on public goods preferences (i.e. interest in the quality of life), political influence (which is under certain conditions positive or negative) and acceptance of a protest norm (propositions 4 to 6).</p>

<title>Research design and measurement</title>
<p>The previous hypotheses were tested with a three-wave panel survey. The data of the first wave consist of a representative sample of 3005 respondents from Leipzig (<italic>N</italic> = 1500) and a rural area in Saxony. The interviews took place between May and July 2000. The second wave of interviews was conducted between April and June 2002 and consisted of 1895 respondents (813 in Leipzig and 1082 in the rural area). A third wave was administered between May and June 2003, with 1153 respondents, 492 from Leipzig and 661 from the rural area. A professional survey institute was in charge of the data collection for all waves. I chose a rural and an urban area because I assumed that identification would differ so that this design would increase the value range of the identification variable.</p>
<p>A comparison of demographic characteristics of the first wave with official statistics indicates that the survey matches these characteristics very well. Only about a third of the respondents of the first wave could be interviewed in all three waves. To analyze a possible bias in the attrition I first compared the extent to which various demographic characteristics of the first wave changed in the second and third wave. The changes were relatively small. For example, the average monthly income in 2000 was 2918.6 Euro. In the second wave in 2002 the average income of 2000 of the respondents left in the panel slightly increased to 3029.5 Euro; it further rose to 3066.6 Euro in 2003. Although there is a slight middle-class bias, the income differences between waves are low. The middle-class bias is not confirmed when we look at the amount of schooling that slightly decreased. Average age as well as the proportion not married declined, whereas the proportion married increased. An explanation is that still young and unmarried East Germans migrate to West Germany because the living conditions are better.</p>
<p>We further analyzed the extent to which some of our theoretical variables such as the identification scales changed. Again, we find small differences between waves. But even if differences were larger I would argue that the major goal of this paper is to test theoretical propositions. If these are sound, they should be confirmed by the present data set.</p>
<p>The measurement of the variables is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1043463111434697">Table 1</xref>. I will shortly comment on operationalizations of some of the variables in more detail. <italic>Protest behavior</italic> – one of the major dependent variables – was measured by presenting the respondents with four items referring to political actions that have been performed in the past two years (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1043463111434697">Table 1</xref>). The answer categories were chosen because I assume that the first step in the decision process is to consider participation and then, if the incentives are strong enough, to actually participate. It could be argued that some item may not refer to protest. Our decision to include each of the four items is supported by factor analyses where one factor was extracted in each wave. Further, reliabilities always decreased if one of the items was excluded. In regard to ‘wearing political buttons’ which may be problematic, I ran various regression analyses with scales that include and do not include this item. The results were almost identical. The distributions of the protest scales are satisfactory: 45.1% and 37.7% of the respondents have a higher value than the minimal value 1, and there is sufficient variation among these higher values as well.</p>
<p>The identity-proposition suggests that identification has an effect on <italic>action in support or in the interest of the group one identifies with</italic>. Protests will only be in support of the residents of Leipzig and the rural area if they are concerned with local problems. My protest scale measures forms of protest such as participation in demonstrations. To what extent do the protests address local problems?</p>
<p>This question cannot be answered with our panel data but with several other surveys that were administered in Leipzig (for details see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1043463111434697">Opp, 2000</xref>). The surveys conducted in 1996, which were pooled for the present analyses, included the question: ‘Did your protest refer to problems of this location, of the state [of Saxony] or of Germany’? Multiple answers were possible. Among the respondents who answered this question (<italic>N</italic> = 280) 80.4% mentioned problems of their location. When I analyze for each protest action (such as participating in demonstrations) whether those protests addressed local, state or national problems, I find that for each of the four protest actions between 85.8% and 93.5% mentioned local problems.</p>
<p>Further evidence for the strong local orientation of protests in Leipzig is provided by a content analysis of the local Leipzig newspaper ‘Leipziger Volkszeitung’ (LVZ) from 1992 to 1999.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1043463111434697">6</xref></sup> I will only briefly look at the 1998 and 1999 data because they are close to the first wave of the panel in 2000 that is used to test the propositions.</p>
<p>In 1998, there were 76 protest events for which the theme could be identified. A total of 72% had a local theme. In 1999, there were 82 protest events: 72% had a local reference. In each year, thus, more than 70% of the protests referred to local issues.</p>
<p>The themes of the protests reflect the situation in Leipzig that is characterized by high unemployment, closures of factories and firms, layoffs, job cuts, and budget cuts of the local, regional, and national governments. There were further student protests against job or budget cuts in the university, and there were protests of leftist youths against right wing groups in a district of Leipzig.</p>
<p>These data refer to Leipzig. There are no data for the rural area, but there is no reason to believe that protests in the rural area are less locally oriented. On the contrary, organizers of protests that address non-local themes will to a large extent prefer Leipzig because more people can be reached than in the rural area.</p>
<p>To conclude, the evidence indicates that the protests measured in our study have to a very large extent a local character. In regard to the theory, thus, I test the proposition that identification leads to action ‘in support of the group’ the respondents are members of (see proposition 1).</p>
<p><italic>Identification</italic> with the residents of Leipzig and the rural area in Saxony was measured by a question about the extent to which respondents <italic>feel as</italic> a Leipziger or Erzgebirger (five answer categories from ‘very strong’ to ‘very weak’) and about the extent to which respondents are <italic>proud of</italic> being a Leipziger or Erzgebirger (five answer categories, from ‘very proud’ to ‘not at all proud’). These items are used in other surveys as well to measure identification with regions. Each item was recoded so that high values refer to high identification (strong feelings and high pride). A factor analysis showed that the items loaded on one factor. Therefore, an additive scale was constructed.</p>
<p>Note that the statistical analyses use the pooled sample consisting of the respondents from Leipzig and from the rural area. The questions that measure identification are included in each questionnaire. The identification scale (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1043463111434697">Table 1</xref>) was constructed for the pooled sample. I therefore call the scale LR (for ‘Leipzig‘ and the ‘rural‘ area). Low values mean low identification, and high values mean high identification (i.e. feeling as a Leipziger etc. to a high extent and being proud of being a Leipziger etc.).</p>
<p>I further measured the <italic>preference for the public good</italic>, in this case the wish of having good (or better) living conditions in Leipzig or the rural area. I presented the respondents with a list of 16 conditions (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1043463111434697">Table 1</xref>). To illustrate, among the items referring to living conditions in the region were ‘sports facilities,’ ‘cultural offerings,’ and ‘public transportation’. For each item, the respondent was asked to what extent these conditions are ‘<italic>important</italic>’ to him or her (five answer categories, from completely unimportant (1) to very important (5)).</p>
<p>I assume that if individuals regard a great number of living conditions as very important, it is likely that many of these conditions do not exist to the extent the respondents had wished. One reason is that the existence of these living conditions very much depends on the area one lives in. For example, if people live in the center of Leipzig, there are many cultural attractions. But this is hardly the case in a small village in the rural area. If one lives in Leipzig, good public transportation is more likely than in a village in the rural area. But even in Leipzig, availability of public transportation varies for different parts of the city.</p>
<p>It is thus plausible that those who regard many aspects of urban and rural life as very important will also find relatively often that these living conditions are not provided to the extent they expect. These respondents may not really feel strong grievances, but they will certainly have an interest that a relatively large number of living conditions will be improved. I therefore call this variable <italic>interest in the quality of life</italic>. Thus, if many living conditions are regarded as very important, interest in the quality of life is relatively strong, and the likelihood is high that living conditions that are considered important do not exist.</p>
<p>If my reasoning is correct one will expect that those who have a high interest in the quality of life will also act in order to improve the living conditions, in contrast to those who regard only few aspects of the living conditions as important or very important.</p>
<p><italic>Perceived political personal influence</italic> was measured by four items that are often used in surveys. They refer to <italic>general</italic> perceived political influence. <italic>Membership in political groups</italic> was measured by presenting respondents with a list of groups and by asking them to indicate whether they are a member or not. Groups differ in the extent to which members value protest activities positively or encourage their performance. I define a group as ‘political’ when it is to be expected that protest is valued positively or encouraged in the group. Among the political groups are unions, church groups, student associations, political parties, citizen initiatives, and protest groups such as environmental or peace groups. My measure ‘membership in political groups’ is the number of memberships in these groups.</p>
<p>The first step in the construction of the scales that consist of several items was, as usual, dimensional analyses for the items of each wave. All scales were constructed by adding the items and dividing their sum by the number of items.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1043463111434697">
<title>Testing the model with a panel design</title>
<p>The previous propositions are a complex system of equations with feedback effects that was tested with the maximum likelihood technique and the Lisrel program. Thus, one complex model is tested, but the findings are presented in several tables. The advantage is that this allows us to test not only feedback effects but to take into account error correlations between the scales which is important in panel analysis.</p>
<p>Dependent variables are taken from wave 2 and wave 3. Variables of wave 1 are thus used only as independent (i.e. exogenous) variables. The first step in the statistical analysis was to take the independent variables always from the previous wave. Furthermore, I always included the lagged dependent variable, i.e. the dependent variable of the previous wave, as an independent variable. This is important because I test the effects of the independent variables on a <italic>change</italic> of the dependent variable (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043463111434697">Finkel, 1995</xref>). If the lagged independent variables did not have any effect, I examined whether the respective simultaneous variable from the same wave had any effect. This makes sense because the time between the measurements is rather long, and it may be that the lagged variable has affected the dependent variable already before its measurement. Insignificant independent variables were excluded. I further tested for the dependent variables of wave 3 whether variables of wave 1 had an impact.</p>
<p>It is important to note that including simultaneous effects is not equivalent with using a cross-sectional design. All my equations include the lagged dependent variable that enables us to answer the question whether the simultaneous independent variables have an effect on protest, <italic>given the level of protest at the previous wave</italic>. This lagged dependent variable is not available in a cross-sectional research design.</p>
<p>At first sight it seems straightforward to include in the equations only the variables specified in the hypotheses. In order to test the robustness of the assumed effects I included in each equation all other variables as controls. For example, when I tested the effects of the identification variable on the public goods variable of wave 2, I included as independent variables not only identification, but personal influence, protest norms, membership in political groups, living in LR, and protest behavior as well. For space limitations I did not provide hypotheses about the effects of the control variables. They are included only to test the robustness of the key variables included in the hypotheses. I will thus not comment on their effects either.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1043463111434697" sec-type="results">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>I will first present the results for the protest model. I continue with the findings referring to the identification-incentives model. In the following sections, I only discuss the extent to which the standardized regression coefficients confirm or falsify my hypotheses. As was said before, I do not comment on the control variables.</p>
<sec id="section14-1043463111434697">
<title>A test of the identity-proposition and solidarity-proposition</title>
<p>I will test the solidarity-proposition by using ‘place of residence’ as a proxy for membership in a solidary group where identification is expected to have a negative or no effect on protest. Thus, it is assumed that living in the rural area comes close to membership in a solidary group, in contrast to living in the city of Leipzig. This implies, among other things, that in the rural area networks are denser so that residents may easily get into contact. An indicator for network density is that the percentage of one-person households in Leipzig is 45.1 %, in the rural area 27 % (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043463111434697">Bundesinstitut, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, as the survey shows, residents of the rural area are more frequently born in Saxony, have spent more time of their life in Saxony and moved less frequently than Leipzig residents.</p>
<p>It could be argued that the effects of the proxy variable – living in Leipzig or the rural area – could come from many other variables, not only from different degrees of solidarity: urban and rural areas differ in many respects, and unmeasured variables might be the factors that produced the findings to be reported later. To what extent is this argument acceptable? First of all, I provide some evidence that one difference of Leipzig and the rural area is solidarity. Based on the theory of collective action, this variable leads to certain predictions. If these predictions are confirmed, then this is a – preliminary – confirmation of the theory.</p>
<p>But it cannot be excluded that other factors are relevant. If this is claimed, one should specify these other factors. Only then can the claim that these factors are relevant be tested. Further research is then needed to examine the influence of these factors. A general claim, that other factors are relevant can always be made in survey research. If such a general claim is regarded as acceptable, survey research can no longer be used to test any hypothesis. It thus seems justified to use the area variable as a proxy for membership in a solidary group. But because the area variable is only an indirect measure I will not expect strong effects on dependent variables.</p>
<p>If, as was argued, protest is in general no viable option to solve problems in the rural area, in contrast to Leipzig, I first predict:</p>
<list id="list8-1043463111434697" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>Prediction 1</bold>: ‘Living in LR’ (‘0’ for living in Leipzig, ‘1’ for living in the rural area) will have a negative effect on protest behavior.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>It was hypothesized that identification with the residents of Leipzig and with the residents of the rural area has different effects on protest because Leipzig consists of a heterogeneous population and there is no strong cohesion or solidarity. I therefore expect:</p>
<list id="list9-1043463111434697" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>Prediction 2</bold>: Identification with Leipzig residents has no effect or a positive effect on protest behavior. In contrast, living in the rural area is supposed to affect protest negatively or at least should have a lower effect than identification with Leipzig. Thus, there should be a negative interaction effect of identification and the dummy variable ‘living in LR.’</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>If the solidarity-proposition holds it is to be expected that the overall effects of the identification variable on protest are close to zero. The reason is that the statistical analysis is based on the pooled samples, as I mentioned before. The respondents are thus partly members of a solidary group (rural area) and partly members of a less solidary group (urban area, i.e. Leipzig). Assume there are positive effects of identification for respondents from Leipzig and negative effects for respondents from the rural area. These positive and negative effects will cancel each other out because, as was said, the analyses are based on both populations. I thus predict:</p>
<list id="list10-1043463111434697" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>Prediction 3</bold>: The effects of LR-identification on protest behavior are close to zero.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>I will now first test the identity proposition. The question thus is: does identity have additive positive effects on protest, as claimed in the literature (proposition 1)? In addition, I test the effects of the other variables of the protest model (proposition 2). In constructing the interaction term of discontent and influence I first centered both variables (i.e., the mean was subtracted from the values of the variables for each respondent per wave) in order to reduce multicollinearity (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043463111434697">Jaccard <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>, pages 29–31). Then both centered variables were multiplied. This interaction term as well as the two additive centered variables were included in the model to be tested. The interaction term of identification and living in LR was constructed in the same way.</p>
<p>Let us first look at protest of wave 2 as a dependent variable. I included the additive identification variable and those incentives that were statistically significant. Model 1 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1043463111434697">Table 2</xref> shows that LR-identification has a negative effect that is not statistically significant. Since the bivariate correlation with protest is only 0.07 the respective coefficient in a multivariate analysis may become negative due to intercorrelations of the independent variables. For protest of wave 3 as a dependent variable (model 4 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1043463111434697">Table 2</xref>) the effect of LR-identification is also negative, but this time marginally statistically significant. The respective bivariate correlation is positive (<italic>r</italic> = 0.05). Thus, the effects of identification are close to zero. This confirms prediction 3 above.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>The effects of the other independent variables are in the expected direction and statistically significant. It is worth noting that in both models almost all independent variables which are significant are measured in the same wave as the dependent variable. The respective variables measured at an earlier wave were statistically not significant. There are thus only simultaneous, but no lagged effects.</p>
<p>To test the solidarity-proposition I extend model 1 and model 4 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1043463111434697">Table 2</xref> by including ‘living in LR’ as well as the interaction ‘LR-identification • living in LR.’ For protest of wave 2 as the dependent variable (see model 2), LR-Identification remains insignificant. However, ‘living in LR’ has the expected negative additive effect: those living in the rural area protest less frequently than those living in Leipzig. Furthermore, the interaction term has the expected effect (<italic>β</italic> = −0.08). The negative sign of the interaction term means that for those who live in the rural area an increasing identification diminishes protest. This is in line with the solidarity-proposition. All other coefficients are very similar to those of model 1.</p>
<p>For protest of wave 3 as a dependent variable (see model 5), LR-identification becomes insignificant. ‘Living in LR’ has the predicted statistically significant negative effect. The effect of the interaction term is negative, as expected, but just under the.05 significance level of 1.65 (<italic>t</italic> = 1.52). The coefficients of the other independent variables are largely the same as in model 4.</p>
<p>I estimated two ‘trimmed’ models for protest of wave 2 and wave 3 as dependent variables, i.e., I dropped all insignificant variables. This yields models 3 and 6 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1043463111434697">Table 2</xref>. The coefficients are largely the same as those of models 2 and 5.</p>
<p>In assessing the findings in relation to the theoretical propositions I wish to emphasize again that ‘living in LR’ is only a proxy so that no strong effects are to be expected. Given the limitations of every proxy variable I conclude that there is some empirical support for the solidarity-proposition.</p>
<p>It may be argued that identity has a <italic>threshold effect</italic>: if identification is relatively low, no protest ensues; but if identification reaches a certain intensity people begin to protest on behalf of the group, and protest increases with rising identification. This curvilinear relationship is an exponential function: the curve (with identification on the horizontal and protest on the vertical axis) is first flat and then sharply increases. I tested this equation with protest of wave 2 and protest of wave 3 as dependent variables by replacing the linear functions of identification (of wave 2 and 3) and protest with an exponential function (with the basis of <italic>e</italic> = 2.71). I further included various other incentive variables. None of my analyses showed any non-linear effects. The same holds for other non-linear functions such as logarithmic and quadratic functions.</p>

<title>The effects of identification on the incentives to protest</title>
<p>We now turn to the effects of identification on the incentives to protest (propositions 4 to 6): it is hypothesized that identification has a positive effect on interest in the quality of life and the acceptance of a protest norm and diminishes general political influence. To test these hypotheses I proceeded as before: the dependent variables are chosen from wave 2 and 3. I include as independent variables identification and as control variables living in LR, the respective interaction term of ‘LR-identification • living in LR,’ the other incentives and the lagged dependent variable. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1043463111434697">Table 3</xref> shows the findings.</p>

<p>Proposition 4 claiming that LR-identification has a positive effect on the public goods variable is confirmed for this variable of wave 2 and of wave 3 (models 1 and 4): the coefficients are identical (<italic>β</italic> = 0.07). The predicted negative effects of identification on general influence (proposition 5) are also confirmed (models 2 and 5). Proposition 6 which assumes a positive effect of identification on the acceptance of a protest norm is only confirmed for wave 3 (model 6) and not for wave 2 (model 3).</p>
<p>Although I have not suggested hypotheses for the effects of the control variables it is nonetheless interesting to look at the positive effect of ‘living in LR’ on accepting a protest norm in wave 2 and wave 3. This relatively strong acceptance of a protest norm in the rural area may be due to socialization under communist rule. It is plausible that personal networks that were critical of the regime were more close-knit in rural areas so that a ‘normative opposition’ was easier to establish. This speculation cannot be tested directly, but if it holds I would expect that respondents who grew up in the rural area during communism had a more intense protest norm than residents of Leipzig. Indeed, residents of the rural area who where older than 39 years in 1989, the actual end of the communist regime, had on the average a stronger protest norm than residents of Leipzig. The finding <italic>cannot</italic> be explained by differential panel attrition of the rural and urban area: the attrition is almost equal.</p>
<p>Another interesting finding is that living in the rural area reduces interest in the quality of life in wave 2 (<italic>β</italic> = −0.08). Thus, identification raises discontent, as proposition 4 assumes; but membership in a solidary group has the effect that identification reduces the value of the publici goods variable. Similarly, the interaction term has a negative effect on accepting a protest norm in wave 2. This means that in the rural area increasing identification lowers the acceptance of a protest norm. In general, however, identification increases the acceptance of a protest norm, as model 6 shows. I leave it to future research to explore these effects for which no propositions were formulated in this paper.</p>

<title>Protest and incentives as determinants of identification</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1043463111434697">Table 4</xref> shows the effects of protest and the incentives on identification. There is only one relatively small effect of protest on LR-identification of wave 2. This was expected because protest in this research is a low-cost activity. There are several effects of incentives on the identification variables. Interest in the quality of life raises identification in both waves. Political influence of wave 1 and 2 has negative effects on identification of wave 2. Models 2 and 3 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1043463111434697">Table 3</xref> show that influence has negative effects on identification. There is thus a feedback effect between identification and influence.

<title>A synopsis of the findings</title>
<p>Since the previous hypotheses and findings are rather complex I will provide a synopsis of the propositions and findings, referring to the causal relationships depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1043463111434697">Figure 1</xref>. Perhaps the most important finding is that the identity proposition assuming a strong positive effect on protest is not confirmed (arrow 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1043463111434697">Figure 1</xref>, and see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1043463111434697">Table 2</xref>). Instead, I provide some empirical evidence for the solidarity-proposition: in solidary groups identification lowers protest, whereas identification raises protest in non-solidary groups.</p>
<p>It was argued that identification can be integrated as a type of incentive into the theory of collective action. I found that the additional incentives that were presumed to instigate protest (public goods preference and influence, acceptance of a protest norm and membership in political groups) had relatively strong effects (see arrow 2, and see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1043463111434697">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>The previous findings do not imply that identification is irrelevant. On the contrary, identification has effects on several incentives (arrow 3, and see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1043463111434697">Table 3</xref>). Thus, identification has <italic>in</italic>direct effects on protest – via incentives. Furthermore, if incentives to protest are strong group identification changes (arrow 4, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1043463111434697">Table 4</xref>). There are thus reciprocal effects of identification and incentives.</p>
<p>It was argued that protest affects identification only in high-cost situations (arrow 5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1043463111434697">Figure 1</xref>). I cannot test this proposition because the protest actions that were measured are low-cost activities. But I can test the alternative proposition that protest in general has an effect on identification. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1043463111434697">Table 4</xref> shows, there is only one weak effect of protest. The proposition that protest <italic>in general</italic> raises identification is thus not confirmed.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>These findings raise several questions for further theory and empirical research. In regard to the relatively small effects of identification on protest that I found, the question arises why some empirical studies in the literature find clear-cut positive effects of identification on protest behavior and others do not.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1043463111434697">8</xref></sup> I will provide some speculations to explore this question.</p>
<list id="list1-1043463111434697" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>(1) Let us first look at situations in which a strong positive effect of identification on protest behavior is plausible. The studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1043463111434697">Simon <italic>et al.</italic> (1998)</xref> show a clear positive effect of identification, in contrast to our own study. The groups were the Grey Panthers and organized homosexuals. One difference between the members of these groups and our respondents is that the former are active members of the respective groups. Why may this be important? The principle of compatibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043463111434697">Ajzen, 1988</xref>) provides at least a partial an answer to this question. Identification with a group is an attitude toward a group. The principle of compatibility suggests, in brief, that an attitude gives rise to the respective behavior if the attitude is closely related to the behavior. To illustrate, assume there is (1) an attitude toward environmental protection and (2) an attitude toward separating trash in the household. The best prediction of the activity ‘separating trash in the household’ would be attitude (2) because there is a greater compatibility of this attitude and the behavior (for details see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043463111434697">Ajzen, 1988</xref>, pages 92–111). This is also plausible from a rational choice perspective: the more specific the preferences (and constraints) for an action are, the better the action can be predicted.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>This principle can explain the effects of group identification on protest. Identification with a group is a very general attitude toward a group. If there exists a positive attitude toward a group such as the Sierra Club (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043463111434697">Ajzen, 1988</xref>, pages 96–97) this attitude does not have any behavior as a referent. The compatibility principle predicts that the correlation between this attitude and a behavior such as protest on behalf of a group should be weak. The correlation may be stronger, if the attitude refers to protest: if there is a positive attitude toward <italic>acting</italic> on behalf of the Sierra Club or on behalf of Leipzig or Germany if the group is threatened I would expect a stronger correlation.</p>
<p>We thus submit that the identity-proposition works well when attitudes are present that refer to specific kinds behavior like protest and not only to the group. Active members of the Grey Panthers will probably have a positive attitude toward their membership group, but also toward supportive actions such as protest behavior. I thus suggest that in certain situations where group identification has an effect on behavior on behalf of the group, the identification variable refers, among other things, to attitudes <italic>toward specific behaviors</italic> in support of a group. To be sure, such attitudes toward acting for a group are not measured in the studies reviewed before, but I assume that they are present when identification shows strong effects on behavior.</p>
<p>This is exactly what the identity-proposition implicitly assumes: when it is said that it is beneficial for those identifying with a group <italic>to act on behalf of the group</italic>, then this implies that there is a preference for or positive attitude toward <italic>acting</italic> on behalf of the group and not only a positive attitude toward the group. Both attitudes need not go together. Empirically, however, a positive attitude toward a group and toward acting on behalf of a group are related in groups such as homosexuals or Grey Panthers, but less in groups such as residents of Leipzig or Germany. I cannot test this explanation because attitudes toward acting or protesting on behalf of a group were not measured in our research. Further research on the effects of identification is needed that ascertains these different kinds of attitudes for different groups.</p>
<list id="list2-1043463111434697" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>(2) It was argued that the identity-proposition is implied by the theory of collective action (see proposition 1) which, in turn, rests on the theory of rational action. I found, however, that the direct additive effect of identification is rather small. Is this a falsification of the theory of collective action and consequently a falsification of rational action theory? In testing the theory of rational action it must be determined empirically what the costs and benefits for a specific behavior are. Even if identification makes acting on behalf of a group beneficial, the benefits may be low and the costs high so that identification has only a small effect. This does not imply that the theory of collective action and, as a consequence, rational action theory are falsified. It only implies that certain hypotheses about costs and benefits in a specific situation are incorrect.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(3) This paper is based on a specific definition of ‘identity’ as attachment to a group. If identity is defined differently one will expect other effects. For example, assume identity is defined as a role or position. An ‘activist identity’ thus means taking over an ‘activist role.’ An example are the activists in the ‘Freedom summer’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1043463111434697">McAdam, 1988</xref>). Holding a role is associated with a whole set of incentives to perform a complex set of activities. It is not surprising that the identity variable defined in this way has strong effects on various kinds of behavior. This holds as well when identity is defined as an intention to act (or to protest) on behalf of a group. Research shows that intention has in general a strong effect on the respective behavior. Thus, strong effects of ‘identity’ on protest might be due to a definition of identity that differs from the one used in this paper. It would be an important task to explore which of the many definitions and measurements of identity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1043463111434697">Sinnott, 2005</xref>) are theoretically most fruitful to explain protest behavior.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(4) Assume an individual strongly identifies with a group such as a social movement. Why should the individual protest on behalf of the group and not decide to support the group in a different way such as spending money or taking on a position in the group? The social movement literature seems to assume that protest is the major alternative to support a group without providing any evidence for this claim. It seems plausible that identification and protest are not strongly related if other alternatives than protest are seen as more adequate to support a groups. It seems thus important for future research that the perceived behavioral alternatives of those who identify with a group are ascertained. It may turn out that those who strongly identify with a group will not protest because they support the group in other ways.</p></list-item></list>
