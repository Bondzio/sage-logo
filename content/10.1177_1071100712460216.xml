<sec id="section1-1071100712460216">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Adult patients with cavovarus feet were seen with symptomatic anteromedial ankle arthrosis and, frequently, lateral hindfoot instability. Static and dynamic realignment was performed to redistribute joint contact pressures and restore stability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1071100712460216">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Thirteen patients with fixed cavovarus feet (6 neurogenic, 7 idiopathic; 6 with hindfoot instability, 7 without) and mild to moderate anteromedial ankle arthrosis were treated by osteotomies and tendon transfers but no lateral ligament reconstruction. Anteromedial cheilectomy of the ankle was added to increase dorsiflexion and alleviate anteromedial impingement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1071100712460216">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Failure occurred in 2 patients, who required additional procedures. The remaining 11 patients improved from preoperative 45 to 71 points (American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Ankle-Hindfoot Scale score) at the latest follow-up (average 84 months). Ankle dorsiflexion improved 7 degrees on average. There was no recurrent hindfoot instability and no progression of anteromedial ankle arthrosis over time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1071100712460216">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Cavovarus foot realignment with anteromedial ankle cheilectomy reliably improved patients’ symptoms related to ankle arthrosis, restored lateral hindfoot stability, and stabilized the extent of anteromedial ankle arthrosis when talar varus tilt was reduced.</p>

<body>
<p>Pes cavovarus is a complex deformity thought to occur from muscular imbalance of idiopathic or neurologic origin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1071100712460216">16</xref></sup> The pathology of the deformity consists of a flexible or fixed hindfoot varus and an adducted and plantarflexed medial forefoot that contributes to hindfoot varus and relative dorsiflexion of the talus. Mainly, the plantarflexion of the medial forefoot and the hindfoot varus alter the ankle biomechanics and lead to an anteromedial concentration of the joint contact pressure, which long term may cause ankle arthrosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712460216">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The association among lateral ankle instability, cavovarus deformity, and medial ankle arthrosis has been made by various authors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712460216">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1071100712460216">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1071100712460216">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1071100712460216">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1071100712460216">31</xref></sup> However, we have observed patients with cavovarus feet and ankle arthrosis but without hindfoot instability. Realignment osteotomy is a well-known treatment option for localized mild to moderate joint degeneration in a malaligned hindfoot.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712460216">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712460216">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712460216">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1071100712460216">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1071100712460216">23</xref></sup> Usually, lateral hindfoot ligament reconstruction to treat concomitant instability is advised in conjunction with the osteotomies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712460216">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712460216">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1071100712460216">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1071100712460216">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1071100712460216">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1071100712460216">29</xref></sup> We omitted ligament reconstruction because the power of the combination of osteotomies and tendon transfers was considered sufficient to restore lateral hindfoot stability.</p>
<p>The purpose of this retrospective study was to assess whether cavovarus realignment in combination with anteromedial ankle cheilectomy alleviated the symptoms of anteromedial ankle arthrosis and impingement, restored lateral hindfoot stability, and increased ankle dorsiflexion and whether this effect was reliable and durable. Additionally, the postoperative decrease of the radiographic varus tilt of the talus and its effect on clinical outcome were analyzed. Finally, the postoperative course of anteromedial ankle arthrosis was observed to find out whether progression of the arthrosis was inevitable or whether it could be slowed or halted.</p>
<sec id="section6-1071100712460216" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Between November 1997 and November 2008, the authors operated on 36 patients (39 feet) for symptoms related to a fixed cavovarus deformity. Seventeen patients (17 feet) suffered from mild to severe ankle arthrosis. All the patients had preoperative magnetic resonance (MR) tomography evaluation of the ankle and the subtalar and Chopart joints. Patients with active inflammatory degeneration (ie, synovitis and/or cancellous edema) of a joint other than the ankle were excluded. Without active inflammation, reduced motion or even subtotal stiffness of one of these joints was not considered as a contraindication to realignment by osteotomy unless the correction could technically not be achieved without arthrodesis. We considered that even a little motion was worthwhile preserving to reduce the stresses otherwise transmitted to the ankle.</p>
<p>Of the 6 patients with subjective lateral hindfoot instability, MR also revealed tear or scar formation of the anterior talofibular ligament in 6 patients and the calcaneofibular ligament in 5. Of those without subjective instability, MR showed a tear or scar formation of the anterior talofibular ligament in 3 and the calcaneofibular ligament in 1.</p>
<p>Four patients with grade 4 anteromedial ankle arthrosis (according to the Kellgren-Lawrence scale)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712460216">9</xref></sup> were treated with an ankle arthrodesis. Thirteen patients (10 male, 3 female; average age, 47 years) with grade 1 to 3 anteromedial ankle arthrosis (2.3 on average) were treated with a static and dynamic forefoot and hindfoot realignment and an anteromedial cheilectomy of the ankle joint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1071100712460216">Figures 1</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1071100712460216"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1071100712460216"/>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1071100712460216">4</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1071100712460216">Table 1</xref>). All 6 patients with a neurogenic cavovarus deformity were community walkers (independent in all home and community activities with complete independence in shopping centers; can accept crowds and uneven terrain).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712460216">10</xref></sup> One patient (No. 2) had 3 previous ligament reconstructions for lateral ankle instability that failed. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients, and the institutional review board approved the study.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Failure occurred in 2 patients with lateral hindfoot instability, idiopathic etiology of the cavovarus deformity, and advanced ankle arthrosis that required additional operations. One patient (No. 12) had an increase of anteromedial ankle pain and the talar varus tilt. He underwent total ankle replacement with no additional procedures 14 months after the index operation. Another patient (No. 13) had ongoing ankle and increasing subtalar discomfort, as well as a lingering varus tilt of the talus. She had a shortening osteotomy of the fibula, realigning subtalar fusion, release of the deltoid, and reconstruction of the lateral ligaments 12 months after the index operation.</p>
<p>No immediate postoperative complications occurred. One patient (No. 2) had ongoing metatarsalgia but did not elect to have another operation; another patient (No. 6) developed a chronic regional pain syndrome 3 months postoperatively. Despite intensive physical therapy and oral medication, a residual chronic pain syndrome persisted at the latest follow-up. Both patients with postoperative complications had a neurologic etiology of their cavovarus deformity.</p>
<p>All other patients with successful realignment were satisfied with the operation and stated that they would undergo the operation again. All patients reported reduced or no impingement at the anteromedial ankle joint. No patient reported ongoing lateral hindfoot instability.</p>
<p>The 13 patients were evaluated at an average follow-up of 84 months (range, 34-135; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1071100712460216">Table 3</xref>). With the small number of patients available, the following statistical results were calculated. They had a significant improvement of the ankle-hindfoot score from preoperatively 45 points to postoperatively 71 points on average (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). There was a significant gain in ankle dorsiflexion (7 degrees on average; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>Poor ankle-hindfoot scores at latest follow-up correlated significantly with the amount of initial radiographic ankle arthrosis (<italic>r</italic> = −0.49, <italic>P</italic> = .046). As opposed to our previous findings (unpublished data), there was no significant correlation of the preoperative or postoperative lateral talo–first metatarsal angles and the extent of the anteromedial ankle arthrosis. The grading of the radiographic anteromedial ankle arthrosis remained unchanged during the average 84-month follow-up period. There was no significant correlation (<italic>r</italic> = 0.19, <italic>P</italic> = .28) between the intraoperative grading of cartilage destruction in the anteromedial ankle joint and the radiographic grading of the anteromedial arthrosis. The localized cartilage destruction ranged from grade 2.5 to 4 (3.5 on average) according to Outerbridge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1071100712460216">19</xref></sup> and was found 18 to 28 mm in length and 7 to 16 mm in width on the anteromedial talar surface and 7 to 20 mm in length and 5 to 10 mm in width on the tibial surface. While the grading of intraoperative cartilage destruction did not correlate significantly with poor ankle-hindfoot scores (<italic>r</italic> = −0.33, <italic>P</italic> = .137), the correlation of the extent of cartilage destruction and poor ankle-hindfoot scores reached the level of significance (<italic>r</italic> = −0.52, <italic>P</italic> = .033).</p>
<p>Postoperative changes of the talocalcaneal angle and the calcaneal pitch angle did not reach the level of significance. Both the postoperative anteroposterior talo–first metatarsal angle (–5 degrees on average, <italic>P</italic> = .002) and the postoperative lateral talo–first metatarsal angle (–8 degrees on average, <italic>P</italic> = .006) decreased significantly. The radiographic varus tilt of the talus was initially 7 degrees on average and 2 degrees on average in the contralateral less affected ankle. It improved 3 degrees on average postoperatively (<italic>P</italic> = .108) for all patients, whereas for the cavovarus deformity realignments that did not fail, the level of significance was reached (4 degrees on average, <italic>P</italic> = .02). A highly significant correlation of the postoperative varus tilt and failure was calculated (<italic>r</italic> = 0.88, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). The correlation of the extent of the intraoperative cartilage defect and failure was also significant (<italic>r</italic> = −0.625, <italic>P</italic> = .011). There was a moderate correlation (<italic>r</italic> = 0.53, <italic>P</italic> = .07) of the initial talar varus tilt to the severity of the ankle arthrosis but no correlation (<italic>r</italic> = −0.3, <italic>P</italic> = .16) of lateral ankle instability and the severity of the ankle arthrosis.</p>
<p>With the number of patients available, there were no substantial differences between neurogenic and idiopathic cavovarus feet with regard to clinical outcome as measured by the ankle-hindfoot score (<italic>P</italic> = .33) and radiographic preoperative and postoperative assessments. Also, no significant differences were seen in the ankle-hindfoot score (<italic>P</italic> = .26) or arthrosis grading at the initial (<italic>P</italic> = .65) and final follow-up (<italic>P</italic> = .39) evaluating patients with and without lateral ankle instability.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Realignment osteotomy with or without joint debridement is a well-known treatment option for localized mild to moderate joint degeneration in a malaligned extremity. It has been successfully used in the distal tibia and fibula to treat varus arthrosis of the ankle in patients without cavovarus foot malalignment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712460216">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712460216">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1071100712460216">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1071100712460216">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1071100712460216">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1071100712460216">26</xref></sup> In the presence of a horizontal ankle joint line and a cavovarus foot, however, it appears more reasonable to redistribute the ankle joint contact forces by realigning the foot deformity rather than by creating a new deformity (ie, with a supramalleolar osteotomy). Furthermore, this would create additional problems in the forefoot by accentuating the plantarflexion of the first ray.</p>
<p>Techniques to realign the cavovarus foot have been proven to be effective in relieving the patients’ symptoms related to hindfoot instability and overload of the forefoot. However, little is known on their effect on the symptoms and on the course of an associated ankle arthrosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712460216">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712460216">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Clinical considerations and biomechanical evidence indicate an anteromedial increase of the ankle joint contact pressures in cavovarus deformity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712460216">12</xref></sup> In this study, a group of patients with cavovarus feet, with or without lateral ligamentous hindfoot instability, and anteromedial ankle arthrosis was evaluated. Correcting the deformity should unload the degenerated portion of the joint, consequently relieve pain, and influence the progression of the degeneration. In fact, all 11 patients with successful realignment demonstrated a substantial alleviation of the symptoms of the anteromedial ankle arthrosis and an increase of ankle dorsiflexion. It also provided hindfoot stability without lateral ligament reconstruction in the patients that reported recurrent hindfoot sprains prior to the operation. A redistribution of the joint contact forces was seen radiographically since the varus tilt of the talus resolved, or at least improved, in most patients. The increase in the ankle-hindfoot score and the radiographic arthrosis grade remained stable throughout the 7 years of average follow-up.</p>
<p>Failure in 2 patients correlated with a persistent postoperative varus tilt of the talus and with the extent of the cartilage defect of the talar and/or tibial side of the joint. Also, with the cavovarus alignment, preoperative lateral hindfoot instability did not resolve in these patients. Obstacles to intraoperative reduction of the varus talar tilt may include osteophytes and scar tissue in the lateral gutter, as well as a tight deltoid ligament from lateral hindfoot instability and medial cartilage erosion in the ankle joint. A persistent varus talar tilt despite elimination of the obstacles may well be caused by a cartilage defect that is too large and additional bony erosion that mechanically obviates a rotation of the talus back to a neutral position. With competent lateral ligaments, a shortening osteotomy of the fibula in conjunction with a deltoid ligament release may be attempted to increase the reduction force on the talar dome. This was successfully performed in patient No. 11 with 28 months of follow-up.</p>
<p>In the literature, reports on the outcome of realignment for ankle arthrosis in cavovarus deformity are rare. A recent study by Irwin et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712460216">8</xref></sup> on 22 patients determined the impact of preoperative ankle arthrosis grade on the outcome 60 months postoperatively. Deformity correction included realignment osteotomy, lateral ligament reconstruction, and various soft tissue procedures. Fourteen patients with no to mild preoperative ankle arthrosis (group 1; average arthrosis grade, 0.5) had a significantly higher ankle-hindfoot score (average score, 86 points) than the 8 patients with moderate to severe arthrosis (group 2; average arthrosis grade, 2.1; average score, 59). Progression of ankle arthrosis through the follow-up period was observed in 1 patient of group 1 and 5 patients of group 2, which included 2 subsequent ankle arthrodeses. The authors recommended a cautious and realistic approach for patients with cavovarus feet and more advanced ankle arthrosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712460216">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>In our study, poor scores were closely related not only to the initial severity of the ankle arthrosis but also, more important, to persistent varus tilt of the talus, ongoing lateral hindfoot instability, and the extent of the intraoperative cartilage defect. Unfortunately, correction or persistence of varus tilt after realignment was not correlated to progression of ankle arthrosis in the Irwin et al study. Their finding of progression of arthrosis even in patients with mild and moderate degeneration during a similar follow-up period was not confirmed in our study. While the extent of static deformity correction in their patients compares well to ours (lateralizing calcaneal osteotomy, dorsiflexion osteotomy of the first metatarsal), the more aggressive dynamic correction in our patients may account for the different findings of ankle arthrosis progression. A peroneus-brevis-to-longus transfer was performed in 77% (10 of 13) of our patients and in only 27% of Irwin’s patients (6 of 22; of those, 4 peroneus brevis to longus and 2 peroneus longus to brevis); 69% of our patients (9 of 13) had a lateralization of the anterior tibial tendon, none of theirs.</p>
<p>Fortin et al recognized the prevalence of tibiotalar arthritis in 13 ankles (10 patients) with lateral instability and idiopathic cavovarus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712460216">6</xref></sup> Four patients with mild to moderate arthrosis were treated with anteromedial cheilectomy, lateral ankle ligament reconstruction, and calcaneal and metatarsal osteotomy. The authors found sufficient correction of the deformity, resolution of pain, and improved functional scores. These patients compare well to ours with respect to the extent of deformity and severity of ankle arthrosis. Unfortunately, because of the small number of patients and short follow-up (33 months, average), no statement about the progression of the arthrosis was possible.</p>
<p>The plantarflexed medial forefoot was a constant component of the cavovarus deformity in our patients. Not only does it force the hindfoot into a varus position, but it also forces the talus into dorsiflexion at the ankle. This results in tibiotalar impingement, worsening the symptoms of the ankle arthrosis. Consequently, realignment should per se improve dorsiflexion and therefore add to the positive effect of anteromedial cheilectomy. We have not performed cheilectomy without realignment in cavovarus feet, because an anteromedial talar subluxation that could occur or worsen, leading to increased symptoms and degeneration of the ankle, was suspected.</p>
<p>Fortin et al also included open cheilectomy for anterior osteophytes in realignment of cavovarus feet with ankle arthrosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712460216">6</xref></sup> The gain of dorsiflexion was not measured, but all patients had resolution of preoperative symptoms of anterior impingement. Ogilvie-Harris et al reviewed 17 patients without or with mild preoperative joint space narrowing 3 years after arthroscopic resection of anterior bony spurs at the ankle joint and reported a significant improvement of dorsiflexion (9 degrees on average). However, they did not report on the foot alignment of their patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1071100712460216">18</xref></sup> The gain of dorsiflexion compared well to our results. Generally, patients without preoperative joint space narrowing seem to have good or excellent functional results, while those with joint space narrowing have worse results. Osteophytes frequently recur but rarely cause symptoms again.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712460216">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1071100712460216">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>The significant gain of dorsiflexion in our patients remained constant throughout the follow-up period, although the osteophytes partially recurred in half the patients. This implies that the improved dorsiflexion was mostly due to the dorsiflexion osteotomies of the medial metatarsals, but the patients without metatarsal osteotomies improved just as well in ankle dorsiflexion. Both the metatarsal osteotomies and the anteromedial ankle cheilectomy likely contributed to the increase in ankle dorsiflexion and the alleviation of anteromedial impingement. However, it was not possible to quantify the additional effect of the Achilles tendon lengthening, performed in 3 patients, and physical therapy.</p>
<p>A significant reduction of the talar varus tilt in the postoperative radiographs was recorded for the successful realignments. This likely implies a lateral shift of the joint contact pressure, indicating that the cavovarus realignment had an unloading effect on the anteromedial ankle joint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1071100712460216">Figure 1</xref>). The positive effect of lateralizing calcaneal osteotomies in simulated cavovarus feet has recently been demonstrated in a cadaver model. A substantial reduction of the elevated anteromedial joint pressure with lateralization of the center of force by calcaneal osteotomies was demonstrated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1071100712460216">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Takakura et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1071100712460216">25</xref></sup> reported good results in 15 of 18 patients with medial ankle arthrosis and varus tilt of the tibial plafond but otherwise normally aligned feet. They were treated with low tibial osteotomy and followed for 7 years. There was an improvement of the medial joint space narrowing in 13 ankles. The authors stated that the valgus and anterior open-wedge osteotomy can shift the load from medial to lateral and that, consequently, the loading area with intact articular cartilage is increased. Clinically and radiographically, there was no progression of the stage of ankle arthrosis in their patients within 7 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1071100712460216">25</xref></sup> Distal tibial osteotomy has successfully been used in cavovarus feet with ankle arthrosis and plafond malalignment as well.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712460216">7</xref></sup> With a radiographic horizontal plafond, however, realigning at the site of the principal deformity seems the more straightforward and reasonable approach.</p>
<p>The association of lateral ligamentous hindfoot instability, cavovarus deformity, and ankle arthrosis has been made by various authors, who all advise not only correction of the foot deformity with osteotomies and tendon transfers but also lateral hindfoot ligament reconstruction to prevent recurrence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712460216">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712460216">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1071100712460216">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1071100712460216">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1071100712460216">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1071100712460216">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1071100712460216">31</xref></sup> Fortin et al reported lateral ankle ligament instability in all of their 10 patients with ankle arthrosis in idiopathic cavovarus deformity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712460216">6</xref></sup> Sammarco et al found 5 of 15 patients with lateral ankle instability in neurogenic cavovarus deformities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1071100712460216">21</xref></sup> Valderrabano et al stated a moderately strong correlation of chronic lateral ankle instability or ankle sprain and ankle arthrosis due to hindfoot varus malalignment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1071100712460216">28</xref></sup> All authors proposed to perform lateral ligament reconstruction in conjunction with cavovarus deformity realignment. In our patients with neurogenic and idiopathic cavovarus deformities, there was a moderate correlation of the extent of the talar varus tilt and the severity of the ankle arthrosis. Six patients preoperatively complained about chronic lateral ankle instability, but there was no correlation to the severity of the ankle arthrosis. Although no lateral hindfoot ligament reconstructions were performed, all these patients (excluding the patients that were considered as failures) were relieved of their instability postoperatively and had similar functional outcome and arthrosis grading at final follow-up as opposed to those without instability. The static and dynamic cavovarus realignment alone obviously provided sufficient lateral hindfoot stability. This finding supports the hypothesis that the cavovarus deformity itself—and not predominantly the lateral instability—has a major influence on the development of the anteromedial ankle arthrosis, as substantiated in a recent biomechanical study evaluating ankle joint pressure in simulated cavovarus feet.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712460216">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The unloading effect of a calcaneal osteotomy on the medial ankle hyperpressure in a cavovarus foot has been well documented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1071100712460216">14</xref></sup> No such evidence is available for the metatarsal osteotomies. The effect of the tendon transfers is even more difficult to assess since it is a dynamic phenomenon. Clinical observations from our patients’ feet suggest that the transfer of the insertion of the anterior tibial tendon to the lateral cuneiform is a powerful step of the dynamic realignment, providing both hindfoot stability and lateral shift of the ankle center of force by changing the strong inversion moment into a light eversion moment while still maintaining dorsiflexion power.</p>
<p>The strength of our study is the long follow-up. Weaknesses are the small number of patients with regard to statistical calculations, the different cavovarus etiology (idiopathic and neurologic) and arthrosis grades (mild and moderate), the individualized set of operative steps, and the lack of a control group.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Individualized cavovarus realignment resulted in appropriate reduction of the fixed deformity in the majority of cases. It restored hindfoot stability without lateral ligament reconstruction when the varus tilt of the talus was reduced. Pain from anteromedial impingement and anteromedial ankle arthrosis grades 1 to 3 according to Kellgren<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712460216">9</xref></sup> was relieved and dorsiflexion improved. The results were reliable and durable and correlated to improved talar tilt and extent of intraoperative cartilage defect. Progression of the anteromedial ankle arthrosis was not seen during the study period.</p>
