<abstract>
<p>This article examines the changing ethics of war photojournalism. It provides a review of the major paradigms of war communication studies, propaganda and memory studies, to argue that, despite their contributions, neither focuses on historical change in the ethics of war. In the light of an analytical discussion of iconic images of the First World War and Second World War as well as the War on Terror in terms of how they portray the battlefield the article argues that there is a historical shift towards an increasingly explicit visualisation of war, which today tends to emphasise the emotional, rather than physical, impact of the battlefield upon both soldiers and civilians. This shift, it concludes, reflects the contemporary political context of humanitarian wars fought with a view to alleviating suffering, rather than wars fought over national sovereignty.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In her acclaimed book, <italic>The Cruel Radiance: Photography and Political Violence</italic> (2010), Susan Linfield puts forward an original argument about the changing meanings of war in the photojournalism of the 20th century. War images, she argues, have moved from less to more explicit visualisations of violence – a historical trend that she attributes to the fact that ‘since the end of the cold war … violence has become less tethered to political aims, which is to say it has become more nihilistic and more “autonomous”’ (p. 133). In a relevant interview, she contrasts the photojournalism of the Spanish Civil War, which inspired unprecedented acts of international solidarity, with contemporary photojournalism, where ‘that kind of solidarity and political clarity is very, very hard to come by. So I think’, Linfield concludes, ‘what we’re presented with visually is the bodily disfigurement, the tortured bodies, but without any kind of political context in which to understand it.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1470357213484422">1</xref></sup> It is this conceptual connection between images and ethics, the ethics of violence, that lends to Linfield’s argument its analytical power in producing historicised accounts of war photojournalism and separates it from mainstream literature on images of war – mostly about influential but a-historical claims on the photography of war as an aestheticisation of violence (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470357213484422">Berger, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1470357213484422">Sontag, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Whereas I agree with Linfield that the visualisations of war have indeed become more explicit, my own argument shifts the empirical focus from her (primarily) non-Western to Western contexts so as to nuance and complicate her claim in two important ways:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1470357213484422">2</xref></sup> first, I demonstrate that visual explicitness is today primarily about the <italic>psychological trauma</italic> of war, rather than ‘bodily disfigurement’, and second, I claim that, even though we are indeed far from the international solidarity of 1936–1939, we are now presented with an intensely moralistic context for understanding war as <italic>humanitarian benevolence</italic>, rather than the nihilistic context of autonomous violence.</p>
<p>My argument centres upon war photojournalism as a practice of visual representation that mundanely confronts us with the realities of the battlefield. Together with other public genres of story-telling, like television news, films, novels or computer games, photojournalism constitutes, what we may call, a ‘war imaginary’ – a configuration of popular practices of representation through which war is imagined as a constitutive dimension of our public morality. This is because, whilst war is denounced as a cause of extreme suffering, it is always also fought in the name of moral principle and, therefore, simultaneously carries specific visions of humanity that are we are all called to endorse – what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470357213484422">Howard (1978)</xref> calls ‘the liberal paradox of war’.</p>
<p>Starting from this tenuous articulation of deliberate inflictions of suffering with moral visions of humanity that defines the war imaginary, I explore how photojournalism has historically sought to resolve this paradox and how, in so doing, it has participated in changing visions of humanity, at two key moments in recent history: the first half of the 20th century, defined below by the two global ‘industrial’ wars (the First and Second World Wars), and the early 21st century, characterised by the emergence of ‘information’ wars (War on Terror). I start with a review of the major paradigms of war communication studies, propaganda and memory studies, to argue that, despite their contributions, neither focuses on historical change in the ethics of war. After introducing the war imaginary as a theoretical concept with important analytical implications, I proceed with a discussion of Anglo/American and Australian iconic images of the First World War (1914–1918) and Second World War (1939–1945) as well as the War on Terror (2001–2012) in terms of how they portray the battlefield. <italic>Pace</italic> Linfield, I conclude, the increasingly explicit visualisation of war centres on the <italic>emotional</italic>, rather than physical, impact of the battlefield upon both soldiers and civilians, whilst the political context of this photography of trauma, far from absent, is one of <italic>humanitarian wars</italic> fought with a view to <italic>‘</italic>alleviating the immediate images of death and suffering’, rather than sovereignty wars fought over national territories and their borders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470357213484422">Coker, 2001</xref>: 130).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1470357213484422">3</xref></sup></p>

<title>Paradigms of War Communication Studies</title>
<p>Two strands define the literature on war communication: war as propaganda and war as cultural memory. Whereas the former is about how photojournalism manipulates war communication with a view to legitimising it in people’s ‘hearts and minds’, the latter focuses on how war images contribute to working through the traumatic memories of those subject to its suffering.</p>
<p><italic>War as propaganda</italic>, largely concerned with visual representation (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470357213484422">Roeder, 1993</xref>), is part of the broader field of strategic communication – that is, communication geared towards persuasion – which it has largely helped to shape. Its usefulness lies in scrutinising invisible relationships of complicity between governments, the military and the media and, thus, explicating the formidable mechanisms of communication that nation-states mobilise to guarantee loyalty among publics and allies in wartime. Whilst propaganda literature is vast, seminal pieces in this research paradigm include Harold Lasswell’s <italic>Propaganda Technique in World War I</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1470357213484422">1971</xref>), which offers the first systematic conceptualisation of propaganda in terms of the promotion of <italic>‘</italic>war aims<italic>’</italic> as ‘the catalysts of transnational political action<italic>’</italic> and <italic>‘</italic>the management of public expectations<italic>’</italic> as ‘the illusion of victory’ (pp. xxiii–iv) but also Herman and Chomsky’s <italic>Manufacturing Consent</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1470357213484422">1988</xref>), which discusses Vietnam as a paradigmatic case of how war propaganda can fail when political elites disagree. More recent work has focused on the transformations of communication involved in the shift from the earlier, ‘industrial’, to contemporary, ‘information’, wars, where super-sophisticated military communication systems, a specialised warrior force, globalised and interactive media turn propaganda into a complex <italic>‘</italic>management of perceptions’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1470357213484422">Tumber and Webster, 2006</xref>: 28–45; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1470357213484422">Kamalipour and Snow, 2004</xref>). This study traces precisely this move from industrial (the First and Second World Wars) to information wars (the War on Terror), by looking at the changing ways in which images communicate the realities of battlefield. It departs from propaganda studies, however, as, despite its contributions, this paradigm tends to suffer from two limitations: its emphasis on communication granted, it underestimates the <italic>performative</italic> work that representations, that is the images and language of propaganda, do in constituting the subjects of national loyalty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470357213484422">Butler, 2006</xref>) and, as a result, it under-theorises the role of such acts of representation in forming public dispositions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470357213484422">Corner, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>War as memory</italic>, born out of a (revised) tradition of psychoanalytic trauma studies, draws attention to the ways in which war images participate in processes of collective remembering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470357213484422">Alexander, 2004</xref>). Unlike propaganda, which is marked by instrumentality, memory studies view war communication as a therapeutic form of communication that addresses the disruptive experience of violence, by articulating it with fantasy and thereby contributing to the narrative healing of traumatised publics. Central to this process are the popular genres of representation through which memory is fashioned: <italic>‘</italic>cultural memory’, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1470357213484422">Sturken (1997</xref>: 8) puts it, ‘is produced through representation – in contemporary culture, often through photographic images, cinema and television.’ This centrality of representation, lacking in propaganda studies, has led to a proliferation of research on the role that popular culture plays in working through 20th-century traumas via the therapeutic work of the sites of war memorialisation, of literature and poetry, of photography and the media (for an overview, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470357213484422">Erll and Nunning, 2008</xref>). Seminal pieces addressing each of these themes include Jay Winter’s <italic>Sites of Memory: Sites of Mourning</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1470357213484422">1995</xref>), which uniquely illustrates the European experience of grief after the First World War; Paul Fussell’s <italic>The Great War and Modern Memory</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470357213484422">1975</xref>), which examines how the literary cannon and popular genres have established dominant ways of remembering the First World War in English culture; Samuel Hynes’ <italic>A War Imagined</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470357213484422">1990</xref>), which draws on a broad range of cultural material (from theatre to journalism and from fashion to parliamentary debates) to trace how this culture was shaped by its multiple ‘imaginations’ of war; and Barbie Zelizer’s <italic>Remembering to Forget</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1470357213484422">1998</xref>), which shows how our over-familiarisation with Holocaust images may be weakening our response to contemporary atrocities. Far from adopting a deterministic view on publics as uniformly shaped by war messages, as propaganda often does, this strand emphasises instead the multiple ways in which images may cumulatively shape collective memory in our culture. The critical analysis that informs these studies also informs my own work in the communication of war, but ultimately I engage neither with trauma and the restorative effects of popular narratives nor with cultural memory and the ways in which atrocity photography may ‘help us <italic>make sense of the past and the future</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1470357213484422">Zelizer, 1998</xref>, emphasis in original).</p>

<sec id="section3-1470357213484422">
<title>The War Imaginary</title>
<p>My starting point is the communication of war as an imaginary: a structured configuration of representational practices, which produces specific performances of the battlefield at specific moments in time, with a view not only to informing and persuading us, as per the instrumental aspect of propaganda, but also to cultivating longer-term dispositions towards the visions of humanity that each war comes to defend. Even though the intellectual trajectory of the term ‘imaginary’ passes through Lacanian psychoanalysis and Castoriades’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470357213484422">1987[1975]</xref>) political theory, my own use of the term is informed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1470357213484422">Charles Taylor’s (2002</xref>: 106) conception of social imaginaries as spaces of popular communication consisting precisely of ‘those images, stories and legends’ through which ‘people imagine their social existence, how they fit together with others … and the deeper normative notions and images that underlie these expectations’.</p>
<p>Extending, thus, Samuel Hynes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470357213484422">1990</xref>: ix) characterisation of the First World War as a ‘great imaginative event’, I take the war imaginary to refer to all 20th- and 21st-century wars, which, in different degrees, were technologically recorded and disseminated, thereby nurturing the imaginations of their publics about what war is and how we should respond to it. In this sense, the war imaginary partly encompasses and partly transcends cultural memory assumptions, in that its focus on popular representations entails a strong normative dimension, implicit in memory studies. In communicating war, this approach has it, the war imaginary does not simply seek to shape the present or heal the past, but simultaneously offers us the resources to imagine who we should be and how we should act as moral subjects – in Frazer and Hutchings’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1470357213484422">2011</xref>: 58) words, the imaginary acts as a normative resource for ‘the distinction and relation between civic and military virtue’. This virtue-oriented normativity of the imaginary, as performative practices that mobilise image and language in order to sustain the collective self-description of communities of virtue, points to the fact that such practices, rather than simply persuading or healing their publics, habitually constitute these publics as moral subjects at the moment that they claim to address them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1470357213484422">4</xref></sup> The force of habituation is, in this sense, not a simple corrective to a pre-existing public morality but bears a <italic>constitutive</italic> force on this morality, as it routinely uses the pictorial performances of war so as to call an ethics of humanity into existence.</p>
<p>From the multiple performances of war, the battlefield, where mass killing takes place at an unimaginable scale, is the most poignant site of the war imaginary. Here, the ambivalence of the imaginary, summed up as it is in the incongruous co-existence of inhumane violence with visions of humanity, is most dramatically enacted. Under the pressure of this tension, the force of habituation that marks the war imaginary as a performative mechanism of moral dispositions can never be a purely mindless repetition of moral norms. It requires instead a reflexive re-engagement with the particular contexts of its emergence and, hence, entails an always renewed performance that may subvert these norms in the act of reproducing them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470357213484422">Chouliaraki 2012</xref>). It is this iterative process, whereby the imaginary is transformed through the very representational practices that reproduce it, which bears the potential for a historical account of change in war photojournalism. Explaining such transformations, I argue, tells us something important about changing moral visions of humanity in the past hundred years.</p>
<sec id="section4-1470357213484422">
<title>Analysing the war imaginary</title>
<p>Drawing on iconic photojournalism from the first half of the 20th century (the First and Second World Wars) and the first decade of the 21st century (War on Terror), I discuss how the visual configuration of <italic>bodies in battle</italic> has shifted in time. Despite the wealth of pictorial material on these wars, my choice of, specifically, iconic imagery of the battlefield draws attention to the enduring, ubiquitous and recurring presence of particular photographs that have historically acted as ‘symbols of cultural and national myth’ and so shaped the war imaginary of the West (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1470357213484422">Griffin, 1999</xref>: 123).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1470357213484422">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The claim to objectivity in professional journalism granted, let us remember that the spectacle of war always emerges within specific ‘spaces of appearance’ – institutionalised sites of spectatorship, where the regulation of visual performance is absolutely crucial in the production of a unified moral imagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470357213484422">Butler, 2006</xref>: xx). In the case of war propaganda, Butler argues, such regulation applies ‘not only on content – certain images of dead bodies in Iraq, for instance, are considered unacceptable for public visual consumption – but on what “can” be heard, read, seen, felt and known’. Breaking from conceptions of aesthetics as a-political, this approach aligns itself with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1470357213484422">Linfield’s (2010)</xref> historical view on the social semiotic work of images (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1470357213484422">Harriman and Loucaites, 2007</xref>) and thus treats war photojournalism as an aesthetic practice of power through which the spectacle of battlefield is institutionally regulated so as to represent ‘what “can” be heard … seen … felt’ in a legitimate and persuasive manner, at particular points in time.</p>
<p>I therefore approach my first analytical category, the <italic>aesthetic quality</italic> of war photography, as evidence of this visual regulation along the two key representational dimensions of the battlefield: the organisation of <italic>human bodies</italic> and their technologies within specific spatial zones of activity, or <italic>landscapes</italic>. It is this focus on the aesthetic strategies through which certain compositions of combative action become intelligible to us that allows me, in a second move, to reflect upon the moral agency that these images make possible. The analytical category of <italic>moral agency</italic>, then, opens up to critical scrutiny the question of how war images operate as a resource of collective moralisation – how, that is, they propose specific conceptions of humanity as legitimate and desirable for all. I begin with the early 20th-century battlefields of the First and Second World Wars and proceed to address the contemporary battlefields of the War on Terror.</p>

<sec id="section5-1470357213484422">
<title>World Wars of the 20th Century</title>
<p>The First World War was the first to become immediately visible to civilians: ‘During the First World War’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470357213484422">Carmichael (1989</xref>: 4) says, ‘it was for the first time possible for people to see and read about a major conflict more or less as it happened.’ This new visibility of the war was, however, shaped by two factors: the large scale of military operations, which defied ‘spectacularisation’ by the technical apparata of the time, and the strict state regulation of war information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470357213484422">Carruthers, 2000</xref>: 57–58). As a result, First World War photojournalism was defined, on the one hand, by the photographers’ continuous efforts to capture the huge scale of events on the battlefield and, on the other, by a visual production that rarely challenged official interpretations of the war. The bulk of First World War pictures, was consequently ‘antispetic’, consisting mostly of ‘archaic images of individual suffering and heroism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470357213484422">Farish, 2001</xref>: 279).</p>
<p>Despite the enormity of its war operations, far exceeding those of the First, the photojournalism of the Second World War became more dynamic, both because technical equipment was now more powerful and mobile and because the information strategy of the Allies changed from rigid control to ‘regulated truth telling’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470357213484422">Roeder, 1993</xref>). Rather than correcting the wrongs of First World War propaganda, however, this turn to the truth was accepted as a pragmatic move in the face of the fact that ‘war on this scale couldn’t simply be hidden, however much states might seek to obscure their losses’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470357213484422">Carruthers, 2000</xref>: 93). A more humane and tragic imagery of the battlefield now emerged, though one that shares with the First World War a similar ethics of heroism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1470357213484422">Winter, 1995</xref>). Let me summarise the key aesthetic features of First and Second World War photography in terms of their visual configuration of <italic>bodies in battle</italic>.</p>
<sec id="section6-1470357213484422">
<title>(i) Aesthetic quality</title>
<p><italic>Bodies</italic>: The majority of First World War photographs are about soldiers posing with or using technology in the battlefield – primarily artillery, such as guns and cannons, but also objects and vehicles, such as gas masks (from 1915) and tanks (from 1916) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1470357213484422">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>This recurring connection between soldier and technology, always articulated in productive relationships of complementarity (soldiers in control of machines) or extension (soldiers protected by machines), operated within a prosthetic imagination, characteristic of the early 20th century – an imagination that celebrated the synergies between man and machine in discourses of heroic virtue and technological utopia: ‘War is beautiful’ as futurist Marinetti put it, ‘because it initiates the dreamt-of metalization of the human body’ (1930, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470357213484422">Der Derian, 2005</xref>: 27). It did so, however, at a cost. It ignored the contradictory relationship between body and technology that, in the context of the first industrialised war, span this relationship out of control and gave rise to the mass phenomenon of war neurosis or shell-shock. Far from a pure fear of death, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1470357213484422">Leed (1979)</xref> argued, the unprecedented rise of war neurosis in the Western Front was a direct consequence of the new relationship of bodies-in-battle stuck in immobilised warfare and the new, long-distance calculations of risk that this warfare entailed. Long-range artillery, machine guns and barbed wire had, in other words, imposed new rules for the conduct of war, making war neurosis ‘the direct product of the increasingly alienated relationship of the combatant to the modes of destruction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1470357213484422">Leed 1979</xref>: 164).</p>
<p>Beyond ignoring the complex emotionality of combative agency in favour of a romantic celebration of the soldier as machine, First World War photojournalism also largely ignored the dead body in the battlefield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470357213484422">Carruthers, 2000</xref>). It is not so much that pictures of the dead were unavailable, but rather that such imagery was heavily regulated to portray the dead enemy rather than friend (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1470357213484422">Winter, 1995</xref>, for a rare exception). Building upon the American Civil War documentary style, the representation of these dead took place through an objectivist aesthetic that emphasised the mass nature of war killing. They did so by portraying the body as part of ‘regularised compositional wholes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1470357213484422">Griffin, 1999</xref>: 136–137), such as landscapes of barbed wire or trench lines, and were often accompanied by captions, such as ‘The Dawn of Passchendaele’ or ‘Death the Reaper’ (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1470357213484422">Figure 2</xref>), that contextualise the scene in broader narratives of the ‘picturesque’.</p>

<p>By the Second World War, the status of the body is both similar and different. On the one hand, it continues to be defined by discourses of technological militarism, particularly in the celebration of new war machinery, such as aircraft carriers and armoured vehicles that made the war more mobile. On the other, the body also begins to appear dissociated from technology and, after President Roosevelt’s recommendation to show more ‘blood and gore’ (1943, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470357213484422">Roeder, 1993</xref>: 28), a different imagery started to appear – one that, whilst co-existing with the heroic, acknowledged the traumatic impact of battle upon soldiers, both physical and emotional: ‘a grittier perspective now emerged’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470357213484422">Carruthers (2000</xref>: 94) says, in which ‘fear, boredom and courage all found a place’. Even though this new discourse served the purposes of hardening public morale, it also introduced a new legitimacy for the wounded body and, with it, a new conception of heroism not as the negation but as the conquest of fear: ‘the legend that soldiers don’t cry’, as war photographer Dickey Chapelle put it, ‘robs them of their personal victories over fear and pain’ (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470357213484422">Benoit, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>This new photographic sensibility is perhaps best reflected in Robert Capa’s ‘magnificent eleven’, his D-Day landing photos (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1470357213484422">Figure 3</xref>), which now placed the configuration of bodies in battle within concrete narratives of dramatic action – showing Allied soldiers with rifle and equipment, drifting or crawling in shallow water, just before they stepped onto Omaha Beach.</p>

<p>New shooting techniques (wide-angle lens), which put the viewer in the scene of action, but also a new professional ethics, the ‘concerned photographer’, gave rise to a moral imagination that inserted the body in discourses not only of heroic sacrifice but also of human agony and grief (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1470357213484422">Griffin, 1999</xref>). Whilst still operating within the realm of objective representation, Capa’s aesthetic, with its bold emphasis on black-and-white and the out-of-focus frame, invited a more intense relationship to combative agency than First World War pictures did – one that was mediated by ‘an artist who can transfigure human suffering and a spectator who can redeem this suffering … by grasping important moral insights‘ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470357213484422">Friday, 2000</xref>: 375).</p>
<p>In summary, the move from the First World War to the Second World War marked a shift from the body-as-machine to the body-as-fragile, both physically, through the acknowledgement of injury and death and, psychologically, through a recognition of the intense emotionality involved in battle. Despite this ‘new frankness’, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470357213484422">Fussell’s (1975)</xref> words, however, both World Wars were dominated by a romantic conception of combative agency that celebrated soldierly suffering as heroic and sustained a largely cleansed photojournalistic depiction of the battlefield – one that, ultimately, only ‘showed intact bodies and revealed little of the agonies of death’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470357213484422">Roeder, 1993</xref>: 9).</p>
<p><italic>Landscapes</italic>: Its multiple theatres of action granted, the most iconic imagery of First World War photojournalistic landscape is the Western Front’s No Man’s Land – a scape characterised by a ‘total negation of habitual perception’, ravaged as it was by an amorphous mass of battlefield waste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1470357213484422">Huppauf, 1996</xref>). Far from simply destroying the topological order of pre-war life, this imagery of No Man’s Land came to replace modernist conceptions of rural landscape as a zone of natural beauty with a new imagination of nature as a zone of technological destruction: ‘the war explodes the landscape back into a state of wilderness’, says Huppauf, ‘which is, at the same time, the landscape of modern technology’ (p. 46). Unable to capture action-as-it-happened, these photojournalistic images were static, concentrating on the aftermath of war, where fusions of mud, crater marks, bomb debris and human bodies construed the battlefield as a liminal space between here and there, us and enemy, life and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1470357213484422">Leed, 1979</xref>: 14). This was a ‘sublime’ aesthetic register that, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470357213484422">Boltanski (1999)</xref>, grasps this scary liminality through a double move: focusing as it did on the aftermath of battle, the initial horror of the spectacle of death was quickly replaced by a sense of safe distance from the scene and offered itself to spectators as an object of reflexive contemplation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1470357213484422">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

<p>Out of the multiple landscapes of Second World War photojournalism, the most iconic ones involve city bombings: the Blitz of London and the atomic attacks on Japan. Unlike Western Front images, which separated combative from non-combative landscapes, the photojournalism of the Second World War blurred the two in a new conception of the battlefield, which now brought civilians into the sphere of legitimate killing. As acts of expressive violence, prioritising a symbolics of destruction over material military gains, these bombings operated less as strategic operations and more as horror spectacles that had ‘to be seen and to strike fear in the hearts of the observer, the real target of an act of terror’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470357213484422">Bousquet, 2006</xref>: 744). The characteristic of such spectacular photojournalism is, therefore, the long-distance shots of cityscapes in flames (London, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1470357213484422">Figure 5</xref>) or in ruins (Hiroshima, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1470357213484422">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<p>Distance abstracts from the details of human injury in order to focus upon the magnitude of the battlefield in a God’s eye view of hyper-destruction. What emerges is again a sublime aesthetic that locates this battlefield in a hybrid register of ‘ecstatic destructiveness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470357213484422">Bousquet, 2006</xref>). At the heart of such aesthetic lies a war imaginary that recognises extreme violence as the most effective means for securing peace: Hiroshima, the most radical instance of the imaginary, signals precisely this shift towards a Cold War morality, where the stability of the new world order now rested upon the constant threat of nuclear annihilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1470357213484422">Huppauf, 1996</xref>: 9).</p>
<p>The representation of landscapes is the clearest manifestation of the paradox of the war imaginary in the early 20th century. In different ways, No Man’s Land and the Second World War ruins reflected a predominantly dystopian vision of technology. Either as a liminal zone of waste that defies rationalisation or as the apocalyptic horizon of burning hell, these sublime landscapes undermined both the romantic optimism of technology and the heroic celebration of soldiers that, to various degrees, defined the representation of bodies-in-battle, in the two World Wars.</p>

<sec id="section7-1470357213484422">
<title>(ii) Moral agency</title>
<p>The category of moral agency examines the role of photojournalism in addressing the existential question of war: which conceptions of humanity, of self and other, does photojournalism come to legitimise?</p>
<p>The conception of humanity emerging out of the photojournalism of the battlefield in 20th-century wars is radically ambivalent. It is, as we saw, a humanity suspended between discourses of technological perfectibility, glorified in the prosthetic imagination of bodies-as-weapons or the suppression of emotion, and discourses of corporeal fragility, testified in the acknowledgment of suffering and the recognition of fear in combat. Whilst the self gradually opens up to discourses of imprefectibility, however, the enemy continues to be construed as a radical other. It is only enemy soldiers that are shown in a state of absolute fragility, death, whilst the mass suffering inflicted upon the Hiroshima civilians is prohibited from view. Both voyeurism and invisibility operated here as strategies of de-humanisation that sustained a phantasy of enemy lives as inhuman or simply irrelevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470357213484422">Fussell, 1975</xref>).</p>
<p>Even if the otherness of the enemy is a persistent theme of war, the ambivalence of the self reflects a historical shift in conceptions of humanity during the first half of 20th century. It marks a departure from chivalric genres of moral agency as aristocratic valour towards a new discourse of agency as military servitude – one that recognises heroic virtue not in the artful dexterity of the distinguished warrior but in the disciplined skill of the nationalised soldier, thrown as he is into industrialised battlefields of mass killing. These soldiers of the first half of the 20th century, what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1470357213484422">Walzer (2006</xref>: 36) calls, ‘soldiers as instruments’, are not ‘members of a fellowship of warriors; they are ‘poor sods just like me’ trapped in a war they did not like’. Evident in the dystopian vision of battlefield landscapes as liminal zones of destruction, this humble agency of the soldier does not, however, mark the end of heroism.</p>
<p>Rather, this humanity redefines heroism within a new moral imagination, informed by, what I called, an aesthetic of the sublime – an ‘emotionally detached and amoral representation of mass environmental destruction and death’ that turns the battlefield into an object of reflexive contemplation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1470357213484422">Huppauf, 1997</xref>: 138–139). Far from a purely stylistic decision, the sublime is the consequence of institutional restrictions on war correspondents as well as of the technological norm of total visibility that journalists sought to capture in the battlefield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470357213484422">Farish, 2001</xref>). Yet, at the same time, the distanced objectivity of the sublime is also a key aesthetic response to a deeper crisis of representation in early 20th-century war, namely the lack of an appropriate language to capture the experience of battlefield through conventional visual practices. This is evident, for instance, in First World War techniques of image manipulation to capture the simultaneity of full-scale violence (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1470357213484422">Figure 4</xref>); or in the rhetoric used by X. Lawrence, the only military photographer to fly above Hiroshima, who described the spectacle through epic language: ‘awe-struck, we watched it shoot upward like a meteor coming from the earth instead of from outer space … it was a living thing, a new species of being, born right before our incredulous eyes’ (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470357213484422">Dower, 2010</xref>: 275).</p>
<p>The ‘poor sods’, in these sublimated battlefields, were thus heroes not because they possessed a masterful combative agency but precisely because they were all too aware of themselves as both agents and victims of mass scale killing: ‘however profound the despair of the individual’, as correspondent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470357213484422">Philip Gibbs (1920</xref>: 359–360) described the advance of the Somme, ‘the mass moved as it was directed’. And even though other public genres, such as poetry and painting, addressed this crisis of representation through the modernist registers of irony and the surreal, which emphasised bitter knowingness or the irrationality of futile sacrifice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470357213484422">Fussell, 1975</xref>), photojournalism operated as a gate-keeping genre that sustained more conventional narratives of war. Even Capa’s concern with human suffering worked, in fact, to individualise and authenticate, rather than break with, the discourse of heroic sacrifice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470357213484422">Coker, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, early 20th-century photojournalism attempted the impossible task of renewing the promise of humanity under inhumane conditions through a sublimation of the battlefield. In the process, it maintained the traditional conception of the enemy as de-humanised other but did not, ultimately, manage to keep intact the conception of the self – its humanity, earlier celebrated in the invincible soldier as machine, is increasingly problematised as a precarious condition that war tragically disintegrates.</p>

<title>Wars of the 21st Century</title>
<p>If the First World War introduced a new visibility of the battlefield, the War on Terror is marked by a thoroughgoing technologisation of combat – a tight articulation of war with technology that goes beyond reporting from the battlefield and refers to the very constitution of war through a media logic, as ‘mediatised conflict’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470357213484422">Cottle, 2006</xref>). Whilst this articulation emerged as early as the Vietnam War, the first ‘televised war’, mediatisation gradually became a military strategy throughout the 1980s, culminating with the first Gulf War in 1991. Despite its celebration as the first real-time war, offering battlefield access from cameras adjusted on aircraft pitcocks, this war’s imagery was largely confined to ‘night vision’ visuals that ‘fictionalised’ the battlefield and maximised, rather than diminished, distance from it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470357213484422">Der Derian, 2005</xref>). The ‘virtual’ Gulf war thus anticipated the fully digital nature of the War on Terror in its use of ICTs, both as propaganda mechanisms and as logistical systems of combat. In this ever-evolving media ecology, photojournalism remains important but, given the proliferation of real-time distribution platforms such as the internet, digital cameras and phones, its scope becomes increasingly differentiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1470357213484422">Hoskins and O’Loughlin, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>(i) Aesthetic quality</title>
<p><italic>Bodies</italic>: Similar to the prosthetic imagination of the early 20th century, technology continues to be celebrated in 21st-century photojournalism. Now, however, the articulation of the mechanical with the corporeal is radically intensified. State-of-the art sensory devices, high-tech weapon systems and uniform fabrics are only some of the ways in which the 21st century imaginary construes a new kind of body – the cyborg soldier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470357213484422">Masters, 2005</xref>). Constituted in techno-scientific discourses of military action, which further locate this body in virtual reality-simulated exercises and digitised battlefields, the cyborg soldier is no longer defined by the ways in which his or her body is complemented by weapons but by a whole new ‘juncture of … metals, chemicals, and people that makes weapons of computers and computers of weapons and soldiers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470357213484422">Gray, 1997</xref>: 8). Yet, even if this technological imagination renders the soldier ‘post-human’ in that technologies now perfect the biological senses, this imagination is simultaneously associated with a new emphasis on human vulnerability.</p>
<p>Indeed, controversies ensuing from the rare depictions of death in the War on Terror, in Julia Stevenson’s 2009 <italic>New York Times</italic> image of a US Marine lethally wounded in the legs or in the 2005 AP imagery of a series of US-flag draped coffins on their way out of Iraq (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1470357213484422">Figure 7</xref>), testify to the deep anxieties that traverse the cyborg soldier. What these contested visualities suggest is that, whilst constructed as a perfected version of the biological body, the cyborg is simultaneously unable to overcome its corporeal vulnerability and remains dramatically open to mortal threat in the battlefield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1470357213484422">Lenoir, 2000</xref>).</p>

<p>This ambivalent humanity is further combined with a thorough psychologisation of the soldier. Going far beyond the recognition of fear, there is today an intense focus on the visualisation of his or her tortured psyche that replaces earlier masculinist conceptions of humanity with a new fascination of agony-in-battle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470357213484422">Coker, 2001</xref>). Evident in the proliferation of a subjectivist aesthetic in war images, including David Turnley’s grieving soldier (World Press Photo of the Year, 1991, not reproduced here)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1470357213484422">7</xref></sup> and Craig Walker’s Iraq War veteran suffering from acute Post-Traumatic-Stress-Disorder (Pulitzer, 2012, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1470357213484422">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1470357213484422">9</xref>), the depiction of soldiers in sorrow not only recast the battlefield as a space of individual trauma but also re-position photojournalism as itself an intimate practice of witnessing personal pain.</p>

<p>A century away from First World War pictures of the soldier-as-machine, these images may project a moral agency of emotional fragility, but cannot ultimately resolve earlier tensions of the soldier as a killing agent. Indeed, despite their hyper-emotionalisation, 21st-century imageries of the cyborg ultimately approximate the First World War soldier in that both are torn between technological fantasy and bodily mortality: ‘military technologies have been “techno-masculinized’’’, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470357213484422">Master (2005</xref>: 114) says, ‘while human soldiers … have been “feminized” and reconstituted within the realm of those needing “protection”’.</p>
<p><italic>Landscapes</italic>: Similarly to bodies, the landscapes of 21st-century war are less sites of battle and more sites of humanitarian action. From aid packages to medical equipment and from mechanical tools to children’s toys, the representation of combative space moves away from the infliction of suffering and towards assisting vulnerable others (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1470357213484422">Figure 10</xref>).</p>

<p>‘We are’, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470357213484422">Coker (2001</xref>: 20–12) puts it, ‘increasingly interested in reducing the material and human destructiveness of the battlefield’ so as ‘to reduce the incidents in which our own soldiers are traumatised or maimed or in danger of being killed, as it is to mitigate our own inhumanity to our enemies’. ‘Embedded’ forms of reporting, which bring together journalists and the military in close relationships of collaboration, further contribute to this humanitarian imagination of the army and, in so doing, establish a new sensibility of benevolence at the heart of the War on Terror. Seeking to legitimise the peacekeeping and nation-building NATO operations in Afghanistan and Iraq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1470357213484422">Petraeus, 2007</xref>), such images cannot, however, break free from the constitutive contradiction of the war imaginary: military humanitarianism is, in fact, a war operation that, in the name of peace, costs hundreds of lives every year. If anything, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470357213484422">Der Derian (2005</xref>: 26) argues, the War on Terror has reversed the mortality rates between soldiers, now safer, and civilians, now more vulnerable: ‘war-related fatalities have been reversed in modern times, from 100 years ago when one civilian was killed per eight soldiers, to the current ratio of eight civilians per soldier killed.’</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the imagery of 21st-century landscapes has radically blurred the boundaries between battlefield and civilian sites that we encountered in the Second World War. Rather than aerial warfare, though, it is now terror attacks in city centres that redefine the battlefield. Whilst, therefore, the fields of Afghanistan and Iraq continue to be key theatres of combative action, the battlefield has come to include the close-up suffering of civilians in Kabul and Basra but also in New York, London and Madrid. Characterised by an aesthetic of the aftermath, these images represent sites of atrocity where emergency services, pools of blood, bodies and scattered personal items come to stand for the horrors of urban killing. Even though the aftermath is a historical trope of atrocity, dominant, as we saw, in the sublime register of First World War battlefields, this aesthetic now re-emerges invested with a new emotionality. This is evident in professional photojournalistic imagery, such as Massoud Hosseini’s picture of an Afghan girl screaming after a suicide attack (Pulitzer, 2012; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1470357213484422">Figure 11</xref>), but also in the practice of amateur photojournalism, as reflected in the 9/11 shaky videos of the WTC plane crashes and the grainy mobile camera pictures from the 7/7 London attacks (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1470357213484422">Figure 12</xref>).</p>

<title>(ii) Moral agency</title>
<p>War photojournalism of the 21st century has redefined the relationship between self and other in ways that both evoke and surpass older tensions between human and machine. Even though the body still remains the focus of military performance, it is now embedded in broader calculations of life and death, where technology is not only a means of killing but primarily a means of maximising survival – of soldiers and local others. This distinction between an early authoritative or ‘disciplinary’ and a contemporary empathetic or, more accurately, ‘bio-political’ form of humanity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1470357213484422">Foucault, 1987</xref>), points, in turn, to a new moral imagination that moves away from a single focus on exterminating enemies towards ‘the targeting of whole populations for political support’ but also away from the soldier as killing machine and towards the soldier as ‘a medium of communication’ with such populations – what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470357213484422">Bell (2011</xref>: 310) refers to as the ‘civilianisation of warfare’. This move of the war imaginary away from extreme violence and around the bio-political imperative of managing lives is visually expressed in an aesthetic of trauma, where war is represented both as an intimate experience of sorrow and a public act of peace-making. Let me summarise each.</p>
<p>Reflected in a series of prize-winning images on the intimate emotions of the soldier, the moral agency of civilianised war, I argued, is imagined through subjectivist registers, which abandon the objectivity of the ‘total gaze’ or the sublime, in favour of an intense affective expressivity. Even though the problematisation of the soldier-machine had started as early as the Second World War, the contemporary dominance of an aesthetic of trauma over the sublime challenges the traditional morality of war in important ways. Celebrated as a triumph of the modernist ‘culture of sympathy’, this ‘increasing respect for humanism and human life’ is informed by the humanitarian vision of avoiding cruelty, which has now replaced the grand narratives of imperialism or nationalism that drove earlier wars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470357213484422">Coker, 2008</xref>: 457).</p>
<p>This revaluation of humanity as biological life, however, may simultaneously be seen as an intensification, rather than relaxation, of the power relations of 21st-century warfare. The bio-political force of these relations lies, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470357213484422">Dillon and Reid (2009)</xref>, in transforming the battlefield from an antagonistic confrontation with the enemy into a site for the micro-management of individual lives without, simultaneously, being able to escape the nature of war as a practice of killing and being killed: ‘Even though many recent military operations have been characterized as peace-keeping missions or stability operations’, an important study, funded by the Iraq Afghanistan Deployment Impact Fund, claims, ‘many of these efforts may share the same risks and stressors inherent in combat – exposure to hostile forces, injured civilians, mass graves, and land mines, for example’ (p. 6). Indicative of this dramatic ambivalence of humanitarian war is the unprecedented rise of suicide rates among Afghanistan-based US soldiers in 2012.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1470357213484422">8</xref></sup> Similarly expressive of this ambivalence, albeit in different ways, is the depiction of US atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan, which further complicates the aesthetic of trauma with disturbing insights of the self as perpetrator – for instance, in the infamous Abu Ghraib amateur snapshots (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1470357213484422">Figure 13</xref>), which portrayed Iraqi prisoners as sub-human.</p>

</fig>
<p>The Abu Ghraib atrocities granted, however, the conception of the other in humanitarian war is primarily defined by massively proliferating images of empathetic exchanges between local populations and soldiers (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1470357213484422">Figure 10</xref>). This is, again, a photojournalism of subjectivism that places a deeply asymmetrical relationship within what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470357213484422">Boltanski (1999)</xref> calls the ‘topic of sentiment’ – a mode of representing human suffering that evokes gratitude towards the benefactors and tender-heartedness towards the beneficiaries of the exchange. Part of the military communication strategy to ‘win hearts and minds’, the topic of sentiment may manage to give visibility to local others, but does so at a cost, insofar as their visualisation as vulnerable recipients of aid construes these others as subordinate to the Western soldier. Suspended thus between subordination and de-humanisation, this visual sentimentalisation of war forges, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1470357213484422">Holmqvist (2012</xref>: 9), encounters of ‘non-recognition’ that, rather than acknowledging the cultural and political difference of local populations, subjects them to a double violence – symbolic, in that it humanises ‘them’ only as subordinate to ‘us’, and physical, in that it abuses or kills ‘them’ unless they desire the same as ‘us’: ‘the ‘other’ of this present-day war’, she argues, ’is not thought of as an Other but rather a different version of the self’.</p>
<p>In summary, the Anglo-American photojournalism of the 21st century has taken a turn towards a subjectivist aesthetic, which places a moral imagination of expressive sentimentality at the heart of war. This aesthetic of trauma attempts to resolve the paradox of the war imaginary by construing war as primarily humanitarian and by psychologising the power relations of the battlefield. Grounded on a photojournalism of embedded reporting and ordinary testimony, both of which, in different ways, favour intimate descriptions of the battlefield, this aesthetic breaks with the sublime and its proposal for an objective contemplation of the war in order to tell more personal stories of benevolent action. Despite its ambition to rescue the humanity of the battlefield, however, affective expressivity seems to accentuate the split between war as protecting and war as killing. It may intend to break from early portrayals of soldiers as human machines, yet inserts them into a more inhumane regulation of human lives in contexts of deliberate suffering. Similarly, this expressivity may attempt to acknowledge the humanity of others, yet it ultimately manages to either collapse this humanity to a Western vision of the self or to demonise it as impenetrable otherness. The new aesthetic of trauma, in conclusion, may be celebrated as humanising war, but only manages to throw into dramatic relief the injured subjectivities that emerge in its course.</p>

<title>Conclusion: The Ethics of War</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1470357213484422">Linfield’s (2010)</xref> investigation of changing war images has been driven, similarly (but not identically) to mine, by the question of ‘how has the photography of political trauma and political witness responded to the radical changes in how war is made, and what it is made for, in the course of the past eight decades?’ (p. xvi). Whilst her response has been informed by images of civilian suffering primarily beyond the West, my own response has been informed by iconic Western (Anglo-American) photojournalism of major battlefields. Consequently, our conclusions as to the political context of contemporary war photojournalism also differ. For Linfield, war photojournalism demonstrates a historical shift from the 20th-century ideological battles to contemporary ‘pure’ violence, thereby giving rise to ‘new kinds of images, because the atrocities they so nakedly depict are almost completely divorced from religious, political, or historical redemption’ (p. 205).</p>
<p>The idea of humanity, as Linfield argues, may no longer matter in non-Western conflict zones, yet, as I have shown, conflicts of the West continue to be informed by a moral imagination of humanity – one that wages war in the name of humanitarian benevolence. Far from new, I have also shown that this paradox is embedded in the centennial trajectory of the war imaginary, where the idea of humanity is constantly torn between a utopia of invincibility and a dystopia of destruction. In the wars of the early 20th century, this ambivalence is expressed through objectivist aesthetic registers, notably a sublimation of the battlefield that invites a reflexive engagement with the spectacle of warfare in two of its most important manifestations – as heroic, in imageries of ‘our’ technological might and steely bravery, or as horrific, in imageries of ‘their’ dead bodies and the ravaged landscapes of combat. In the wars of the 21st century, the ambivalence of humanity is articulated through increasingly subjectivist aesthetic registers that now focus on war as an intensely psychological experience in two of its most prominent manifestations – the humanitarian battlefield, in imageries of benevolent encounters between troops and locals, and the traumatised individual, in imageries of victims in the civilianised landscapes of war. Rather than a move towards benevolence, I have finally cautioned, this transformation intensifies the power relations of war and the traumatic impact of the battlefield upon soldiers and civilians alike. War is becoming more humanitarian but less humane.</p>
<p>Even if photojournalism is traditionally seen as a conservative genre of the war imaginary, echoing the values of the military, its aesthetic variations are indicative of broader societal changes: cultural ones, in the pervasive emotionalisation of the public sphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470357213484422">Coker, 2001</xref>); institutional ones, in the technologies, ethics and professional styles of reporting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470357213484422">Allan, 2007</xref>); and geo-political ones, in the global order and conduct of war (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470357213484422">Der Derian, 2005</xref>). Insofar, however, as such changes are also about <italic>communication</italic> – the representational resources that nurture our public morality – it remains an urgent task of critical scholarship in this field to reflect upon the practices, past and present, through which the spectacle of the battlefield invites us to imagine the humanity of ourselves and that of the others who happen to be ‘our’ enemies. For, as Der Derian reminds us, it is ultimately the sight of the dead, the absolute sufferers, that, censored as it may be, comes to provide ‘the corporeal gravitas of war’ (p. 30). And it is precisely this irreducible corporeal gravitas, in its sublimated or hyper-emotional forms, that, by speaking about war, also speaks of us – of who we are and how we should feel as witnesses of its horrors.</p>

<p>Whilst Linfield focuses on the Holocaust or the Chinese Cultural Revolution and contemporary contexts of violence, such as Sierra Leone, Sudan or Afghanistan, I focus on major First World War and Second World War battlefields as well as major War on Terror sites, in Afghanistan and Iraq but also Western cities, such as New York and London. This variation drives our different claims about photojournalistic visualisations of suffering as well as different assumptions about the political contexts of such visualisations.</p>
