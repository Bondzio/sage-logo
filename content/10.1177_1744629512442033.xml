<abstract>
<p>This is the second of two articles presenting the findings of a qualitative study which explored the experiences of Registered Nurses Intellectual Disability (RNIDs) of communicating with people with an intellectual disability who communicate non-verbally. While Part 1 outlined the study background, context and methodology along with the overarching, multi-dimensional category of ‘familiarity/knowing the person’, the current article critically discusses the themes and subthemes encapsulated in this category. Each theme is considered in the light of current policies, strategies and philosophies shaping the provision of services to people with an intellectual disability in Ireland. The results suggest that the RNID is ideally located and key to supporting the implementation of these policies and strategies due to their highly developed and proficient skill set as well as experience of communicating with people with an intellectual disability who communicate non-verbally.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This is the second of two articles presenting the findings of a qualitative study which explored the experiences of Registered Nurses Intellectual Disability (RNIDs) of communicating with people with an intellectual disability who communicate non-verbally. The first article (Martin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1744629512442033">2012</xref>) outlined the background, context, study aims and methodology. The overarching category of ‘familiarity/knowing the person’ was presented in the context of current debates and discourses shaping policy and service delivery for people with an intellectual disability including person-centredness, inclusion, choice and independence. The dimensions of familiarity/knowing the person were detailed and supported by quotes from the interviews. It is clear that the interactions between RNIDs and people with an intellectual disability who communicate non-verbally are a critical component of service delivery, not only currently but into the future as services for people with an intellectual disability enter a period of transition.</p>
<p>The themes and subthemes of familiarity/knowing the person are presented in the current article, namely emotional conflict, person-centred communication and the caring environment. These contain further subthemes which together present the unique interaction between the RNID and the person with an intellectual disability (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1744629512442033">Table 1</xref>). Each of these themes and subthemes is presented individually and their relationship to familiarity/knowing the person is made explicit. The findings are also contextualized in current philosophies and drivers of intellectual disability service provision including person-centredness, inclusion, choice and independence as well as key policies shaping intellectual disability service provision, e.g. <italic>Time to Move on from Congregated Settings: A Strategy for Community Inclusion</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744629512442033">HSE, 2011</xref>) and <italic>The Efficiency and Effectiveness of Long-Stay Residential Care for Adults within the Mental Health Services: Evaluation Report Prepared under the Value for Money and Policy Review</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744629512442033">HSE, 2008</xref>) as well as several National Disability Authority of Ireland (NDA) papers regarding rights, community living, employment and service delivery. Firstly, a brief overview of the research methodology is provided.</p>

<title>Research methodology</title>
<p>This study adopted a Heideggerian phenomenological approach, as this was considered most suitable to meeting the study aim of exploring the experiences of RNIDs communicating with people with an intellectual disability who communicate non-verbally. Following ethical approval from the ethics committee in the research site, eight RNIDs were purposefully selected to participate in individual, in-depth, semi-structured interviews. Data collection and analysis took place concurrently. The data were analysed using Colaizzi’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744629512442033">1978</xref>) method of data analysis. Interview transcripts were sent to the participants for them to read, delete and/or add information as they wished. A detailed account and description of the methodology of this study and the measures taken to uphold rigour can be found in the first of these two articles. The overarching category of familiarity/knowing the person and its dimensions were also presented and critically discussed in Part 1. The current article presents and analytically deliberates upon the themes and subthemes of this overarching category in light of current discourses relating to intellectual disability. These themes are emotional conflict, person-centred communication, and the caring environment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1744629512442033">
<title>Emotional conflict</title>
<p>Emotional conflict is the first of three themes contained in the category of familiarity/knowing the person. The concept of emotional conflict as defined by the RNIDs is described. Interpersonal interactions by their nature involve emotional experience. The emotional experience participants described in this study was contradicting. It was evident during the interviews that RNIDs love their work and caring for service-users. However, some emotions they expressed included self-doubt, frustration, guilt, disempowerment, demoralization and feeling misunderstood. These emotions appear to stem from within the participants, as they strive to provide the best care they can. Emotional conflict encompasses two subthemes – internal conflict and demoralization/feeling misunderstood – which are now presented.</p>
<sec id="section4-1744629512442033">
<title>Internal conflict</title>
<p>Internal conflict in the context of this study was articulated as meaning the contradicting emotions that the participants experience as they support people with an intellectual disability who communicate non-verbally. The participants’ commitment to service-users and their work was clear during the interviews. This commitment indicates a significant personal investment in their work and consequently a substantial emotional investment. Passion, devotion and enthusiasm were contrasted with frustration, self-doubt and guilt. Many participants blame themselves when communication is unsuccessful. They ask themselves questions like: what did I do wrong here? What can I do to help them understand? They assume responsibility for the failed communication despite acknowledging the influence of the service-user’s ability. When asked to explain the origin of these feelings, one participant replied:<disp-quote>
<p>It’s hard to realize that … one human being is going to spend their lives in a wheelchair non-verbal and the rest of us can skip around in the darling buds of May … Why? Why that poor creature ends up there? Nobody knows. (Helen)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Other participants alluded to this notion of guilt and blame. Guilt would appear to stem from witnessing the challenges people with an intellectual disability who communicate non-verbally face. The participants feel guilty for being unable to alleviate these difficulties. The endeavour to reduce these problems is often a challenging task within the reality of intellectual disability caregiving. Instead, participants try to facilitate communication to reduce the service-user’s problems. This is a responsible and demanding task requiring high-level skill, patience and tolerance. Considering this unique skill set in light of current debates regarding the intellectual disability nursing profession in Ireland, the findings of this study suggest that the role of the RNID is essential in providing unique support to people with an intellectual disability who communicate non-verbally. It is recognized that the RNID holds a critical and central position in intellectual disability services in Ireland, but the exceptional skill set of this profession has been inadequately utilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744629512442033">Sheerin and McConkey, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744629512442033">ERHA, 2003</xref>). The findings of this study highlight the uniqueness and necessity of the RNID in terms of direct personalized service provision to people with an intellectual disability and communication impairment. This concurs with a recent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744629512442033">RCN (2011</xref>) position statement on the role of the Learning Disability Nurse (LDN) in the United Kingdom. This article endorses and clearly outlines the central role the LDN plays in the provision of person-centred care for people with an intellectual disability. However, it would also appear that RNIDs experience challenges in terms of being misunderstood and feeling demoralized regarding their role. Demoralization/feeling misunderstood was the second subtheme under emotional conflict.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1744629512442033">
<title>Demoralization/feeling misunderstood</title>
<p>Responsibility is a source of stress and the reason why participants felt misunderstood and sought recognition of their skills. Communication is often successful despite how challenging and difficult it is, and thus participants sought recognition of this skill. The in-depth familiarity and knowledge of the service-user is difficult to articulate and therefore can easily be overlooked. Even among peers they feel misunderstood. One RNID discussed an experience in a general hospital where staff didn’t understand what her role involved, believing she was a mental health nurse. This was a source of frustration and demoralization. However, participants didn’t know how to address this. They describe feeling disempowered and unsure. One participant described the intellectual disability discipline as a ‘shy’ discipline (Helen), believing they do not have a strong voice to articulate and explain their role fully. Additionally, the complexity and involvedness of the RNID role makes it difficult to articulate. The individualized, person-centred approach, skill and ability of the RNID in supporting the service-user therefore can go unrecognized. In <italic>National Quality Standards: Residential Services for People with Disabilities</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744629512442033">HIQA, 2009</xref>), the Health Information and Quality Authority identifies staff who work with people with intellectual disabilities as requiring requisite knowledge and skills but also qualities such as respect, empathy and enthusiasm. It was clear that the participants in this study possessed these key qualities. Although the emotional experience described by the participants is contradicting, it was very clear that the participants practise in a person-centred way. Person-centred communication emerged as another key theme.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1744629512442033">
<title>Person-centred communication</title>
<p>Person-centredness is a key and central principle shaping policy and strategy in intellectual disability services. In its <italic>Vision Statement for Intellectual Disability in Ireland for the 21st Century</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744629512442033">NFVB, 2009</xref>), the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies highlights inclusion, equity and person-centred approaches as its guiding principles. Several publications by the NDA regarding person-centredness also highlight the importance of this principle in current and future development of intellectual disability services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744629512442033">NDA, 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744629512442033">2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744629512442033">2011c</xref>). RNIDs in this study use several person-centred methods/systems to communicate with service-users who communicate non-verbally – each as individual as the service-users themselves. This requires versatility as there may be as many communication systems as service-users. They adapt to the service-user’s communication system, placing him/her at the centre of the exchange – in keeping with a person-centred philosophy. All participants recognize their role as a facilitator of communication of and for the service-user, including communication between the service-user and a third party and/or during one-to-one interactions. This requires highly developed skills, which fall under three subthemes: observing, listening and conveying.</p>
<sec id="section7-1744629512442033">
<title>Observation</title>
<p>Observation in the context of communicating with people who communicate non-verbally was defined by the participants as a complex skill that is used constantly. Participants not only observe the person but also observe their interactions with others and their environment. Observation is a key skill in nursing regardless of the discipline but is part of the essence of intellectual disability nursing, and one that the participants rely heavily on. RNIDs use observations to understand and inform interpretations. Participants discussed observing eye/facial expressions, idiosyncrasies, physical signs and body language, gestures and prompting, and behaviour. Additionally, there is a need to be aware of events in the person’s life that could provide a clue as to what they are trying to express.</p>
<p>Eye/facial expressions were the most frequently mentioned communication strategy. These are considered a very powerful method of communicating as they are a reactive method and messages can be interpreted immediately. The RNID analyses the minutiae of facial expressions: the eyes, mouth, head positioning, etc. Particular attention is paid to eye expressions more than any other facial feature. Eye contact is seen as indicating that you are paying attention but needs to be used carefully as it can be perceived as threatening:<disp-quote>
<p>The old saying is they’re the windows to your soul … but they are the windows to what’s going on inside. (Helen)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Similar to observing facial expressions is observing for physical signs, body language and gestures. The participants need to know the person and their usual behaviour, observing for changes in body positioning, appearance, changes to diet, sleeping pattern, etc. Interpretation of this type of communication is difficult and problematic. Although it may be clear there is a problem, the actual problem may be unidentified. Participants may be able to decipher the message by observing gestures or prompts the person may use. These can range from ‘a nod of the head’ (Ruth), to pointing or hand signals, to physically leading the person to an item. This communication method is limited to people who are physically able and the degree to which it is used depends upon the service-user’s ability. This method can give more information when one is unable to understand the service-user. Participants stated that they interpret a service-user waving their hands vigorously as meaning they don’t want the item. Closely linked to this is communication through idiosyncratic movements. This requires knowledge of the service-user’s unique communication methods. When there is insufficient knowledge of the service-user, idiosyncratic communication could be missed, ignored or misinterpreted. Clearly, each of these communication methods can be individual and unique to the person with an intellectual disability. This highlights the importance of familiarity/knowing the person in terms of communicating with the person, as detailed in Part 1.</p>
<p>Behaviour is perceived not in the problematic sense but as a communication method. One participant said ‘every behaviour says something’ (Helen). If participants observe the service-user cooperating with a request, the interpretation is that they like it or at least don’t have a problem with it. If the person is uncooperative, this is interpreted as disliking the activity or not wanting to participate. Interestingly, no participant said that non-cooperation might mean the request isn’t understood. Most participants perceive that people who communicate through behaviour often have a more severe level of disability and are unable to utilize other communication methods:<disp-quote>
<p>People who are functioning in the profound to severe area because they have no other way of telling you … and if all else fails, they have no other way of letting you know only hitting out. (Grace)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Discussion of observation to this point has been in relation to the one-to-one interaction between participants and service-users. However, participants felt they need to be aware of other factors in the person’s life, e.g. there may be an argument between service-users, causing one to become upset. If the participant is unaware of the argument, understanding why the service-user is upset is difficult. This is in tandem with the person-centred philosophy that the person exists within a circle of other people.</p>
<p>Observation is a key theme in the context of non-verbal communication and person-centred care and support. The RNID’s individualized, in-depth knowledge of the service-user is added to through observation. This occurs alongside using proficient listening skills.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1744629512442033">
<title>Listening</title>
<p>Although the service-users communicate non-verbally, it is recognized that they are not silent. The service-users who communicate non-verbally utilize any options they have to communicate. This includes communicating through vocalizations that appear incoherent to the unfamiliar person. Again, this highlights the importance of familiarity/knowing the person and the in-depth knowledge the RNID has of the service-user. Participants report how people who are non-verbal often vocalize but the sounds are not formal words or language. In order to interpret these, the RNID needs to have a thorough, individual knowledge of the service-user to understand their unique vocalizations. Although this is challenging and difficult, participants believe it becomes easier once they know the service-user. They believe they could correctly interpret the meaning of most sounds:<disp-quote>
<p>A service-user mightn’t be able to pronounce a thing but certain noises might be their attempt to say a word, perhaps the same sound would always mean tea or would mean toilet or would mean whatever it might mean. (Ruth)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Participants listen for tone and pitch and observe facial expressions and/or body language, taking the lead from the service-user. Participants had not thought about this skill. They were unable to articulate how they interpret and distinguish different sounds. It appears to be an intuitive skill learned through time and being with the service-user. Similarly, when conveying a message, participants observe and listen for responses to interpret whether or not the service-user understands.</p>
<p>Conveying emerged as the third aspect of person-centred communication.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1744629512442033">
<title>Conveying</title>
<p>Participants also demonstrate person-centred communication when conveying messages. They describe several ways they convey messages including verbal language, body language, communication systems, appealing to the service-user’s senses, and the environment. Each method is selected based on the service-user’s ability. Verbal communication is always used with another method to ensure the service-user understands. This was not expressed directly by the participants but indirectly when discussing scenarios. When asked what they do when they feel the service-user doesn’t understand, most discussed how they change their language and sentence structure. However, when outlining a scenario of when the service-user doesn’t understand, participants indirectly described supporting verbal communication with other forms of communication such as gestures, body language etc.</p>
<p>Participants discussed body language in terms of their approach to the service-user and using their presence to communicate. They believe that service-users can interpret body language and draw many messages from their approach. Participants recognize the powerful yet delicate nature of body language. If they do not position their body correctly, it can be interpreted as intimidating or threatening. Messages conveyed through body language include confidence, respect and being open to communication:<disp-quote>
<p>If you’re … nervous or appear unsure of yourself then they’ll be unsure as well … whereas if you’re confident … they know … that you’re in control. (Jennifer)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The individual ability of the service-user affects the use of methods that appeal to their senses. All of the person’s senses are used to communicate with the exception of taste, particularly for those with sensory disability. Smells, touch, hearing and sight are all used to convey messages:<disp-quote>
<p>Sensory things would be really important like smelling porridge … in the morning if breakfast is cooking or if you’re having a fry or anything like that … Even the shower … in the water coming … the vapour coming out … has a smell. (Jennifer)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Using the person’s sense of touch to communicate a message is the most interpersonal method. Touch is used through tapping a person’s chair so they will feel vibrations and know someone is there or actually contacting the person directly. The service-user’s sense of hearing is constantly being used as the participants’ state that they always use verbal language to communicate. The fourth sense, sight, is used regularly as participants show the person items, gestures or photos. Communicating this way removes any abstract thinking required and gives the person something tangible to understand. Where such systems are in use, they are mostly successful. Each method focuses on the service-user’s ability rather than disability, thus compounding the description of the participants as communicating in a person-centred way.</p>
<p>An abstract method of conveying a message involves using the person’s surroundings, e.g. routine, timing and the atmosphere. These are methods of communicating without using words. Routine offers structure and predictability. Choosing an effective time to communicate a message avoids confusing the service-user. This use of timing is closely linked with communicating through atmosphere. Participants believe that service-users can interpret what is happening by the activities around them, associating certain activities with certain events:<disp-quote>
<p>It’s the ambience in the unit. There’s hustle and bustle. The ovens are going. There’s cutlery. There’s tables being set. (Jennifer)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This skill of interpreting and conveying messages from and to people with an intellectual disability and communication impairment will be essential to supporting people with an intellectual disability in a time where services are facing significant transition. New strategies for supporting people with an intellectual disability (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744629512442033">HSE, 2011</xref>) and several papers regarding inclusion published by the NDA will see services which have been provided in congregated settings in the past move towards community-based services in the future. This implies a transition not only for services but for service-users and their families. The unique skill of the RNID must be recognized and appropriately utilized to ensure people with an intellectual disability are supported fully through this transition. Not least of these will be the need for specific and additional support to people with an intellectual disability who communicate non-verbally. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744629512442033">HIQA (2009</xref>) under criterion 5.6 state that all staff must communicate effectively with and listen and respond to the individuals as well as make information accessible to them. This finding of person-centred communication and its characteristics fulfils these criteria and therefore demonstrates the higher-order skill of these RNIDs in communicating with people with an intellectual disability. It further highlights the ideal positioning of the RNID as one vital influence in the provision of high-quality care and support for people living in intellectual disability services. As is highlighted in the <italic>Time to Move On</italic> report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744629512442033">HSE, 2011</xref>), the environment in which this interaction takes place is another significant factor which impacts on communication. This, ‘the caring environment’, was the final theme.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1744629512442033">
<title>The caring environment</title>
<p>It is well documented that the environment in which communication takes place has a significant impact on the success of the communication exchange. This was also identified by the participants in this study. It was found that there are many contextual features that contribute to the success of the exchange, including the service-user, teamwork among staff, and the setting.</p>
<sec id="section11-1744629512442033">
<title>The service-user</title>
<p>As a partner in the communication exchange, the service-user has a direct influence on it. Participants described how the service-user’s ability and their frame of mind at the time of the communication impacts upon the exchange. They recognize their responsibility to adjust their communication level to suit the service-user but believe that the more severe the disability, the more difficult communication is:<disp-quote>
<p>They mightn’t have the vocabulary or the words even within themselves … even the physical side of their disability … the person might not be even able to point at what they want. (Ruth)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This challenge is compounded if the service-user’s frame of mind is not conducive to communication. The participant needs to keep the service-user focused. If the service-user is inattentive, there is a greater challenge to communicating:<disp-quote>
<p>They are stuck totally buried in themselves or else they’re in another space … They’re just not present at the moment but … after observing, giving them time, putting in the effort to ask the proper questions, looking out for their reaction to their different stimuli, you’ll get to them eventually. (Helen)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This process is time-consuming and requires perseverance and tolerance. Participants accept this and are aware of the importance of teamwork to cope with these demands.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1744629512442033">
<title>Teamwork</title>
<p>Being an active and contributing member of the healthcare team is a requirement of nurses in Ireland according to the Irish Nursing Board (An Bord Altranais, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744629512442033">2005</xref>). Being a member of a team is a critical support for RNIDs. It is a support to cope with the emotional aspects of the role. It is a support for when communication is unsuccessful. It is a support forum to discuss and confer about observations and evaluations. When working with service-users who communicate non-verbally, participants described the necessity of teamwork, good communication between staff and the multi-disciplinary team, and supporting new staff as vital. This included consulting with each other regarding best approaches, sharing knowledge and supporting each other when experiencing difficulty to provide continuity and consistency for the service-user:<disp-quote>
<p>If the staff work then the client will work because we’re the ones supporting them. If we don’t work as a team and are not singing from the same hymn sheet, it doesn’t matter what you’ve in place … it won’t work. (Aoife)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This consistency and continuity can be hampered by staff changes/turnover which have advantages and disadvantages. If someone new joins the team there is an adjustment period. However, some participants see a necessity for this turnover as old staff can become ‘stale’ (Grace) and new staff can bring fresh ideas that may enhance care:<disp-quote>
<p>You have a mix of the new blood, you have the new ideas, you have the older people with the experience of being there and being through whatever over the years. (Grace)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In summary, teamwork in the context of this study means working together to achieve the best outcomes for the person with an intellectual disability. The priority is the service-user and their well-being.</p>

<p>The setting where communication occurs can influence the exchange, including the physical environment, the people present and the resources. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744629512442033">HIQA (2009</xref>) under Standard 15 states that the residential service for people with intellectual disability should be homely and promote the privacy and dignity of each individual. Such an environment would be relaxed and comfortable and provide the optimal environment in which to communicate. Participants highlighted issues such as noise, other people interfering and the arrangement of the room as contributing to negative outcomes when communicating. These can affect attention and listening. Each of these factors may be influenced by the presence or absence of resources including education, staff levels, funding and time. Of the eight participants interviewed, only one had communication-specific training since qualifying. Some had received training indirectly through other courses but all said they would like to receive training. Reasons for not attending courses included a lack of awareness and funding. In the current economic climate it could be assumed that the situation regarding funding of intellectual disability services will remain challenging. However, as the Value for Money and Policy Review Initiative 2008–2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744629512442033">HSE, 2008</xref>) assesses and evaluates the extent to which disability services are meeting set objectives and the sustainability of investments, it is clear from the findings of this research that any developments involving people with intellectual disability in the areas of inclusion, person-centredness and independence will require highly skilled communicators who can meet the needs of people who communicate non-verbally. The findings of this study would suggest that RNIDs can and are fulfilling this role.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>At a time of great change, it is essential that people who have an intellectual disability and communicate non-verbally availing of intellectual disability services in Ireland have strong, consistent and reliable support. This change is occurring at several levels of services and is impacting on current philosophies, the types of supports available and a shift in residential services. It is also influencing financial and investment changes to include staffing levels, resources available, etc. Effective communication will be essential to ensure the smooth transition with minimal negative impact on people with an intellectual disability and their families. The findings of this research would suggest that the RNID is ideally situated to provide such supports. Intellectual disability service strategies, policies and standards such as those mentioned earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744629512442033">HSE, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744629512442033">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744629512442033">HIQA, 2009</xref>) have person-centredness, inclusion, community living and independence as their drivers. These are the current driving principles and philosophies of intellectual disability services, but the findings of this study would suggest that if these are to be delivered on, the RNID will need to remain central in delivering care to people with intellectual disability who communicate non-verbally. People with an intellectual disability are often referred to as a vulnerable group. However, within this population, people who communicate non-verbally are particularly vulnerable. The RNID’s familiarity/knowledge of the person is the thread that binds each of these concepts and ensures people who communicate non-verbally are fully supported.</p>
<sec id="section15-1744629512442033">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>As with any research, there are a number of limitations to this study. Firstly, it is acknowledged that communication is a two-way phenomenon, but this study only explored the perspectives of the intellectual disability nurse. The perspectives of people with an intellectual disability are not explored. This warrants exploration as it may compound or invalidate some of the participants’ assertions, e.g. the belief that an image of confidence and control must be presented to reduce service-user anxiety and worry. Does the service-user view this as reducing their anxiety? Or is it disempowering? In another example, participants viewed non-cooperation by service-users as signalling they don’t want to participate in an activity. Service-users’ views are required to clarify this or the possibility of another reason, e.g. not understanding. A second limitation is that the data collected are only participants’ reports of what they believe they do. There is no certainty that this is what they actually practise. An observation-based approach used alongside the interviews would have enhanced the findings. A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744629512442033">Healy and Noonan-Walsh (2007</xref>) in relation to communication between nurses and adults with severe and profound intellectual disabilities found a disparity between what staff reported they practise and what they actually practise. Despite these limitations, this study does provide insight into the participants’ experiences of communicating with service-users who are non-verbal, which meets the aim of the study.</p>

<title>Conclusions and recommendations</title>
<p>By purposefully selecting eight RNIDs to participate in individual, in-depth, semi-structured interviews, this study explored the experiences of RNIDs of communicating with people with an intellectual disability who communicate non-verbally using a phenomenological approach. Part 1 outlined the study background, context and methodology and critically discussed the overarching, multi-dimensional category of familiarity/knowing the person which encapsulated several themes and subthemes. The current article has presented and analytically deliberated upon the three themes within this overarching category which illustrate the context within which communication takes place: emotional conflict; person-centred communication; and the caring environment. Each of these involved several subthemes that highlight the critical role and context of the RNID in ensuring successful communication with the service-user who communicates non-verbally. This complex and involved role as well as the individualized and person-centred approach to care were evident. The responsibility alongside the high skill level required were considered to be largely unrecognized due to the difficulty in accurately articulating a convoluted, complex and multifaceted interaction and process. Each of these findings was discussed in the context of policies, strategies and philosophies that are driving and shaping the future direction of intellectual disability service provision in Ireland. It was clear that the RNIDs in this study are ideally situated to support the implementation of these policies and strategies at the forefront of service provision with a high level of skill and knowledge as well as experience. This study adds to the debate regarding communication in intellectual disability settings, and the specific challenges to supporting people with an intellectual disability who communicate non-verbally. It is hoped that the findings can inform service providers and nurse educators in an effort to enhance care for and improve the lives of people with an intellectual disability. However, it is recommended that further research be carried out from the perspective of people with an intellectual disability who communicate non-verbally which could further explain the complexity and uniqueness of interactions between persons who are non-verbal and those who support them.</p>
