<abstract>
<p>Although land seizure is designed to be an evocative and provocative tactic for social movement organizations, how are groups’ members, goals, and claims portrayed in subsequent media coverage? Focusing on the Indians of All Tribes’ occupation of Alcatraz Island, this article qualitatively analyzes photographic representations of protest in three national newspapers. Images published during the occupation (1969 to 1971) represent Indian activists as lazing or inactive, politically ineffectual, and invisible. When foregrounding contention, photographs showed negatively affected non-Natives or Indians being arrested. By contrast, images published after the occupation (1972 to 2000) generally concentrate on the physical space of the island as a tourist destination rather than a site of conflict. Social scientists should critically assess the media’s role in shaping collective perceptions about social movements through visual images, particularly when tactics are designed to garner media attention.</p>

<p>Six young Native American activists stand on Alcatraz Island facing the camera, most with their arms resting at their sides, in front of a recently repainted sign. Although the activists are horizontally centered in the picture printed on the <italic>San Francisco Chronicle</italic>’s front page on Friday, November 21, 1969, the substantial sign behind them takes up most of the space in the image. It clearly reads, “Warning: Keep Off Indian Property.” The connected article conveyed some of the action’s demands: “An occupation force of more than 80 young American Indians landed on Alcatraz Island before dawn yesterday and proclaimed it ‘free Indian land’ by ‘right of discovery’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0002764211419354">Findley, 1969b</xref>, p. 1). The initial occupiers called on other Native Americans to come to the island and join in their common struggle: “Our fight with the whiteman’s power structure demands a united front. . . . What we must do now is demonstrate our faith in our Indian brothers and demand this symbolic bit of reparation for the millions of acres of land stolen from Native Americans.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0002764211419354">1</xref></sup> The Indians of All Tribes (IAT) quickly organized day-to-day life and resisted efforts by the state to remove them. November 21, 1969, marked the beginning of a 19-month-long takeover of the former federal prison on Alcatraz Island in the San Francisco Bay.</p>
<p>Native American groups, tribes, and pantribal coalitions have used a multitude of tactics to critique federal, state, and local governments; non-Native populations; and occasionally, one another. Although most inter- and intrasovereign disputes are resolved through mechanisms that do not result in overt protests, in nearly 100 cases, these conflicts generated land seizure activism in the United States. Blockades, takeovers, sit-ins, and other related techniques proved to be highly adaptable and resonant ways to use physical spaces in contention. Whether it is Mohawk Indians blockading the Seaway International Bridge across the Saint Lawrence Seaway in December 1968 to defend their rights reserved by the Jay Treaty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0002764211419354">“41 Mohawks Seized,” 1968</xref>) or Seneca Indians closing a 31-mile section of the New York State Thruway on reservation lands in July 1992 because of the state’s effort to unilaterally impose taxes on cigarette and gasoline sales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0002764211419354">Palazzetti &amp; Cardinale, 1992</xref>), land seizures disrupt and dispute the routine operation of power. These highly visible actions provoke responses from opponents while also explaining why the action is taking place, who is to blame, and what should be done to resolve the underlying problem.</p>
<p>Since land seizure, like other confrontational tactics, is intentionally sensational, it is an ideal case to analyze the visual representations of Native American protest actions. Although sociologists often study social movement organizations’ formal framing strategies, less attention has been devoted to theorizing how these frames are rearticulated through pictures and visual narratives about movement activity. This article focuses on a single tactic—land seizures—and on a particular instance of this approach to contention. Specifically, I consider the occupation of Alcatraz by the IAT, which lasted from November 1969 until June 1971. Analyzing how the event was represented in newspaper imagery as it developed, as well as its remembrances in subsequent decades, provides an ideal lens to recognize the value of visual representations in the study of social movements. The takeover of Alcatraz is an iconic moment in contemporary indigenous activism, widely reported in the media and debated by reputational entrepreneurs, that merits analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0002764211419354">Leavy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0002764211419354">Schwartz, 1982</xref>). I begin by offering a synopsis of Native land seizure activism in general and the occupation of Alcatraz in particular. Next, turning to existing literatures, I build a theory of tactics as evocative performances to emphasize why it is critical to study the visual representations generated by these actions. After describing the data collected for the article and the qualitative analysis, my analysis explores differences among representations across time and region for this paradigmatic land seizure.</p>
<sec id="section1-0002764211419354">
<title>A History of Native Land Seizures</title>
<p>The takeover of Alcatraz Island is a particularly prominent moment in a long history of indigenous land seizure activism. Elsewhere, I detail three distinct phases of Native American land seizure activism that occurred throughout the United States during the second half of the 20th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0002764211419354">Wetzel, 2009</xref>). During the “recuperative” phase of action, stretching from January 1950 through October 1969, 13 actions focused on reclaiming specific areas on reservations regularly used by non-Native peoples, such as beaches, bridges, and roads. These actions demanded that state and federal governments address the lack of resources for the reservation community while simultaneously reasserting sovereignty of the lands. The 46 actions in the “expropriative” phase (November 1969 through January 1975) generally involved pantribal coalitions occupying surplus federal lands. Here, actions typically highlighted the needs of urban Indians and invoked treaty rights as a basis to reclaim lands. Finally, the 38 actions during the “demonstrative” phase (February 1975 through December 2000) were divided. On one hand, tribal groups occupied on-reservation facilities to gain leverage in intratribal disputes, and on the other hand, pantribal coalitions seized high-profile locations to raise grievances with non-Native governments.</p>
<p>The IAT’s takeover of Alcatraz is often used to designate the beginning of the Red Power movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0002764211419354">Johnson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0002764211419354">Nagel, 1996</xref>). Native peoples actually seized the island three times in the 1960s. The first occurred on March 8, 1964, when five Sioux men from the Bay Area sailed out and planted claims stakes and an American flag in the ground. Their typed declaration cited the Great Sioux Treaty and noted, “Under the US Code, we as Sioux Indians are settling on federal land no longer appropriated” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0002764211419354">Power, 1964</xref>, p. 16).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0002764211419354">2</xref></sup> The second occupation was an immediate precursor to the major event, occurring on November 9, 1969. Mohawk Richard Oakes, an early IAT leader and student at San Francisco State College, read a proclamation at the San Francisco waterfront before a group boarded the <italic>Monte Cristo</italic> to sail around the island. Although the journey was intended to circle and symbolically claim the island, several young men dove from the boat and attempted to swim to Alcatraz after they set sail. After being removed from the island, 14 returned that evening and spent the night on the island (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002764211419354">Findley, 1969a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0002764211419354">1969d</xref>).</p>
<p>The third, longest, and most-well-known takeover started on November 21, 1969, when a group of approximately 80 Native students reclaimed Alcatraz. By December, this new piece of Indian Country had 86 permanent residents and a series of defined goals, namely, the construction of a cultural center, a primary school, an ecology center, and a Native American university.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0002764211419354">3</xref></sup> Minutes from General Council meetings reflect the activists’ concerns about negotiating with the federal government regarding disposition of the island, integrating new residents, establishing rules for organizing daily life, and executing tasks on the island as well as backing other Native land seizures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0002764211419354">4</xref></sup> Members of the IAT also solicited distinct types of support from different groups. Natives were asked to directly participate in the takeover, whereas everyone else was directed to channel their participation toward writing letters to elected officials, signing petitions backing the IAT, and sending financial contributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0002764211419354">Wetzel, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>As negotiations over the island between the Indians and government agents stretched on, a number of the Native student activists left the island in January and February 1970 to return to school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0002764211419354">Fortunate Eagle, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0002764211419354">Johnson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0002764211419354">Talbot, 1997</xref>). After the United States proposed to create an “Indian-themed” national park that would have Native docents in April 1970, a proposal roundly rejected by the IAT, the government removed the island’s water barge and cut electricity. A fire on the island in June 1970 destroyed the warden’s house and caused significant damage to the lighthouse, which was used for navigation. Despite these challenges, the IAT remained entrenched on, and connected to, the island. Federal marshals and the Coast Guard finally raided Alcatraz on June 11, 1971, removing the remaining activists. Shortly thereafter, representatives from the General Services Administration coordinated a tour to allow the media to see the conditions on the island (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0002764211419354">Fortunate Eagle, 2003</xref>). Decrying the government’s dishonest dealings, some from the IAT responded to their ouster by occupying a closed missile site in the hills above Richmond, California. Santee Sioux and IAT spokesman John Trudell clarified the new event’s purpose: “This is just another Alcatraz. . . . We aren’t going away quietly” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0002764211419354">“Indians Take Over,” 1971</xref>, p. 47). Activists from Alcatraz went on to participate in many subsequent land seizures across the United States. More generally, the sustained takeover of Alcatraz served as a beacon of hope and opportunity. Joseph “Indian Joe” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0002764211419354">Morris (1998)</xref>, a Blackfoot and San Francisco longshoreman who helped coordinate the cityside logistics for the IAT, reflected on the occupation’s meaning in his memoir:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Despite all of the problems, I was glad to join in and be part of the Alcatraz Indian movement. I liked helping the people from the different tribes who come to San Francisco and Alcatraz Island, talking to them and getting acquainted. . . . I am happy to have served my Indian brothers and sisters. We let those bastards in the government know our feeling and our hurts that came from the stealing of our lands, our dignity, and our self-respect, and our people being killed in the white man’s wars against us. We let them know that American Indians are still around. They still have to deal with us. (p. 121)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The government opened Alcatraz to tourists in 1973, eventually including the island in the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. Within a few years, Alcatraz was firmly established as one of the Bay Area’s most popular attractions. The National Park Service finally opened an exhibit on the history of the IAT occupation in the island’s museum in July 1997.</p>
<sec id="section2-0002764211419354">
<title>Land Seizure as a Tool to Provoke and Evoke</title>
<p>Understanding more about the tactics used by social movement organizations (SMOs) in general helps situate the analysis of land seizures by Native Americans and the occupation of Alcatraz by the IAT specifically. In his study of the development of Black activism, Doug <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0002764211419354">McAdam (1983)</xref> explains that movement organizations must continually develop new protest techniques that disrupt the status quo and work against the interests of the group’s opponents. These tactical innovations are both <italic>provocative</italic>, in that they intend to elicit a response from the activists’ opponents, and <italic>evocative</italic>, in that they convey the organization’s goals and aspirations to a wider audience.</p>
<p>Sociologists have described the genealogies of a range of tactics. The sit-in, for example, spread widely throughout Southern communities after the first action by students in Greensboro, North Carolina, in February 1960. An evolving narrative about the sit-ins swept across college campuses “like a fever” and generated a moral imperative for students to become involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0002764211419354">Polletta, 1998</xref>). By reporting on the extent of these protests, the news media played a critical role in disseminating sit-ins to 66 cities across the South (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0002764211419354">Andrews &amp; Biggs, 2006</xref>). Sit-ins were met with a range of responses by opponents. Although at first they were caught off guard, agents of the state quickly adapted with mass arrests, developing antitrespassing ordinances, permanently closing lunch counters, and ultimately establishing biracial negotiating bodies to deflect conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0002764211419354">McAdam, 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>The barricade has been similarly flexible and resonant as a tactic of contention for French protestors since the 17th century. For hundreds of years, students, workers, and political partisans required relatively minimal resources to create literal obstacles that take advantage of the physical space of cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0002764211419354">Tarrow, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0002764211419354">Traugott, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0002764211419354">2010</xref>). What is sociologically significant are not the materials from which barricades are constructed but the extent to which the tactic itself educates. “Despite its varied manifestations,” writes Mark <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0002764211419354">Traugott (2010)</xref>, the barricade</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>has retained its identity, making it possible to speak of the barricade as having a history of its own. The barricades . . . shared common characteristics that allowed observers and participants alike to see them all as part of a single insurrectionary lineage. (p. 12)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Much like the sit-in, the barricade socializes movement actors, elicits responses from the state, and becomes the site for confrontations. These are but two examples from the literature demonstrating how tactics manage to evoke and provoke.</p>
<p>However, to theorize the ways in which land seizures are represented, one also needs to examine the performative nature of tactics. This literature deepens understanding of the dual nature of tactics. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0002764211419354">Verta Taylor, Leila J. Rupp, and Joshua Gamson (2004)</xref> explicate how drag shows are performances that serve as vehicles to simultaneously assert political claims and translate gay life to a wider audience. Jeffrey S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0002764211419354">Juris (2008)</xref> similarly underscores the powerful performative aspects of anticorporate protests. Although it is difficult to shape narratives in the media, these events remain a key tool for activists in generating emotional reactions and engagement. Graham <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0002764211419354">St. John (2008)</xref>, much like Juris, theorizes the complicated role played by the “protestival,” which he describes as anticapitalist events that employ aspects of the carnival to dramatize activists’ claims. Each study underscores how tactics precipitate emotional reactions by virtue of being sensational.</p>
<p>With the cultural turn in the study of social movements, greater scholarly focus has been placed on the process of creating shared meanings and cognitions. In practical terms, this concentration had yielded a significant literature on movement framing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002764211419354">Benford, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0002764211419354">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0002764211419354">McCammon, Hewitt, &amp; Smith, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0002764211419354">Rohlinger, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0002764211419354">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0002764211419354">Snow, Vleigenthart, &amp; Corrigall-Brown, 2007</xref>). A frame, defined as a “‘schemata of interpretation’ that enables individuals to locate, perceive, identify, and label occurrences within their life space and world at large,” makes the connection between peoples’ lived experiences and their willingness to participate in action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0002764211419354">Snow, Rochford, Worden, &amp; Benford, 1986</xref>, p. 464). Elsewhere, I analyze how the IAT used movement-controlled venues, such as the <italic>IAT Journal</italic>, Radio Free Alcatraz, and letter writing, to make distinct appeals to different audiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0002764211419354">Wetzel, 2010</xref>). Yet more research is needed on how activists and events are represented in outlets they do not control. How are movements’ messages diffused to the wider world? Answering this question becomes all the more pressing when recognizing that performative tactics intentionally evoke and provoke.</p>
<p>A social constructionist perspective acknowledges the media’s powerful role in shaping collective perceptions of realities and opinions about issues in society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0002764211419354">Gamson &amp; Modigliani, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0002764211419354">Gitlin, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0002764211419354">Iyengar &amp; Kinder, 1987</xref>). Although the media generally produce popular apathy and indifference, they can also serve as a forum for struggle and contestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0002764211419354">Gamson, Croteau, Hoynes, &amp; Sasson, 1992</xref>). Scholars argue that the media’s coverage, particularly, newspapers’ coverage, of social movements is typically limited and biased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0002764211419354">Earl, Martin, McCarthy, &amp; Soule, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0002764211419354">McCarthy, Titarenko, McPhail, Rafail, &amp; Augustyn, 2008</xref>). Noting the selectivity of media coverage, John McCarthy and his coauthors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0002764211419354">McCarthy, McPhail, &amp; Smith, 1996</xref>) find that coverage of movement activity is most likely when events are large and when issue fits with media issue cycle. Rima <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0002764211419354">Wilkes, Corrigall-Brown, and Myers (2010)</xref> examined newspaper reporting on indigenous protests in Canada. They find protest size and length have little effect on the quality of coverage; rather, certain types of action produce more coverage. Confrontational protests are particularly likely to result in coverage by the media.</p>
<p>It is critical to read land seizures in general, and the occupation of Alcatraz in particular, in light of these studies. That is, land seizure is designed to be a sensational performance. It aims to stimulate support from a movement organization’s adherents while provocatively contesting its opponent’s ability to continue to easily exercise power. Although much research has been devoted to understanding how activists frame their own narratives, this project instead builds on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0002764211419354">Wilkes and her coauthors (2010)</xref> to think about the quality of coverage of a specific event. What stories do images published in mainstream media outlets tell about the occupation? How do these representations vary across place? How do the depictions of this event change over time? Although the problems of selectivity and bias in media coverage mentioned above are clearly limits when attempting to understand the goals and ambitions of an SMO, these are actually advantages for my project, as they shed light on how place, time, and power bear on representations.</p>
<p>My research on the takeover of Alcatraz extends an impressive and expanding body of literature on contemporary indigenous activism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0002764211419354">Johnson, Nagel, &amp; Champagne, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0002764211419354">Nagel, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0002764211419354">Ramos, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0002764211419354">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0002764211419354">Wilkes, 2006</xref>). Focusing on a particular tactic, and within that, on an instance of land seizure, is a unique lens through which to consider these representations. Land seizures are designed to elicit responses from an opponent and to tell the public a story. After more than three decades, the history and facts about the occupation do not change. How do images of the occupation vary? How do we make sense of these differences?</p>

<title>Data and Methods</title>
<p>This article offers a comparative content analysis of the representations of the occupation of Alcatraz. The comparison looks across region, inquiring about how the event is portrayed in different regions. Here I draw on three newspapers’ collections: the <italic>San Francisco Chronicle</italic>, the Bay Area newspaper with the largest circulation; <italic>The New York Times</italic>, a source frequently used to study social movements; and the <italic>Chicago Tribune</italic>, a paper based in a major city in the American Midwest.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0002764211419354">5</xref></sup> New York and Chicago newspapers are ideal data sources, since these were the two largest cities in the United States in 1970 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0002764211419354">U.S. Census Bureau, 1998</xref>). The comparison also looks across time, studying how the occupation is represented when events were unfolding from 1969 to 1971 and the long tail of memories across the subsequent three decades. Rather than analyze written accounts, I focus on the images of the occupation published in three newspapers. What kinds of images are published? What narratives of the occupation and activists are articulated?</p>
<p>To begin my analysis, I compiled all the articles and images published from the initial occupation in November 1969 through December 2000, searching for keywords, including <italic>activism, Alcatraz, American Indian, Indian, Native American, National Park Service, protest</italic>, and <italic>San Francisco</italic>, in the electronic ProQuest Historical Newspapers database and printed indexes for each paper. This preliminary search was intentionally broad, designed to capture a wide range of articles on the occupation itself, the history and use of Alcatraz Island, Native communities in the Bay Area, and the Red Power movement. From this initial cut, I closely read each article and examined the associated images to determine to what extent they addressed the occupation. This winnowing process ultimately generated a universe of 236 articles. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0002764211419354">Figure 1</xref> makes two trends immediately clear. First, the numbers demonstrate a markedly higher level of attention by the <italic>San Francisco Chronicle</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 148, approximately 63% of all articles), compared with 47 articles in <italic>The New York Times</italic> and 41 in the <italic>Chicago Tribune</italic>. Second, attention was much more common during the 19 months of the occupation: 188 articles were published between 1969 and 1971. Here, too, the <italic>Chronicle</italic> published many more articles (<italic>n</italic> = 116) than either the <italic>Tribune</italic> (37) or the <italic>Times</italic> (35). Although reporting on the occupation declined noticeably in all three papers after 1971, at certain moments there are noticeable upticks in interest. These instances of heightened attention will be discussed in the next section.</p>

<p>A smaller number of articles within this collection were accompanied by images. Across the entire period of years, 43.2% of articles (<italic>n</italic> = 102) had at least one image: 70 in the <italic>Chronicle</italic>, 18 in the <italic>Times</italic>, and 14 in the <italic>Tribune</italic>. Much like the frequency of articles, many more images were published during rather than after the occupation. Between 1969 and 1971, 36.7% of published articles (<italic>n</italic> = 69) had images. Again, the majority of these were printed in the San Francisco newspaper (<italic>n</italic> = 48) relative to those in New York and Chicago (<italic>n</italic> = 11 and <italic>n</italic> = 10, respectively). After 1972, the papers were less likely to publish articles about the occupation, but when they did, images most often accompanied these articles. In fact, 63.6% of <italic>New York Times</italic> articles, 68.8% of <italic>San Francisco Chronicle</italic> articles, and 100% of <italic>Chicago Tribune</italic> articles had images in this later period. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0002764211419354">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0002764211419354">3</xref> illustrate the pace of reporting and the frequency of images through the years.</p>

<p>Next, I considered the content of the images, using a grounded approach that allowed the data to generate salient categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0002764211419354">Altheide, Coyle, DeVriese, &amp; Schneider, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002764211419354">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>). I began by writing thick descriptions that recorded specific details of the images. Following this, I again worked through the images to document what was pictured and in what context. Some of the topics I considered include the following: Regarding people, did the image present an activist, a government agent, or someone else? Was the image a standard headshot, or did it show the person in action? Regarding places, was the island seen up close or from a distance? Did the image reflect life on the island or the impact on the physical infrastructure? To answer these questions, the subsequent analytic section is divided into the years during which the occupation occurred (1969 to 1971) and period of postoccupation memories (1972 to 2000).</p>

<title>Staking a Claim: Representations From 1969 to 1971</title>
<p>The occupation received extensive coverage in the Bay Area and national media during the years that the IAT held Alcatraz. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0002764211419354">Wilkes, Corrigall-Brown, and Myers (2010)</xref> suggest, the confrontational nature of the tactic resulted in 188 articles in the three newspapers, 69 of which included at least one image. What is intriguing, however, are the narrative representations articulated through the pictures. Although the occupation was powerfully evocative, the event and activists responsible for creating it were seldom portrayed as confrontational. Rather, the photos from this period tend to represent three types of Indians: lazing, neutered, and invisible. Only in the waning months of the occupation do images begin to show some conflict, but even at this point, what is revealed are arrested Indians and negatively affected Whites. This pattern of representation is surprising, given that the media has an interest in sensational depictions of protest to sell papers and meet the commercial needs of the media. Yet these images reflect both the familiar way occupation worked on a day-to-day basis, tacitly illustrating how activists were largely concerned with food and shelter, building a sense of community, and planning for the future, and that Indians are rarely regarded as legitimate political actors in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002764211419354">Corntassel &amp; Witmer, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>First, all papers published images of Indians lazing during the actual event. That is, representations depict Indians inhabiting the space and waiting rather than actively engaged in protest. For example, a photo from the early weeks of the event depicts a group of five men sitting on boat dock at Alcatraz. Three are holding fishing rods and two dangle their legs over the edge of the dock. All are looking at the camera, which is positioned slightly below them. A building can be seen in the background with several slogans painted on it: “Indians Welcome,” “United Indian Property,” and “Indian Land” with an eagle. Three additional people are standing on a walkway above the graffiti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002764211419354">Caldwell, 1969</xref>). Similarly, during this same period, an image of three young Native men who are perhaps in their mid-20s was printed. They are leaning on the railing of the cellblock, looking down and to their right. The viewer can see behind them open cell doors and the next level of cells above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0002764211419354">“Indians Seize,” 1969</xref>). At another time, there was a picture of young Indian men leaning on a railing outside with the lighthouse in the background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0002764211419354">Findley, 1970</xref>, p. 5). Even when Indian delegates came to Alcatraz in December 1969 to attend a conference planning future uses of the island, the representation was of people sitting on a boat wearing life jackets rather than the ensuing conversations about the disposition of the land (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0002764211419354">Findley, 1969c</xref>, p. 2). Collectively, these images of Indians mark the activists as inactive, yet they also reflect a certain reality of daily life on the island during the occupation.</p>
<p>Second, a variety of images also neuter or disarm Indian activists, showing leaders of the IAT outside the context of activism or the claims being leveled. In one case, there was an eye-level photo of a young Native woman and a “Little Indian” boy on Christmas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002764211419354">“Christmas on the ‘Rock,’” 1969</xref>). The boy is grinning broadly as he stands to the side of a pile of presents with his left hand resting on the gifts. One can see only the woman’s head behind a large pile of wrapped presents as she reaches with her right hand to pull a present from the top for him. Another image showed IAT leader Richard Oakes embracing his wife with the island residences and lighthouse in the background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0002764211419354">Ludlow, 1969</xref>). Another representational strategy to remove activists from the context of political claims making was to publish headshots. For example, this was done when the IAT formally incorporated in January 1970, with headshots of Earl Livermore and Stella Leach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0002764211419354">“‘Rock’ Indians to Incorporate,” 1970</xref>), and again in March 1971, when describing the challenges the IAT faced after spending a second winter on Alcatraz, with headshots of John Trudell and Albert Montoya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002764211419354">Findley, 1971</xref>). Another striking instance of removing members of the IAT from activism came when the group rejected the federal government’s proposal to create an “Indianized park” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002764211419354">Champion, 1970</xref>, p. 2). The image showed only a headshot of Trudell and actually misspelled his name both in the caption and throughout the associated piece. These kinds of images obfuscate the context in which the IAT made a claim for the island and the content of their demands.</p>
<p>Third, still another type of image not only eliminated the context of action but rendered the Indians completely invisible. These photos focused on scenery, landscape, and buildings, which further marginalizes the Native actors. For example, in March 1970, the <italic>Chicago Tribune Magazine</italic> published a lengthy feature on the occupation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0002764211419354">Michaels, 1970</xref>). Although the text of the article went into a fair amount of detail about the rhythm of daily life on the island and the movement organization’s goals, the three images accompanying the article situated actual Indians on the margins. The lead image for the piece was a two-page-wide cityscape of the San Francisco skyline taken from Alcatraz. At the far right of the image is the large silhouette of a teepee, and off to the left, behind the teepee, is a pair of people gazing across the bay. Another image offered a close shot of the building adjacent to the boat dock. A large sign on the building has been partially painted over to read “United Indian Property.” Few Indian activists inhabit this vision of the occupied island. In another image, there is a large teepee set on a grassy promontory on the west end of the island with the stunning vista of the Golden Gate Bridge and Marin Headlands in the background. However, here, too, no activists are in the frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0002764211419354">Caldwell, 1970</xref>). Members of the IAT are also displaced in favor of images of the place when it came to representing damages to the island. When the <italic>Chronicle</italic> published a series of images in the immediate aftermath of the June 1970 fire on the island, only destroyed or damaged buildings were shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0002764211419354">“Fire’s Destruction,” 1970</xref>). Similarly, one of the series of articles printed in the <italic>Chronicle</italic> at the end of the occupation featured damage to the physical plant of Alcatraz: the burned lighthouse and warden’s house, another house that had been burned, and a living room that had been thoroughly trashed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002764211419354">Carroll, 1971</xref>). These images that focus on the place more than the people signal the direction of what would come during the next period of time.</p>
<p>To the extent that images reflected ongoing action during the takeover, these tended to be published later during the occupation and focused on how non-Natives were affected and showed Indians being arrested. Considering the former group, a photo from the summer of 1970 showed a non-Native female attorney holding an arrow that was allegedly fired at a Coast Guard boat by occupiers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002764211419354">Carroll, 1970</xref>). She carefully held the arrow in both hands as she examined it. Another article similarly describes a tourist boat being hit by steel nuts that were supposedly launched from slingshots on the island. Included on the second page of this article is an image of a non-Native tourist holding the steel nuts he recovered in the palm of his hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002764211419354">“Alcatraz Barrage,” 1971</xref>). Especially at the end of the occupation, the papers published images of police officers and arrests. For example, in the immediate aftermath of the last activists being removed from Alcatraz, the <italic>Chronicle</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002764211419354">“Alcatraz Occupation,” 1971</xref>) published photos of a federal agent leading an Indian from the island and another of an agent standing watch near a graffiti-covered wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002764211419354">“Alcatraz Occupation,” 1971</xref>). The <italic>Chicago Tribune</italic> ran an article with similar content and an image of police removing activists from the island (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0002764211419354">“US Marshalls Oust,” 1971</xref>). It is only at later stages of the occupation that newspapers represent the activists in action. However, the narrative here tends to be focused on the deleterious effect certain actions have on non-Native people and of agents making arrests.</p>
<p>Visual representations of the occupation were relatively rare in the national coverage, making up 21 of the 69 articles with images (10 in the <italic>Chicago Tribune</italic>, 11 in <italic>The New York Times</italic>). For the most part, these images seldom concentrated on the occupation itself. Rather, published images tend to be either a macroscopic context photo, such as a wide view of the island or headshots of relevant actors, or a particularizing photo. These particularizing pictures are interesting because they show protests occurring outside of the Bay Area but in support of the IAT. For example, an image in the <italic>Tribune</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0002764211419354">“Drums of Protest,” 1969</xref>) with no article showed two young Native men standing while holding drumsticks and playing a traditional drum outside the Bureau of Indian Affairs office in Chicago. More people are in the background but are blurry. Both men are wearing headbands and heavy coats and looking to the side. The man on the far side of the image has a button on the lapel of his coat that says “Indian Power.” The caption mentions a local demonstration of Native students in support of the action on Alcatraz. <italic>The New York Times</italic> similarly used photos to localize the protest’s impact. Here, an image shows two non-Native people walking in front of a large, imposing statue of Theodore Roosevelt outside of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0002764211419354">Oelsner, 1971</xref>). The plinth of the statue has been spray-painted messily with the words “Return Alcatraz.” Again, papers outside of the Bay Area tend not to focus on the actual activists and instead focus on either the broader context of the event or a clear local connection.</p>
<p>During the period from the occupation’s beginning in November 1969 through the end of 1971, the takeover of Alcatraz was covered in 188 articles, of which nearly one third included images. When studying only the images, one gleans a particular narrative about the occupation. Rather than showing the IAT in action, the images represent activists as detached, inactive, or marginalized in favor of representations of the island itself. National coverage similarly focuses on the broad context or distinctively local elements. Given these portrayals, it is difficult to thoroughly discuss the movement organization’s goals and aspirations. In this way, my research on the seizure of Alcatraz affirms the findings of other scholars who illustrate how media coverage of social movements tends to be episodic, focusing on specific, discrete moments rather than thematically dealing with the larger issues at stake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0002764211419354">Gamson et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0002764211419354">Ryan, 1991</xref>). These visual narratives of an iconic land seizure also set a framework for what happens in the subsequent period.</p>

<title>From a Site of Contestation to the Sight of Tourist Destination: Representations From 1972 to 2000</title>
<p>The impact of the IAT’s occupation certainly endured beyond June 1971. According to Peter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0002764211419354">Blue Cloud (1972)</xref>, a Mohawk and editor of the <italic>IAT Journal</italic>, Alcatraz represented an opportunity to unite Native people as much as it was about reclaiming a particular physical place. The occupation affected the dynamics of the Red Power movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0002764211419354">Hauptman, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0002764211419354">Johnson, Nagel, &amp; Champagne, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0002764211419354">Smith &amp; Warrior, 1996</xref>). But what happened to representations of the event after the occupation?</p>
<p>The lack of daily developments led to diminished coverage in the national media. During the nearly 30 years, 48 articles were published: 32 in the <italic>San Francisco Chronicle</italic>, 12 in <italic>The New York Times</italic>, and 4 in the <italic>Chicago Tribune</italic>. To the extent that articles were published outside of the Bay Area, coverage was still highly episodic. For example, a cluster of articles with pictures are published when the National Park Service opened Alcatraz as a tourist destination in the mid-1970s. An article from the <italic>Tribune</italic> incorporated three images and a map of the Bay Area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0002764211419354">Booker, 1973</xref>). The trio of images rendered Indian occupiers completely invisible, instead microscopically focusing on the island’s physical plant. The first image gazes at the island from the water, looking up toward a smokestack, a series of buildings, and the water tower. The second image is taken from the island, this time an up-close image of the burned remnants of the warden’s house and an abandoned fire hose reel. The third image moves inside of the buildings, looking down the main cellblock as light streams in from above. Only the second image’s caption even makes mention of the occupation, but here, the text, like the image, reflects on the damage done by the Indian activists. “All that remains of the warden’s home on Alcatraz are burned out walls, a reminder of the Indian occupation of 1969-71” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0002764211419354">Booker, 1973</xref>, p. C8). Two articles from <italic>The New York Times</italic> documented the start of formal tourism on the island. The first, from June 1973, actually used the identical image of the burned warden’s home as published by the <italic>Tribune</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0002764211419354">“Park Service Will Open,” 1973</xref>, p. 232). In the second case, the <italic>Times</italic> printed a standalone image that showed Adam Nordwall (Fortunate Eagle) on the island wearing his full regalia and holding an eagle staff in his right hand. Behind him, a number of men and boys are walking up the hill from the dock while carrying suitcases and regalia. The caption notes that the group of Indians was there to hold “a brief ceremony commemorating the seizure of the island” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0002764211419354">“Indians Return,” 1973</xref>, p. 89). Although recognizing the people involved in this important event, the image shows Native commemorators walking in front of the same burned-out shell of the warden’s house. Even here, the narrative of the occupation is largely about destruction of or damage to buildings.</p>
<p>A proposal to open a casino on Alcatraz in 1988 similarly led to a period of heightened representations of the island and occupation. Much like reporting when the island was opened to tourism, images here focused on the island itself. When the <italic>Times</italic> covered the plan, it printed a wide view of the island as seen from a distance on the water as sailboats crossed between the viewer and the site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0002764211419354">Bishop, 1988</xref>). Both articles in the <italic>Chronicle</italic> that had images portrayed fanciful artists’ renderings of the would-be casino. One included a series of proposed casino designs, including one that appeared to be a stack of casino chips and another an homage to the freighters that sail the bay. A particular rendering actually incorporated a teepee with the cellblock in the background and Coit Tower in the foreground. This design, proposed by San Francisco–based Hanns Kainz, “would . . . cut the island in two and turn the tip of it into a giant tepee topped by an Indian cultural center. The tepee would house the casino” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0002764211419354">Lufkin, 1988</xref>, p. B1). Native peoples are introduced into the conversation about the island’s future but not as activists or agents; rather, the IAT’s demand for a cultural complex on the island had been melded into the vision of a non-Native gaming facility.</p>
<p>Again, coverage after the occupation is overwhelmingly episodic, focused around periods of time when the island is discussed as a tourist destination. Images in this moment generally concentrate on the island itself viewed from a distance or the remaining buildings. Not quite pastoral, the images still de-people the place and largely obfuscate the specific people involved with the occupation. To the extent that the occupation of Alcatraz is germane to these discussions, activists are portrayed as people who damaged historic buildings that are again national property.</p>
<p>By contrast, the <italic>San Francisco Chronicle</italic>’s coverage offers a more complex, if still incomplete, recollection of the occupation. This is not to say that the local newspaper was disinterested in issues related to tourism and representation. Indeed, the <italic>Chronicle</italic> reported on both the short-lived plan to build a casino on the island (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0002764211419354">Capps, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002764211419354">Garcia, 1988</xref>) and Alcatraz’s integration into the local tourist economy with images of visitors strolling through the former prison’s main cellblock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002764211419354">Ganahal, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0002764211419354">Nolte, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0002764211419354">Zane, 1986</xref>). Rather, given the demand to cover local news stories, <italic>Chronicle</italic> reporters detailed a range of events about the occupation and the many people who participated.</p>
<p>Beyond a greater quantity of articles (32 articles, 22 with images), coverage in the <italic>Chronicle</italic> was also qualitatively different than in the other two papers in that images throughout the period shifted from a focus on the site itself (such as the island or burned buildings) to again featuring Indians. For example, an article in 1978 described how Native activists returned to Alcatraz “not to occupy it as was done more than eight years ago, but . . . to draw strength from it” before beginning a march across the country as part of the Longest Walk protest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0002764211419354">Pogash, 1978</xref>, p. A3). The three images connected with the article showed the activists as dignified and reverent. One picture represented a male elder carrying a sacred pipe as he left the island, and another portrayed a large group of men, women, and children—some wearing regalia, others dressed in long coats and pants—walking across the island for the ceremony. Similarly, articles from the late 1990s show Native activists in a positive light. When the National Park Service finally opened an exhibit on the IAT’s occupation of Alcatraz in 1997, images showed the activists and their supporters as energized and joyful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0002764211419354">Brazil, 1997</xref>). In one picture, two of the student activists involved with the initial takeover in November 1969 exited the building housing the exhibit, stepping into the sun and smiling broadly. Both extended one arm and clenched their fist. In another image, people attending the ceremony stood in a large circle near the boat dock with their heads bowed in prayer. What is striking about this image is that the graffiti on the building is clearly visible, reading “Indians Welcome” and “Indian Land”; the representation seems to affirm the vision of the occupation.</p>
<p>The <italic>Chronicle</italic> also reported on the annual Un-Thanksgiving memorial on the anniversary of the occupation. Five images were printed with the 1999 article that marked the 30th anniversary of the takeover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0002764211419354">Fimrite, 1999</xref>). Only one image was contemporary. This reimagined a recurring visual trope from the tourist portrayals of the island in which visitors strolled through the cellblock. A close-up shot shows “Indian Joe” Morris, wearing a headdress and beaded bolo tie, and another man walking side by side through the prison’s cellblock. The other four images were historical, drawn from the <italic>Chronicle</italic>’s original coverage of the event. These were a montage of life on the island: activists sitting in the warden’s house, a young girl smiling as she flashes a peace sign toward a camera, a group of Native men joking with the island’s White caretaker, and that same image described at the beginning of this article. Read together, these all capably historicize and normalize the occupation. This was, to be certain, a sensational protest; but the people involved had a set of clear objectives and goals. The contemporary-period images are more favorable toward Natives than those during the occupation. After the height of the occupation and the Red Power movement, newspapers could show more agency in retrospective accounts than during the conflict, when land and the power are at stake. Even so, contemporary images are still largely peaceful, suggesting a certain complacency and satisfaction with America’s post–civil rights era of multiculturalism.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Alcatraz was the rekindling of the spirit of native people. It reminds me of a flame that kind of died down, and was at just a very low, low flame. The flame never went out. And Alcatraz sort of relit that and out of that fire came all of these different people, spread in all of the different directions to do incredible work. The people from Alcatraz have had a profound impact on the lives of people throughout this country.

<p>Cherokee Wilma Mankiller’s powerful account of how seizing Alcatraz energized people underscores the event’s successes. Although the IAT may not have received title to the island, the group revived “the spirit of native people.” This and other land seizures were designed to attract attention to, and hopefully reequilibrate, power inequalities between Native Americans and the state.</p>
<p>To the extent that land seizure is a confrontational tactic that is designed to provoke and evoke, it garnered significant coverage from three national newspapers. However, the visual representations of the action and activists were hardly positive or consonant with the IAT’s own framings. During the actual occupation, members of the IAT were seen in images as inactive, politically ineffectual, or hidden by the island’s physical landscape. When conflict was foregrounded, photos concentrated on the event’s deleterious impacts on non-Natives and on Indians being arrested at the end of the occupation. In the decades after the occupation, the island was largely portrayed as an emerging tourist destination. The <italic>San Francisco Chronicle</italic>, the paper closest to the action, went farther by sympathetically documenting the recurring memorials to the takeover.</p>
<p>My findings extend the existing literature by showing how visual representations of social movement action in newspapers, much like written accounts, tend to offer a restricted narrative of protest. Subsequent research should consider how these types of representation are similar to or different from other tactics that are specifically designed to be sensational. Researchers should also assess how SMOs find or create channels to tell their own stories. For the occupation of Alcatraz, this could take shape through a comparative analysis of the imagery conveyed in media controlled by the movement, such as the <italic>IAT Journal</italic> and <italic>Rock Talk</italic>. One could also study pictures taken by Ilka Hartman and Michelle Vignes, both of whom spent considerable time on the island building relationships with the activists.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0002764211419354">6</xref></sup> This type of analysis is all the more important as activists can avail themselves of tools such as weblogs and e-zines.</p>

<p>Interestingly, of the three papers, only the <italic>San Francisco Chronicle</italic> covered the first seizure of Alcatraz, publishing three articles during 1 week. Two images accompanied the initial article on March 9. On the front page was a picture of three Sioux men, two of whom were wearing regalia, as they drove the base of a billowing American flag firmly into the ground. In the background, the warden’s house and lighthouse are visible. The modest national coverage of this occupation is represented by passing mention in a <italic>Boston Globe</italic> editorial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0002764211419354">“Editorial Points,” 1964</xref>, p. 10): “If the Sioux Indians want Alcatraz, why shouldn’t they have it?
