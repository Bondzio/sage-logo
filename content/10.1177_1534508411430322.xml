<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this study was to extend the research on the <italic>Tests of Early Numeracy Curriculum-Based Measurement</italic> (TEN-CBM) tools by examining concurrent and predictive relations from kindergarten through third grade. Using a longitudinal sample of 535 students, this study included logistic regression, latent cluster, and latent transition analyses to examine the patterns and trends of student performance on all four TEN-CBM measures in kindergarten and first grade, math CBM (M-CBM) in first grade, and mathematics performance on a statewide high-stakes assessment in third grade. Results suggest that two of the TEN-CBM tools, Quantity Discrimination and Missing Number, are most robust at predicting later math performance. Longitudinal analysis indicated that students who are low performing in early numeracy at the beginning of kindergarten tend to be low performing in math at third grade. Low-achieving students also demonstrated a greater decrease in math skills over summer months when compared to higher-achieving peers.</p>

<p>In recent years, math achievement in the United States has received increasing attention for several reasons. First, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534508411430322">National Mathematics Advisory Panel (2008)</xref>, convened by the U.S. Department of Education, released a compilation of research findings, best practices, and guidelines for fostering and enhancing math development among American students. Second, a seminal meta-analysis of six longitudinal studies indicated that the mathematics achievement of children entering kindergarten is a stronger predictor of their subsequent academic achievement than other developmental skills, including literacy, attention, and social skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534508411430322">Duncan et al., 2007</xref>). Third, large-scale national and international studies have indicated that children in the United States may not have sufficient mathematical skills. Nationally, 19% of fourth-graders and 30% of eighth-graders performed at “below basic” levels on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534508411430322">Lee, Grigg, &amp; Dion, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534508411430322">Perie, Grigg, &amp; Dion, 2005</xref>). The 2007 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study ranked U.S. fourth-grade students 11th of 36 nations and eighth-grade students 9th of 48 countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534508411430322">Olson, Martin, &amp; Mullis, 2008</xref>). American students performed above the world average, but below students from the East Asian and European countries who represent our economic competition, and the results seem to worsen as children age. In a worldwide analysis of secondary students, the U.S. performance was even less strong. The 2006 Program for International Student Assessment ranked the United States 25th of 30 advanced nations and 11th relative to developing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534508411430322">Baldi et al., 2007</xref>). Undoubtedly, early math development is important for later math achievement and school success and has bearing on personal and national outcomes over time.</p>

<title>Defining Early Math</title>
<p>Mathematics represents a complex construct that develops in an iterative fashion. Unlike reading, which has clear prerequisite and precursory skills (e.g., phonological awareness, alphabetic knowledge), math is composed of several domains that interweave and evolve as children grow in their skills. For children in the early elementary years (kindergarten through third grade), math skills develop concurrently across five areas: numbers and operations, geometry, algebra, measurement, and data analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534508411430322">Clements, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534508411430322">Clements &amp; Sarama, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534508411430322">National Council for Teachers of Mathematics, 2006</xref>). These math domains are also relevant for older students, but at different levels of sophistication.</p>
<p>In early elementary, <italic>numbers and operations</italic> encompasses the skills of number knowledge, verbal counting, basic calculation, and quantity comparisons. <italic>Geometry</italic> is defined by identifying shapes and describing spatial relations. <italic>Measurement</italic> skills include identifying quantifiable attributes and comparing objects using the attributes. <italic>Algebra</italic> translates to skills related to identifying patterns and bringing organization and predictability to unorganized situations, and <italic>data analysis</italic> concerns classifying and ordering information to ask and answer questions. “Numbers and operations,” commonly referenced as <italic>number sense</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534508411430322">Wagner &amp; Davis, 2010</xref>) or <italic>early numeracy</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534508411430322">Kidd, Pasnak, Gadzichowski, Ferral-Like, &amp; Gallington, 2008</xref>), is the area of early math development most predictive of later math success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534508411430322">Mazzocco &amp; Thompson, 2005</xref>). A significant amount of research has been conducted in this area. Accordingly, across the range of early math assessment tools, measures of number sense dominate the field. However, it is important for readers to understand that early math as a construct is much broader than number sense.</p>

<title>Tests of Early Numeracy Curriculum- Based Measurement (TEN-CBM)</title>
<p>Some of the most commonly used CBM tools of early numeracy in published research with kindergarten and first-grade children are collectively referred to as the <italic>Tests of Early Numeracy Curriculum-based Measurement</italic> (TEN-CBM; c.f., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534508411430322">Baglici, Codding, &amp; Tryon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534508411430322">Chard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534508411430322">Clarke, Baker, Smolkowski, &amp; Chard, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534508411430322">Clarke &amp; Shinn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534508411430322">Martínez, Missall, Graney, Aricak, &amp; Clarke, 2009</xref>). The TEN-CBM includes a suite of four tasks (<italic>Oral Counting</italic> [OC], <italic>Number Identification</italic> [NI], <italic>Quantity Discrimination</italic> [QD], and <italic>Missing Number</italic> [MN]) for benchmark and progress monitoring assessment throughout kindergarten and first grade (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.aimsweb.com">http://www.aimsweb.com</ext-link>). All four TEN-CBM tasks assess the area of numbers and operations within the broad area of early mathematics, although arguably, with limited emphasis on “operations.”</p>
<p>Limited and inconclusive research has produced psychometric evidence of reliability and validity of the four TEN-CBM tasks in kindergarten (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534508411430322">Baglici et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534508411430322">Chard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534508411430322">Clarke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534508411430322">Martínez et al., 2009</xref>) and first grade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534508411430322">Baglici et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534508411430322">Chard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534508411430322">Clarke &amp; Shinn, 2004</xref>). Although support for the psychometric properties of the measures has been adequate, results have produced mixed effects with regard to the strength of the relations between individual TEN-CBM measures and criterion measures, and researchers have reached different conclusions about sensitivity of the measures at single points in time as well as over time given distributions of data within and across grades (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534508411430322">Baglici et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534508411430322">Chard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534508411430322">Clarke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534508411430322">Clarke &amp; Shinn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534508411430322">Martínez et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In a study of the four TEN-CBM measures with 59 kindergartners administered in the fall and spring, Martínez and colleagues (2009) found moderate to high test–retest reliability (<italic>r</italic> = .89–.92) and delayed alternate-form reliability (<italic>r</italic> = .77–.91). Results also suggested adequate concurrent (<italic>r</italic> = .44–.63) and predictive (<italic>r</italic> = .31–.46) validity. All four measures showed growth from fall to spring, indicating appropriate use for screening with kindergarten-age students. Perhaps the most interesting finding was a post hoc analysis suggesting that combining three of the four measures, Number Identification (NI), Quantity Discrimination (QD), and Missing Number (MN), produced the most robust evidence of technical adequacy. In short, the study questioned the added value of the TEN-CBM measure of Oral Counting (OC) in kindergarten.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534508411430322">Clarke and colleagues (2008)</xref> examined the four TEN-CBM measures administered in fall and spring of kindergarten in relation to a high-stakes end-of-year assessment in kindergarten with approximately 200 students. Moderate correlations were observed between the measures (<italic>r</italic> = .50–.64). All four measures were identified as robust and appropriate for screening purposes. QD performed better than any of the other measures in growth models, accounting for additional variance in end-of-year performance above the other TEN-CBM measures.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534508411430322">Chard and colleagues (2005)</xref> conducted a study with 436 kindergarten and 483 first-grade students and administered three of the four TEN-CBM tools (NI, QD, MN) in the fall, winter, and spring. The goal was to select measures for use in the fall of kindergarten and the fall of first grade that could identify students within those grades at risk for math difficulties. Findings suggested that all three measures were adequate screening tools across kindergarten and first grade. NI showed more potential for sensitivity to growth than QD or MN; however, in the kindergarten sample, QD and MN were most predictive of number sense. In the first-grade sample, all three TEN-CBM measures (NI, QD, MN) were better predictors of number sense than any one measure or other combination of measures.</p>
<p>Most recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534508411430322">Baglici and colleagues (2010)</xref> examined longitudinal relations across four benchmark assessments from winter of kindergarten through spring of first-grade TEN-CBM measures (OC, NI, QD, MN) in a sample of 61 students. Results corroborated previous research indicating strong alternate-form reliability (<italic>r</italic> = .71–.91) and evidence of predictive validity (<italic>r</italic> = .25–.67). All four TEN-CBM measures produced statistically significant growth rates across the four assessments. However, specific analysis within and across grades suggested that OC and MN growth was significant within kindergarten, but not first grade; QD growth was significant within first grade but not kindergarten, and NI growth was not significant within or between grades.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534508411430322">Clarke and Shinn (2004)</xref> examined all four TEN-CBM tools in the fall, winter, and spring with 52 first-grade students. Results suggested reliability coefficients very similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534508411430322">Martínez et al. (2009)</xref>. Test–retest reliability was high (<italic>r</italic> = .79–.85), as was alternate-form reliability (<italic>r</italic> = .78–.93). Evidence of concurrent (<italic>r</italic> = .49–.93) and predictive (<italic>r</italic> = .46–.78) validity was adequate, with QD and MN showing stronger relations with measures of computation. Increased performance on each of the measures from fall to spring was found to be statistically significant, with OC and NI demonstrating most growth. No combinations of measures were tested.</p>

<title>Current Study</title>
<p>Existing research does not present clear guidance as to the use of TEN-CBM tools. Given that all four measures assess number sense and the measures appear to have inconsistent sensitivity to growth, administration of all four measures may not be necessary as children move through kindergarten and first grade. A more sophisticated understanding of the patterns and trends of student performance on all four TEN-CBM measures at different points in time throughout kindergarten and first grade is needed to be able to make valid and efficient decisions regarding appropriate instructional services for all students.</p>
<p>Prior research suggests that TEN-CBM may serve as an adequate overall indicator of early performance in mathematics; however, limited information is available regarding the ability of TEN-CBM to identify subgroups of students with unique instructional needs. Determining if there are groups of students with qualitatively different patterns of performance across the TEN-CBM measures is important given the growing emphasis on extracting subskill-relevant diagnostic information from CBM assessments that can be used for instructional planning (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534508411430322">Fuchs, Fuchs, Hosp, &amp; Hamlett, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534508411430322">VanDerHeyden &amp; Burns, 2009</xref>). Further, examination of the stability of TEN-CBM performance patterns across kindergarten and first grades, as well as potential differences between performance groups in subsequent performance in mathematics, provides an additional test of the technical adequacy of TEN-CBM and explores the utility of additional information that could be obtained from TEN-CBM assessments, that is, identifying groups of students with similar instructional needs.</p>
<p>The purpose of the current study was to determine if there is a critical TEN-CBM measure or if combinations of TEN-CBM measures seem to be more important for predicting math achievement as children move through kindergarten and first grade. More specifically, research questions included:</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The current study uses TEN-CBM longitudinal data from three cohorts of students (<italic>n</italic> = 535) entering kindergarten at the same kindergarten through second-grade (K-2) elementary school during the following academic years: 2004–2005 (<italic>n</italic> = 172), 2005–2006 (<italic>n</italic> = 178), and 2006–2007 (<italic>n</italic> = 185). Specific demographic information was only available from the Indiana Department of Education as far back as the 2009–2010 class (<italic>N</italic> = 552), although school enrollment and population parameters have remained steady for years. In 2009–2010, 27% of the students in K-2 were eligible for free lunch and 9% qualified for reduced-price lunch. Sixteen percent of the population received special education services and only six (1%) were designated as English Learners (EL). In 2009–2010, 512 students were White (92.7%), 26 multiracial (4.7%), 7 African American (1.3%), 6 Hispanic (1%), and 1 Asian/Pacific Islander (&lt;1%).</p>

<title>TEN-CBM</title>
<p>The TEN-CBM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534508411430322">Clarke &amp; Shinn, 2004</xref>; obtained from AIMSweb, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.aimsweb.com/">http://www.aimsweb.com/</ext-link>) were administered as part of the standard universal screening program at the school where the study took place. The TEN-CBM consists of four distinct tasks individually administered under standardized testing conditions (e.g., task is discontinued if the student missed the first five items on any probe). Each probe is administered for 1 min and the examiner places a bracket after the last correct answer provided by the student. Scores represent raw correct answers; incorrect or missed numerals are not credited. The TEN-CBM task Oral Counting (OC) measures a child’s ability to count aloud in sequence, starting at number 1 to a maximum of 100. Number Identification (NI) assesses a child’s ability to orally identify randomly listed numerals (0–20) on a sheet of paper. The maximum score on NI is 56 in kindergarten and 80 in first grade. Quantity Discrimination (QD) gauges a child’s ability to compare two numerals on a piece of paper and identify the numeral representing the greater quantity (e.g., 3 or 9). The maximum score on QD is 28 in kindergarten and 40 in first grade. Missing Number (MN) determines a child’s ability to correctly report the correct number that ought to go in the blank (beginning, middle, or end) in a string of three consecutive numbers (e.g., 7, ___, 9). The maximum score on MN is 21 in kindergarten and 30 in first grade.</p>

<p><italic>Mathematics Curriculum-Based Measurement</italic> (M-CBM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534508411430322">Shinn, 2004</xref>) probes assess mathematics computation skill using paper and pencil. Research examining the technical adequacy has demonstrated strong evidence of reliability with coefficients often greater than .80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534508411430322">Foegen, Jiban, &amp; Deno, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1534508411430322">Thurber, Shinn, &amp; Smoklowski, 2002</xref>). Examination of M-CBM and other measures of computation have yielded validity estimates from .30 to .83 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534508411430322">Foegen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1534508411430322">Thurber et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Probes are group-administered in a standard paper-and-pencil format. Using standardized directions, students are given 2 min to calculate as many problems as they can. The first-grade probes used in this study included a mixture of 60 single- and double-numeral addition and subtraction problems. Each correct numeral (commonly referred to <italic>correct digit</italic> [CD]) in the answers was summed and a total score calculated (maximum of 60).</p>

<title>ISTEP+</title>
<p>The criterion measure in the current study was the mathematics subtest of the <italic>Indiana Statewide Testing for Educational Progress-Plus</italic> (ISTEP+). The ISTEP+ is a criterion-referenced measure of academic achievement based on the Indiana Academic Standards adopted in 2000 by the Indiana State Board of Education. In third grade, six mathematics standards are assessed: number sense, computation, algebra and functions, geometry, measurement, and problem solving. For the 2004–2005 and 2005–2006 cohorts, the ISTEP+ was administered in the fall; it was administered in the spring for the 2006–2007 cohort. The ISTEP+ is group-administered and untimed. ISTEP+ results are reported as scale scores (i.e., standard scores) that are classified by levels of performance (i.e., Did Not Pass, Pass, and Pass+). In this study, both ISTEP+ scale scores and levels of performance (i.e., Did Not Pass = 0, Pass or Pass+ = 1) were analyzed.</p>
<p>The reliability of the ISTEP+ is supported by adequate estimates of interrater reliability for constructed-response items (<italic>M</italic> = .94), item–test correlations greater than .30 for all multiple-choice items, and internal consistency estimates ranging from .87 to .93 depending on grade for the total test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534508411430322">Indiana Department of Education, 2010</xref>). The validity of the ISTEP+ is supported by the iterative expert content review process used to generate and review test items, factor analyses indicating unidimensionality of assessments within each content area, and the item-response theory analyses used to generate scale scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534508411430322">Indiana Department of Education, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Procedures</title>
<p>Students were administered all four TEN-CBM measures in the fall and spring of kindergarten and first grade. Based on typical benchmark procedures, TEN-CBM measures are also administered in the winter, but because of time constraints were only administered in the fall and spring for this study. At each of the three benchmark periods in 2004–2005 and 2005–2006, school psychology graduate students administered CBM probes and scored and entered the data. In the fall of each academic year, the graduate students participated in a half-day training on CBM conducted by the third author. CBM procedures were taught using administration and scoring videos and practice assessments provided by AIMSweb. Interrater reliability (IRR) on the practice probes was conducted until all students reached 100%. IRR was conducted on 25% of all probes administered in the fall of both academic years using a percentage agreement formula (agreements/agreements-disagreements × 100). IRR of .97 and .99 was achieved in the fall of the first and second years, respectively.</p>
<p>An M-CBM probe (M-CBM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534508411430322">Shinn, 2004</xref>) was also administered in the spring of first grade. In addition, ISTEP+ math results from each participant’s third-grade year were collected. ISTEP+ data were obtained by student name from the districtwide database containing all student information (e.g., attendance, demographics, test scores) by the fourth author, the lead school psychologist in the district, and entered manually into a spreadsheet by the third author.</p>

<title>Data Analyses</title>
<p>To address the relative importance of the individual TEN-CBM measures in predicting third-grade ISTEP+ math performance (Research Question 1), a series of binary logistic regression analyses were conducted with the TEN-CBM measures at each benchmark assessment as predictors of passing the math assessment. The consistency of findings regarding the relative importance of individual TEN-CBM measures across benchmark assessments (Research Question 2) was assessed by inspecting patterns of results from these logistic regressions across benchmarks. Presented values of variance explained (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>) for the logistic regression analyses were calculated using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534508411430322">McKelvey and Zavoina’s (1975)</xref> method.</p>
<p>To identify groups of students with similar patterns of performance on the TEN-CBM measures at each benchmark (Research Question 3), an initial series of latent-class cluster models were fit to the data, separately for each benchmark. The models varied in terms of complexity (i.e., whether variances and covariances among the TEN-CBM measures were specified as invariant or varying across clusters; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534508411430322">Muthén, 2001</xref>, for a technical description of models, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534508411430322">DiStefano and Kamphaus, 2006</xref>, for an applied demonstration) and in the number of clusters to be extracted (i.e., two to five). Because inclusion of covariates predicting cluster membership can improve mixture model performance and the correct assignment of cases to clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534508411430322">Lubke &amp; Muthén, 2007</xref>), M-CBM scores from spring of first-grade and third-grade ISTEP+ math scores were included in all models as covariates. The covariates were included as predictors of latent cluster membership; consequently, results for the covariates can be interpreted as multinomial logistic regression analyses. Specifically, beta weights are given for each predictor that represent the change in probability of assignment into each cluster relative to a specified reference cluster while holding all other variables equal.</p>
<p>A mixture of statistical (i.e., comparison of Bayesian information criterion [BIC] values) and substantive (i.e., examining the theoretical significance and percentage of students in solutions with additional clusters) considerations were examined to determine the optimal model parameterization and number of clusters at each benchmark assessment. Because mixture models are subject to local maxima, estimating models with multiple starting values for parameter estimates is recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534508411430322">Muthén, 2001</xref>). Consequently, all models were estimated with at least 400 random sets of starting values, with the 100 best-performing sets of values used as starting values in final-stage optimizations. Comparison of BIC values suggested that parameterizations with (a) cluster-invariant covariances among the TEN-CBM measures and cluster-specific means and variances fit the data best at the fall of kindergarten benchmark and (b) cluster-invariant variances and covariances and cluster-specific means fit the data best at the other benchmarks. For parsimony, only results based on these parameterizations of the mixture models are presented.</p>
<p>Following the determination of the optimal number of clusters at each wave, a latent transition analysis (LTA) was conducted (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534508411430322">Lanza, Flaherty, &amp; Collins, 2003</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534508411430322">Kaplan, 2008</xref>, for technical descriptions of LTA with application examples). In LTA, the cluster solutions at each assessment period and the probabilities of transitioning from particular clusters at earlier assessment periods to clusters at later assessment periods are modeled. Most importantly, LTA was used to identify groups of students with qualitatively distinct longitudinal patterns of performance on the TEN-CBM measures (Research Question 4). In addition, M-CBM at spring of first-grade and third-grade ISTEP+ math scores were included as distal outcomes in the LTA model, enabling comparisons of the TEN-CBM trajectory groups on subsequent math assessments (Research Question 5).</p>
<p>As is common in longitudinal research, the percentage of students with missing values increased over the course of the study because of student mobility (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534508411430322">Table 1</xref> for percentage of missing data by measure and time). Missing data were addressed in analyses via multiple imputation. Under the assumption that data are missing at random (i.e., that the probability of missingness is related to measured variables in the data set but not on the missing values themselves), multiple imputation is less biased than traditional methods of handling missing data such as listwise deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534508411430322">Enders, 2010</xref>). Analyses were conducted across 10 multiply imputed data sets in M<italic>plus</italic> 6.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534508411430322">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2010</xref>) using the robust maximum likelihood estimator.</p>

Although there was an overall pattern of improvement on all TEN-CBM measures over time; scores in fall of first grade were lower than spring of kindergarten, providing evidence for a decline in skills during summer break. Of note, two measures (NI and QD) exhibited noticeable ceiling effects at the spring kindergarten benchmark, as reflected in the negative skew (NI: –2.13, QD: –1.79) and positive kurtosis estimates (NI: 4.50, QD: 2.80) at this benchmark.</p>

<title>Cross-Sectional Patterns of TEN-CBM Performance</title>
<p>At some benchmark assessments, inspection of BIC values suggested a three-cluster solution fit the data best, and for some assessments, model fit continued to improve as more clusters were extracted. For all solutions, however, the latent clusters differed in terms of overall level across the TEN-CBM measures (i.e., one cluster had low performance, one had average performance, and one had high performance on all TEN-CBM measures). Extracting additional clusters beyond three did not change this pattern. Specifically, additional clusters tended to subdivide the original clusters based on the overall level of performance on TEN-CBM. As displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1534508411430322">Table 3</xref>, students exhibited similar patterns of performance on TEN-CBM across clusters and benchmarks (i.e., OC &gt; NI &gt; QD &gt; MN). Although the clusters did not appear to represent qualitatively distinct patterns of performance beyond overall level, the clusters exhibited differences in terms of future risk of academic difficulty. As displayed in the multinomial regression coefficients for the covariates as predictors of cluster membership, membership in Clusters 1 and 2 was associated with lower M-CBM and third-grade math exam scores as compared to Cluster 3. The negative beta weights for Clusters 1 and 2 indicate that as M-CBM and third-grade math exam scores increase, the probability of being assigned to Cluster 1 or 2, as compared to Cluster 3, decreases. For these reasons, the three cluster solutions appeared to best represent the patterns at each benchmark statistically and substantively.</p>

<title>Longitudinal Patterns of TEN-CBM Performance</title>
<p>To determine longitudinal patterns of performance on the TEN-CBM measures, LTA was used to classify students by pattern of cluster membership across benchmark assessments based on posterior probabilities generated from the model. Although the parameter estimates for the separate mixture models by benchmark assessment were used as starting values for the full LTA model, the LTA model differed from the solutions presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1534508411430322">Table 3</xref> in some aspects. Specifically, three classes were identified at each benchmark that varied based on overall level of performance on the TEN-CBM measures; however, the proportion of students in each cluster differed at some benchmark assessments from the cross-sectional mixture model results. At fall of kindergarten, Cluster 1 (Low Performing) contained 41% of students but only 15% to 18% of students at subsequent benchmarks. Consequently, Cluster 1 at fall of kindergarten contained some students who were later classified in the Average and High Performing Clusters. The proportions of students in each cluster were highly stable after the fall of kindergarten benchmark: 15% to 18% Low Performing (Cluster 1), 42% to 44% Average (Cluster 2), and 40% to 41% High Performing (Cluster 3).</p>
<p>Aside from variability in cluster assignment over time related to movement to higher performing clusters following the fall kindergarten benchmark, longitudinal patterns of cluster assignment were largely stable. Of the 81 possible longitudinal patterns of cluster membership (i.e., movement between three clusters at four time points), only 11 were exhibited by at least one student. The 11 patterns were classified in the following three longitudinal trajectory groups (Low, Average, and High) based on final cluster membership. The Low trajectory group included the following patterns (number of students and percent of all students in parentheses), with cluster membership (1 = Low Performing Cluster, 2 = Average Cluster, 3 = High Performing Cluster) at each of the four benchmarks indicated as 1212 to indicate the individual was in Cluster 1 at fall of kindergarten, Cluster 2 at spring of kindergarten, Cluster 1 at fall of first grade, and Cluster 2 at spring of first grade: 2111 (<italic>n</italic> = 72, 13%), 1211 (<italic>n</italic> = 8, 1%), 2211 (<italic>n</italic> = 4, 1%), 1111 (<italic>n</italic> = 1, &lt;1%). The Average trajectory group included the following patterns: 1222 (<italic>n</italic> = 191, 36%), 2222 (<italic>n</italic> = 35, 7%), 2112 (<italic>n</italic> = 5, 1%), 2212 (<italic>n</italic> = 1, &lt;1%), and 3322 (<italic>n</italic> = 1, &lt;1%). Last, the High trajectory group included the following patterns: 3333 (<italic>n</italic> = 192, 36%) and 1333 (<italic>n</italic> = 25, 5%). Inspection of the most frequently occurring longitudinal patterns suggests that the most stable patterns (i.e., three or more benchmarks in the same cluster) were the most frequently occurring and that cluster membership was highly stable after the spring of kindergarten benchmark. Frequently occurring longitudinal patterns of cluster membership are displayed graphically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534508411430322">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<p>The mean scores on the TEN-CBM measures by trajectory group are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1534508411430322">Table 4</xref>. Again, the trajectory groups were separated by overall level of performance on the TEN-CBM measures, which was evident at all benchmark assessments. Average scores on the TEN-CBM measures were similarly ordered at all occasions for all trajectory groups, with scores on OC &gt; NI &gt; QD &gt; MN. Of note, the declines in scores from the spring of kindergarten to fall of first-grade benchmarks were either not present (QD) or of smaller percentages of spring of kindergarten scores for the students in the High longitudinal trajectory group. In addition to reflecting overall levels of performance on the TEN-CBM measures, the trajectory groups exhibited similar ordering on spring of first-grade M-CBM and the third-grade ISTEP+ math (see average scores in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1534508411430322">Table 4</xref>).</p>

<p>To determine if the longitudinal trajectory groups differed on first-grade M-CBM and third-grade ISTEP+ math scores, a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was conducted with trajectory group as a between-subjects factor. There were overall differences on M-CBM and ISTEP+ math scaled scores between trajectory groups, Wilks’s λ = .45; <italic>F</italic>(4, 1062) = 128.79, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. In addition, univariate tests indicated that the trajectory groups differed on both first-grade M-CBM, <italic>F</italic>(2, 532) = 78.00, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and third-grade ISTEP+ math scaled scores, <italic>F</italic>(2, 532) = 263.14, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Post hoc tests (i.e., Fisher’s least significant difference) indicated that all pairwise differences between the trajectory groups on M-CBM and ISTEP+ math scaled scores were statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>In addition to the above analyses investigating the statistical significance of differences between the trajectory groups on the continuous M-CBM and third-grade ISTEP+ math scaled scores, a generalized linear model was fit to see if the trajectory groups differed significantly on probabilities of passing the third-grade ISTEP+ math exam (binary: 0 = fail, 1 = pass). This analysis is analogous to a one-way ANOVA, only with a logit link function to account for the binary format of the dependent variable (i.e., passing ISTEP+ math). The model indicated overall differences in pass rates by longitudinal pattern, χ<sup>2</sup>(2) = 63.18, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and post hoc tests indicated that all pairwise comparisons among pass rates for the trajectory groups were statistically significant. Of note, 99.54% of the High longitudinal trajectory group passed the third-grade ISTEP+ math exam.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The primary goals of this study were to determine the relative importance of the individual TEN-CBM measures across kindergarten and first grade in predicting subsequent math performance and to determine longitudinal patterns of performance on the TEN-CBM measures in relation to third-grade state math exam scores. Results indicated that the more complex TEN-CBM measures (MN and QD) were most strongly related to later high-stakes math performance (i.e., ISTEP+ performance), although the measures explained less variance in ISTEP+ math scores across the kindergarten to first-grade benchmarks. Previous research has hypothesized that MN and QD are broader and stronger indicators of overall mathematics knowledge and performance than NI and OC, which have been described as “gateway skills” that enable children to engage in more sophisticated mathematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534508411430322">Clarke et al., 2008</xref>, p. 48). Findings here confirmed this notion.</p>
<p>Overall, students exhibited consistent patterns of performance on the TEN-CBM measures (i.e., lower performance on the more complex measures), and performance on the QD and MN TEN-CBM measures at most benchmarks across kindergarten and first grade indicated the likelihood of passing the third-grade math exam. These results add to prior work exploring the validity of TEN-CBM measures within the early elementary grades by demonstrating that some of the TEN-CBM measures independently predict future risk of math failure in third grade. Of note, the earlier TEN-CBM benchmarks explained more variance in third-grade exam results than later benchmarks, demonstrating the need for early screening.</p>
<p>In looking at longitudinal patterns of performance on TEN-CBM, two groups of children were identified in kindergarten with elevated risk of subsequent state math test failure. At fall of kindergarten, the lowest-performing cluster of students appeared to have limited knowledge of “numbers and operations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534508411430322">Clements, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534508411430322">Gersten &amp; Chard, 1999</xref>), and students who did not improve in this area by spring of kindergarten had stable longitudinal patterns of elevated risk of math failure. Although these students could count orally, they had difficulty identifying numerals and performing more complex operations with numerals, such as the MN and QD tasks most strongly related to subsequent math achievement. Because the patterns of performance found in this study at the end of kindergarten were quite stable over time, evidence suggests that universal screening and intervention in “numbers and operations” is critical during kindergarten.</p>
<p>In further support of universal screening is the heterogeneity of the Low Performing and Average Clusters at fall of kindergarten. Although students classified in the High Performing cluster at fall of kindergarten stayed in the High Performing clusters at spring of kindergarten and subsequent benchmarks, children in the Average and Low Performing Clusters at fall of kindergarten had variable cluster membership at spring of kindergarten. This pattern could, in part, reflect low performance, on average, on the best discriminators of future math performance (MN and QD) for both the Average and Low Performing clusters at fall of kindergarten, suggesting that successful performance on these tasks may be normatively unlikely at this time. For this reason, documenting growth and response to instruction and intervention across kindergarten on MN and QD is particularly important for determining the students most at risk of future math failure. These patterns also highlight the importance of screening and intervention of early numeracy skills prior to kindergarten given that patterns are largely stable beyond spring of kindergarten.</p>
<p>Most students exhibited declines in skills from spring of kindergarten to fall of first-grade benchmarks, and the magnitude of the decrease (in terms of percentage of spring kindergarten scores) was greater for low-achieving students. These findings are largely consistent with results of a meta-analysis on loss of skills during summer vacations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534508411430322">Cooper, Nye, Charlton, Lindsay, &amp; Greathouse, 1996</xref>), which noted that skill loss was more pronounced for math than reading skill and for low-achieving students. The decrease observed for low-achieving students on critical early numeracy assessments may indicate the need for ongoing early numeracy instruction and intervention during the summer months for students who struggle with mathematics.</p>
<p>Last, students tended to perform similarly across the TEN-CBM measures, as evidenced by cluster solutions at the fall and spring benchmark periods that differed primarily in overall level. Specifically, students who performed well on one measure generally performed well on the other TEN-CBM measures, so it may not be necessary to administer all measures to predict future math performance and identify students in need of more intensive instruction. Because of this pattern of performance, the TEN-CBM measures used in this study, which primarily assess “numbers and operations,” may need to be supplemented with assessments targeting additional domains of early math (e.g., geometry, measurement) to determine individual patterns of variability across critical early math constructs that could be useful for intervention design.</p>
<sec id="section18-1534508411430322">
<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>Given that MN and QD most strongly predicted future risk of math failure, it may be more valuable and efficient to administer MN and QD in kindergarten and first grade rather than OC and NI. OC and NI have strong technical adequacy and measure important math skills, but predict later math performance less well. If the goal is to determine if students are on track with mathematical knowledge acquisition, MN and QD are more robust domain samples and are more in line with the notion of general outcome measurement. Similarly, MN and QD might be administered more often to increase reliability of MN and QD slope and prediction.</p>
<p>Because students who were low performing at the beginning of kindergarten tended to be low performing in first grade and third grade, schools need to be implementing universal screening starting in kindergarten. There is theoretical support for implementing universal screening using TEN-CBM measures given that TEN-CBM tasks measure number sense, which is the element of early math most predictive of later success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534508411430322">Mazzocco &amp; Thompson, 2005</xref>). From a practical and evaluative perspective, schools need students to perform proficiently on high stakes assessments. If regular monitoring of student math performance with MN and QD can provide information about which students are on track to successfully perform on a high-stakes assessment of math skill, then that is valuable to the school.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1534508411430322">
<title>Limitations and Future Research</title>
<p>This study has several limitations to consider. First, although the use of data collected by a school as part of routine benchmark assessments increased the feasibility of data collection and possibly generalizability, traditional benchmark practices may not reflect optimal CBM assessment procedures. For example, collecting data on more than one probe per TEN-CBM measure would increase reliability. In addition, schools do not routinely collect data on inter-scorer agreement, which could also affect reliability.</p>
<p>A second, related limitation is that the percentage of missing data was higher than would be preferred at some benchmark assessments and on the third-grade math assessment. This limitation is common to longitudinal studies in schools because of student mobility. This limitation is tempered by using analysis procedures (i.e., multiple imputation) that are less biased than traditional methods such as listwise deletion, and the percentage of available data on all variables provided adequate covariance coverage to conduct the analyses.</p>
<p>Future research in math CBM needs to carefully examine how tools might be developed to assess other domains of early mathematics. Although measures of number sense, which fall within the domain of numbers and operations, are robust predictors of later math performance, the field needs to be cognizant about the breadth of early math and develop measurement tools in accordance. If measures can be developed in the mold of CBM to more comprehensively predict success in the broad domain of mathematics, the result will benefit students and educators. In terms of sample size and predictive validity, this study is one of the most robust to date supporting the use of TEN-CBM. We hope that this study encourages future research and development of measures assessing domains other than number sense for use in early screening and intervention.</p>
