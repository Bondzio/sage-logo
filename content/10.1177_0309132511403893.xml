<p>As I began to type this review, I received a message from an old geography acquaintance I had not seen for some years informing me he had experienced a major illness that had left him with physical impairments. It reminded me just how closely the human experience is linked to disablement; that is, corporeal change and inhibiting response to it. Most of us will experience impairment and thus very likely disablement at some point in our lives, but consider just how absent this pervasive human condition is from the social consciousness, including many domains of social science.</p>
<p>In the past two decades, Human Geography to its credit has produced a powerful stream of engaged work on questions of impairment and disability. The two questions frame and define one of the most pervasive ways in which our humanity, and its utter and irreducible embodiment, is rendered up to social encounter. From the 1960s, the spatiality of disablement was expressed in social struggles around accessibility and mobility; yet this was often more apparent to disabled people than to geographers. Early recognition and innovation came from geographers working with health issues. Evolution and take-up in the decades since means that we can now speak of a discernible field of disability studies in geography.</p>
<p>Many of the leaders in this geography subfield are represented in the volume <italic>Towards Enabling Geographies</italic>, edited by three of its leading contemporary participants. Indeed the book’s list of contributors reads as a roll call of those on active service in the geographies of disability field. It is pleasing to see the inclusion of emerging and early career scholars within this impressive complement. Progress in this still new and unsettling field for geography has often been forced with difficulty by emerging scholars. There are some who doubtless recall the opprobrium visited upon the first geographers to apply social theory not headcounts to the explanation of disablement. At the time (the early 1990s), the move to apply social theory reflected and reported the wider struggles of disabled people themselves to replace medicalized and dehumanizing approaches with a ‘social model’ that located inhibition in societal processes, not individual qualities. Now, as the editors of <italic>Towards Enabling Geographies</italic> point out, the social model has been deepened, and often challenged, by emphases on the lived, and embodied, experience of impairment/disability. This is to resist the reduction of individual experience to social ordination. It is fair to say that the early enthusiasm to embrace a socialized understanding of disablement tended to disembody and bury subjectivity.</p>
<p>The empirical and experiential sweep of this volume is broad and ambitious, taking in physical, intellectual impairment, and the emotional lifeworlds that define and distinguish the experience of disablement. The inclusion of work on chronic illness, ageing, obesity and new biotechnologies broadens the lens of recent inquiry and thus links disablement to the broader and necessary notion of human frailty and the shifting lines of social response. This wider ontological scope recognizes that injury is not the only way the journey of impairment begins. Indeed, for most, it evolves and unfolds, though in often surprising and discomfiting ways. The issue of mental health, which has inspired an allied landscape of geographical research, is not engaged directly in the volume. However, the emerging focus on emotional response to impairment provides a powerful bridge between the geographies of disability and mental health.</p>
<p>The editors' Introduction is a fresh, crisp review of scholarship that has sought a ‘spatial interpretation of disability’. It is vital reading for anyone who wishes to understand how geographers took up the question of disablement over the past three decades. As with other areas of social science, it took time for this early interest to transcend the lures of medicalization and empiricism. The chapters that follow present solid, original geographies of the wider, myriad experience of disablement. In keeping with the editorial commitment to ‘more embodied, geographic understandings of impairment, disability, identity and difference’ the tendency to hypertheorization is restrained. The voices of disabled people resound through the volume. In one moment, personal investment and encounter is marked out movingly by Deborah Metzel. The works speak to policy themes directly, including the important and challenging issues surrounding technology, especially its medicalized forms, which ever threaten to reduce disability to a question of microscopes, scanners, genetic error, and ‘informed choice’.</p>
<p>
<italic>Towards Enabling Geographies</italic> marks an important journey of progress in human geography. The editors are aware of the volume’s exclusions which reflect the formal tidemarks of inquiry in the discipline itself. They note the ‘absence of work by geographers beyond Western and urban contexts' and the limited methodological ambition of much of the spatial analysis of disability. The observation is largely true if one discounts the subterranean stream of postgraduate work that has crossed these frontiers but which has not seen published form. This ‘silence of the new’ of course reflects a wider quietude that will always trouble the mind of progressive science.</p>
