<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is characterized by slow progressive atherosclerosis and arterial thrombotic events, leading to occlusions. Whether either of these presentations is more likely in patients with a genetic predisposition for CVD is still unknown. We suggest that a genetic predisposition for CVD is related to recurrent events of the same nature.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively investigated 275 patients with premature CVD and divided them in two groups according to their first event: an arterial thrombotic event or stable atherosclerosis. We used a Cox proportional-hazards model to estimate the effect of a positive family history for CVD on recurrent events of the same nature. This was tested in the entire cohort and in patients with coronary artery disease only.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Patients with a first arterial thrombotic event and a positive family history had a threefold increased risk for a recurrent event of the same nature, compared to patients with a negative family history (hazard ratio 3.00, 95% confidence interval 1.32–6.81); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). In contrast, a positive family history was not associated with an increased risk for a recurrent stable atherosclerosis (hazard ratio 0.98 (95% confidence interval 0.59–1.63). These findings were similar analysing the patients with coronary artery disease only. Additional adjustments for other risk factors did not change these associations.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Patients with a first premature arterial thrombotic event and a positive family history for CVD have an increased risk for a second event of the same nature. This might be due to unknown hereditary mechanisms leading to recurrent acute events.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1741826711422989" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of death in Western society,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711422989">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711422989">2</xref></sup> is characterized by a combination of slowly evolving plaque formation and acute occlusive thrombotic lesions, leading to tissue damage and complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711422989">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711422989">4</xref></sup> The fact that thrombotic factors are of importance in CVD is sustained by the use of anticoagulant therapeutic agents, which are of major importance treating acute and chronic CVD.</p>
<p>However, the current literature shows that the relationship between thrombophilic disorders and CVD is only modest, with studies finding conflicting results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711422989">5</xref></sup> For instance, the role of factor V Leiden and prothrombin mutations as risk factor for CVD is not defined, with some studies finding positive associations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711422989">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711422989">7</xref></sup> and others do not.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711422989">8</xref></sup> Furthermore, the role of proteins C and S and anti-thrombin is even less defined, with only isolated case reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711422989">9</xref></sup> Therefore, it is still unknown which thrombotic factors are clinically relevant in CVD and a thrombophilia work up is often not considered.</p>
<p>This inconsistency of results might be due to the heterogeneous characteristics of the individuals under investigation, comprising different manifestations of CVD as well as different age groups. Identification of patients with CVD who are more likely to develop thrombotic-related complications is needed and poses a challenge in clinical practice. Such a candidate population may include patients with premature CVD of thrombotic nature and a positive family history for CVD, suggestive of a genetic predisposition leading to a specific thrombotic mechanism. Indeed, it has been suggested that thrombotic factors may play an important role in premature CVD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711422989">10</xref></sup> For instance, premature coronary artery disease (CAD) is associated with increased plasma levels of prothrombotic factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711422989">11</xref></sup> Furthermore, the factor V Leiden mutation shows a positive relation with CVD in the young,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826711422989">12</xref></sup> whereas this is not observed in the elderly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711422989">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>We therefore hypothesized that patients with premature CVD of thrombotic nature and a positive family history for CVD are prone to develop recurrent thrombotic events. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the relationship between a positive family history and recurrent events of the same nature in a retrospective cohort of individuals with premature CVD. Furthermore, to support our epidemiological observation, we analysed in-vitro thrombin generation in a subgroup.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1741826711422989" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<sec id="sec3-1741826711422989"><title>Study patients</title>
<p>All consecutive patients who were referred by general practitioners, cardiologists, neurologists, vascular surgeons or vascular internists to our outpatient clinic specializing in premature CVD in the city of Maastricht, the Netherlands, between January 2001 and January 2008, were identified and retrospectively analysed. All patients referred to our specialized outpatient clinic followed a multidisciplinary approach, which involved a cardiologist, vascular internist, and vascular surgeon. This cohort consisted of 287 patients with premature CVD with cardiac, cerebral, or peripheral artery disease. From this database we retrospectively evaluated the first and recurrent events from the patients’ records. No standard questionnaire was used, but the records were searched for predefined diagnosis made by the referring physician. For all patients we examined the records thoroughly and retrieved data concerning any cardiovascular events. In doubt, the referring physician or the general practitioner was contacted.</p>
<p>Since referral and routine medical care in the city of Maastricht is directed to our hospital, all of the patients were seen on a regular basis in this hospital. Therefore, in most of these patients complete data of the type of first event, follow-up data on the type of recurrent cardiovascular events, family history, presence of traditional risk factors, and medication use at the time of the first event and at the end of the follow-up period were available. We excluded eight patients from the analyses since there was no information about family history. After applying the selection criteria and taken into account other missing data, 275 patients were eligible for the analysis. In this group there was no loss to follow up.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1741826711422989"><title>Definitions</title>
<p>Premature CVD was defined as a premature cardiovascular event occurring before the age of 51 years in men and 56 years in women, according to the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711422989">14</xref></sup> We decided not to use the regular age criteria (≥1 first-degree and/or ≥ 2 second-degree family members with CVD before the age of 55 years in men and 60 years) for premature CVD, but to decrease the age limits, to enrich our cohort for subjects with a genetic predisposition for CVD. This more stringent definition was based on age criteria of incidence curves of CVD, estimating a genetic effect at these various ages, as explained in the GENECARD study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711422989">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711422989">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Patients were divided into two groups according to their first event: either an arterial thrombotic event or a stable atherosclerotic event. An arterial thrombotic event was defined as an acute myocardial infarction (elevation of cardiac biomarkers (troponin or CK-MB) with symptoms of cardiac ischaemia, with or without electrocardiogram changes indicative of ischaemia); an acute arterial occlusion of the upper or lower peripheral arteries, diagnosed by angiography; stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) without any atherosclerotic abnormalities on duplex of the carotid arteries. Stable atherosclerosis was defined as complaints of angina necessitating elective interventions, such as coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary intervention, both defined as planned procedures, without the elevation of cardiac biomarkers; peripheral artery disease necessitating bypass surgery, or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty; stroke or TIA with atherosclerotic abnormalities on duplex of the carotid arteries.</p>
<p>All patients with a stroke or TIA were subjected to cardiac ultrasound examination to exclude a cardiac embolus. Patients with a stroke or TIA but without information of the duplex of the carotid arteries were excluded from the analyses (<italic>n</italic> = 7). Since stroke or TIA can be either diagnosed as an arterial thrombotic occlusion or due to an occlusion by parts of an atherosclerotic plaque, the abnormalities seen on duplex of the carotid arteries were leading. All diagnoses were made according to the American Heart Association criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711422989">19</xref></sup> by the treating physician.</p>
<p>Recurrent events were defined in the same manner as first events. For purposes of analysis, only the first recurrent event experienced by a patient was counted. The time elapsed between first and second event was used in the analyses.</p>
<p>The presence of the traditional risk factors was based on the presence at the time of the first event and their definitions were as follows. Body mass index was calculated as the ratio between weight (kg) and the square of height in metres (kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and diabetes were defined as the use of antihypertensive, anti-cholesterol, or anti-diabetic medication before the first event. We chose this definition because blood pressure data and cholesterol and glucose levels before the start of the first event could not reliably be extracted from the patients’ records. Patients were considered as smokers if they smoked at the time of their first event or quit smoking less than 5 years before. This definition was based on studies showing a normalization of risk and biochemical parameters 5 years after smoking cessation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711422989">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741826711422989">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>All medication use before the first event and at the end of the follow-up period was retrieved from the patients’ records or was assessed via the general practitioner. Hereby, adequate information could be obtained concerning hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, and diabetes before the first event and whether patients were adequately treated at the end of the follow-up period.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1741826711422989"><title>Calibrated automated thrombin generation assays</title>
<p>To confirm our epidemiological observations in the retrospective cohort, we also performed an in-vitro coagulation test. We investigated tissue factor-induced thrombin generation, in a subgroup of patients selected from the initial population and compared this with a control population (total population <italic>n</italic> = 61). The subjects were selected based on the following criteria: patients with a first arterial thrombotic event without any stable atherosclerosis (<italic>n</italic> = 13), patients with stable atherosclerosis without any arterial thrombotic event (<italic>n</italic> = 18), both with a positive family history for CVD, and age- and sex-matched healthy controls (<italic>n</italic> = 30). The control subjects were selected from the laboratory of clinical haematology where their plasma had been used as the normal reference for the routine clinical measurements; these subjects were therefore not allowed to use any medication and, for that matter, had not been diagnosed with hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, or diabetes. Furthermore, none of the subjects were allowed to use warfarin. Blood was drawn in sodium citrate and subjects gave permission to use it for thrombin generation tests. Thrombin generation in plasma (0.32% sodium citrate) was induced with 1.4 pM tissue factor (Dade Innovin Behring, Germany), 30 µM phospholipid vesicles (20/60/20 DOPS/DOPC/DOPE; Avanti Polar Lipids, AL, USA), and 16 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> (final concentrations). To rule out influences of contact activation under these conditions, corn trypsin inhibitor (CTI; 30 µg/ml; Haematologic Technologies, VT, USA) was added as a specific inhibitor for factor XIIa. Thrombin generation in clotting plasma was monitored by conversion of the low affinity fluorogenic substrate I-1140 by thrombin in time on a Fluoroskan Ascent reader (Thermo Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland) with filter sets 390 nm-excitation and 460 nm-emission. Thrombin generation curves and peak heights were calculated using the Thrombinoscope software (Synapse BV, Maastricht, The Netherlands).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741826711422989">22</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1741826711422989"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>For all analyses we used SPSS software, version 16.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Illinois). Continuous data are reported as means ± standard deviation. All <italic>p</italic>-values are two-tailed and values &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p>
<p>We analysed the cohort stratified to the type of first event, which was either an arterial thrombotic event or stable atherosclerosis. We then assessed the differences between patients with and without a positive family history in these groups. Differences were compared using chi-squared analysis in case of proportions and Student's t-tests in case of continuous data.</p>
<p>To estimate the risk of the recurrence of an event of the same nature, we used Cox proportional-hazards regression modelling in patients with either a positive or a negative family history for CVD. Secondly, we performed the same analysis in a subset of patients, excluding all patients with any non-cardiac event. Analysing only the cardiac patients lead to a loss of power, but increased the homogeneity of the population.</p>
<p>Both models were then further adjusted for age and sex (model 2) and for hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia, body mass index at onset of the first event and the use of any medication (aspirin, statins, beta-blockers, and other blood pressure-lowering medication) and smoking at the end of the follow-up period (model 3), and finally, only in the analysis on the total population, we also adjusted for the type of first event (model 4).</p>
<p>We constructed Kaplan Meier cumulative event curves to estimate the risk of a recurrent event of the same nature in patients with either a positive or a negative family history for CVD.</p>

<p>For the entire population, patients with a first arterial thrombotic event and a positive family history for CVD had a threefold increased risk for a second event of the same nature, compared to patients with a negative family history for CVD (hazard ratio (HR), 3.00 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.32–6.81; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; model 1; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741826711422989">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1741826711422989">Figure 1</xref>).

<p>This study shows that a positive family history of premature CVD is of importance for the recurrence of arterial thrombotic events, whereas this effect was not found in stable atherosclerosis. These findings might reflect that premature CVD consists of different disease entities, with different causes and consequences.</p>
<p>It is well established that a positive family history for CVD is predictive for future cardiovascular events in healthy siblings of these patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741826711422989">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741826711422989">25</xref></sup> Also, it was recently shown that a positive family history in patients with premature CVD increases the risk of any recurrent event by 30%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741826711422989">26</xref></sup> In addition to this, we find that this increased risk in patients with premature CVD only holds true when the first event is an arterial thrombotic event, suggesting that a genetic component might be responsible for the specific type of recurrent event. This theory is supported by the finding of higher thrombin generation in patients with arterial thrombotic disease and a positive family history of CVD.</p>
<p>A hereditary predisposition to CVD has also been investigated in several independent genome-wide association studies. These studies successfully identified loci, such as the chr9p21 region, to be associated with both acute myocardial infarctions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741826711422989">27</xref></sup> and stable CAD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741826711422989">28</xref></sup> Other studies contradicted these findings, indicating that chr9p21 was only associated with acute infarctions and not with CAD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741826711422989">29</xref></sup> This was confirmed by Reilly et al., who found a locus to be specifically associated with MI, whereas another locus was only associated with the presence of CAD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741826711422989">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite these promising genome-wide association studies, to date not one single gene is found to be associated with CVD. It seems extremely difficult to pin down which specific gene or genes are responsible for CVD within the observed loci. We believe this is due to the fact that most genetic association studies have not put any effort in thoroughly phenotyping patients and have often included patients who are a single case within their family. In search of genetic disorders, it seems more attractive to investigate extreme-end phenotypes with more affected cases in one family. Our current paper shows that genetic factors might be associated with arterial thrombosis. Whether or not specific cases with CAD might have a genetic background is still unclear.</p>
<p>One of the strengths of our study is that in all analysis, either on the whole 275 patients or on the cardiac patients only, we were able to show similar results. Furthermore, we were able to confirm these results by showing increased thrombin generation in a subgroup of patients with premature arterial thrombotic events and a positive family history.</p>
<p>A potential weakness of our study is its retrospective design. On the other hand, this gave us the opportunity to analyse patients over a longer follow-up time, without the costs and infrastructure necessary to handle prospective cohort studies. Therefore, this study is only hypothesis generating. Besides, the study population of patients with premature CVD is rather rare and therefore less suited for large cohort studies. We have limited our analyses to data which were robust, such as diagnosis made by the referring specialist instead of self-reported diagnosis. Concerning family history, complete information on the specific age when each family member had their first event was available from the patients' records for almost all patients.</p>
<p>In conclusion, patients with a premature arterial thrombotic event and a positive family history for CVD had an increased risk for a second arterial thrombotic event, independent of risk factors, whereas this was not the case for patients with a premature stable atherosclerotic event and a positive family history for CVD. We propose that, within such families, specific prothrombotic mechanisms leading to arterial thrombotic events may be responsible for the premature CVD in these families.</p>
