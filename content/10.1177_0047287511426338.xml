<abstract>
<p>Local arts agencies have entered the local ecology of destination management in the United States as part of the network of organizations seeking to attract cultural tourists. This role has been virtually ignored in both the tourism and the community arts literatures. A national survey of local arts agencies reflects a substantial proportion that report involvement in cultural tourism development. Narrative analysis of descriptions of cultural tourism strategy reveals a range of activities, especially strategic marketing, development of products, and organizational learning through collaborative partnerships. Unexpected among destination management organizations, we learn that local arts agencies are substantially involved in the development of cultural products geared toward facilitating tourism. We propose that future research on destination management should recognize the position and value of local arts agencies in community-level development of cultural tourism.</p>

<p>Twenty-five years ago, the <italic>Journal of Travel Research</italic> published summary research on the activities of state arts agencies and state travel offices related to cultural tourism. Based on surveys from the Travel Industry Association of America, about half of states then reported initiatives to support cultural tourism, a condition that prompted Anthony Tighe to conclude that cooperation in arts and tourism was “active and growing” but also exhibited “much room for growth” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0047287511426338">1986</xref>, p. 5). Despite his call for further research on cultural tourism’s potential in the United States, no other national-level research on the activities of state or community arts agencies regarding cultural tourism development have appeared in the past half-century. Urice makes no reference to tourism in his otherwise thorough <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0047287511426338">1992</xref> description of U.S. state arts agency activities, Mulcahy’s more recent review of state arts agency history and programming makes only one offhanded reference to cultural tourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0047287511426338">2002</xref>, p. 70), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0047287511426338">Lowell’s (2004)</xref> evaluation of state arts agency strategies to encourage participation in arts and culture makes no reference to cultural tourism.</p>
<p>Over this time period, however, the field of tourism studies has developed essential understanding of local and regional development through the efforts of destination management organizations and the transactional networks of community actors interested in tourism development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0047287511426338">Beritelli, Bieger, and Laesser 2007</xref>). Cultural amenities are critical to such development in many communities. However, community arts organization involvement in destination management has been generally overlooked. We mark the silver anniversary of Tighe’s benchmark analysis by returning to the topic of tourism efforts in arts agencies engaged in destination management. However, whereas Tighe considered the role of state arts agencies in cultural tourism development, we investigate how cultural tourism currently plays into the strategies and partnerships of arts agencies at the local level, where most destination management occurs. Our work comes at a time of new interest in the ecology of tourism strategy development at the local level, where partnerships between government, private nonprofits, and destination management organizations are seen as essential in governing tourism development efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0047287511426338">Palmer and Bejou 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0047287511426338">Paskaleva-Shapira 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0047287511426338">Svensson, Nordin, and Flagestad 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The article proceeds in seven parts. The first two outline the state of knowledge of cultural tourism and local arts agencies, respectively. The third section introduces the concept of the ecology of destination management, characterized by the network of actors engaged in destination governance. Recent conceptual development by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0047287511426338">Wang and Xiang (2007)</xref> provides a theoretical basis for mapping the motivations of actors involved in destination marketing. The model is a starting point for documenting the role that local arts agencies currently play in the ecology of destination management across communities in the United States.</p>
<p>A fourth section provides details on data collected for the assessment, as well as the methods used to document cultural tourism programming among local arts agencies. Two analytic sections follow. The fifth section compares destination management activities of local arts agencies, documenting their roles in light of the activities suggested in the Wang and Xiang framework. The sixth section explores different approaches and roles of local arts agencies in the ecology of destination management. Lastly, we discuss the implications, potential, and limitations of the study.</p>
<sec id="section1-0047287511426338">
<title>The Value of Cultural Tourism</title>
<p>Performing and visual arts organizations are common in U.S. communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0047287511426338">Grams and Farrell 2008</xref>). The <italic>cultural sector</italic>, however, includes a broad range of individuals and organizations that create, produce, present, distribute, and preserve cultural and historic goods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0047287511426338">Dewey 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0047287511426338">Wyszomirski 2002</xref>). The sector also includes the promotion of cultural goods and the development of audiences. One prominent strategy of promotion is the attraction of not only residents but also outside visitors to community cultural amenities. Strategy, programming, and marketing to attract visitors to a community based on its cultural offerings is popularly known as <italic>cultural tourism</italic> development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047287511426338">Ivanovic 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Cultural tourism can have broad social value for local communities, such as creativity, resource sustainability, and the development of place identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0047287511426338">Sepe and Trapani 2010</xref>), as well as building of social capital, increased community capacity, and support for other local activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0047287511426338">Moscardo 2008</xref>). However, tourism is also an economic driver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0047287511426338">Ghali 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0047287511426338">Hall and Richards 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0047287511426338">Tyrrell and Johnston 2009</xref>), and efforts to encourage cultural tourism are often motivated by the promise of economic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0047287511426338">Crouch and Ritchie 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0047287511426338">Dziembowska-Kowalska and Funck 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0047287511426338">Scott 2006</xref>). To achieve economic growth, communities must draw outside dollars by attracting shoppers or by creating products and services that can be marketed and sold to outsiders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0047287511426338">Leontief 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0047287511426338">Ranis and Fei 1961</xref>). Strategic tourism development meets this end. Tourists stay in local hotels, eat at local restaurants, buy local goods, and buy tickets to local events and sites, prompting local growth.</p>
<p>Most community leaders understand the economic value of tourism, and many communities take active steps to support and encourage it. Different communities have a variety of assets that can be marketed to special interest travelers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0047287511426338">McKercher and Chan 2005</xref>), but perhaps the most common are cultural amenities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0047287511426338">Mason 2008</xref>). Heritage sites are popular tourist destinations. Not all communities can lay claim to heritage sites, but all have the potential of developing or marketing festivals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0047287511426338">McKercher, Mei, and Tse 2006</xref>), arts performances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0047287511426338">Hughes 2002</xref>), museums (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0047287511426338">Chhabra 2008</xref>), studio tours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0047287511426338">Smith 2009</xref>), and other events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0047287511426338">Getz 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0047287511426338">Moscardo 2008</xref>). Communities also differ in how arts organizations, community arts agencies, and traditional destination management organizations interact in the development and execution of cultural tourism strategies. Elaboration of the current role of local (U.S.) arts agencies in implementing community-level approaches to cultural tourism is the primary motivation for this paper.</p>

<sec id="section2-0047287511426338">
<title>Local Arts Agencies in the Community Tourism Ecology</title>
<p>Arts producers and heritage sites work primarily to please, challenge, and educate their audiences. They must also be financially solvent to remain in business, so they also work to develop their brands and bring in audience members. In focusing on their art and their audiences, these types of community arts organizations do not typically concentrate on community-level outcomes, especially macroeconomic outcomes. Other community organizations seek to fill these needs. Prominent among these is the <italic>local arts agency</italic>, known variously as arts or humanities councils, arts alliances, arts commissions, and other monikers. Their national service organization, Americans for the Arts (formerly the National Assembly of Local Arts Agencies), defines local arts agencies as community organizations that support arts organizations, provide services to artists or arts organizations, or present arts programming to the public. This definition is necessarily general, since local arts agencies perform different functions in different communities. They perform any or all of five functions: cultural programming, grant making, facility management, service to artists and arts organizations, and community cultural planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0047287511426338">Menchaca and Davidson 2010</xref>). Cultural tourism has no obvious place in that list. The national service organization characterizes cultural tourism as a specialty program or partnership opportunity for local arts agencies, with most local arts agencies reporting cultural tourism among its portfolio of responsibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0047287511426338">Menchaca and Davidson 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The question that motivates our research concerns the range of ways that local arts agencies act as destination management organizations through the promotion of cultural tourism. This research question has received peripheral attention in recent scholarship that recognizes how partnerships between a community of actors facilitates cultural tourism strategy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0047287511426338">Svensson, Nordin, and Flagestad (2005</xref>; cf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0047287511426338">Nordin and Svensson 2007</xref>) emphasize public–private partnerships and community networks as necessary governance structures for destination development. Paskaleva-Shapira describes three constituencies as “key”: private sector, public sector, and nonprofit organizations, including citizen groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0047287511426338">2007</xref>, p. 110). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0047287511426338">Simpson (2008</xref>, p. 2) replaces citizen group with “community,” but similarly labels the four actors as “key stakeholders” in tourism initiatives aimed at benefitting local communities. We describe this attention as <italic>peripheral</italic> since it tends to recognize the value of nonprofit and governmental bodies in abstract terms but does not recognize the role of local arts agencies, specifically, in cultural tourism development or destination management. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0047287511426338">Mason (2008)</xref> makes no mention of arts agencies in his chapter on key players in tourism planning and management, and arts organizations are not specifically cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0047287511426338">Fyall and Garrod’s (2005)</xref> monograph on collaborative tourism marketing. In short, they are mostly invisible in the tourism literature.</p>
<p>Even in the community arts and arts management literatures, descriptions of the role that local arts agencies play in community development, and especially cultural tourism, are sparse. A notable exception is an 11-city study of arts sectors and systems of support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0047287511426338">McCarthy, Ondaatje, and Novak 2007</xref>) that considers both urban arts agencies’ programming and their integration into community-level strategic development of tourism. That monograph makes three observations that are particularly instructive for our current study. One, in some cities, the arts agency plays the lead role in destination management. The study cites Chicago and recent reorganizations in Baltimore and Boston where the city arts agency plays the lead role in destination management, housing the city’s tourism development operations. Two, consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0047287511426338">Paskaleva-Shapira’s (2007)</xref> observation about city tourism management in Europe, McCarthy and colleagues note uneven adoption of cultural tourism promotion across cities. Chicago’s Department of Cultural Affairs is listed as an exemplar, Pittsburgh as not yet attaining “higher-profile status,” and Cleveland, Detroit, and Philadelphia as weak, lacking a city arts agency, and showing “few signs of a concerted attempt among groups to stress economic development in their arts investment” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0047287511426338">McCarthy, Ondaatje, and Novak 2007</xref>, p. 55).</p>
<p>The third insight comes in the form of a recommendation to stakeholders in Philadelphia. Not surprisingly, the study suggests that the city establish a local arts agency. More instructively, however, the study further suggests that that agency be given broad purview over a range of functions, including tourism development, as part of a policy of integrating city arts activities with its broader economic development activities. This recommendation, already implemented in Chicago, since implemented in Philadelphia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0047287511426338">City of Philadelphia 2011</xref>), and gaining acceptance in many smaller cities around the country, heralds an emerging recognition of how arts agencies and a range of other community actors might work together to provide leadership for the promotion of cultural tourism. Our work seeks to build on this budding recognition of how an ecology of community actors create and execute strategy concerning cultural tourism, with special attention to the role that local arts agencies play in this process. To the extent that local arts agencies are, or are becoming, important actors in destination management, they should be recognized as a central collaborator in the milieu of cultural tourism development.</p>

<title>The Ecology of Destination Management</title>
<p>The literature on destination management has tended to focus either on the nature of collaboration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0047287511426338">Palmer and Bejou 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0047287511426338">Selin 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0047287511426338">Wang and Krakover 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0047287511426338">Watkins and Bell 2002</xref>) or specifically on strategic marketing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0047287511426338">Baker and Cameron 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0047287511426338">Pike 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0047287511426338">Wang 2008</xref>). However, destination management may fall to single organizations, especially in smaller communities, where collaborative destination management has less meaning. Also, despite the centrality of marketing, destination management frequently includes a broader array of strategy, including fostering of cultural products, advocacy and lobbying for policies that facilitate cultural tourism, and long-term cultural and community planning. An assessment of the role that local arts agencies play in destination management requires a theoretical lens that maps their range of activities beyond collaboration and marketing.</p>
<p>The beginnings of such a lens is found in the model developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0047287511426338">Wang and Xiang (2007)</xref>, which compiles a range of macro-organizational theory into a conceptual framework of destination marketing alliance formation. The full model considers the preconditions, motivations, process, and outcomes of alliance formation. The section of the model that frames our work is presented by Wang and Xiang as the motivation for entering alliances. They offer three motivations: strategy, including the desire to expand markets and develop products; efficiency, based on a desire to economize on transaction costs; and learning, premised on a desire to expand capabilities and broaden the organizational knowledge base. We propose that this theoretical framework might be conceptualized alternatively as the range of activities in which destination management organizations collectively engage. That is, the fully functioning local ecology includes one or more organizations that cover the range of motivations: strategic programming, efficient operations, and organizational learning. Such a conceptualization provides the dimensions necessary to assess the ecologies of specific communities. More relevant to the aims of our work, it provides the lens through which we can assess the contributions that local arts agencies make to destination management across the United States.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0047287511426338">Wang and Xiang (2007)</xref> propose that destination management features two principal <italic>strategy</italic> outcomes: expansion of markets and development of products. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0047287511426338">Figure 1</xref>, expansion of the market is principally achieved through marketing. Product development, on the other hand, is described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0047287511426338">Porter (1998)</xref> as the creation of offerings perceived industry-wide as being unique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0047287511426338">Buhalis 2000</xref>). Efficiency of transactions receives equal weight, but much less description in the Wang and Xiang treatment. They contend that organizations entering destination management alliances must economize on <italic>transaction costs</italic> as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0047287511426338">Williamson (1985)</xref>. Third, Wang and Xiang emphasize the necessity for destination management organizations to expand capabilities and broaden the collective knowledge base through openness to <italic>learning</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0047287511426338">Dredge (2006)</xref> characterizes learning, creativity, and innovation as essential to destination management policy and decision-making processes. We approach our description of the place of local arts agencies in the ecology of destination management with these three equally weighted constructs at hand.</p>

<title>Data and Method</title>
<p>Data for our study are narratives collected from U.S. local arts agencies regarding their cultural tourism programming and alliances. Selection of cases proceeded through two stages. The first stage derived from survey data collected and shared by Americans for the Arts, the national professional organization for local arts agencies in the United States. They maintain a database of approximately 3,500 organizations that reasonably represent the population of formalized local arts agencies in the United States. In early 2010, Americans for the Arts emailed a short survey to the 2,300 organizations for which they had an email address. After two months, they mailed a paper version to those organizations for which they had no initial email address, as well as to email nonrespondents. Following reminder emails and postcards, they received responses from 953 organizations that met their definition of a local arts agency.</p>
<p>Out of 953 respondents, 605 checked a box indicating that their local arts agency is currently working on or involved in a partnership in the promotion of cultural tourism. The second stage of case selection occurred in late 2010, when we re-contacted all of these agencies (605) by email, reminded them of the first stage survey, declared a research collaboration with Americans for the Arts, and asked respondents to elaborate on their cultural tourism activities. The email was directed to the individual who had filled out the initial survey on behalf of the local arts agency. Our email query was designed to prompt a focused narrative description of cultural tourism programming from these spokespeople. Specifically, we asked organizational representatives “what cultural tourism programming the local arts agency is engaged in.” As a further prompt, we encouraged respondents to particularly describe “strategic partnership roles, such as with a local tourism agency.” The goal of this second-stage sample is not to draw conclusions about the representative distribution of cultural tourism activities in local arts agencies. Rather, the responses from 117 agencies in 38 states illustrate the range of ways that local arts agencies approach cultural tourism as destination management organizations in their local communities.</p>
<p>The resulting narratives are the building blocks for our analysis. The two authors collaboratively identified 270 action units related to cultural tourism in the 117 cases, an average of 2.3 actions per organization. A given case provided as many action units as was indicated in its narrative description, with some only describing one action, and one describing as many as eight.</p>
<p>Many action units were similar across cases. With the Wang and Xiang as a backdrop, we coded the narrative action units into emergent categories (illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0047287511426338">Table 1</xref>). We began with several cases, noting how cultural tourism activities were described across cases, and creating initial categories. Each additional case then either solidified a coding category, altered it, or suggested a new one. We progressed through the 270 action units, deriving 30 categories of action. Many categories were idiosyncratic, such as one local arts agency that solicited photographs from tourists for temporary exhibitions. We combined small cells with broader categories or deleted outliers to arrive at 21 reasonably distinct categories of action, such as creation of a cultural district and networking with local businesses. These categories provide the basis for the following two summary analyses of how local arts agencies contribute to the local ecology of destination management.</p>

<title>Distribution of Destination Management Actions by Local Arts Agencies</title>
<sec id="section6-0047287511426338">
<title>Strategy</title>
<p>By far, the most common destination management action employed by the local arts agencies we studied is marketing of cultural products to prospective audiences. Slightly more than half of the cases (60) reported marketing of cultural products for tourism purposes. Methods include the production or distribution of brochures and public art guides, maintenance of informative websites, radio advertising, and highway signage. Local arts agencies described both collaborative destination marketing as well as their solo efforts to act as community agents for the promotion of cultural tourism. Marketing occupies a clear space in the Wang and Xiang framework. It is the one category of codes that describes the strategy of market expansion. In the ecology of destination management, local arts agencies are substantially involved in the marketing of cultural amenities.</p>
<p>The other strategy dimension offered by Wang and Xiang is the development of products. Here, too, local arts agencies report prominent strategic involvement in this dimension of destination management. However, whereas marketing is our sole description of market expansion, we coded seven distinct categories of action units into the broad category of product development. Among these categories, the most common (8 cases) are local arts agencies that describe a generalized support of local cultural events, such as festivals produced by other community actors. Other product development strategies are more direct, including distribution of grants to organizations with cultural tourism aims (8 cases) or for public art programs (7). Several local arts agencies (7) report their responsibility for distributing taxes collected for tourism development to community arts organizations; others report responsibility for tax revenues collected for the production of art (5). Other examples bring the number of action units describing product development to 41, less prominent than marketing but still a substantial representation of activity in the ecology of local destination management.</p>
<p>Our coding of narratives revealed a substantial category of strategy that is neither market expansion nor product development, so is absent from the Wang and Xiang framework. We name this category “delivery of product.” We observe that a substantial number of local arts agencies are involved in the production, presentation, or delivery of cultural products geared toward attracting tourists. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0047287511426338">Palmer (2002)</xref> encourages the distinction between delivery and development of product, noting that marketing cooperatives should be distinguished from producer cooperatives, even when producers have also taken on a marketing role. The absence of product delivery might be explained by a relative absence of product delivery in traditional destination management organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0047287511426338">Pike 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0047287511426338">Tkaczynski, Rundle-Thiele, and Beaumont 2010</xref>). For local arts agencies operating in destination management, however, direct delivery of product is vital. Among the organizations we studied, the most common cultural tourism production mechanism is the festival (22), followed by other events (11) and the creation of studio tours (10). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0047287511426338">Smith (2009)</xref> describes “open studio events” as artists opening their workplaces at a specific time, open for public tour, advertised by a collaborative. Our study of local arts agencies reveals not only that these organizations frequently serve as the collaborative that develops and organizes the tours, but also that the agencies conceive of this production as cultural tourism development. Less frequent production strategies such as the maintenance of arts centers or galleries add to 56 occurrences of action units coded as product delivery strategy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0047287511426338">
<title>Transaction Costs</title>
<p>After strategy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0047287511426338">Wang and Xiang (2007)</xref> give equal consideration to transaction costs in organizational decisions to engage in destination management. We learn from our narrative analysis that local arts agencies do not typically describe their cultural tourism activities and collaborations in terms of transaction efficiencies or economies of scale. Whereas local arts agencies appear relatively unique in their focus on the delivery of products, perhaps the lack of a transaction cost orientation likewise reflects a distinctive trait of this particular brand of destination management organization. Or, perhaps our narrative prompts did not gear respondents to describe this particular aspect of their work. Whatever the case, we observe only three instances of action units that might fall under Wang and Xiang’s description of the transaction cost orientation. Distinct from production or marketing partnerships, they include network relationships aimed at joint value maximization as a dimension of transaction cost efficiency. Our three narrative cases note the value of networks with local businesses as a component of cultural tourism development, where both local businesses and the broader community benefit from the exchange.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0047287511426338">
<title>Organizational Learning</title>
<p>On the other hand, our research validates and reinforces the learning orientation described by Wang and Xiang. Of our 270 action units, more than one-third (99) describe an expansion of capabilities stemming from partnerships with other community organizations engaged in local cultural tourism development. The most common is destination management partnerships with a convention and visitors bureau (52), followed closely by partnerships with a variety of other community organizations interested in destination management (41). Less common is a specific relationship with local (usually county) economic development agencies (6). These descriptions of capability expansions through local partnerships point to substantial involvement of local arts agencies in the broader ecology of destination management. Local arts agencies are both able to expand their cultural tourism development capabilities and learn from the actions and competencies of these partner organizations.</p>
<p>Engagement in partnerships arguably spans the second dimension of learning in the Wang and Xiang framework, the broadening of the knowledge base. Clearly, information is shared through partnerships, blurring the boundaries between these learning objectives. However, we uncovered one category that properly reflects learning through the broadening of knowledge that does not entail the expansion of capabilities: meetings with local tourism agencies. We include this category and its four cases in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0047287511426338">Figure 2</xref>, but note the conceptual overlap between partnerships and the broadening of knowledge.</p>

</fig>
<p>As we found with product delivery as an undertheorized dimension of strategy, we also observe a new category of action in local arts agencies absent in the Wang and Xiang conception of the learning orientation. Specifically, we obtained descriptions from seven local arts agencies that included specific references to cultural planning, or broad regional planning that involved the arts, in their cultural tourism development efforts. We include this under the learning orientation because it involves the collection of information and diverse perspectives in long-term planning for the community. We suggest it as either a refinement to the Wang and Xiang lens, or a uniqueness in local arts agency approaches to cultural tourism development and local destination management.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0047287511426338">Figure 2</xref> both illustrates our findings for local arts agencies and suggests specific refinements to the framework. The sizes of category boxes reflect the relative importance of categories, as found through the coding of narrative descriptions provided by subject organizations. The transaction cost orientation shows a diminished role of local arts agencies in the destination management ecology. The delivery of products and long-term planning suggest new dimensions of strategy and learning, respectively. We return to these observations in the conclusions.</p>

<title>Approaches to Destination Management by Local Arts Agencies</title>
<p>The foregoing analysis described the range of practices that local arts agencies use in cultural tourism programming. Next, we consider how these activities are practiced together, with an aim of describing both typical and unique contributions. In addition, we aim to demonstrate empirically whether new categories of product delivery and long-term planning are central to cultural tourism programming, and the extent to which our single measure of transaction costs justifies consideration in our final description of local arts agencies in the destination management ecology.</p>
<p>We cluster our practice categories, generating groupings of local arts agencies based on the extent to which activities are practiced together. We may learn that marketing and collaboration characterize the entirety of destination management among local arts agencies, with other practices sprinkled idiosyncratically among outlier organizations. Or, the analysis may demonstrate a richer array of modes by which local arts agencies cultivate cultural tourism.</p>
<p>Cluster formation is a function of the seven categories in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0047287511426338">Figure 2</xref>: Expansion of market, development of products, delivery of products, networking with businesses, expansion of capabilities, broadening of knowledge, and long-term planning. We employed the <italic>k</italic>-means clustering method. We inspected a three-cluster solution and judged it as too crude, not providing a definitive judgment on the roles of product delivery and long-term planning in the uniqueness of local arts agency destination management. We inspected a five-cluster solution and found two clusters to be substantially similar, leading to adoption of a four-cluster solution.</p>
<p>The solution is represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0047287511426338">Figure 3</xref>. Cluster 1 represents local arts agencies as part of a collaborative marketing enterprise, described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0047287511426338">Fyall and Garrod (2005)</xref> and others as a traditional destination management form. However, this is not the most common form adopted by local arts agencies. Cluster 2 is larger, 54 cases compared to only 38 in cluster 1, indicating that the strategy of product delivery is more prominent in local arts agency cultural tourism development than marketing. The cluster also underscores the value of product delivery as a conceptual category missing from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0047287511426338">Wang and Xiang (2007)</xref> framework.</p>

</fig>
<p>Cluster 3 is small, representing only three cases. However, it nonetheless demonstrates a unique approach to destination management among local arts agencies. Like the organizations in cluster 1, they emphasize marketing as a primary strategy. However, unlike cluster 1, these organizations rely on meetings (broadening of knowledge base) rather than partnerships for their organizational learning, and further supplement learning by participating in long-term community planning related to cultural tourism development. Cluster 4 is unique in that its organizations rely solely on strategy, employing few to none of the learning orientations described by Wang and Xiang. Their strategy is also unique to the four clusters: they emphasize the development and sponsorship of products at the local level rather than marketing or the creation of products.</p>
<p>Notably, none of the clusters emphasize networking with businesses, our sole category representing the transaction cost orientation. The value of this category can be quantified by tests of how much each variable contributes to cluster formation, as reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0047287511426338">Table 2</xref>. The size of the <italic>F</italic> statistic is useful for identifying categories that contribute to the clustering, as well as those that differ little across the clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0047287511426338">Sung 2004</xref>). According to this standard, the strategic orientation categories contribute the most to the definition of the clusters, with <italic>F</italic> values of 41.83, 24.67, and 36.12. Although the learning orientation category of expansion of capabilities has the most cases numerically (99), its <italic>F</italic> value is comparatively lower, indicating that expansions of capabilities stemming from partnerships with local tourism and economic development agencies is ubiquitous, contributing somewhat less to the definition of the clusters. The small-<italic>n</italic> category of long-term planning (7 cases) contributes the least of the organizational learning categories toward cluster definition. However, the high cluster center value in cluster 3, as well as the significance value for the <italic>F</italic> statistic, lends credence to its value in defining both important and unique approaches to cultural tourism development among local arts agencies.</p>

<p>On the other hand, networking with business contributes little to cluster formation. Only three cases in our analysis report this orientation. However, rather than defining a unique approach to destination management, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0047287511426338">Table 2</xref> indicates that networking with business (low <italic>F</italic>, nonsignificant) is spread across other approaches that better define the state of the practice among these kinds of organizations.</p>

<sec id="section10-0047287511426338" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In 1965, arts agencies were rare in the United States. Seven states had identifiable arts agencies, and local arts agencies numbered less than 100 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0047287511426338">Wyszomirski and Mulcahy 1995</xref>). Since then, all states have adopted the form, and most localities of any size have at least one local arts agency. Mulcahy describes these agencies as an “extensive intergovernmental system for administering support for the arts and distributing artistic benefits to the public” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0047287511426338">2002</xref>, p. 75). Arts agencies play a major role in destination management in some communities. This identification is generally absent from both the tourism literature’s research on destination management and the arts management literature’s research on community-level functions of arts and umbrella organizations. The primary contribution of our work is its suggestion that local arts agencies are an identifiable player in the ecology of destination management in many communities.</p>
<p>The role of local arts agencies is clearly evolving and emerging, but in the direction of a greater role in destination management. As illustrated by our narrative analysis, local arts agencies stress two features that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0047287511426338">Wang and Xiang (2007)</xref> identify as necessary for effective contributions to cultural tourism development: strategy and organizational learning.</p>
<p><italic>Strategy</italic> manifests as marketing of cultural products, but also as involvement in the delivery and development of products. Local arts agencies, other content providers, historic events, or nature provide the cultural amenities, landmarks, wildlife, sports, shopping, or beaches that tourists might enjoy. However, tourists do not visit if they do not know about those attractions. Marketing by providers, or by destination management organizations, plays at least some role in bringing tourists to the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0047287511426338">Govers, Go, and Kumar 2007</xref>). Tourism marketing scholarship frequently recognizes the advantages afforded by collaboration with a broad range of community actors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0047287511426338">Palmer and Bejou (1995)</xref> term these “marketing alliances” and evoke the same public–private partnerships that others describe. That is, they suggest alliances with and between convention and visitors bureaus, local governments, and chambers of commerce but not local arts agencies, or even arts producers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047287511426338">Kolb (2006</xref>, p. 58; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0047287511426338">Kantanen and Tikkanen 2006</xref>) extends the “stakeholders” list to “nonprofit organizations” such as museums, theaters, and performing arts centers, but likewise makes no reference to arts intermediaries, like local arts agencies, that are commonly involved in marketing for cultural tourism.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, local arts agencies play a clear role in destination marketing, at least in some communities and cities. They concentrate on the programming and activities of arts and cultural organizations, building relationships through advocacy, grant making, and a common purpose. From this position, they are primed to gather and share marketing information. Many cases in our narrative analysis described their marketing efforts in terms of online calendars that residents and tourists alike can tap for information on cultural offerings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0047287511426338">Tighe (1986)</xref> originally listed calendars and brochures, and general publicity campaigns, as the two most common tourism strategies of state arts agencies. Local arts agencies serve as a central node for marketing their constituent arts producers. However, they often do so as part of an overall strategy of marketing their broader community for purposes of cultural tourism.</p>
<p>Among the cultural tourism marketing strategies that we coded in our narrative analysis, <italic>marketing</italic> was the most common. It was also a central strategy of two of the four clusters of local arts agencies engaged in cultural tourism. However, consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0047287511426338">Govers, Go, and Kumar (2007)</xref>, marketing is not the only strategy that defines the diversity of approaches to destination management. In a plurality of cases, strategy manifests as product delivery, including direct involvement in festivals, events, and open studio tours. In a substantial number of other cases, the development of product defines the local arts agency’s approach to destination management, adding to the strategic dimension of the framework offered by Wang and Xiang. In addition, the prominence of delivery and development of product reinforces our contention that destination <italic>management</italic> better captures the range of tourism development activity than the more restrictive destination <italic>marketing</italic>.</p>
<p>Second, local arts agencies are substantially represented in Wang and Xiang’s <italic>organizational learning</italic> dimension. Although we uncover planning as an underrecognized area of destination management and find evidence of efforts to broaden the organizational knowledge base, the most prominent dimension of organizational learning comes from destination management ecology participation through <italic>collaboration with other organizations</italic>. These partnerships often include destination management organizations, but sometimes that local arts agency <italic>is</italic> the destination management organization. Partnerships are common in marketing efforts but are not limited to that. Local arts agencies often described interlocking directorates, where their leaders sat on tourism councils, or where tourism leaders sat on arts agency boards or committees. These relationships create tight bonds between the arts councils and tourism development, contributing to learning on both sides.</p>
<p>The clustering procedure reveals the expansion of capabilities through partnerships as a defining characteristic of cultural tourism development among local arts agencies. However, the clustering also reveals that learning is not always present, or at least not always described as part of destination management activity. In some cases, strategy alone, in activities such as the support of local events or the administration of taxes earmarked for tourism development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047287511426338">Kato, Kwak, and Mak 2011</xref>), describes the full range of cultural development programming in local arts agencies.</p>
<p>Like any study, ours has limitations. One is that it describes a single case, community arts organization destination management in the United States, while cultural tourism is prominent in localities around the world. Since countries differ in how they fund and otherwise support cultural amenities, it should be seen as a study of the United States alone. However, for communities both inside and outside the United States that do not employ the local arts agency in destination management, it stands as a model for the potential of incorporating such organizations into the milieu of cultural tourism development.</p>
<p>Secondly, our interviews are short narrative responses to simple questions. While this approach maximizes participation and facilitated our desire to focus on the central elements of cultural tourism activities, it belies the complexity of destination management in some communities. Also, our simple narrative prompts very possibly lead to an underrepresentation of the extent to which organizations are concerned with <italic>efficiency</italic> or <italic>economies of scale</italic>. We conclude from our data analysis that the transaction cost orientation receives too much prominence in the Wang and Xiang framework, at least for local arts agencies. However, we may just as well have overlooked evidence of the transaction cost orientation by selecting our particular prompts and questions.</p>
<p>Third, our analysis, as well as the literature on destination management more generally, suffers from a lack of cogent theoretical framing that portrays the ecology of organizations involved in tourism development. We engage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0047287511426338">Wang and Xiang (2007)</xref> in framing our analysis, although their framework focuses on collaboration and marketing, whereas our situation includes some organizations acting alone, or in management situations that do not include marketing. Wang and Xiang couch strategy, transaction costs, and learning in terms of motivations for alliance formation, whereas we are interested in a broader understanding of the ecology of destination management. Given these disjunctions, we hesitate to represent <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0047287511426338">Figure 2</xref> as an elaboration or extension of the Wang and Xiang framework. Rather, we conceive of the Wang and Xiang framework as merely orienting, providing a basis for our independent notions of how strategy and learning manifest in the local arts agencies engaged in cultural tourism programming.</p>
<p>We see two new developments in the coming years. One, both the tourism and the arts management literature will recognize the role of arts intermediaries, especially local arts agencies in the community ecology of destination management. Our review of the literature has highlighted two themes in the tourism literature: partnerships and organizational learning are vital to the strategic development of cultural tourism, and local arts agencies are conspicuously absent from research and discussion of this milieu. We suggest that future formulations consider the role, and even the potential centrality, of local arts agencies in cultural tourism.</p>
<p>Second, we expect that local arts agency participation in cultural tourism will continue to evolve and expand (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0047287511426338">Hager and Sung 2011</xref>). Above, we mention several historical points of reference in the evolution of local arts agencies, from their infancy in the mid-1960s, to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0047287511426338">Tighe’s (1986)</xref> “active and growing” movement in cultural tourism among state arts agencies. By 2007, McCarthy, Ondaatje, and Novak described both exemplary and weak examples of city arts agency sponsorship of cultural tourism, with plenty of examples of each. Collected in 2010, our data on a broader sample of both small and large local arts agencies displays a similar range, from heavy, purposeful participation in destination management to no involvement at all. We contend that maturity of the field’s involvement in cultural tourism programming has not fully run its course. As in any organizational form, strategies diffuse from organization to organization as agencies read trade publications, attend trade association meetings, and work with trade consultants. Participation of local arts agencies in the local ecology of tourism development is a natural extension of their mission to support arts organizations and present arts programming to the public. In some cases, they are a key stakeholder or purveyor of local destination management. Our work paints a substantial development of arts agencies in cultural tourism programming compared to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0047287511426338">Tighe’s (1986)</xref> benchmark descriptions. When our work celebrates its own silver anniversary, we anticipate that local arts agencies will have solidified their central role in destination management, both in the ecology of local communities and in how the ecology is described in the tourism, arts management, and community development literatures.</p>
