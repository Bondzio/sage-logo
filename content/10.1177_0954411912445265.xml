<abstract>
<p>Cross-linked polyethylene has been introduced into total joint replacement to improve wear resistance. Although the performance of highly cross-linked polyethylene is well documented clinically and experimentally for total hip replacements, the reduction in mechanical properties with increasing irradiation is of concern for application to total knee replacement. The aim of this study was to investigate the wear performance of a moderately cross-linked polyethylene material in a fixed-bearing total knee replacement. The study was conducted using two femoral geometries, a conventional cruciate-retaining femoral and a high-flexion femoral geometry. The femoral geometry appeared to have no effect on the wear of the knee replacement under standard gait conditions. A significant reduction in wear volume was measured with the moderately cross-linked polyethylene compared with the conventional polyethylene over a six-million-cycle wear study. This study indicates the use of a moderately cross-linked polyethylene in a fixed-bearing total knee replacement may provide a low wearing option for total knee replacement.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Polyethylene wear in total joint replacement continues to be one of the principal factors influencing the clinical success of an implant. Historical failure in total knee replacement was often owing to oxidative degradation of the material resulting in fatigue failure and delamination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912445265">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411912445265">3</xref></sup> Improvements in design, material and sterilisation procedure have resulted in more oxidatively stable polyethylene materials, with good clinical results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411912445265">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912445265">6</xref></sup> Despite these significant improvements in material performance and reduction in early failures, concerns remain about the surface wear of the polyethylene material and osteolysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411912445265">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411912445265">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Cross-linked polyethylene material has been introduced to total joint replacement to reduce the volumetric wear. Cross-links within the polyethylene material may be created through several processes; however, the most common route is through irradiation. The level of cross-linkage may be controlled by the irradiation dosage, such that a moderately cross-linked polyethylene would be irradiated at approximately 4–6 MRad, and a highly cross-linked material may be irradiated at a dosage of approximately 8–10 MRad. In the total hip replacement, use of highly cross-linked polyethylene has been demonstrated to significantly reduce wear rates <italic>in-vitro</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411912445265">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411912445265">11</xref></sup> and these advantages have also been demonstrated clinically at short- to mid-term follow up.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411912445265">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411912445265">13</xref></sup> However, few studies have published wear performance of cross-linked polyethylene for total knee replacement, and there is little clinical data detailing the performance of cross-linked polyethylene in the knee. The wear simulator studies have tended to focus upon highly cross-linked polyethylene; however, there are concerns that the reduction in mechanical properties with an increasing irradiation dose makes highly cross-linked polyethylene an unsuitable bearing material for total knee replacement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411912445265">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411912445265">15</xref></sup> The translation and rotation experienced in a total knee replacement makes it more susceptible to fracture failure modes, therefore, the mechanical properties of the material are very important in terms of preventing fatigue failure. Indeed, clinical incidence of cracking at the edge and rim of highly cross-linked polyethylene cups further raises concerns regarding its suitability as a bearing material for total knee replacement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411912445265">16</xref></sup> A study investigating the radiation dose effects on the wear and mechanical properties of cross-linked polyethylene demonstrated an approximately linear increase in wear resistance with increasing radiation dose; however, there was a significant reduction in mechanical properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411912445265">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>In younger, more active patients, the need to reduce volumetric wear, and hence reduce potential for osteolysis, is a significant factor to allow patients to resume a normal, active lifestyle. In addition to increasing the osteolysis-free lifetime of a total knee replacement, younger patients also tend to want greater functionality from their prosthesis, including a large range of motion. Recent total knee replacement designs have included modifications to the polyethylene insert and/or the femoral bearing to allow a more natural and higher range of motion for high flexion activities, such as stair climbing and squatting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954411912445265">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954411912445265">19</xref></sup> Clinical outcomes to date present a mixed result, with some studies indicating a significant improvement in range of motion with high-flexion knee designs compared with conventional knees,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954411912445265">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954411912445265">21</xref></sup> whereas some show no significant advantage compared with the conventional knee.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954411912445265">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to compare the wear performance of a moderately cross-linked ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene with a conventional gamma-sterilised in vacuum foil polyethylene in a fixed-bearing knee configuration. In addition, the effect of femoral design on the wear performance of the cross-linked material was examined, comparing a conventional cruciate-retaining femoral bearing with a bearing designed for high flexion activities.</p>

<title>Materials</title>
<p>The wear of the fixed-bearing total knee replacement was investigated using two different femoral geometries and two polyethylene insert materials (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954411912445265">Table 1</xref>), and compared with historic data from our laboratories.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954411912445265">23</xref></sup> The historic studies were conducted on the same simulator under identical test conditions, and wear measurement assessed using identical methods. Both femoral geometries are commercially available bearings in current clinical use, the Sigma Cruciate Retaining design (DePuy International, UK) and the Sigma CR150 Cruciate Retaining design (DePuy International, UK), a femoral bearing that has been designed for high-flexion performance. Both femoral bearings were manufactured from the same Co–Cr–Mo alloy. The polyethylene inserts were clipped into identical polished cobalt chrome trays. Tests were conducted with GUR1020 ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) inserts, which had been sterilised in foil pouches by gamma-irradiation (2.5–4 MRad) in a vacuum (GVF<sup>TM</sup> material), and with a moderately cross-linked GUR1020 UHMWPE (5 MRad irradiated and remelted) insert (XLK<sup>TM</sup> material).</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Three studies were conducted using the Leeds ProSim six station force/displacement controlled knee simulator<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954411912445265">24</xref></sup> (Simulator Solutions, UK). Each station had six-degrees-of-freedom with four controlled axes of motion – axial load, femoral flexion, tibial internal/external (IE) rotation and tibial anterior–posterior (AP) displacement. The femoral axis loading (maximum 2600 N) and extension–flexion (0°–58°) input profiles were taken from ISO 14243-3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954411912445265">25</xref></sup> for all testing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411912445265">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The IE tibial rotation was displacement controlled and set at ±5° based on the natural kinematics of the knee as described by Lafortune et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0954411912445265">26</xref></sup> AP translation was displacement controlled for all three studies, as these designs have minimal constraints, and thus rely on soft tissue <italic>in-vivo.</italic> Two displacement test conditions were used during each test; intermediate kinematics with an AP displacement of 0–5 mm, and high kinematics with an AP displacement of 0–10 mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954411912445265">27</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411912445265">Figure 2</xref>). Abduction/adduction was allowed but not controlled. Six sets of bearings were tested for each design and material, mounted anatomically in each station. The central axis of each implant was offset from the aligned axes of applied load and tibial rotation from the centre of the joint by 7% of its width, in accordance with ISO 14243-1, to replicate a right knee. In order to eliminate station-specific differences, the samples were moved around the stations every million cycles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954411912445265">24</xref></sup></p>

<p>The bearings were tested for 3 Mc (million cycles) under intermediate kinematics, followed by 3 Mc under high kinematic conditions. The simulator was run at a frequency of 1 Hz. The lubricant used was newborn calf serum, diluted to 25%, supplemented with 0.03% (v/v) sodium azide to retard bacterial growth, and was changed every 0.33 Mc. Prior to testing, all inserts were soaked in deionised water for a period of four weeks. This allowed an equilibrated fluid absorption level to be achieved prior to the commencement of the wear study, reducing variability owing to fluid weight gain at the start of the wear study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954411912445265">24</xref></sup> Wear was determined gravimetrically through measurements of the inserts following the four-week soak period, and at measurement intervals throughout the study. A Mettler AT201 (Mettler–Toledo, USA) digital microbalance, which had a resolution of 0.01 mg, was used for weighing the bearing inserts. The volumetric wear was calculated from the weight loss measurements, using a density of 0.934 mg/mm<sup>3</sup> for both polyethylene materials, using unloaded soak controls to compensate for moisture uptake. The soak control samples were immersed in 25% bovine serum, as prepared for the test samples, and this serum was also changed every 0.33 Mc.</p>
<p>Digital images of the wear scars on the inserts at the completion of the study were obtained by manually tracing the outline of the wear scars on the superior surface of each insert and capturing the image on a Kodak DX6490 digital camera. The wear area was quantified using Image Pro-Plus 3.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Maryland, USA) and was expressed as a percentage of the total area of the insert. Statistical analysis of the wear data was performed using one-way ANOVA, and significance taken at <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05.</p>

<p>A comparison between the wear rates reported in the present study for GVF material and a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954411912445265">23</xref></sup> shows a significant reduction in wear in the current study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954411912445265">Figure 6</xref>) under both intermediate and high kinematics. As the present study had shown the femoral bearing design had no effect on wear rate, and the wear scar regions were comparable for both studies, further explanation for these differences was sought. Surface measurements were taken on three samples from the present study and the previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954411912445265">23</xref></sup> on unworn regions of the femoral surface to identify any differences between the bearings.

The mean surface roughness (Ra) showed a significant difference between the two bearings (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954411912445265">Table 2</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study investigated the effect of femoral geometry and insert material upon the <italic>in-vitro</italic> wear performance of a fixed-bearing total knee replacement. Significant progress in the reduction of wear in fixed-bearing knee replacements has already been achieved by improving the sterilisation process for polyethylene,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0954411912445265">28</xref></sup> and reducing backside wear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912445265">1</xref></sup> This study has examined the effect of introducing a moderately cross-linked polyethylene insert upon wear performance of the fixed-bearing knee.</p>
<p>This study, using moderately cross-linked polyethylene (XLK) as the insert material, compared the effect of femoral geometry on the wear performance of the TKR under standard gait conditions. The study compared a Sigma cruciate-retaining femoral geometry with a Sigma CR150 femoral bearing, which has extended femoral condyles to reduce the contact stress at high flexion angles. This study showed there was no significant difference in wear rate through a standard gait cycle; over this range the geometries of the two femoral bearings are identical and, therefore, it was expected that the wear rates would be comparable. The geometries differ at higher flexion angles, with the CR150 bearing designed for greater conformity and lower contact stresses at higher flexion angles. A high-flexion wear simulation should be conducted to determine differences in wear performance over these activities; however, this study demonstrates equivalence in the wear performance under standard gait conditions.</p>
<p>The effect of insert material was compared using the CR150 femoral geometry, testing conventional ‘GVF’ polyethylene and moderately cross-linked ‘XLK’ polyethylene. Under intermediate kinematics, with an AP displacement of 0–5 mm, there was no difference between the wear performance of the two materials, both having low mean wear rates of approximately 3 mm<sup>3</sup>/Mc. It seems with improvements in total knee replacement design and material that intermediate kinematics are no longer adequate for comparison of wear performances. Under the high kinematic condition, with an AP displacement of 0–10 mm and an increased cross-shear, a significant reduction in wear was achieved by the XLK material compared with the GVF material.</p>
<p>Simple configuration pin-on-plate studies have illustrated a relationship between cross-shear and wear rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0954411912445265">29</xref></sup> Under uni-directional motion, molecular orientation in the principal direction of motion occurs in conventional polyethylene material, allowing the material to be strong in the direction of motion. Studies have demonstrated that under low or zero cross-shear conditions, there is no significant difference between the volumetric wear of cross-linked or conventional polyethylene.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0954411912445265">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0954411912445265">31</xref></sup> This effect was demonstrated under the intermediate kinematic condition in this wear study, where there was no significant difference in the wear performance of the two materials. Cross-linking in the polyethylene material inhibits the molecular orientation, and therefore, preferential hardening does not occur and there is no observed benefit in wear performance under low cross-shear conditions. Under high kinematics, the level of cross-shear is increased. As conventional polyethylene undergoes hardening in the principal direction of motion, the resistance to wear in transverse directions – as produced under higher cross-shear conditions – is reduced, causing an increase in wear, as observed under high kinematics. In the moderately cross-linked XLK polyethylene material, the level of molecular orientation that is achieved is less as the chain mobility is reduced, and therefore, this material is more resistant to cross-shear forces. Hence, when comparing the XLK and GVF materials under high kinematics, an increased cross-shear condition, the XLK material exhibits a reduction in wear rate compared with the GVF material.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0954411912445265">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0954411912445265">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Few studies document the relative wear performance of a moderately cross-linked polyethylene compared with a ‘conventional’ polyethylene, with much of the previous work examining highly cross-linked polyethylene in a total knee arrangement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0954411912445265">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0954411912445265">34</xref></sup> Early studies examining polyethylenes irradiated with doses up to 100 kGy demonstrated significant reductions in wear rate compared with non-irradiated polyethylene.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0954411912445265">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0954411912445265">36</xref></sup> Accelerated aging studies have also demonstrated a clear reduction in volumetric wear rate when comparing conventional and highly cross-linked polyethylene materials, also demonstrating the resistance of cross-linked polyethylene to oxidation and delamination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0954411912445265">37</xref></sup> However, concerns have been raised regarding the reduction in mechanical properties of polyethylene with increasing cross-linkage. Studies have identified a reduction in fracture toughness for highly cross-linked polyethylene and have recommended the use of a moderately cross-linked polyethylene, which still demonstrates a reduction in wear rate compared with non-irradiated material but retains the mechanical properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411912445265">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0954411912445265">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>A few studies have examined a range of cross-linked polyethylene materials, including moderately cross-linked polyethylene, and demonstrated a reduction in wear. Asano et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411912445265">17</xref></sup> showed a 54% reduction in wear with a moderately cross-linked polyethylene irradiated with a dose of 50 kGy compared with the non-irradiated material. More recently, Utzschneider et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0954411912445265">39</xref></sup> presented data contrasting six bearing designs, including a range of cross-linked material. Although the study clearly demonstrated a significant reduction in wear rate for each of the cross-linked polyethylene materials, and the moderately cross-linked polyethylenes to have wear rates between the highly cross-linked materials (lowest wear rates) and the conventional polyethylene materials (highest wear rates), the effect of bearing design and type confounds the wear results observed, and therefore, it is not possible to conclude these differences are a function of the material. The present study compares a conventional GVF polyethylene material with a moderately cross-linked XLK polyethylene in an identical bearing arrangement and under identical test conditions, and therefore, it is possible to conclude the reduction in wear rate is a function of the cross-linkage of the material. The reduction in wear rate observed in this study (approximately 35%) may not appear as large as previously reported studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411912445265">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0954411912445265">39</xref></sup> however, it should be noted that the conventional polyethylene reported in this study also undergoes irradiation at a level of between 2.5–4 MRad, and therefore, the comparison is not between a moderately cross-linked polyethylene and a non-irradiated material, but a comparison with a material that will have a low level of cross-linkage owing to the sterilisation process.</p>
<p>A comparison between the mean wear rates of the conventional polyethylene (GVF) in the present study with a previous study conducted on the same material under identical conditions highlighted a difference between the two studies, with the present study showing significantly reduced wear rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954411912445265">23</xref></sup> A comparison of the surface roughness of the femoral bearings showed there was a significant difference in mean surface roughness (Ra), with the present study bearings having a significantly lower surface roughness than the previous study, although both sets of components were very smooth with mean surface roughness values of less than 0.05 µm. Several studies have demonstrated that surface roughness has a significant effect on the wear performance of conventional polyethylene.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0954411912445265">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0954411912445265">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0954411912445265">42</xref></sup> Using a power equation derived from pin-on-disc studies for conventional polyethylene,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0954411912445265">40</xref></sup> the change in surface roughness highlighted between the two femoral sample groups predicts a reduction in wear of approximately 47%, while the reduction in wear actually observed in this study was 42%. In addition to changes in surface roughness, there are other factors that may have influenced the wear rate, including the sterilisation method for the polyethylene material. The material specification has a radiation dose in the range of 2.5 MRad to 4 MRad, and it is possible that the material batches for the two studies may have been at the limits of these doses. Studies have demonstrated a clear relationship between radiation dose and volumetric wear, and it is possible the reduction in wear may be related to an increase in irradiation within the limits of the material specification. Although it is not possible to clearly define the cause of the reduction in wear rate in the present study, it is an important result to consider. In addition to identifying the limitations of comparing wear studies from different simulators, materials and designs, it is important to be mindful of manufacturing changes and inter-batch variability when comparing wear study results with historical data.</p>
<p>This study has investigated the <italic>in-vitro</italic> wear of a fixed-bearing total knee replacement with a conventional and moderately cross-linked polyethylene. The hypothesis that a moderately cross-linked polyethylene would reduce the wear in a fixed-bearing knee compared with conventional polyethylene was supported. A comparison of two femoral designs demonstrated no significant difference in wear rate during a standard kinematic cycle, which was expected as the geometries differed only at the posterior condyles of the bearing. The difference in wear of the conventional polyethylene in the current study compared with a historic study, highlighted the potential for changes in the manufacturing process and inter-batch variability to have a significant effect on the wear performance of a total knee replacement.</p>
