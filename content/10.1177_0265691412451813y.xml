<p>Who has the authority to control when we work and when we rest? Important questions like this one are at the heart of Noah Shusterman’s book on holidays in France from Louis XIV to Napoleon. Eschewing traditional interpretative frameworks in the history of temporal organization, namely economically driven analyses focusing on industrialization, Shusterman is more concerned with the political struggles over claims to authority. This cogently written book is very engaging. The first half of the text is an extensive examination of the number and range of religious holidays in <italic>ancien régime </italic>France from the middle of the seventeenth century to 1789. These weekday religious holidays, known as <italic>fêtes chômées</italic>, varied tremendously across space and time as local bishops decided which holy days would be observed in their dioceses. During the seventeenth century the average number of weekday religious holidays per year was 33. This figure is the result of impressive research based on the synodal statutes (<italic>statuts synodaux</italic>), and pastoral letters (<italic>mandements</italic>), found in the Bibliothèque Nationale and the Bibliothèque Saint Geneviève. Shusterman’s work shows that the number of observed holidays had declined dramatically by the late eighteenth century to just over 20 because of a growing centralization within the Gallic church. But the church still maintained the authority to decide which <italic>fêtes chômées </italic>would be observed, although civil authorities did help with the enforcement of laws like those requiring people not to work or sell alcohol during Mass.</p>
<p>All of this changed with the French Revolution, when the republican government sought to re-shape time with a new calendar based on a 10-day week. The challenges that this re-structuring faced are the focus of the second half of the book. While the history of the Republican Calendar is relatively well known, one of Shusterman’s aims is to re-examine this calendar in a longer-term framework. He succeeds in this and more by providing a fascinating discussion of how the Fructidorian Directory tried to enforce adherence to the Republican Calendar during Years VI–VII. While the Republican Calendar represented the first move towards the creation of one set of holidays for the entire nation, Shusterman argues that the revolutionaries failed to understand that resting on Sunday was due to more than just religious observance. Resting at the end of a seven-day week was also about rhythms of work and patterns of sociability. So when the government made a concerted effort to enforce the new calendar by legislating that all markets, fairs, and weddings must take place on the <italic>décadi</italic>, or tenth day, people responded with defiance. Employing James C. Scott’s ideas about peasant resistance in the form of ‘weapons of the weak’, Shusterman describes how people would wear their best clothes on Sundays and rags on the <italic>décadi. </italic>Unlike most of the historiography which links adherence to the 10-day week to republicanism, and non-compliance with it to counter-revolution, Shusterman argues that opposition to the Republican Calendar far exceeded opposition to republicanism, and that in some senses the Republican Calendar was contrary to religious freedom.</p>
<p>The experiment in a new republican conception of time lasted only 14 years. The ultimate demise of the Republican Calendar was due to the general lack of acceptance and a lack of will by the government after the coup of prairial VII. Benefitting from the French Revolution’s destruction of <italic>ancien régime </italic>institutions and privileges, Napoleon was able to reform the French liturgical calendar in 1802. He was, of course, bargaining from a position of power, as the Civil Constitution of the Clergy of 1790 had completely weakened the position of the Catholic Church in French society. Napoleon was thus able to take control of religious holidays and bring the church into the service of the state. The number of <italic>fêtes chômées</italic> had been reduced to four – the fewest in history. As is the case today, no new holiday could be established without permission of the government – the exact reverse of the situation a century before when the Church had the exclusive authority in this area. Shusterman’s book charts this extraordinary change. There is some mention of the historiography of the French Revolution in terms of de Tocqueville’s idea of centralization and Suzanne Desan’s arguments about religion and political culture. However, Shusterman’s conclusions could have explained more extensively how increasing state intervention in daily life fitted within the larger debates about the French Revolution in the making of modernity. This is a minor point and should not detract from a finely written and researched book, which is a most welcome addition to our understanding of time, power and politics in early modern and modern France.</p>
