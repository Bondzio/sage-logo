<p>Seeking security amid momentous changes has been a constant preoccupation in human society. However, the discourse of security has changed over time. The focus in this book is on health security, in line with the pronouncement in the Constitution of the World Health Organization (WHO) that the health of all peoples is fundamental to the attainment of peace and security. The author, Stefen Elbe, has done commendable work by developing the health security debate along some unchartered terrain. He has connected the often overlooked dots between security and health and has groomed the discourse in a canvas which has global texture and at the same time contextual concerns. The pivotal point is a call for good governance, in general, and health governance, in particular, at all levels.</p>
<p>Framing it in terms of security, the control of disease is expected to become a main concern of global governance. The turn of events of the last decade has put the medicalization of security at the forefront, although health security has been on the agenda of WHO for a long time. The discourse of security seems to have become more poignant in relation to health after 9/11. The nature of global society requires that we be prepared for any unforeseen event, especially for those that have the potential for creating large-scale insecurity in society. The risk from infectious diseases and bio-terrorist threats from so-called ‘rogue’ and ‘under-developed’ sectors is a case in point. The process by which any social issue is given medical overtones is a significant step in creating the institutional structure for medicalization and thus is a powerful means of social control. This book argues that overall medicalization is significant for security concerns, thus requiring greater involvement in such issues of medical professionals.</p>
<p>While the first chapter establishes the themes of the discussion, the second and third chapters highlight several significant cases necessary to advance the line of thought towards the medicalization of insecurity. The threat from pandemic disease is part of most national security debates. However, enormous threats from microbes such as HIV, SARS and H5N1 has added value to these debates. Protecting the civilian population from the threat of biological warfare is another concern. Nevertheless, in the discussion, both these issues seem to concern only the developed western nations. The nature of global society must be comprehended better. The ever increasing role of media and migration facilitate the movement of people and perspectives within the shortest span of time from one part to another. They also transport diseases. The author feels that migration from the far corners of the world to the doorsteps of the developed world is the cause. Similarly, the post-industrialized developed regions are reaping the benefits of global integration through the supply of relatively cheaper labour force, and raw materials and neoliberal markets for their ever increasing production. In doing so, they are pushing the few stakeholders out who in turn plan to strike back. This is part of a complicated conversation and not a unidirectional debate. Vouching for greater security for the good health of the citizenry does not do justice to the practices and processes that unfold in this global world.</p>
<p>The question to ask, then, is whether security framing is the only way to manage better global health. One needs to be cautious about the cross-border spread of infectious and life-threatening disease. But there are practices within the boundaries of nation-state which also need attention. This is equally valid for developing and developed countries, although developing and under-developed regions of the world have weak public health infrastructure in comparison to the industrially advanced countries of the world. The author delineates a couple of praiseworthy threads along this line. The endemic killers like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and their like pose immense danger for human security. The Commission of Human Security, and as mentioned by Elbe, has rightly deliberated the points that health security is at the core of human security and that illness, disability and avoidable deaths are critical threats to human security. Nevertheless, livelihood security for the marginalized is crucial. Indifferent governance and administrative lapses regarding the developmental needs of marginalized communities have resulted in acute security deficit in developing countries. Despite economic crisis, the economies of countries like India and China are surging. However, the benefits of this growth have evaded the majority of their population. The poor define their insecurity in multidimensional ways that encompass self-respect and access to their livelihood before anything else. Despite valid arguments for health security, other dimensions of human security also provide the necessary fibre for peace and development.</p>
<p>The fifth chapter brings the discussion from macro terrain to the basic issues that interest sociologists. The way of life of people in the current age of over-production is ridden with over-consumption. The lifestyle diseases that Elbe neatly discusses are smoking, obesity, and alcoholism. Unlike the previous issues these aspects may not be explicitly identifiable as security threats, but they are significant. Also, they are constructed as diseases simply because they can cause untimely deaths. Elbe mentions that governments anxious about the threat posed by these lifestyle choices are turning to doctors, nutritionists, and public health experts for policy guidelines. These diseases may be controlled by curative or preventive measures. However, the root of the problem lies in the culture that industry promotes. To repeat, production is ensured only with ever increasing consumption, as evident in the case of the tobacco industry. Moreover, the reason that certain segments of society fight diseases that are due to over-consumption while another segment fights poverty should encourage us to think about ways to synthesize processes and practices that would lead to better global governance of health.</p>
<p>The sixth chapter further narrows the labyrinth of discussion and brings the medicalization issue to the human body. If social relations, the body and the human consciousness are the axes through which power is exercised, they alone should be the vectors through which it can be fought back. Also, and as Fiske reminds us, with the rise of health security the body becomes the battlefield of the twenty-first century. The fifth and sixth chapters explain issues which will guide the debates on health security. Overall, this is a very good book, containing sustained discussions on important dimensions of health security. It has the potential to inform transdisciplinary debates and provide foci for research in many areas.</p>
