<p>This article explores children’s imaginative representations of time in relation to self-experience. Poems published in a young poets’ anthology edited by Naomi Shihab Nye are analyzed in order to discern models of temporality and subjectivity imagined by young writers. A <italic>dynamic temporality</italic> is seen in a subset of poems which manipulate time through crossing temporal references, expanding time frames, or claiming power over time. The article argues that poetry written by young people is a valuable lens on their subjectivity and temporality, and concludes by suggesting the value of incorporating arts and humanities approaches in social inquiry concerning childhood.</p>

<title>Introduction: Time and childhood</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Time presupposes a view of time. It is, therefore, not like a river, not a flowing substance. The fact that the metaphor based on this comparison has persisted from the time of Heraclitus to our own day is explained by our surreptitiously putting into the river a witness of its course.</p>
<attrib>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0907568211422748">Merleau-Ponty, 1995 [1962]</xref>: 411)</attrib>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Regarding childhood and time, we have a perspective problem. Our common-sense view of time, as phenomenological philosopher Merleau-Ponty reminds us, is as a river which ‘flows from the past towards the present and the future’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0907568211422748">1995 [1962]</xref>: 411), yet an idea of time as a flowing river depends on the perspective of a person observing the flow. Applying Merleau-Ponty’s idea to a persistent problem in theorizing childhood and temporality, one could say that our thinking about time and childhood has been from the perspective of an adult standing in the river. The failure to take account of the adult observer has limited our ability to think about time from children’s perspectives. From the perspective of an adult, a child has emerged from upstream in the past and is changing toward the future downstream, whereas for a child herself, she is a living presence. ‘What is past or future for me is present in the world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0907568211422748">Merleau-Ponty, 1995 [1962]</xref>: 412).</p>
<p>Merleau-Ponty helps conceptualize subjectivity not as a given or absolute, a fixed sense that is rooted in time, but as a continual process of coming into being in relation to one’s experiences and other subjectivities. Temporality may involve an overlapping of multiple time frames in consciousness, ‘the mutual harmonizing and overlapping of past and future through the present’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0907568211422748">Merleau-Ponty, 1995 [1962]</xref>: 420). Moments in time may be bound to each other ‘in simultaneity’ rather than sitting ‘side by side “in” time’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0907568211422748">Merleau-Ponty, 1968 [1964]</xref>: 267). Further, the present may not strictly coincide with subjectivity; ‘the present, also, is ungraspable from close-up, in the forceps of attention’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0907568211422748">Merleau-Ponty, 1968 [1964]</xref>: 195). Subjective experience of time may be more complex, interpenetrating and layered than as is depicted by available models and metaphors. Given the centrality of time in adults’ conceptualizations of childhood, adults’ ability to conceptualize subjectivity and temporality from children’s perspectives may be limited.</p>
<p>Discourse in childhood studies, developmental psychology and psychoanalysis includes multiple perspectives on time in relation to theorizing children and childhood. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0907568211422748">James and Prout (1997</xref>), in drawing attention to the centrality of time in organizing societal views of children – in which the present-time of children’s lives is always downplayed in adults’ focus on the remembered pasts and hoped-for futures of childhood – clearly articulated a notion of children’s present-oriented ‘being’ as an alternative to the developmental focus on children’s future ‘becoming’. In the 20th century, also influential alongside developmental perspectives were psychoanalytic approaches, in which children were known primarily through adults’ retrospective accounts comparing child-as-past with the adult present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0907568211422748">Blum, 1995</xref>). This ‘having been’ child surfaces in contemporary social studies of childhood, in research that introduces adults’ retrospective accounts of childhood while considering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0907568211422748">Brannen, 2004</xref>) or not considering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0907568211422748">Moss, 2010</xref>) methodological complications of these approaches.</p>
<p>Recent writers have suggested alternatives to a ‘being’ or ‘becoming’ dichotomy in theorizing childhood. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0907568211422748">Uprichard (2008)</xref> proposes children as ‘being and becoming’ in an attempt to balance a present and future orientation, yet this synthesis does not solve the problem of adults’ determinative perspective on children’s becoming that views children as changing in the direction of future adulthood. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0907568211422748">Prout (2005)</xref> suggests that adults as well as children should be viewed through multiple and incomplete becomings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0907568211422748">Gallacher and Gallagher (2008</xref>: 510) propose a non-determinative sense of becoming in their notion of ‘emergent subjectivity’, which attempts to circumvent a contrast between a static ‘being’ and future-oriented ‘becoming’, and instead is focused on ‘process without predetermination’ in what they term the ‘present continuous tense’. To <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0907568211422748">Gallacher and Gallagher (2008</xref>: 510), ‘subjectivity is performatively produced through the continuous unfolding of action’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0907568211422748">Gallacher and Gallagher’s (2008)</xref> focus on process and the ‘unfolding of action’, as well as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0907568211422748">Warming’s (2011</xref>: 49) discussion of the ‘fluid and performative’ – as opposed to ‘fixed and essential’ – nature of children’s perspectives, are potentially productive directions. Given that conceptions of childhood in relation to time, age and social position differ historically and culturally, the varieties in temporal structuring of childhood as a social position and of children’s daily lives have implications for children’s experiences of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0907568211422748">James et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Time provides a vantage point for considering the potentially different priorities of youth and adults. A number of recent investigations have explored the role of temporality in young people’s lives and in child–adult relations, such as a study of parental regulation of young people’s time in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0907568211422748">Sarre, 2010</xref>); children’s understanding of the social organization of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0907568211422748">Christensen and James, 2008</xref>); Norwegian children’s and parents’ negotiation over the use of time in relation to age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0907568211422748">Solberg, 1997</xref>); and the temporal experiences of children living in asylum centers in Denmark while their families’ cases are pending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0907568211422748">Vitus, 2010</xref>). Given children’s likely awareness of adults’ future-oriented agendas, the conflict over the daily use of time that can pervade adult–child relations (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0907568211422748">Corsaro, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0907568211422748">Sarre, 2010</xref>) may have deeper significance for children’s subjective experiences of time. Adam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0907568211422748">Phillips (1998</xref>: 17) has written that ‘it is not the child who believes in something called development’, a future-oriented notion of the child, since from a child’s perspective, adulthood is ‘the afterlife’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0907568211422748">Phillips, 1998</xref>: 16), a form of life that can signal or involve the end of one’s own desires and interests. Thus, beyond children’s priorities in structuring or using daily time, it is important to learn more about how children might imagine themselves in relation to time, and imagine time in relation to their lives.</p>
<p>Complicating our understanding of temporality is crucial for theorizing childhood and children’s subjectivity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0907568211422748">Thorne (2007</xref>: 150) has usefully articulated the need to theorize ‘different types of <italic>temporality</italic> – historical, generational, chronological, phenomenological, developmental, biological [that] should be central to the study of children and childhoods’, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0907568211422748">Adam’s (1990</xref>: 149) consideration of time as a ‘transdisciplinary subject’ helps ground exploration of the multiplicity of temporal experiences and expressions. The arts and humanities can provide additional sources of insight on children, childhood and temporality. In this article, I analyze poems written by young people in order to discern models of temporality and subjectivity imagined by children. By viewing young people’s poems through the thematic lens of temporal concerns, this article demonstrates the value of poetry as sources of young people’s perspectives on time in relation to the self, while enacting the quandary of presenting children’s cultural productions as mediated by the concerns of adults.</p>

<sec id="section2-0907568211422748">
<title>Poetry as a site of inquiry about childhood</title>
<p>Along with the growth of childhood studies as a vibrant site of integration of approaches to social studies of childhood has been the continued unrealized potential of integrating methods from the humanities and arts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0907568211422748">Prout (2005</xref>: 145) has argued for ‘the need to intensify the interdisciplinarity of childhood studies’, and the integration of the humanities and arts <italic>with</italic> social analytic approaches can be important means of doing so. While there has been valuable work integrating historical and literary perspectives on childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0907568211422748">Sanchez-Eppler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0907568211422748">Steedman, 1995</xref>), integration of literary analysis with social studies of childhood has not yet been much attempted. Children’s literature has been an active area of relevant scholarship in recent years, producing interesting work exploring adult writers’ conceptions of childhood in fiction for young readers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0907568211422748">Clark, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0907568211422748">Nodelman, 2008</xref>) and poetry for adult and child audiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0907568211422748">Flynn, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0907568211422748">2000</xref>), and there have been a few studies of representations of youth in poetry for adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0907568211422748">Burt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0907568211422748">Flynn, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Though young people’s poetic writing has not received much scholarly attention, poetry is a valuable source of young people’s representations of subjectivity and temporality. Poetry can also be a site of potential political action through adult poets’, teachers’ and editors’ facilitation of young poets’ recognition. Taking poetry written by children seriously involves moving beyond thinking only about the ‘maturing’ of artistic ability to considering children as capable of cultural production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0907568211422748">Caputo, 1995</xref>), and to considering art by children as important sources of cultural value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0907568211422748">Matthews, 1994</xref>) as well as of insight into children’s perspectives. In the US, debates over the present or future value of poetry written by children linger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0907568211422748">Sloan, 2001</xref>) from the 1970s concerning whether children can write poems that deserve publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0907568211422748">Koch, 1980 [1970]</xref>) or whether children’s poetic writings are only stepping stones toward children’s potential maturation into accomplished poets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0907568211422748">Livingston, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>While in recent years there has been an explosion of poetry written by adults for young audiences, only a trickle of poetry written by children and youth has been published in the US (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0907568211422748">Lyne, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0907568211422748">Michael, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0907568211422748">WritersCorps, 2003</xref>). The poems I analyze in this article were published in an anthology entitled <italic>Salting the Ocean: 100 Poems by Young Poets</italic>, selected by poet and anthologizer Naomi Shihab Nye and accompanied by paintings by artist Ashley Bryan. Nye has worked for many years as a visiting poet in schools, and the poems in <italic>Salting the Ocean</italic> ‘were selected from the vast heaps that she has saved over the past twenty-five years’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0907568211422748">Nye, 2000</xref>: v) of work with young poets in grades 1 through 12 (approximate ages 6 through 18 years) across ‘dozens’ of schools, school districts and towns in the US. While Nye doesn’t specify the regions where these young people lived, a prefatory note indicates that she has taught in Texas, Maine, Wyoming, Oregon, California, Hawaii and Alaska, most likely encountering a diversity of young people across class, ethnicity and race in the US.</p>
<p>Nye’s <italic>Salting the Ocean</italic> presents 100 poems by ‘young poets’ with poems identified only by each poet’s name. My students noticed that Nye’s decision not to print individual children’s ages or school grades in conjunction with their poems was a radical departure from the conventional practice of anthologizing young poets’ work. Nye’s decision helps afford legitimacy for these young poets through resisting what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0907568211422748">James and Prout (1997</xref>: 235) term adults’ ‘insistent demand of children that their age be made public’. Nye’s decision also takes these poems out of reach of developmental explanations for their themes, language, or imagery. It is not possible for the reader to compare or judge the poems written by younger child poets against the poems written by older child poets in this volume.</p>
<p>The last section of Naomi Shihab Nye’s introduction to <italic>Salting the Ocean</italic>, titled ‘To the Poets’ and addressed directly to young poets, hinges on time. Of her own experience as a poet, Nye writes that ‘Writing a poem was not separate from living, it was more like <italic>Living Twice</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0907568211422748">Nye, 2000</xref>: xiii). Then she zeroes in on her central advice to young poets:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Basically, here’s my advice: <italic>take time</italic>.</p>
<p>In your life, you may always feel as if you don’t have enough time. Adults are specialists at feeling that. Strangely, writing seems to give us a deeper sense of our own time and <italic>time</italic> in general. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0907568211422748">Nye, 2000</xref>: xiii)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Poetry, says Nye to her young readers, can be a means of ‘taking time’, a way of claiming time not just to live but to live twice, to deepen one’s experience through thinking, attending and making; and also to gain a ‘deeper’ understanding of both one’s own sense of time and ‘<italic>time</italic> in general’. In her advice to young writers, Nye calls attention to the possibilities of engaging with time personally and conceptually through writing poetry, and in so doing to exert imaginative control over time and over one’s temporal experience.</p>
<p>Lyric poetry is an especially interesting literary genre for considerations of temporality and subjectivity, given the variety of strategies poets can use to construct temporality, as well as lyric poetry’s typical evocation of an individual voice. While lyric poems represent moments of individual feeling and thought, images and ideas about the past, present and future can be expressed and interwoven through shifting verb tenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0907568211422748">Vendler, 2010 [2002]</xref>). Critics vary in their approach to temporality in lyric poetry. For instance, in their attention to temporality in Emily Dickinson’s poetry, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0907568211422748">Vendler (2004)</xref> analyzes alterations in Dickinson’s temporal strategies across her poetic work, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0907568211422748">Cameron (1979)</xref> analyzes Dickinson’s poetry in order to make a general claim about the attempt to collapse temporal distinctions in lyric poetry. Poems written by young people are a valuable site for exploring children’s perspectives on temporality in relation to subjectivity. In the next section, I analyze a selection of poems in Nye’s anthology, written by poets aged approximately 6–18 years, for their imaginative engagements with time.</p>

<sec id="section3-0907568211422748">
<title>Analysis of temporal reference in poems written by young people</title>
<p>Before beginning my analysis of poems written by young poets in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0907568211422748">Nye’s <italic>Salting the Ocean</italic> (2000)</xref>, it is important to acknowledge some limitations of this analysis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0907568211422748">James (2007)</xref> has cautioned that modes of representation of children’s voices and perspectives must continually be critically examined. Questions about the individuality, diversity and representativeness of children’s perspectives need to be considered, as well as epistemological questions about how adult perspectives and values mediate children’s voices in scholarly, policy and artistic projects. I do not know what Nye’s instructions were to the young poets she worked with – what poems she read them prior to their writing, what prompts she gave them, what she encouraged or discouraged – and thus my discussion cannot tease apart these influences. We also do not know what criteria Nye had in mind when she selected these poems from the ‘vast heaps’ she had saved; her work as teacher and as editor has clearly shaped what our view of these poems can be, and in ways that are difficult to trace. While it is possible that Nye might have suggested writing about time, each young poet imagines time poetically from his or her own intellectual, emotional and artistic perspective. Additionally, my decisions about which poems to discuss and in relation to what particular questions interpose my own perspective and interests between the reader and the poems written by young poets.</p>
<p>My analysis focuses on a subset of poems in <italic>Salting the Ocean</italic> that explicitly engage with time in relation to personal experience. While many poems in the volume mark their figured experiences as taking place in the present or through a remembered past or imagined future, the poems discussed in this article are both in time and out of time. They present a speaker who lives in and through time, yet can also step partially outside of temporal experience to comment, reflect on, or manipulate an aspect of temporality. Some of these poems use explicit temporal markers (such as the words <italic>past, present, future</italic>, or <italic>time</italic>), while others engage with these themes without explicitly naming them.</p>
<p>The poems demonstrate what I term <italic>dynamic temporality</italic> in young poets’ references to time, as revealed primarily through patterns of verb tense in relation to content. While simple present tense is most commonly used in these poems, the poets often combine present tense with other tenses, such as tenses that convey ongoing action (e.g. present and past progressive); cross-temporal reference also occurs through crossing tense with content (e.g. referring to the future in present tense). Dynamic temporality can be seen in creative manipulation of temporal registers that can involve stretching out present or past (using progressive tenses), looping the past into the future through the present; yoking the future into the present; or otherwise claiming power over time. While a basic sense of each poem’s ‘plot’ is possible through a surface reading of the words, the complexity of the ideas involved are only evident through reading each poem as a constructed work of art, through the ‘imaginative and linguistic fusion engaged in by the poem’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0907568211422748">Vendler, 2004</xref>: 9). Although most of these poems are written in the first person, I follow literary critical convention in referring to ‘the speaker’, rather than the young poet, as the constructed voice of the poem.</p>
<p>The following analysis is organized by thematic focus. The poems discussed appear in two of the four sections of <italic>Salting the Ocean</italic> – ‘ “My Shadow is an Ant’s Night”: Thirty-two Poems about the Self and the Inner World’ and ‘ “Silence is like a Tractor Moving the Whole World”: Twenty-five Poems about the Wide Imagination’ – whose titles are taken from young poets’ writings, followed by Nye’s subtitles. The analysis focuses on pairs of poems that offer interesting and sometimes contrasting perspectives on themes of time and knowledge, time and motion and direct address to time. In the conclusion to the article, I consider the implications of the analysis for understanding children’s subjectivity and temporality, and reflect on the value of poetry for social inquiry concerning childhood.</p>
<sec id="section4-0907568211422748">
<title>Time and knowledge</title>
<p>The initial pair of poems I discuss concern whether and how the self can be known, and by whom, in the present and future. Though these poems speak from the present, they position the future as an unknowing, unknown, or possibly unknowable force. The speakers in these poems refer to a future that, at best, is at a remove from themselves, and perhaps even poses a threat to their subjectivity. The first poem depicts the future as not knowing the self, while the second poem depicts the self as not knowing the future.</p>
<p>In Christopher Viner’s poem ‘Anonymous’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0907568211422748">Nye, 2000</xref>: 25), the speaker claims that the future does not know him. He refers to a future that is personal – ‘My future’ – yet is positioned outside and without knowledge of the speaker’s present self:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I am anonymous.</p>
<p>I am only known to a</p>
<p>small group.</p>
<p>The world doesn’t know</p>
<p> ME.</p>
<p>My future doesn’t know</p>
<p> ME.</p>
<p>Sometimes I am not known to my</p>
<p> PARENTS.</p>
<p>My insides don’t know my outsides.</p>
<p>I am only known to some things but not many.</p>
<p>I AM ANONYMOUS.</p>

</disp-quote></p>
<p>The future is a putative agent here, capable of knowing or not knowing. The poem’s speaker claims that the future, the world and even sometimes his parents do not know what he experiences as himself. While the speaker does not deny a future, he claims a voice for himself in spite of possible futures. Cross-temporal reference is used through referring to the future in present tense – ‘My future doesn’t know’ rather than ‘My future will not know.’ In so doing, the threat of his future’s lack of knowledge of him is brought into his present.</p>
<p>A complex, layered notion of subjectivity emerges through this poem. Lack of knowledge is attributed to external forces – the world, parents and his future – which Christopher Viner contrasts with the emphatic, outsized, capitalized ME. Yet he complicates this view by stating that ‘My insides don’t know my outsides’, questioning whether total self-knowledge is possible. This representation of subjectivity is centered (in the unnamed present) but not integrated (across temporal frames, across inside and outside), known only to a ‘small group’, ‘to some things but not many’. The poem proceeds through contrasts: small/large (evidenced through manipulating typeface and capitalization), doesn’t know/know, inside/outside, some/many; and begins and ends with parallel statements – ‘I am anonymous’ – which by the end of the poem becomes the uppercase emphatic ‘I AM ANONYMOUS’, a claim of power and self-definition through the articulation of anonymity as a strength. To be ‘anonymous’ is transformed by the end of the poem into a positive statement of self-knowledge and self-assertion, and a claim to be known ‘sometimes’ to ‘some’ people.</p>
<p>‘Patterns’ by Leticia Gray (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0907568211422748">Nye, 2000</xref>: 28) invokes a natural image of growth, recalling a maturational or organismic metaphor though using trees as a figure of knowing how to grow, yet does so in a way that undercuts typical notions of maturational, unidirectional change:</p>

<p>‘Patterns’ begins with an epigram from poet William Stafford that suggests the solitary speaker is thinking about her voice against the ‘petition’ of a community of trees. The poem questions whether the future can be known through a speaker who claims she does not know the future. The opening two lines of the poem depict rain as a force of present erosion (driving present life into gutters or down slopes) that complicates a simple view of natural change and forward motion. Rain is an image of time, change, or age, as it provokes the second stanza’s question about the future. Verb tenses change from the first stanza’s use of present (‘I think’) and present progressive tense (‘the rain / is washing life away’), to asking about the future in the present tense (‘How do I know’ rather than ‘How will I know’), a cross-temporal reference that connects the speaker’s present knowledge with her questions about the future.</p>
<p>Part of the craft of this poem involves the juxtaposition of its careful making with the speaker’s questioning of her knowledge. The poem’s central two stanzas present the speaker’s questioning about herself and her future (‘How do I know what life / has in store for me?’) in relation to pattern (‘It is strange that I cannot / figure out the pattern’).</p>
<p>The poem’s concluding stanza suggests praise for the naturalness of pattern, which seems to echo the common maturational (or organismic) model of development and growth. A maturational (or organismic) metaphor for development – in which a child, given a supportive environment, is seen as expected to mature into a functioning adult from her unfolding biological capacity, ‘as a seed planted in favorable conditions is expected to unfold and mature into a tree’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0907568211422748">Meacham, 2004</xref>: 75) – is one of the most common conceptions of development across the history of academic psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0907568211422748">Parke et al., 1994</xref>). In ‘Patterns’, the speaker attributes to trees a knowledge of their growth, a clear purpose that she states she doesn’t have. Yet it is hard not to read this poem as implicitly questioning the certainty of adults’ expectations for young people and their formulations of predictive developmental patterns. ‘Patterns’ is composed in a careful pattern of four stanzas (two-line couplets) with mostly regular meter (three beats per line). Leticia Gray has artfully constructed a poem about not knowing her pattern through careful use of poetic patterns, and the poem seems to question the nature and value of pattern and perfection in relation to young people. If adult expectations lurk in the shadows, seeing children as potentially perfectible, or as failures when they do not develop into perfect adults, Leticia Gray’s poem is an artful, polished rebuke.</p>

<title>Time and motion</title>
<p>Two contrasting poems treat the sufficiency of the self in relation to time and motion, the first through the power of outrunning, and the second through the poignancy of not being able to catch up. Whereas in the first poem, the speaker writes that ‘Time is as fast as I am’, the speaker in the second poem states that ‘I feel like a puppy that can’t catch up’.</p>
<p>Jamshid Afshar Jr’s poem ‘Roller-Skate!’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0907568211422748">Nye, 2000</xref>: 97) depicts a speaker in motion articulating the power and resonance of motion and speed:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When I roller-skate</p>
<p> I feel life in a way</p>
<p> where time is as fast as I am.</p>
<p>When I roller-skate</p>
<p> I feel power, like being</p>
<p> superior to the world.</p>
<p>When I turn on my roller skates</p>
<p> it’s like my life changing</p>
<p> as I grow older.</p>
<p>When I roller-skate</p>
<p> I feel that loneliness</p>
<p> cannot catch me.</p>

</disp-quote></p>
<p>The opening stanza conveys a fullness and sufficiency in the speaker’s sense of himself roller-skating. This image raises the young speaker to the level of elemental time; time must catch up to him, must reach his own speed. Roller-skating as an image of ‘power’ is explicit in the second stanza, where the speaker while roller-skating feels ‘superior to the world’. By the third stanza, Jamshid Afshar Jr presents an intriguing image that fuses present action with change and aging. Does roller-skating make him feel more grown up, or more in charge of his own movement and change, or does the act of speeding ahead accentuate his sense of his life ‘changing / as I grow older’? – a phrase which is an interesting combination of future-oriented (‘grow older’) but not necessarily linear (‘changing’) terms. This effect is heightened through the use of the present progressive tense (‘changing’) where the rest of the poem is in the simple present tense.</p>
<p>That the action of the entire poem occurs ‘When I roller-skate’ results in a provocative set of images about the action and meaning of moving in space and time. The poem’s final stanza – ‘When I roller-skate / I feel that loneliness / cannot catch me’ – depicts the speaker outpacing loneliness. One measure of this poem’s potency is that these lines inspired Nye herself to write a poem, ‘The Rider’, which begins ‘A boy told me / if he rollerskated fast enough / his loneliness couldn’t catch up to him’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0907568211422748">Nye, 1990</xref>: 6). It is striking that Nye’s poem picks up on Jamshid Afshar Jr’s image of leaving loneliness behind, but does not make use of his poem’s images relating to time, power and change, which relate specifically to the poet’s subjectivity as a young person.</p>
<p>Alberto Santillana’s untitled poem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0907568211422748">Nye, 2000</xref>: 13) presents a series of images that conveys a sense of being behind time and unable to catch up:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I feel like a puppy that</p>
<p>can’t catch up to his mother.</p>
<p>Like a creek that runs fast</p>
<p>but can’t reach the ocean.</p>
<p>Like a runner who stays all day</p>
<p>in the starting line.</p>
<p>My mind is like an empty box.</p>
<p>Time like a racing car</p>
<p>running at the speed of light.</p>
<p>Text copyright © 2000 by Naomi Shihab Nye. Used by permission of HarperCollins Publishers.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The poem depicts the speaker as feeling like a puppy, a creek and a runner who can’t catch up, can’t reach the goal, or can’t even start moving – all images of active subjects who are in motion or ready for motion yet can’t go fast enough. These images contrast with the incongruous final image of the initial stanza, ‘My mind is like an empty box’. The poem seems to step back from representing motion-that-is-not-fast-enough, to the potential for motion (the runner at the starting line), to the mind as ‘empty box’, perhaps depleted, unknowable, or without resources. The mind as ‘empty box’ is contrasted with the final image of time itself, ‘like a racing car / running at the speed of light’, an image of elemental time as potent and ultra swift, yet depicted through images of human-made (racing car) or human-like (running) motion. Though the poem has been in the present tense, this final image makes use of present progressive tense (‘Time . . . / running at the speed of light’), a fitting representation of time’s mobility in relation to the speaker. While the contrast in this poem between the human speaker and time is surprising, direct reference to time is taken a step further in two other poems, in which poets address aspects of time directly as characters within the poems.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0907568211422748">
<title>Direct address to time</title>
<p>In these final two poems, elements of time – ‘free time’ in the first poem, the ‘past’ in the second poem – become characters in the drama of each poem. The speakers of these poems engage directly with time through questions, pleas, or directives. These poets take risks to engage directly with time through language, and position their speakers in very particular positions in relation to time. Rather than a young person as an object of time, or as a figure of the beginning of a linear narrative, the speakers in these poems are constructed as potent, imaginatively resourceful and capable of altering temporal frames.</p>
<p>In her untitled poem, Karen Luk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0907568211422748">Nye, 2000</xref>: 100) playfully explores ideas about ‘free time’ and addresses free time directly by the end of the poem:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Where does my free time go?</p>
<p>Does it fly off like a shooting star?</p>
<p>Take a trip to the Bahamas?</p>
<p>What if I don’t use it?</p>
<p>Does it feel neglected?</p>
<p>Or does it understand?</p>
<p>Is it all-encompassing?</p>
<p>Or know give-and-take?</p>
<p>Does it keep an alarm?</p>
<p>Is it always on time?</p>
<p>Is free time shared by all of us?</p>
<p>I want more.</p>
<p>Hey, free time . . .</p>
<p>You’re late.</p>
<p>Text copyright © 2000 by Naomi Shihab Nye. Used by permission of HarperCollins Publishers.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The poem proceeds through a list of questions, in which the speaker imagines the journeys free time might take, wonders about free time’s feelings if she doesn’t ‘use it’, and questions whether free time is ‘shared by all of us’. An aspect of the poem’s craft is the structuring of the set of questions about free time in a descending pattern: three questions about where free time goes (when she doesn’t have access to it), three questions about what free time feels (when she doesn’t use it all), two questions on free time’s manner of engagement (‘all-encompassing’ versus reciprocal ‘give-and-take’), two questions about free time’s own time-keeping (‘Is it always on time?’), and a final question about whether we all share free time. The poem’s turn or new direction in its last three lines begins with a declarative statement, ‘I want more’. This statement of desire for more free time prompts the speaker to take a very active stance in the final two lines by addressing her free time directly in a manner that commands attention and power to scold: ‘Hey, free time . . . / You’re late.’ By the end of the poem (all of which is in the present tense), the speaker claims a powerful position in relation to an aspect of time, and it is likely important that this aspect is ‘free time’, an element that some children may believe they should have control over.</p>
<p>Finally, Martin Laureles’ poem ‘Charm to Bring Back the Past’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0907568211422748">Nye, 2000</xref>: 88) is a meditation on the speaker’s relation to the past that proceeds through playing with temporal reference:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I will risk my life to bring back the Past.</p>
<p>I will order it at a restaurant.</p>
<p>It will cost but it’s worth it.</p>
<p>I will invite it to my house and treat it</p>
<p>as if it were my relative.</p>
<p>If the Past feels bad, I feel bad.</p>
<p>If the Past feels good, I feel good.</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel further back in the Past</p>
<p>than the Past itself.</p>
<p>I wish the Past would come back</p>
<p>so my older relatives would have those good times</p>
<p>they told me they had.</p>
<p>Please come back Past please come back.</p>
<p>Text copyright © 2000 by Naomi Shihab Nye. Used by permission of HarperCollins Publishers.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For a poem focused on the past, it begins by making promises toward the future, opening with the line ‘I will risk my life to bring back the Past’. The poem’s first four lines are structured ‘I will . . . I will . . . It will . . . I will . . . ’, an insistent series of promises about the speaker’s future actions. By its fourth line, the poem quietly startles the reader by referring to the past as a human character who will take up residence with the speaker in the future: ‘I will invite it to my house and treat it / as if it were my relative.’ The speaker engages in a range of interesting interactions and feelings with regard to the past, which include the absurd (‘I will order it at a restaurant’), the fellow-feeling (‘If the Past feels bad, I feel bad’) and the mysterious (‘Sometimes I feel further back in the Past / than the Past itself’).</p>
<p>The freedom to subvert temporal order that Martin Laureles engages in is accomplished with a tone alternately playful and serious. The poem’s earnestness is expressed when the speaker mentions a reason for wanting the past to return: ‘so my older relatives would have those good times / they told me they had.’ The motivation for transforming linear time thus derives from the social relations of the self, in desiring that his elder relatives ‘would have’ (in the conditional future), ‘those good times’ that they specifically ‘told me’ about (in the past). The poignancy of this motivation is accentuated by its not being revealed until the end of the poem, just prior to the incantatory final line ‘Please come back Past please come back’, a repetitive, pleading direct address to the past whose lack of punctuation adds urgency. The poem subverts the powerless, supplicating image of juvenile pleading through the poem’s overall image of a speaker potent, courageous and clever enough to reposition the past in the future for the sake of the present. This repositioning is accomplished through a final sleight of hand in the poem’s last line, when ‘Past’ is positioned in the middle of the line’s sequence – in the present position – rather than in the initial position in expected linear movement from past to present to future. Dynamic temporality is seen in ‘Charm to Bring Back the Past’ in its shifting temporal registers, in moving from talking about the past in simple future tense (a striking cross-temporality), to subjunctive mood, to simple present tense, to conditional mood, to simple past tense, to direct address to the past in present tense, demonstrating a complexity of temporal reference that is a fitting place to end consideration of young poets’ exploration of temporality and subjectivity in lyric poetry.</p>
<p>This analysis of poems written by young people has highlighted multiple and at times contrasting points of engagement with time. The poems by Christopher Viner and Leticia Gray consider time in relation to knowledge, and claim that the future does not know one’s present self or question whether one’s self can know the future while rooted in the present. The poems by Jamshid Afshar Jr and Alberto Santillana are concerned with time and motion in relation to the self, and represent the self as able to outpace time or depict the self as overrun by time. Karen Luk and Martin Laureles address elements of time directly as characters in their poems, and question the travels and habits of free time or imagine a relationship to a personified past in order to incorporate it in the present. Despite these varied engagements, these young poets demonstrate a striking similarity in constructing poetic voices that enable them to imaginatively manipulate time – in a manner I term <italic>dynamic temporality –</italic> in relation to questions about the self. The use of dynamic temporality in representing time in relation to subjectivity can be understood as exercising imaginative control over time, practicing flexibility in temporal arrangements, or moving beyond perceived limits of time in young people’s lives.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Poetry written by young people is a valuable source of young people’s perspectives on time and subjectivity. In the poems analyzed in this article, time is an elemental force that young poets confront imaginatively through metaphoric engagement, direct address and multiple temporal configurations. These representations of time demonstrate <italic>dynamic temporality</italic> – a remodeling of time that involves stretching out duration, crossing temporal frames, subverting linear trajectories, or otherwise claiming power over time. These young people use language in powerful, artful ways that integrate imaginative and conceptual understanding of time and its significance for self-experience.</p>
<p>This analysis of young people’s temporal engagements in lyric poetry demonstrates that even in a small sample, children can take multiple and even contrasting views of time from each other, and thus that young people’s ideas about time are not reducible to a unitary ‘child’s perspective’. The dynamic temporality evident in these poems involves different approaches to articulating temporal metaphors and sequences – questioning time, ordering it around, stretching it out, moving it in unpredictable ways and subverting straightforward temporal linearity. While all six poems use the present tense, many of them shift between tenses or display cross-temporal reference in referring to a temporal epoch in an unexpected tense. This frequency of playing with verb tenses demonstrates that lyric poetry is a particularly interesting genre to explore in relation to young people’s experience of time and subjectivity. Exploring time in lyric poetry enables these young poets to reposition the self imaginatively in relation to time, to explore alternative metaphors and trajectories and to challenge ideas about time and childhood. The complex intertwined registers in these imaginative reflections on temporality provide a lens onto these young people’s subjective experience of time in ways that would arguably not be possible even through other linguistic means, such as dialogue or interview.</p>
<p>Childhood studies can be enriched by work that incorporates methodologies from the humanities and arts into social inquiry, in this case to ask questions both about childhood and about poetry. Such reciprocal questioning can benefit our social as well as literary inquiry about childhood and children’s lives and subjectivity. Integrating social and literary analysis can help develop methods which can reveal the varied and complex metaphors and linguistic means that young people can use to think about themselves and their temporal lives.</p>
