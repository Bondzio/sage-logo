<p>This fall, I had the opportunity to meet with attendees at the AARP Annual Member Event and answer their questions about diabetes. In this “Ask the Diabetes Educator” setting, attendees can ask questions about their own or a loved one’s diabetes, prediabetes, and general health concerns.</p>
<p>Each year, over 1,000 people attend this event for people age 50 and above to take advantage of this diabetes resource, and every year I am amazed with the response. After all, they could instead choose to hear from a celebrity, a presidential candidate, or a famous tennis athlete that is now a proud spokesperson for AARP. Yet every year they want to hear from a diabetes educator!</p>
<p>People attending this event are on average 63 years old, but age ranges widely. They come from all over the United States, many attending year after year, just as I have staffed it year after year.</p>

<title>Acceptance and Interest</title>
<p>The good news I have observed is that over the years, people have gone from saying I don’t have diabetes, I just have a touch of sugar, or I’m borderline, to calling their condition what it is— prediabetes. They understand this is a real condition that cannot be dismissed or ignored. When they hear they are not alone, they seem relieved to know they can turn their head in any direction and see that 1 in 4 probably has diabetes or prediabetes.</p>
<p>However, they tell me they haven’t heard their concerns addressed in primary care. What do they need to do to keep prediabetes just that or to keep their diabetes from causing them to live less independently for a long time to come? They may have heard that 5-7% weight loss will make a big difference but may not understand what that means to them as individuals. Many people can’t do the math to understand just how achievable that is, given they may have previously been led to believe they had to reach a healthy or even an ideal weight. This same situation may be true for being active. It’s one thing to hear they should be active 30 minutes a day, but another to have that translated to an actionable plan.</p>
<p>Diabetes educators have the unique skills to help patients understand, and yet, many people with prediabetes and diabetes never have the opportunity to “ask an educator.” The reasons vary, as we know—no physician referral, physicians don’t have a diabetes educator in their arsenal of tools for helping their patients, lack of reimbursement for diabetes prevention when delivered by a diabetes educator, and so on. What are we to do?</p>

<title>Help and Hope</title>
<p>During the AARP Life@50+ member event, my team and I have the fortune of working outside the box. Each of us on the team comes from a different background—marketing, communications, pharmacy, and the nurse line. I am the only CDE, but the others are also providing valuable and impactful diabetes prevention tips as well as diabetes education commensurate with their skills and training. We are all there to provide a service, and fortunately, reimbursement is not an issue. In settings like these, we are able to provide help and hope for those people who say they are struggling and need to better understand what they can do.</p>
<p>Looking at the 5 levels of diabetes educators as defined by AADE, our team represents 4 of the 5 levels, as unconventional as it may seem. Year after year, this area within our exhibit at the AARP member event scores in the top 2 things members appreciate about their experience visiting our exhibit.</p>

<title>Jane’s Story</title>
<p>Jane has come to see me every year since we first met at the AARP event in 2006. Back then, we spoke about her A1C of 6.2% and her fear of having that number creep up and “over the line.” Jane believed that if she were diagnosed with diabetes she would lose her quality of life and her independence, something she had seen with her aunt when she was a child. After we discussed that type 2 diabetes may be prevented or at least delayed and the steps she could take starting at that moment, she was clearly relieved. She even asked if she could give me a hug.</p>
<p>The following year we met again at the event, this time in Boston. She came to tell me how she was doing and said she felt she needed to share her success. Her A1C was down to 6.1%. She explained what she was doing and how she knew it was working when she stepped on the scale and she had lost 12 pounds. The next year when Jane came to see me at the event in Washington, D.C., she stated she was working in 30 to 45 minutes of activity every day and felt great. Her A1C had remained stable and both her doctor and she were happy with her blood glucose control.</p>
<p>In 2009, it was Vegas, and the stakes were high for Jane. She had now had prediabetes for 3 years, and in many cases, this would be the time for the prediabetes to have progressed to diabetes. But not Jane! Her job was stressful and time was hard to find, but she had continued her plan to stop diabetes. We found her some personal resources in her community to help her stay on track, including a registered dietitian her physician could refer her to for nutrition guidance, information to help with her food allergies, and support for her to achieve her goal to prevent diabetes.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>An encouraging word of hope, a simple message to make a change, maybe even “you can do this” is just what they need to help them say “not me” to diabetes.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Fast forward now, through Orlando and LA, to New Orleans in 2012. Jane’s A1C remains at 6%. She attributes this to the following:</p>
<list id="list1-2325160312471802" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>She has lost and kept off 7% of her initial weight.</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>She was ready to get started when we spoke for the first time and has maintained her efforts ever since.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>She recognized the risk, but she didn’t let fear hold her back when she had the right information.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>She feels she needs to be held accountable for her choices.</p></list-item>

<title>Lessons Learned</title>
<p>We know diabetes prevention is possible, proven through both NIH-funded clinical trials and through CDC-recognized diabetes prevention programs such as those provided in YMCAs across the country. Interventionists in the current model are providing effective prevention solutions. Likely, they are diabetes educators in one of the competency levels defined by AADE. While a formal program for diabetes prevention may be ideal, we can all help the people we interact with on a regular basis to stop diabetes—in their lives and the lives of the people important to them. An encouraging word of hope, a simple message to make a change, maybe even “you can do this” is just what they need to help them say “not me” to diabetes.</p>
<p>Oh, I almost forgot to tell you. Jane gave me a hug again this year.</p>
<p>The Food For Thought department of <italic>AADE in Practice</italic> is for you to tell your stories to help other diabetes educators enhance their practices in both DSME and MNT. It’s OK to think outside the box! Offer what has worked for you in your practice, ways you feel we can expand the effectiveness of the care we provide, and food for thought in the ways we can make a positive impact on those we serve—patients, third-party payers, and colleagues who have come to understand the incredible resource they have in their diabetes educators. ■</p>
