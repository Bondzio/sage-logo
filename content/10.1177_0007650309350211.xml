<abstract>
<p>Trade associations operate under the premise of advancing the shared interests of their member firms. How well do they fulfill this role? This article measures the activity of 148 major industry trade associations over time and relates this activity to the performance of the relevant industries and dominant firms within them. Findings suggest that trade association spending increases when the profitability of the four largest firms in an industry decreases, but spending is unrelated to the profitability of the industry overall. This implies that large firms exert control over trade association agendas and may use these communal organizations to advance their own interests rather than the shared interests of the entire industry. Moreover, it points to the need for further development of the currently anemic management literature on the activities of trade associations.</p>

<p>Trade associations are a pervasive part of our economic landscape. Most firms hold membership in at least one trade association. Nearly every industry, across all sectors of the economy, has organized at least one and often several trade associations. From the American Apparel Manufacturers Association to the American Wind Energy Association, there are thousands of trade associations in the United States alone and thousands more in countries throughout the developed world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0007650309350211">Aldrich &amp; Staber, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0007650309350211">Bailey &amp; Rupp, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0007650309350211">Collins &amp; Roper, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0007650309350211">Lane &amp; Bachmann, 1997</xref>). Yet “[v]ery little academic research has focused on trade associations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0007650309350211">Barringer &amp; Harrison, 2000</xref>, p. 393). As a result, we have little systematic understanding of what these ubiquitous organizations actually do.</p>
<p>The lack of research on trade associations is lamentable. These organizations can amass budgets of millions of dollars and employ staffs of hundreds, and their lobbying activities can significantly influence the competitive environment, shaping regulations in ways that affect industry survival rates, growth, and profitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0007650309350211">Hirsch, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0007650309350211">Ingram &amp; Inman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0007650309350211">Miles, 1982</xref>). Many trade associations not only influence government regulation but even assume the role of government through industry self-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0007650309350211">Barnett &amp; King, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0007650309350211">Gupta &amp; Lad, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0007650309350211">Lenox &amp; Nash, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0007650309350211">Maitland, 1985</xref>). Thus, if we are to understand the competitive environment, we cannot ignore the role of trade associations.</p>
<p>In this article, I examine the conditions that drive trade associations to action. Trade associations are organizations through which a group of interdependent firms, typically in the same industry, pool their resources and coordinate their efforts so that they may “speak with one voice”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0007650309350211">1</xref></sup> on matters of shared interest. However, member firms are typically rivals and so they may not always share the same interests. Some firms may seek to direct the amassed resources of their trade associations in ways that maximize their individual interests and not necessarily the memberships’ shared interests. Empirically discerning what actually drives trade associations to “speak up”—be it the interests of a few powerful firms or the shared interests of the industry—is a critical step in better understanding these ubiquitous and influential organizations.</p>
<p>I conduct a longitudinal study of the activity of 148 major U.S. industry trade associations. Findings suggest that industry-wide downturns may not drive trade association activity. Rather, it is downturns in the performance of the dominant firms within an industry that are strongly associated with increased trade association activity. These findings thus imply that when trade associations speak with “one voice,” the most powerful firms may be writing the script.</p>
<sec id="section1-0007650309350211">
<title>What Do We Know About Trade Associations?</title>
<p>Trade associations are commonly defined as “organizations created to represent business interests within specific domains, mobilizing firms within their domain so that collective action can be taken on common problems” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0007650309350211">Aldrich &amp; Staber, 1988</xref>, p. 111). There are several thousand trade associations within the United States that represent the interests of almost every industry and thousands more across the industrialized world. Many are highly active, with large staffs, a wide range of active committees, and generous budgets. For example, the American Chemistry Council,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0007650309350211">2</xref></sup> the primary trade association for nearly 200 chemical manufacturers, has a paid staff of approximately 300 personnel overseeing the association and its more than one dozen major subgroups, operating on an annual budget of around US$110 million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0007650309350211">Swartout, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Not only the level but also the type of activity varies across trade associations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0007650309350211">Hemphill (1992</xref>, p. 916) described the range of trade association activities as “data collection, educational programs, facilitating technical standards and specifications, insurance programs, legal assistance and government relations.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0007650309350211">Oliver (1990</xref>, p. 249) listed trade association activities to include lobbying state regulators, promoting collective good through events such as trade shows, seeking to obtain economic advantages, reducing legislative uncertainty through activities such as product standardization, and enhancing members’ image. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0007650309350211">Staber and Aldrich (1983)</xref> distinguished four trade association “activity areas: commercial, public, political, and solidaristic” (p. 168). These encompass the organization of trade shows and conventions, product standardization, and the collection of industry statistics (commercial); compilation of statistics for regulatory compliance (public); lobbying the government (political); and building consensus and shared purpose within the industry (solidaristic).</p>
<p>Others have made a blunter distinction, wherein trade associations serve as the bodies through which firms pursue collective strategy in the political (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0007650309350211">Hillman &amp; Hitt, 1999</xref>) or nonmarket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0007650309350211">Baron, 1995</xref>) environments. This is an important distinction to make because colluding in market activities constitutes a violation of antitrust laws.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0007650309350211">3</xref></sup> Thus, legally, trade associations operate entirely within the nonmarket environment, which consists of “the social, political, and legal arrangements that structure interactions among companies and their public” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0007650309350211">Baron, 1995</xref>, p. 73).</p>
<p>Though they cannot coordinate market activities, trade associations can enhance the performance and survival rates of their member firms by exerting influence on nonmarket forces. For example, the coordinated might of the pharmaceutical industry enabled it to co-opt critical resource holders and thereby gain higher average profits and survival rates than the recording industry, despite the similar structural characteristics of these two industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0007650309350211">Hirsch, 1975</xref>). The Tobacco Institute protected cigarette manufacturers from a variety of lawsuits and regulations that likely would have resulted in even greater harm to the industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0007650309350211">Miles, 1982</xref>). The coordinated effort of hoteliers around Niagara Falls led to regulation that overcame common problems that threatened their growth and prosperity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0007650309350211">Ingram &amp; Inman, 1996</xref>). Industry-wide cooperation through trade associations is particularly critical to recovery from crises that face entire industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0007650309350211">Barnett, 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0007650309350211">2006b</xref>). By presenting a united front and speaking with a unified voice, firms may collectively “improve the legislative, regulatory, market, and public interest climate for the industry” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0007650309350211">Chemical Manufacturers Association Report, 1993</xref>) and so help to realign their industry with the demands of its environment.</p>
<p>Yet despite their prevalence and potential impact, trade associations have received relatively little attention from organizational scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0007650309350211">Barnett, Mischke, &amp; Ocasio, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0007650309350211">Barringer &amp; Harrison, 2000</xref>). The studies mentioned above focused on the effects that trade associations can have on parties external to an industry. The few other studies of trade associations have focused on population dynamics. Howard Aldrich, Udo Staber, and colleagues put forth several articles that explored variations in the rates of founding, transformation, and death of trade associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0007650309350211">Aldrich &amp; Staber, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0007650309350211">Aldrich, Staber, Zimmer, &amp; Beggs, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0007650309350211">Aldrich, Zimmer, Staber, &amp; Beggs, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0007650309350211">Staber &amp; Aldrich, 1983</xref>). They found that trade associations are very robust organizational forms due to their minimalist nature. Minimalist organizations are a special class of organizations that require few resources for founding and sustenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0007650309350211">Halliday, Powell, &amp; Granfors, 1987</xref>). Trade associations require little overhead to initiate and, if necessary, can survive for extended periods of time with relatively little financial support. Members may withhold resources from a trade association in difficult times without causing the trade association to collapse. Thus, trade associations are relatively easy to found and likely to survive once founded.</p>
<p>Because of the minimalist nature of trade associations, population studies offer limited insight into key dynamics of these important organizations. Population studies are not sensitive to variation in organizational activity short of the disbanding of an existing organization or the establishment of a new one. An industry’s trade association is often founded early in the industry’s life because such collective action aids in gaining legitimacy for new types of organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0007650309350211">Aldrich &amp; Fiol, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0007650309350211">DiMaggio, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0007650309350211">Oliver, 1990</xref>). Yet once legitimacy is established, and so this shared problem is resolved, trade associations rarely disband. Rather, these robust organizations tend to survive for long periods of time. For example, though its name has changed several times, the American Chemistry Council has represented the evolving collective interests of chemical manufacturers since 1872. Thus, when an established industry faces a shared problem, its members are more likely to address this problem within the framework of an existing trade association than to create an entirely new one. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0007650309350211">Aldrich and Staber (1988)</xref> acknowledged, population-level studies are not sensitive to this activity: “New positions might have been created, new committees formed, dues raised, lobbyists hired, and other actions taken . . . Such developments would not show up at the level of the analysis reported here” (p. 125).</p>

<title>What Do We Need To Know About Trade Associations?</title>
<p>To better understand the nature of trade associations, one must look beyond a few blunt milestones such as creation, reorganization, and eventual abandonment. Much happens in the intervening years. Some trade associations dominate their industries’ affairs, controlling large budgets and employing large staffs; others assume a minimalist posture and play a largely ceremonial role. Within a given trade association, activity waxes and wanes over time. Depending on the level of activity, trade associations can shape the competitive landscape, or they can be relatively inert. We need to look inside this black box and assess what drives variation in a trade association’s activity throughout its typically long life.</p>
<sec id="section3-0007650309350211">
<title>Collective Responses to Shared Problems</title>
<p>A trade association draws resources from its member firms. Firms often incur significant financial and human resource commitments as a condition of participation. For example, American Chemistry Council member firms pay annual dues ranging well into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0007650309350211">4</xref></sup> Furthermore, they provide “sweat equity” in the form of skilled personnel who participate in the thousands of meetings held at the Council’s headquarters each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0007650309350211">Rees, 1997</xref>). Yet membership and, accordingly, the associated resource commitments are voluntary. When will firms be willing to commit resources to their trade associations?</p>
<p>Profit-seeking firms, of course, prefer to limit their expenses, all else equal. In the case of trade association spending, this tendency would seem to be exacerbated because firms may engage in free riding. The benefits of trade association activity, such as an improved political and regulatory environment and a better industry reputation, are nonexcludable. When a trade association’s efforts leads to a reduction in the regulatory burden on an entire industry, all the firms in the industry benefit, including those who did not contribute to the trade association. Thus, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0007650309350211">Olson’s (1965)</xref> influential work argued, the logic of collective action dictates that so long as participation in an initiative is voluntary and the fruits of the effort are nonexcludable, the rational choice is to free ride. In aggregate, this suggests that the “tragedy of the commons” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0007650309350211">Hardin, 1968</xref>) prevails in these situations, producing not a voluntary organization that resolves shared problems but inaction that exacerbates these problems.</p>
<p>Despite the logic of collective action, a burgeoning body of research has shown that the tragedy of the commons is often averted in practice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0007650309350211">Ostrom (1990)</xref> demonstrated that individuals did not succumb to the temptation to free ride under a number of circumstances relating to the preservation of shared natural resources. For example, individuals voluntarily created and participated in organizations that governed the use of fisheries and water sources. Others have extended these ideas on cooperation in the protection of natural resources to industrial settings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0007650309350211">Rees (1994)</xref> found that the nuclear power industry, facing intense public criticism and rigid government oversight following a nuclear accident at Three Mile Island in 1979, quickly banded together through a trade association, the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations, to increase the industry’s prospects for survival. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0007650309350211">Barnett and King (2008)</xref> found that when the chemical industry was under threat following a deadly chemical spill, chemical firms came together to create a new industry self-regulatory program that significantly increased their voluntary commitments to their trade association.</p>
<p>In light of this growing body of research demonstrating that, when confronted by shared problems, firms can avert the tragedy of the commons and come together to create new institutional structures, I hypothesize that firms will increase their activity within existing trade associations when confronted by shared problems. The existing relationships between firms forged over time within a trade association facilitates mobilization by creating a common culture that unifies members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0007650309350211">Abrahamson &amp; Fombrun, 1994</xref>) and engenders peer pressure to cooperate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0007650309350211">Gunningham, 1995</xref>), thereby helping overcome the collective action problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0007650309350211">Olson, 1965</xref>). In short, it is easier to respond to a shared problem through the action of an existing trade association than it is to create a new organization, and so if firms can create new organizations to manage shared problems, it seems only logical that they can take the less burdensome action of expanding activity within existing organizations to manage shared problems.</p>

<title>Collective Responses to the Problems of a Few</title>
<p>Though firms may overcome the collective action problem and voluntarily contribute to trade association efforts to manage shared problems facing their industry, how do they recognize a shared problem? The problems faced by a firm are often ambiguous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0007650309350211">March &amp; Olsen, 1976</xref>). The shared problems faced by an entire industry are yet more ambiguous. For example, how does a firm surmise that its industry’s legitimacy is under threat or that the regulatory climate has become problematic?</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0007650309350211">Hoffman and Ocasio (2001)</xref> found that the objective characteristics of a critical event confronting an industry often had little to do with the likelihood that the industry would attend to the event. Lacking objective guidelines on what constitutes a shared problem, firms may rely on social cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0007650309350211">DiMaggio &amp; Powell, 1983</xref>). Firms tend to follow the actions of market leaders, presuming that if dominant firms are taking certain actions, then these actions must be appropriate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0007650309350211">Ferrier, Smith, &amp; Grimm, 1999</xref>). Thus, firms may be alerted to an issue and gauge its importance by the involvement of dominant firms.</p>
<p>In fact, without the leadership of large firms, the collective action problem inherent in trade association activity might never be surmounted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0007650309350211">Olson, 1965</xref>). Large firms often put forth the initial effort and resources essential for beginning new collective endeavors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0007650309350211">Hoffman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0007650309350211">Rees, 1994</xref>). Moreover, the involvement of dominant firms increases the perceived feasibility of resolution, thereby increasing the likelihood that firms will participate and a coalition will arise. Faced with an array of potential issues vying for their limited attention, firms tend to participate in those issues that they perceive as most likely to be resolved because involvement with failed issues provides no rewards to offset the costs of participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0007650309350211">Bacharach &amp; Lawler, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0007650309350211">Dutton &amp; Webster, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>The associated “follow the leader” behavior provides dominant firms the opportunity to set the agendas of their trade associations. Participation in a collaborative group such as a trade association is a mixed motive game involving simultaneous incentives to compete and cooperate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0007650309350211">Phillips, Lawrence, &amp; Hardy, 2000</xref>). Although member firms may share some common interests, they are ultimately rivals. There is no reason to believe that rivalry is set aside at the doorstep of a trade association. In fact, it seems more reasonable to believe that those firms with the power to sway trade association agendas actively seek to do so in their favor. Enterprising individuals and organizations have been shown to define, create, and manipulate issues to spur collective action toward some desired end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0007650309350211">Davis &amp; Thompson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0007650309350211">McCarthy &amp; Zald, 1977</xref>). Dominant firms in an industry are in a particularly opportune setting to define, create, and manipulate the problems that their trade association pursues.</p>
<p>The strategic intent behind some agenda setting efforts may be hidden. For example, a firm may champion a trade association program that mandates improvements in the social or environmental performance of an industry under the premise that the increased standards will improve the industry’s standing with regulators, customers, and other stakeholder groups. But if the championing firm can abide by these higher industry standards at a lower cost or in a superior way than can its rivals, then it gains competitive advantage. Large firms can have a strong hand in establishing these sorts of self-regulatory programs and so can shape these intraindustry policies in ways that play to their scale advantage. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0007650309350211">Gunningham (1995)</xref> discussed the role of Dow Chemical in guiding the development of the chemical industry’s self-regulatory program, Responsible Care, and how Dow was able to benefit from this program more easily than were smaller firms who could not spread their costs over such a large asset base. A variety of studies have documented that firms may strategically pursue changes in government policy and regulation that actually increase their regulatory burden as a means of raising rivals’ costs even more and deterring new entrance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0007650309350211">McWilliams, Van Fleet, &amp; Cory, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0007650309350211">Salop &amp; Scheffman, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0007650309350211">Williamson, 1968</xref>).</p>
<p>It is logical for large firms to initiate collective action on those issues for which they may receive private benefits more than ample to offset their costs of participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0007650309350211">Olson, 1965</xref>). But this logic does not suggest that smaller members of a trade association will knowingly subjugate their interests and willingly join efforts that disproportionately advantage their rivals. Especially in light of antitrust laws that limit the scope of coordination among rivals, it is not feasible for the dominant firms in an industry to force their trade association to pursue ventures that clearly disadvantage a substantial portion of the membership, no matter their relative power. However, many of the issues that trade associations face have subjective goals and largely intangible or distant measures of progress (e.g., choosing an ad campaign to improve public opinion, engaging a lobbyist to enhance the regulatory climate). Moreover, dominant firms hold considerable sway over smaller firms. They may use peer pressure or the threat of exclusion from business subcultures to forge cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0007650309350211">Galaskiewicz, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0007650309350211">Useem, 1984</xref>). This makes trade associations a fertile ground for enterprising firms to put forth their favored projects. In fact, a trade association provides the opportunity to engage in these practices more efficiently and effectively. By engaging a trade association instead of going it alone, a firm spreads the costs of its political and regulatory influence efforts.</p>
<p>In sum, the nature of the shared problems facing an industry is often subjective, which leaves the agenda of a trade association open to manipulation. Dominant firms have both the incentive and the ability to take the lead in mobilizing trade association activity. Other firms take their cue from dominant firms in deciding what constitutes a shared problem and whether or not collective action is likely to resolve it. Thus, dominant firms may seize the opportunity to mobilize trade associations to action to solve their particular problems rather than the problems of the industry as a whole. Therefore, I hypothesize the following:</p>

<title>Data and Method</title>
<p>The lack of prior empirical research on activity within trade associations over time may be due, in part, to the difficulty of finding useful longitudinal data. The <italic>Encyclopedia of Associations</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0007650309350211">Swartout, 2008</xref>) is the primary source of data on trade associations. It annually reports activity figures such as membership, budget, and staffing for all trade associations. However, the <italic>Encyclopedia of Associations</italic> relies on self-reporting. Whether out of desire to disguise true spending or lack of desire to report annually, many trade associations report no figures, similar figures, or very round figures each year. Thus, it serves as a poor source of analysis of variability in spending.</p>
<p>Given these limitations, I turned instead to a source of compulsory reporting. Trade associations, as 501(c) nonprofit organizations, are required to file the Internal Revenue Service Form 990 every year. The Form 990 requires detailed reporting of a trade association’s income and expenses. A check of this data, made available by The Urban Institute,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0007650309350211">5</xref></sup> revealed that, indeed, trade association activity is not stagnant. For example, although the <italic>Encyclopedia of Associations</italic> reported an unchanging budget of US$3 million for the National Petroleum Refiners Association from 1990 to 2000, Form 990 data showed that this trade association’s total expenses ranged from US$3,610,483 to US$7,266,164, its gross income varied from US$2,969,870 to US$5,091,364, and its gross receipts changed from US$4,825,223 to US$7,838,843 over this same period. Thus, the Form 990 data provide several precise measures of a trade association’s annual activity.</p>
<p>Though the <italic>Encyclopedia of Associations</italic> data are of limited use in assessing variability in a trade association’s activity over time, they help in choosing a sample from among the large population of trade associations. The <italic>Encyclopedia of Associations</italic> lists more than 22,000 associations. From this list, I selected a sample of 148 major industry trade associations based on several criteria. The electronic version of the <italic>Encyclopedia of Associations</italic>, “Associations Unlimited,” provides several options for selecting a sample. I chose only those trade associations that were national in scope so as to avoid double-counting regional associations. Furthermore, I limited the sample to mature trade associations to factor out volatility in activity based on early industry growth. To do this, I included only those trade associations founded in 1980 or earlier—a full decade prior to the beginning of the study period. In addition, I excluded any trade association with more than 1,000 members because such large associations were likely to be professional associations representing the interests of individuals (e.g., lawyers, doctors, actors), not firms. Finally, I restricted the sample to those associations with significant annual budgets, defined as greater than US$1 million, to increase the likelihood that each trade association had more than just a symbolic role in furthering the interests of its members.</p>
<p>This search produced 255 trade associations. I then reviewed on-line documentation for each of these associations to screen out those trade associations that met the above search criteria but did not actually represent the interests of for-profit member firms within a particular industry. For example, the search returned trade associations such as the International Cotton Advisory Committee (countries, not firms as members), the Society of Professional Benefit Administrators (individuals, not firms as members), and the International Trade Council (peak or meta-association serving no single industry). Moreover, I excluded those associations that were not fully discretionary but were partially or fully overseen by a government agency (e.g., U.S. Wheat Associates). Finally, I excluded those trade associations for which I could not find a valid employer identification number (EIN), which serves as a link to the Form 990 database, as well as those trade associations that did not have Form 990 data for at least 8 years of the total 11-year period of this study (1990 to 2000). This resulted in a final sample of 148 major and mature industry trade associations and 1,589 trade association / year observations. The <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0007650309350211">appendix</xref> provides a list of these trade associations along with some descriptive characteristics.</p>
<p>For the dependent variable in this study, I chose “annual total expenditures” (totexp). The Form 990 data provided annual figures for a variety of measures of trade association activity, such as the total dues paid, gross receipts, and gross income. I chose total expenditures because a trade association may accumulate assets and so has discretion as to when it may choose to add to or deplete these accumulated assets. Thus, a measure of total expenditures in a given year provides a more direct assessment of activity than does membership dues, gross receipts, or gross income. In other words, totexp assumes that trade associations will “put their money where their mouth is” and so will reveal their true agendas in the ways that they expend their resources over time.</p>
<p>There are two independent variables in this study—one measuring the annual performance of a given industry and the other measuring the annual performance of the dominant firms in that industry. Associations Unlimited provides one or more four-digit standard industrial classification (SIC) code for most trade associations. To augment this data where no SIC code was listed, to judge a primary SIC code where more than one SIC code was listed, and more generally, to serve as an additional check on what I have described above as often questionable data, an independent coder and I examined on-line documentation for each of the 148 trade associations. We independently determined the primary four-digit SIC code for each trade association. In any cases in which we had conflicting judgments, we discussed the cases and then came to a final mutual decision. In those cases in which our final choice of SIC conflicted with that of Associations Unlimited, we deferred to our judgment.</p>
<p>I measure the annual financial performance of a given industry with the variable “% profit for industry.” I computed % profit for industry as the total value of shipments for an industry in a particular year, less labor, material, and energy costs, all divided by total value of shipments. I obtained these figures from the U.S. Census Bureau’s <italic>Annual Survey of Manufacturers</italic> (ASM). Because of a change of classification system in 1997 (from SIC to NAICS), I could not obtain this measure after 1997. Thus, though the dependent variable spans 1990 to 2000, the time period over which the hypotheses can be tested is effectively restricted to the years 1990 to 1997.</p>
<p>To measure the annual financial performance of the dominant firms in a given industry (a test of Hypothesis 2), I turned to the Combined Compustat/CRSP Business Segment Database. ASM data are not available at the firm level. I computed the variable “% profit for top4” as the net operating profit (or loss) for the four largest firms (in terms of sales) in an industry as a percentage of that industry’s total assets. Compustat computes operating profit as operating revenue minus operating expense.</p>
<p>In addition to the above variables, I assembled several control variables. Trade associations with more members, all else equal, should have greater expenditures. Thus, I control for size through the variable “TA members.” Industries with high market concentration, wherein the bulk of market share is held by one or a few large firms, should have an easier time mobilizing for collective action than will industries with low market concentration, populated by a broad swath of small firms. I control for market concentration with the variable “HH index,” which is the Herfindahl–Hirschman index for each industry. The HH index takes account of the relative size and distribution of firms in an industry in forming an overarching measure of concentration. As noted above in my explanation of the chosen dependent variable, trade associations have discretion. I control for this discretion with the variables “age of TA” and “% rcpts not from dues.” As a trade association ages, it becomes more institutionalized and thus potentially more inertial. It may be difficult to disband the myriad projects and committees that arise over time. In addition, the more of a trade association’s receipts that are garnered through sources other than direct member dues, such as outside consulting, the more discretion the trade association maintains.</p>
<p>A major expense of trade associations is political lobbying. Therefore, I include a control for whether or not a trade association is headquartered in the Washington, D.C., area (DC office), as such positioning may be indicative of higher lobbying costs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0007650309350211">6</xref></sup> Finally, to control for any effects on the dependent variable caused by variation in the overall economy over time, I include “year dummies.”</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0007650309350211">Table 1</xref> provides descriptive statistics and correlation coefficients for these variables. Many of the correlations are significant. Therefore, I calculated variance inflation factors (VIFs) for each of the independent variables. These VIFs are well within the acceptable range, varying from 1.10 to 1.26, and so multicollinearity does not appear to be a problem.</p>

<p>Model 1 is an ordinary least squares regression model. The results of Model 1 show that % profit for industry is not a significant predictor of totexp, thus providing no support for Hypothesis 1. When % profit for top4 was added to the regression in Model 2, % profit for industry remained insignificant, but % profit for top4 was significant and negative at the <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01 level. These results indicate support for Hypothesis 2, wherein trade association expenditures are high when the profitability of dominant firms in an industry is low.</p>
<p>Across both models, several control variables produced significant results. TA members was positively related to totexp, suggesting that, as expected, trade associations with more members tend to have higher expenditures. HH index was also positive and significant, indicating that industries with greater concentration have higher trade association spending. Age of TA was also positive and significant, pointing to a somewhat slight tendency for older trade associations to have higher expenditures. Moreover, trade associations headquartered in the Washington, D.C., area, as expected, tended to outspend those headquartered elsewhere. The percentage of receipts of a trade association generated from sources other than member dues appeared to have no significant effect on trade association expenditures.</p>
<p>Models 3 and 4 show the output of a robust regression (rreg method in Stata). Robust regression limits the effects of outliers through weighting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0007650309350211">Rousseeuw &amp; Leroy, 1987</xref>). I ran robust regression to ensure that none of the larger trade associations had undue influence on the results. Again, the results support Hypothesis 2 and provide no support for Hypothesis 1. In fact, Model 4 shows some slight support for the notion that trade association activity is low when the profitability of the overall industry is low. This may be due to the difficulty of garnering resources from member firms when they face resource constraints. All control variables follow a very similar pattern to that found in Models 1 and 2.</p>
<p>Across this panel, all observations are not independent. The total expenditures of a given trade association are generally not independent of its expenditures in prior years. To account for this, in Models 5 and 6, I ran a robust cluster model. This model relaxes the assumption of independent observations within clusters; in this case, each cluster represents a single trade association. The results again appear to support Hypothesis 2 and provide results quite similar to the prior models, though several of the control variable effects become weaker.</p>
<p>As a stronger control for the lack of independence of observations within a trade association, Models 7 and 8 show the results of a between-effects regression model. This model effectively treats each trade association as a single observation and instead focuses on measuring variation across trade associations. The results are quite consistent with prior models, again lending support to Hypothesis 2, but further highlighting a constraint inherent in this study: The effects found within this panel are cross-sectional, not longitudinal.</p>
<p>Because of data constraints, the portion of the panel included in these regressions encompasses only the period from 1990 to 1997. The total expenditures within a given trade association often do not vary greatly over this time period. As a result, the data reveal little about differences in performance within a given trade association over the time period and instead serve as a test of differences across trade associations. Models 9 and 10, which are fixed effects regressions, confirm this. The fixed effects model factors out the average total expenditures for each trade association and seeks to explain differences within each trade association that deviate from this average factor or fixed effect. Both independent variables are insignificant in the fixed effects models. Moreover, the year dummies, though not listed independently in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0007650309350211">Table 2</xref>, become highly significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) in these models yet were generally not significant in the prior models.</p>
<p>The variables were assembled from differing sources, so not all variables were available for all trade associations for all years, leading to a significant decrease in the number of trade association / year observations included in the regression models. For example, some of the variables were available only for trade associations with manufacturing SIC codes, from 1990 to 1997. Other variables were available for all years and nonmanufacturing SIC codes but often not all of the same SIC codes as the other variables. Thus, there are 617 observations in the odd-numbered models and 489 in the even-numbered models. Because these two samples may have differing characteristics, I also ran each odd-numbered model on only those 489 observations in the even-numbered model sample. The results were nearly identical and produced identical directionality.</p>
<p>Some of the effects of the independent variables on the dependent variable may be lagged, as it may take some time to mobilize the trade association to increase spending in response to a decline in performance. I ran all 10 models with 1- and 2-year lags. This lagging further reduced the data set, providing somewhat weaker fit but overall similar results in terms of significance and directionality. These results are again consistent with the problem of limited variability in spending across years producing effectively a cross-sectional study.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The lack of research on trade associations has left a large and important part of the competitive landscape uncharted. The findings of this study are limited in significant ways, so they cannot provide a detailed map of the uncharted territory of trade associations, but they do suggest some basic points of interest that are worthy of more detailed mapping. This study was unable to explain variations in the activity of a given trade association over time. Nonetheless, in a robust manner and controlling for a variety of variables, this study found that across trade associations, low performance of their primary industry’s four largest firms was associated with high trade association expenditures, yet low performance of their primary industry was not associated with high trade association expenditures. This suggests that trade associations may speak for and serve the interests of the dominant firms in an industry more so than the interests of the industry as a whole.</p>
<p>Some of the findings across the models offer more nuance. Model 4 found that the performance of the industry was positively, though weakly, associated with the total expenditures of its trade association. Though inferences must be made with caution given the limits of the data, this finding suggests that not only may the industry’s voice be primarily that of the dominant firms, but these dominant firms may have an easier time pushing their agendas when the members firms have slack resources, as contrasted with the difficulty they would face in garnering additional funds to pursue their agendas during lean times.</p>
<p>The findings of the fixed effects analyses offer a bit more insight. Models 9 and 10 show a strong positive relationship between the percentage of a trade association’s receipts derived from sources other than membership dues and trade association spending. This suggests that as trade associations secure more funding independent of direct dues payments, they tend to make use of this discretion in spending rather than by contributing to reserves. The average nondues income in the sample is 44%, and it can rise to as high as 99%. Thus, it appears that trade associations are fairly independent bodies, able to survive, and spend, in the near term without necessarily having to directly raise member dues. Instead, a significant portion of receipts may come from interest on investments or the sale of assets, or from trade association activities such as program service revenues and meetings and seminars. With such a high level of financial discretion, it seems all the more important to understand how trade associations choose to spend their funds.</p>
<p>Trade associations occupy a tricky legal space that sometimes borders on violation of antitrust laws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0007650309350211">Luria, 2005</xref>). Though trade associations explicitly involve coordination among rivals, trade associations are allowed to exist under the premise that they serve as a means of resolving shared problems in a way that advances competition while avoiding collusion. If, indeed, trade associations tend to be tools of domination by powerful firms, their antitrust exemption becomes questionable. The findings in this article are not adequate to draw such a conclusion, but they do point to the need for further investigation of just how trade associations work.</p>
<p>For firms that do not dominate their industries—that is, most firms—these findings should give pause for reflection on the benefits they receive relative to the contributions they make to their trade associations. Paying trade association dues may be more or less a rote exercise for most firms, and managers may have no more an expectation of measurable financial returns from these investments than they have from, say, sponsorship of a local little league team. However, when member firms are called on to increase their involvement or support particular trade association initiatives, they should not simply assume that these efforts are in their best interests and so worth pursuing. Instead, they should give consideration to the possibility that they may be using their limited resources in a way that contributes more to the advancement of their rivals’ interests than to their industry’s shared interests.</p>
<p>The management research on trade associations is limited, but it does recognize that these organizations face an ongoing tension associated with size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0007650309350211">Aldrich, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0007650309350211">Schmitter &amp; Streeck, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0007650309350211">Van Waarden, 1992</xref>). Each trade association, as an organization pursuing its own interests, wishes to gain membership and grow larger. Member firms can benefit from increased size because it can bring with it increased influence. However, as a trade association gets larger and its membership grows more diverse, it becomes less able to fully satisfy the unique needs of its individual members, and so this leads to pressure to splinter into subgroups. The findings of this study cannot conclude when a firm no longer fits with its trade association, but it does provide some suggestion that smaller firms may be remaining in large associations longer than they should and might better be served by splintering into smaller specialized trade associations with less heterogeneity in size and power. A smaller trade association means less influence, but it may be that this lessened influence is of greater benefit to its members than is being part of a larger organization that predominantly serves the interests of larger rivals.</p>
<p>Overall, this study helps bring the field a little closer to understanding the drivers of trade association activity, but obviously much more needs to be done. For one, future studies would benefit greatly from lengthier windows. Prior studies in the ecological tradition had very lengthy windows but did not focus on variations in activity within trade associations. The combination of long windows and performance data would be ideal. Trade association activity appears to be fairly constant in the short run. Longer time periods are necessary to evince any measurable disruptions. However, given the underdeveloped state of this literature, it may be necessary to first proceed with smaller scale studies. Qualitative studies may be necessary to observe and understand the actual mechanisms. Although motives can be inferred from spending patterns and other such outcome measures over time, it would be particularly insightful to directly observe trade association activity through field studies. Such work would be laborious, of course, and it could be difficult to gain access to trade associations, but where feasible, such studies offer great promise of rich insight into the workings of these important organizations.</p>
<p>Future studies should also look at the ways in which factors other than changes in profit affect changes in trade association activity. I operationalized a shared problem as a decline in the industry’s profitability. Collective action can be difficult to organize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0007650309350211">Olson, 1965</xref>) especially in the face of ill-defined threats. A decline in profitability would seem to be a tangible and significant threat and so a conservative measure of what might spur firms to take collective action through their trade associations. However, trade associations may not be spurred to action when profit declines if they perceive the decline in profit as relating to factors outside of their control. The inclusion of year effects in this study helped alleviate some concern that exogenous macroeconomic factors such as a general market downturn in any given year might be responsible for trade association activity. However, this study could not determine whether firms perceived any change in industry profitability as something they could influence through trade association activity. Moreover, it is possible that firms may perceive other actions as shared threats, to cope with through trade association activity, before they cause any decline in industry profitability. For example, firms may recognize negative press coverage, looming lawsuits, or a general decline in reputation scores as signaling problems and take action in advance. Future studies should further explore how firms come to recognize shared threats and just how serious the threat must be perceived to be before it spurs collective action (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0007650309350211">Hoffman &amp; Ocasio, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, I stepped down from the population level of analysis at which the few prior studies in the organizations literature resided (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0007650309350211">Aldrich &amp; Staber, 1988</xref>) to look inside trade associations. Nonetheless, the level of insight I was able to garner with the data available was still too abstract to enable strong inference about the inner workings of trade associations. To develop richer insights, future studies will need to gather data that likely will only be feasible to collect through smaller sample sizes. For example, with 148 trade associations, each with membership bases ranging into the hundreds and spanning many years, I was unable to verify that the largest firms in each industry were always members of the trade association affiliated with that industry in this study. Firms may come and go from a trade association over time for any of a number of reasons. Thus, it is possible that even though a firm is a dominant firm in an industry, in any given year it may not be a member of that industry’s major trade association.</p>
<p>Trade associations generally do not provide direct access to their membership archives over time. In this study, I checked a sample of five trade associations to confirm that the current membership rosters contained the “top four” firms in their industry during the study period. Of the 20 firms, I could not account for 2. Because I do not have the membership rosters over time and instead am relying on a current membership roster, it is possible that these two firms were members during the study period, but I cannot say with certainty. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0007650309350211">Staber’s (1987)</xref> interviews of trade associations in the manufacturing sector add confidence that this is unlikely to be a significant problem:
<disp-quote>
<p>Most associations are highly representative of the domain they cover, regardless of their size. Ninety-three per cent cover more than half of their members’ industry share, and 74 per cent represent more than three-quarters of their domain . . . all but one represent the four largest producers in their industry. (p. 284)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another limitation of the large sample study I conducted is that I was unable to account for the performance of private firms. I relied on Compustat/CRSP for firm-level performance data. As a result, though I tested for whether or not trade association activity was reliant on changes in the performance of dominant firms, I was unable to contrast changes in large firm performance with changes in the profitability of smaller firms, or even many medium-sized firms in the same industry, since these tend not to be publicly listed. Smaller sample studies might be able to obtain useful performance measures for the entirety of their member firms and so contrast large firm effects with those of medium and small firms to better specify the true drivers of trade association activity.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to note that the broad view of trade associations taken in this study did not allow me to determine the fit between the mission of any particular trade association and the performance of the particular four-digit SIC industry to which I assigned it. As noted previously, I did follow a systematic process for determining the appropriate industry for a given trade association. But this process cannot ensure that the firms within a given SIC rely on that particular trade association exclusively to manage their shared problems. Future smaller scale studies might be able to determine performance of the relevant population of a given trade association at a finer-grained level than that of the four-digit SIC code.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Because firms face many critical interdependencies, strategy researchers have broadly concluded that competition alone is insufficient for the success and survival of most firms. Environmental conditions often affect the likelihood of survival not of individual firms but of groups of firms and entire industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0007650309350211">Astley &amp; Fombrun, 1983</xref>). Firms may find that their reputations and performance are intertwined such that the acts of one firm can harm similar other firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0007650309350211">Barnett &amp; Hoffman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0007650309350211">King, Lenox, &amp; Barnett, 2002</xref>). To cope with these interdependencies, rivalrous firms often must cooperate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0007650309350211">Barnett, 2006a</xref>). Especially, in recent years, as many industries have come under attack from increasingly powerful constituent groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0007650309350211">Davis &amp; Thompson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0007650309350211">Freeman, 1984</xref>) and government has relaxed many relevant antitrust concerns, firms have coordinated more of their efforts through trade associations. Many industry trade associations now go so far as to stringently regulate and standardize the behavior of member firms through industry self-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0007650309350211">Barnett &amp; King, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0007650309350211">Prakash &amp; Potoski, 2006</xref>). Thus, it is all the more important to understand what goes on within trade associations over time.</p>
<p>It is important to note that firms do not rely exclusively on trade associations to deal with problems in their competitive environments. “Communal strategies” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0007650309350211">Barnett, 2006a</xref>) may be operationalized through venues other than industry trade associations or through multiple trade associations. In addition, when individual firms, especially dominant firms, experience difficult times, they may engage in a variety of individual strategies, such as lobbying and contributions to political action committees. The literature has tended to describe such activities in terms of a dichotomy—firms either act individually to pursue their own nonmarket or political activities, or they join collective efforts such as those of trade associations (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0007650309350211">Hillman &amp; Hitt, 1999</xref>). The costs of individually pursuing these activities are high and often may not be effective at favorably influencing the competitive environment. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0007650309350211">Astley and Fombrun (1983)</xref> argued, “the very impotence of organizations acting in isolation merely elevates the importance of collective action” (p. 582). As a result, trade associations, wherein the costs are pooled and the influence enhanced, are often the primary means of influencing the competitive environment. The findings of this study suggest a sort of third “hybrid” form whereby large firms might use trade associations to pursue their individual goals, effectively leveraging the might of the trade association at a fractional cost of engaging in these efforts alone. Future studies should seek to parse out the degree to which they turn to each of these varying activities. The more refined such work becomes the closer we will come to achieving “the most basic operational requirement in the formulation and implementation of strategy,” which is to explain the degree to which rivalrous firms also choose to “take on responsibilities as members of a larger social entity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0007650309350211">Astley &amp; Fombrun, 1983</xref>, p. 585).</p>

<p>“One voice” is a common motto of trade associations of all sizes throughout the world. See, for example, the Georgia Urban Agriculture Council (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.urbanagcouncil.com">www.urbanagcouncil.com</ext-link>), whose mission statement is “to address issues of common interest as “one voice—one industry,” or the British Insurance Brokers’ Association (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biba.org.uk">www.biba.org.uk</ext-link>), which touts “One voice. Strength in numbers.” In his interviews of trade association executives, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0007650309350211">Staber (1987)</xref> found the phrase “speak with one voice” to be a common characterization.</p>

<p>Dues vary by trade association and are often based on firm size. Industry trade associations typically do not make public the amount of dues paid by individual firms. The figures cited here are likely at the upper end of the range, representing the amount of dues paid by the largest firms in the most active trade associations.</p>

<p>Form 990 data are publicly available through a variety of sources, such as the Foundation Center, but typically not in aggregate form. The Urban Institute was kind enough to provide aggregated data.</p>

<p>The DC office control is a common (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0007650309350211">Lenway &amp; Rehbein, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0007650309350211">Schuler, 1996</xref>) but blunt indicator that an organization has a high level of lobbying expenditures. Lobbying may occur in other ways and at other levels, such as the state. However, it is not feasible to obtain a list of the states in which each trade association has a lobbying office, over time, and moreover, it is not clear how one would weight such information. For example, would a Rhode Island office be comparable to a California office? Thus, I retained the common DC office proxy.</p>

<p><bold>Michael L. Barnett</bold> is Professor 1 in the Management and Global Business Department and Vice Dean for Academic Programs at Rutgers Business School–Newark and New Brunswick. Mike’s research focuses on the firm-stakeholder interface.
