<p>This exciting contribution remakes the world and practice of social work. The best novel I know that challenges modernist empiricism is the African-American postmodern writer Colson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1473325013486574b">Whitehead's <italic>The Intuitionist</italic> (1999)</xref>. Its plot revolves around two competing camps of elevator inspection: the empiricists and the intuitionists. Heirs of the Enlightenment, the prevailing empiricists cleave to elevator knowledge guided by ‘the light of reason and what they could see’ (p. 27, 239); intuitionist philosophy, which is mocked by the empiricists as voodoo and witchery, offers another way of knowing in its critique of scientific rationality and its wish to instruct ‘the dull and plodding citizens of modernity that there is a power beyond rationality’ (p. 231). While I certainly do not want to cast our empiricist friends as dull and plodding … this book, <italic>Social Construction and Social Work Practice,</italic> is a remarkable illustration of how a social constructionist and postmodern approach to social work practice can richly bring our work of social work engagingly to life in ways that evidence-based practice can never hope to accomplish.</p>
<p>As the reviewer I would like to place my cards face up on the table. I see the self and the world through the cultural, philosophical and literary lenses of postmodernism. Coming to know from a rationalist-empiricist Enlightenment standpoint, the basis for most of social work education and practice even today, enacts the premise of a rational correspondence between the individual mind and the objective world, the correspondence theory of truth (or mirror theory or representational theory) which I have long disavowed. This model assumes that there is a structural affinity between the subject who seeks to know and the object to be known. Philosophically this is known as realism which tells us that the representational field of space and time that we as subjects inhabit and move through corresponds to the objective world itself. The postmodern perspective argues that realism – we have put there what we claim is there independently – has stacked the deck, pre-arranged the cards and done nothing more than construct a world according to this frame. Deconstruction in the work of Derrida, Foucault and many others has sought to discredit realism and representation itself – to show the artlessness of realism, its pretense that objective reality out there could be accurately and reliably represented through words. For cultural theorist Roland Barthes realism is sheer ideology masquerading as objective reality; the real is only that which hegemonic power calls the real. Postmodernism's stance is the radical abandonment of anything ‘out there’ as reliably knowable and therefore credibly representable as absolute truth. It has been noted that ‘postmodernism is the resumption of rhetoric in the wake of representation’ (p. 179). Philosopher Richard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1473325013486574b">Rorty writes in <italic>Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity</italic> (1989)</xref> ‘that the human subject is created by the use of a vocabulary rather than being adequately or inadequately expressed in a vocabulary’ (p. 7).</p>
<p>With this volume Stanley Witkin, of the University of Vermont, has edited the most original contribution to social work scholarship and practice in many years and shows convincingly that social work can be sprung free from Enlightenment fiat. It could well take its place beside and as the latest in a short list of classic works in social work: Jane Addams, Mary Richmond, Charlotte Towle, Ruth Smalley, Florence Hollis, Helen Harris Perlman … He established himself as an exceptional editor of NASW's journal <italic>Social Work</italic> (1998–2002) and in that position brought the journal fully into the intellectual postmodern era; as well, he wrote many remarkable editorials displaying a rare, bold and exciting intellectual range. Witkin also co-edited a previous book with Dennis Saleebey, <italic>Social Work Dialogues: Transforming the Canon in Inquiry, Practice, and Education</italic> (2007); both books come out of the small annual gathering in Burlington, Vermont organized by Witkin and Saleebey (who retired several years ago) which has generated several days of spirited dialogue every fall for the past twelve years about social construction and postmodernism as they inform and change social work practice. The umbrella organization for this gathering is called the <italic>Global Partnership for Transformative Social Work</italic> – more detail is to be found on the website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gptsw.net/index.html">http://www.gptsw.net/index.html</ext-link>.</p>
<p>The book consists of a lovely foreword by Dennis Saleebey, a preface, and twelve finely-crafted chapters by authors representing six different countries (Australia, Canada, China (Hong Kong), Ireland, UK, USA). There is an old joke that in considering a proposal the British will say ‘well, it works fine in theory but will it work in practice?’; whereas the French say ‘well, it works fine in practice but will it work in theory?’ The chapters in this collection bring together theory and practice in a fertile and generative manner that is seldom seen in academic social work literature. It is a contribution both to postmodern theory, social construction and individual fields of social work practice tapped into through the individual essays. All the chapters are well written, some with flair and elegance, all very readable, a tribute to Witkin's editorial proficiency. He acknowledges the editorial assistance of his daughter and wife. ‘The book,’ Witkin notes, ‘is written in a style intended to be reader accessible, particularly to those not versed in “postmodern speak”’ (p. 4). In preparing their chapters each author was encouraged to: (1) tell something geographically, culturally, socially, and professionally about themselves; (2) explain the history of their relationship with social construction; (3) discuss their understanding of social construction; (4) discuss how their practice is informed by ideas taken from social construction; (5) discuss their social work practice illustrating with case examples; (6) explain how they negotiate in their places of work to stick to the tenets of social construction in a context of managerialism and empirical accountability; (7) speculate on the future of social construction.</p>
<p>Two themes from my reading of the book are prevalent throughout the chapters. The first is nicely captured in a quote from the philosopher and literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin: ‘truth is not born nor is it found inside the head of an individual person; it is born between people collectively searching for the truth, in the process of their dialogic interaction’ (p. 110). This comment relates to Bakhtin's distinction between monologism and dialogism: the former disregards the existence of another <italic>I</italic> where another person is only an object of consciousness, our Cartesian culture of mastery and possession; dialogism in speech acts is always responsive to the other and is created with the expectation of a response. The second leitmotif I derive in opposition to Immanuel Kant combined with the thought of the postmodern French literary figure Helene Cixous. In his <italic>Critique of Pure Reason</italic> (1781) Kant claims to have ‘explored the territory of pure understanding’ a territory that he goes on to describe as an island – ‘the land of truth’ – surrounded ‘by a wide and stormy ocean’ shrouded in fog (p. 257). Now, from a postmodern perspective, the fog has rolled over Kant's ‘land of truth’ no longer permitting absolute universal truth or certainty. For Cixous what can only be true and only temporarily is what is created by the poetic and literary imagination. What ‘is indissociable from human life,’ Cixous maintains, is instability, uncertainty, ambiguity, the undecidable. In her luminous phrases, she conveys that ‘the thinking that addresses the undecidable is the thinking of tolerance, the thinking that does not sever the thinking capable of turning in on itself to make room for difference’ (pp. 52, 83). Hence, multiplicities and pluralities of voices are opened up. While these two themes are not explicitly stated in the book in the way I have described them they are there in each chapter nuanced and reflective.</p>
<p>While each of the twelve chapters rewards with fresh and innovative slants on theory and practice there are four that I will comment on briefly. Witkin's chapter, <italic>An Introduction to Social Constructions,</italic> is a succinct and carefully crafted appraisal of postmodernism and social constructionism. For those who have no familiarity or are just becoming acquainted with these ideas the chapter is the best introduction I know to a vast and complex topic. For those already familiar with the delights that are to be found from these perspectives the chapter reaffirms just how exciting it is to be a social worker equipped with multivocality and an approach to people and the world informed by philosophy, literature and the arts. Witkin's erudition is fully on display but never obscure or heavy-handed. Readers will not have to thrash through an impenetrable forest of bamboo. As well, he makes readily understood and insightful connections to social work practice and the chapter will be very welcome for those teaching courses incorporating social constructionist approaches.</p>
<p>Sally St. George and Dan Wulff both at the University of Calgary lay out in <italic>Family Therapy with a Larger Aim,</italic> how to connect problems that emerge in clinical settings with the larger social context and social ills that almost always contribute to the troubled discourses that arise in working with families in clinical situations. Deftly weaving together social constructionist ideas with family therapy and social work they illustrate with case examples their approaches to questions of gender inequalities and societal violence. ‘This blending of therapeutic work and activism,’ they write, ‘presents a challenging new frontier in how we might imagine clinical practice’ (p. 213). Each has a separate section in the chapter.</p>
<p>Sally St. George uses the expression, ‘women supporting women’ to counter she says, ‘the discouraged and heartsick feelings’ she has when working with mothers and daughters who are locked in seemingly inescapable oppositional conversations. For St. George the phrase points to a resistance to ‘repeating the language, hierarchies, and experiences’ of women in their everyday lives; it is also a reminder for women to avoid re-enacting these behaviors in the home, especially between mothers and daughters. She draws on the extensive scholarship of Ken Gergen to fashion ideas that she uses ‘in working with mother-daughter conflict from a social constructionist stance and incorporating a kind of <italic>gentle gender</italic> talk’ (pp. 214--215). From the many examples St. George provides it is evident she is a skilled, caring and thoughtful therapist as she helps those who come to her to consider a constellation of new possible constructions for their lives.</p>
<p>Dan Wulff has a particular interest in violence and works from the perspective that ‘responding to children/adolescents in strong and domineering ways … may actually re-inscribe our society's already well-developed allegiance to violence and its tactics … ’ (p. 227). He shifts the focus from the violent individual to violence itself being the culprit and in his encounters he promotes, following Michael White and David Epston, the use of a different set of languages that are non-violent. Wulff never loses sight of the larger social contexts of violence: in sports, in the environment, in advertising, and in our economic policies. He provides lively and refreshing examples of his work that will appeal to practitioners.</p>
<p>In her chapter, <italic>Opening a Space for Hope in a Landscape of Despair: Trauma and Violence Work with Men Who Have Sexually Abused Minors,</italic> Marie Keenan, who lectures at the School of Applied Social Science, University College Dublin, and is a social worker and psychotherapist demonstrates the contributions of a social constructionist approach with child sexual offenders. She highlights how in her dialogical conversations with sexual offenders she examines the challenges of creating a space where reflective and meaningful dialogue can occur and where hope can survive. She creatively draws on an allegory from ancient Celtic mythology, ‘The Fifth Province’ to help visualize a safe dialogical space.</p>
<p>Keenan became familiar with the notion from reading the work of two Irish philosophers who suggest that the Fifth Province symbolizes ‘a neutral ground where things can detach themselves from all partisan and prejudiced connections and show themselves for what they really are’. It is a province of imagination, ‘an archetypal imaginary meeting place where even the most ordinary things could be seen in an unusual light.’ It is a place for new understandings and where all oppositions can be resolved. It reminded me of Foucault's <italic>heterotopia</italic>. In several brilliant paragraphs Keenan explains how she translates this imagined space into an ‘expansive speaking site’ (pp. 251--252) in her work with male sexual offenders. Her chapter is a sparkling example of how social work can draw on the arts for ideas and need not always be so dependent on the social sciences.</p>
<p>Martha Kuwee Kumsa's (Faculty of Social Work, Wilfrid Laurier University, Ontario, Canada) chapter, <italic>When Woman-at-Risk Meets Youth-at-Risk: Engaging the Discursive Practices of the Nation-State,</italic> moves with a humming beauty in its passion, courage, and struggle. It is an autoethnographic story in three parts where she challenges the dominance of the Western world as she takes us on a journey to lives situated in very different cultural contexts. It is the most poignant chapter in the book, written with a lyrical intelligence that takes us to the edge of the world.</p>
<p>These four chapters illustrate the book's far-reaching scope and value. Other chapters equally worth reading are by Ruth Dean (Simmons College School of Social Work in Boston), Fiona Gardner (La Trobe University, Australia), Chris Hall (University of North Carolina), Deborah Major (Catholic Charities, Chicago), Nigel Parton (University of Huddersfield, UK), Wai-Fong Ting (Hong Kong Polytechnic University), Trish Walsh (Trinity College, Dublin).</p>
<p>If you want your social work to be replete with notions of the truth as something to be plucked, polished and transported across the ages, with standards and values to be delivered <italic>ex cathedra</italic> and objectively fronted by Doric columns then reading this book compellingly introduces alternative ways of casting reality and working differently with those who have difficulty living in one kind of created world as though it is the only possibility. If you already adhere to social constructionist ideas then the book will provide marvelous and insightful practice applications. It is a wonderful book for classroom use and should find its way into many courses in social work education as well as other fields – sociology, women's studies, cultural studies, philosophy … Witkin and the authors have given us an inspired work of spacious conversations, a work that invigorates and vivifies the field of social work and in the poet Robert Lowell's phrase affirms that ‘all's possible, all's unpredictable’ (p. 133). We are fortunate to have this volume in our midst.</p>
