<abstract>
<p>This paper examines reading behaviour in readers of printed and online newspaper media. The aim is to identify how much reading behaviour is dependent on various presentation factors, and how this dependence and its magnitude are related to output media. The work is based on review and analysis of empirical studies, primarily those employing methods using eye-tracking. The results show that some factors, such as text-based elements, size and placement, are an important guide to salience in both media. Images, on the other hand, have mostly been found not to elicit major visual attention online, affecting, for example, how ads are perceived. Reading behaviour is, however, a complicated process, and eye-tracking research does not consistently point in one direction.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The medium is not the message. An aim of newspaper producers is to get the reader to read the newspaper, independent of the media it is presented upon. To a large extent the medium should be immediate, that is, the user should be so absorbed by the interface, content and design that the medium itself does not matter. For both paper and screen media, reading should be effortless. To support readability, the use of formal conventions for presentation is a major precondition; simple and consistent layout cues beyond conscious notice provide orientation and structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1470357211434029">Lemken, 1999</xref>), and alert the user to the type of content the document will likely contain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1470357211434029">Toms and Campbell, 1999</xref>). With new technologies, however, there is no established, straightforward way to present content. Digital media are often depending on formats derived from earlier technologies, instead of exploiting their own expressive power. Knowledge of how information is processed and what information receives attention will help to facilitate the development of newspaper media.</p>
<sec id="section2-1470357211434029">
<title>Scope</title>
<p>This work examines how presentation factors and styles affect reading behaviour<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1470357211434029">1</xref></sup> in readers of newspaper content within the same medium, and additionally compares behaviour in readers of printed (‘old’) and online (‘new’) newspaper media. Presentation factors include visual and textual elements such as images, headlines, drop quotes, fact boxes, etc. but also interface, format, typography, page layout, etc., as well as size, placement, and colour.</p>
<p>The purpose of this work is to determine how a reader consumes a newspaper medium and what the reader consumes, as well as how reading behaviour differs between newspaper media. The following questions are of primary interest. How do format and structure change? Where do readers start reading? How important are the position, size and colour of objects? Do readers notice advertisements, and to what extent does this depend on design and placement? These questions support the underlying question: what can be said about the future of the newspaper genre?</p>

<title>Research conducted in the field and reviewed in this study</title>
<p>This work is based on review and secondary analysis of empirical studies conducted of newspaper reading behaviour. It has focused on previous work using eye-tracking methods. Eye-tracking is a collective name for several methods that register where subjects position their eyes, which search or reading strategies the subjects use (spatial variations), and how long they linger at one location (temporal variations) of a stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470357211434029">Duchowski, 2003</xref>). It is hence an objective way to measure what is consumed in a stimulus such as a newspaper. However, it does not tell us why subjects position their eyes on certain elements or why they use a specific strategy. Thus, eye-tracking studies are often complemented with additional question-based methods, such as interviews, questionnaires and think-aloud methods.</p>
<p>Explorative and experimental eye-tracking studies focusing exclusively on newspaper reading are relatively few and were introduced in the late 1980s. The most frequent and earliest studies concern print, but today also include online newspapers, as well as comparisons between the two media. No similar review to this one has been found, although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1470357211434029">Sternvik (2004)</xref> provides an overview of some of the printed newspaper behaviour included in this work, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1470357211434029">Leckner (2011)</xref> presents an overview on factors influencing reading behaviour of newspapers other than the presentation factors covered in the present work, such as the reading process, reading paths, quantity of reading and reading depending on media and content.</p>
<p>Reading behaviour is a complex phenomenon, and eye-tracking methodology induces several limitations. Eye-tracking studies are performed under artificial conditions; the subjects may be affected and behave differently than they normally do, even if they say they do not. The characteristics of the stimuli matter; whether the stimuli are mock-ups or real editions, tabloids or broadsheets, spreads or single page, as well as type of newspaper, demographics, or output medium. When a study is performed is also important; research performed when colour images in newspapers were uncommon, that is, up until the latter part of the 1990s, might yield different results today when coloured newspapers are the praxis. Moreover, individual differences in reading behaviour exist on both cognitive and emotional levels,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1470357211434029">2</xref></sup> and affect reading and legibility. These factors increase the possibility for contradictory results, not uncommon in eye-tracking research.</p>

<title>Overview</title>
<p>The main section of this work concerns the influence of presentation factors on reading behaviour of newspapers. Before this section, a brief background on new and old media in terms of newspapers is given, followed by a description of the newspaper genre and how it changes depending on media output. The main section presents how various presentation factors affect reading behaviour. The consequence of these behaviours within and across media outputs is then discussed.</p>

<title>Current Trends In Newspaper Media</title>
<p>Newspapers are one of the oldest, most ubiquitous and most standardized elements in the modern media landscape, very closely associated with ink printed on paper. The continued existence of newsprint is, however, being questioned. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470357211434029">Fidler (2000</xref>: 3), for example, believes that ‘ink-on-paper newspapers have been pushed to their practical limit’ and that ‘no future redesign, content improvement or advanced colour press can be expected to displace broadcast and cyber media or to recapture lost audiences and advertisers’. Fidler asserts that, if newspaper publishers are to survive and thrive, they must be prepared to abandon ‘the last vestiges of industrial age publishing – printing presses and delivery trucks’.</p>
<p>But not everyone has given up the belief in newspapers continued existence, and some argue that the printed newspaper can still refashion itself to compete, or complement, digital media. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470357211434029">Garcia (2005</xref>: 2), for example, holds that ‘everything makes a comeback’ and that ‘things tend to simplify themselves’. For printed news media this translates into smaller formats, simpler and more reader-friendly storytelling, and quicker messages. And globally, there is an ongoing trend towards more compact newspaper formats, such as tabloid (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1470357211434029">Sternvik, 2009</xref>), or to the even smaller micro format (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470357211434029">Garcia, 2005</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1470357211434029">3</xref></sup>. This downscaled format is a prerequisite for ‘readers in a hurry’, for example commuters, and a signal to the readers (especially younger ones) that a change is taking place. Research indicates that readers have a preference for more compact formats (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1470357211434029">Schumacher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1470357211434029">Sternvik, 2009</xref>), especially in women and younger adults, and in heavy commuter markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470357211434029">Khattak, 2005</xref>). Reading habits have changed over the past decades, the number of roaming readers has increased, newspapers are read outside the homes to a greater extent, and cultural habits in society are becoming more individualized. Other reasons for downscaling formats are increased competition from other media channels and advertising markets, as well as decreased economic resources (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1470357211434029">Sternvik, 2005a</xref>).</p>
<p>Naturally, format changes mean that the entire content included in a previously larger format will not fit. A smaller format means that articles are shorter, since a newspaper cannot be too voluminous, that typographic styles must be changed, that images become more dominant, and that sectionalizing is more difficult, that is, effort must be placed on design in order to keep readers’ interest focused (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470357211434029">Garcia, 2005</xref>). Format changes can be positive for a newspaper’s development, but make it harder to be distinctive from competitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470357211434029">Khattak, 2005</xref>). To the readers, qualities such as a suitable newspaper format, are considered more important than an interesting content and an additional online edition, but less important than trustworthiness, on-time delivery, and navigation and readability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1470357211434029">Nordicom, 2007</xref>: 101). These reader opinions have been fairly consistent for several years; however, the importance of a modern format has increased in later years. Recent research has, however, shown that readers are less satisfied with the content of the compact format, which is considered to have become shorter and shallower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1470357211434029">Sternvik, 2009</xref>). Sternvik states that this tendency might not be caused by the format change per se, but is due to other factors, such as decrease of personnel and administrative resources at many newspaper companies.</p>

<title>Structures Of Newspaper Media</title>
<p>In the traditional newspaper format (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1470357211434029">Figure 1a</xref>), information can be organized in various ways (see e.g. the organizational systems<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1470357211434029">4</xref></sup> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470357211434029">Kress and van Leeuwen, 2006</xref>), although the layout and usage are familiar (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470357211434029">Ihlström and Åkesson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470357211434029">Sternvik, 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470357211434029">Kress and van Leeuwen, 2006</xref>). The front page includes the masthead, and presents teasers classified into broad categories (e.g. Politics, Sports, Culture), promoted by bold headlines and images. In the interior sections, articles tend to be organized by topic, containing related articles, images and sidebars – all part of a structure helping the reader to find relevant information and drawing a connection between the various pieces of information, as well as minimizing interference from non-relevant articles. In webpage architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1470357211434029">Figure 1b</xref>), the modes of information operate under another logic: the ‘traditional’ web front page is commonly hierarchically structured, including one or a few images, and the layout factors are of similar size. The text is presented in relatively short briefs, or in link lists and tables. The content is highlighted through the use of lists, bullets and/or icons. An important aspect is the spatial and temporal difference caused by the necessity of scrolling and linking (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1470357211434029">Knox, 2007</xref>). However, features of the traditional newspaper genre can be mapped onto the computer user interface (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470357211434029">Cooke, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470357211434029">Ihlström and Åkesson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1470357211434029">Seelig, 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1470357211434029">Figure 1c</xref>), and aid the user’s understanding of the content. Naturally, all aspects of the newspaper genre cannot to be duplicated onto a digital rendition, and the digital edition can provide factors not feasible in the printed version, for example two-way communication and multiple media.</p>

<title>Presentation Factors</title>
<p>A critical concern is to ensure that the layout, structure and typography are affected in the ‘right’ manner. Some design factors, commonly translated into visual cues, are local in nature (e.g. information graphics), whereas others are global (e.g. newspaper format, typography). Local design factors can be applied selectively to an individual article, while global design factors tend to affect overall newspaper design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470357211434029">Holmberg, 2004</xref>). If the relation between two design factors (modes of information) is complementary rather than competitive, this will facilitate article comprehension, and thus, increase the probability of readers reading these articles in greater depth.</p>
<sec id="section8-1470357211434029">
<title>Cues</title>
<p>Although daily printed newspapers have changed during the 20th century in form, layout and content, the changes have been quite homogenous across newspaper brands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470357211434029">Sternvik, 2005b)</xref>. Tewksbury and Althaus claim that a ‘part of the educational function of the press is rooted in standardized news presentation formats’, and that editors select news through relatively consistent rules regarding the importance of story and layout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1470357211434029">Tewksbury and Althaus, 2000</xref>: 1). The editors thereby guide the news-consumption process of many readers: deliberately (by promoting what the editors consider important), or non-deliberately (by clear layout and easy overview). Design factors such as <italic>cues, entry points</italic> or <italic>style patterns</italic> are used for this purpose (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470357211434029">Garcia and Stark, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470357211434029">Holmqvist and Wartenberg, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470357211434029">Graber (1988)</xref> suggests that the most important criteria readers of print newspapers apply to article selection, are story-importance cues supplied by editors, and the match between story topics and the readers’ own interest. In print newspapers, cues are elements such as the position of an article on the page, the position of an article within a section, the use of images and graphics, size (of headlines, text, images), and the use of paragraphs, typographical elements and colours. Specific online cues exist in the form of icons, animated elements, location and order of headlines, etc.</p>
<p>It has been implied (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1470357211434029">Tewksbury and Althaus, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470357211434029">de Waal et al., 2004</xref>) that relative to print newspapers, online newspapers provide fewer and reorganized cues concerning news-story importance. Hence, readers receive less guidance regarding story selection, which makes them use their own interest as a guiding criterion. Consequently, readers online may acquire less information about certain topics, such as national, international and political events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1470357211434029">Tewksbury and Althaus, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470357211434029">de Waal et al., 2004</xref>). Another consequence is that some readers find it hard to locate and overview information. When paper documents evolve into digital form, the cues intrinsic to paper may not be transferred, or even transferable. Hence, users may require additional effort to make sense of the digital content, adding to their cognitive load, potentially leading to misunderstanding and misinterpretation. This is, however, not necessarily caused by fewer cues, but by different ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1470357211434029">Toms and Campbell, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470357211434029">Holsanova and Holmqvist, 2004</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section9-1470357211434029">
<title>Cues in printed newspapers</title>
<p>In traditional newspaper reading, the principal cues have been found to be the main images and headlines, which attract the most visual attention upon a first-time viewing of a page (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470357211434029">Küpper, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470357211434029">Garcia and Stark, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470357211434029">Holmberg and Holmqvist, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470357211434029">Bucher and Schumacher, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1470357211434029">Quinn et al., 2007</xref>). Readers of printed newspapers usually enter a page through a dominant photo, move to a prominent headline or another dominant photo, or to the text beside a dominant element.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1470357211434029">
<title>Cues in online newspapers</title>
<p>The first fixations<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1470357211434029">5</xref></sup> on the front page of an online newspaper, however, seem to go to text instead (in almost 80% of the cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1470357211434029">Lewenstein et al., 2000</xref>)), such as briefs, captions and lists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470357211434029">Barthelson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1470357211434029">Quinn et al., 2007</xref>). This is particularly true on secondary and further pages levels (e.g. links to full article pages) (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470357211434029">Barthelson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470357211434029">Leckner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1470357211434029">Zambarbieri et al., 2008</xref>). Whether headlines attract early attention online, however, has received contradictory support. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1470357211434029">Outing and Ruel (2004)</xref> found that dominant headlines most often (95% of the total fixations) attract attention when a subject enters an online page, especially if the headline is placed in the upper left corner, but in the comparative study between print and online newspapers by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470357211434029">Bucher and Schumacher (2006)</xref>, headlines were mostly ignored. In the cases where the headlines received attention, it lasted less than a second (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1470357211434029">Outing and Ruel, 2004</xref>). This suggests that (especially) in online newspapers it is important that the first words of a headline catch the readers’ interest (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470357211434029">Holsanova et al., 2008a</xref>). Moreover, the underlining of headlines, discourages reading of the text below (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1470357211434029">Outing and Ruel, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Contradictory to these results, several authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470357211434029">Hedman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470357211434029">Bucher and Schumacher, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470357211434029">Leckner, 2007</xref>) found that the first fixation in online newspapers went to photos, commonly the first image of the news (main) frame. If no image was placed next to the text, however, or the image appeared further down on the page, the first fixation went to the headline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470357211434029">Hedman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470357211434029">Leckner, 2007</xref>), a behaviour equivalent to the behaviour of traditional newspaper reading. As in print newspapers, the first image in an online newspaper is usually large, hence, it is difficult to avoid fixating on it. However, this first image fixation lasts only a brief moment and then goes to text, for example the first headline, and rarely or never returns to the photo in the ensuing process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470357211434029">Hedman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470357211434029">Bucher and Schumacher, 2006</xref>). The reader, according to Hedman, performs this action deliberately.</p>
<p>These differing results may be due to page design, as design differs somewhat between countries, between newspaper brands nationally, as well as changes over time. Nonetheless, virtually all elements anywhere, even editorial text, can serve as entry points.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1470357211434029">
<title>Position of objects</title>
<p>Besides the influence of different design factors, it is often asserted that object placement is not a neutral factor. For example, articles positioned in some areas of the newspaper spread/page are more likely to be observed and read than those in other areas. According to, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1470357211434029">Josephson and Holmes (2002)</xref>, readers’ eye movements may follow a habitually preferred path – a scan path – across a visual page.</p>
<sec id="section12-1470357211434029">
<title>Position of objects in printed newspapers</title>
<p>A number of studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470357211434029">Küpper, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470357211434029">Garcia and Stark, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470357211434029">Hansen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470357211434029">Holmqvist and Wartenberg, 2005</xref>) have found that readers of printed newspapers typically make their first fixation on the right page of a spread (through a dominant entry point). The right page fixation is explained partly as a consequence of page-turning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470357211434029">Garcia and Stark, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470357211434029">Holmqvist and Wartenberg, 2005</xref>) – a process taking approximately one second, with the first look at the right page often taking even less time – and partly by the fact that advertisements often appear on the right page, and these usually receive low eye-movement traffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470357211434029">Holmberg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470357211434029">Holmqvist and Wartenberg, 2005</xref>). After this glance at the right page, the reader quickly moves to the left page and often starts reading in an area just to the left of the middle, then continues over the entire spread, with the average reading direction from the upper left corner to the lower right corner, that is, objects in the upper left are seen earlier than are objects in the lower right (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470357211434029">Küpper, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1470357211434029">Josephson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470357211434029">Holmqvist and Wartenberg, 2005</xref>). The left page is commonly also read for a longer time than the right page: 61 per cent compared to 39 per cent in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470357211434029">Holmberg (2004)</xref>, and 55 per cent compared to 45 per cent in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470357211434029">Leckner (2007)</xref> (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470357211434029">Hansen, 1994</xref>).</p>

<title>Position of objects in online newspapers</title>
<p>Comparatively, in online newspaper reading, the majority of readers place their main attention on the news frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470357211434029">Barthelson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470357211434029">Hedman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470357211434029">Leckner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1470357211434029">Zambarbieri et al., 2008</xref>), where most of the news text is located, and first fixate on the top of the page (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470357211434029">Holsanova and Holmqvist, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1470357211434029">Outing and Ruel, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470357211434029">Leckner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1470357211434029">Zambarbieri et al., 2008</xref>). This may be due to the fact that the most recent material is commonly placed there, but also to the downloading process by which the information first appears at the top. Subjects first fixate on the upper left (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470357211434029">Holsanova and Holmqvist, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1470357211434029">Outing and Ruel, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470357211434029">Leckner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1470357211434029">Zambarbieri et al., 2008</xref>), that is, commonly the news frame, and then in some cases the upper right side of the page (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1470357211434029">Outing and Ruel, 2004</xref>). Fixations to other frames than the news frame are more brief or sporadic, made when the reader has moved down to the bottom of the frame and starts to move back to the top of the page (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470357211434029">Leckner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1470357211434029">Zambarbieri et al., 2008</xref>). After reading an article, the reader’s attention is commonly either placed on the frame to the right (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470357211434029">Hedman, 2003</xref>), or on the frame to the left (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470357211434029">Barthelson, 2002</xref>) of the news frame. These differences are likely due to the design of the pages; that is, where the content list/frame is positioned in the stimulus, as exemplified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1470357211434029">Figures 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1470357211434029">b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1470357211434029">c</xref>.</p>

<title>Position of objects discussion</title>
<p>Naturally, these results do not mean that all readers start at the top and/or upper left and read downwards. Readers often switch quickly between texts and images on both paper spreads and online pages (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470357211434029">Holmberg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470357211434029">Holmqvist and Wartenberg, 2005</xref>). Moreover, even placed in an adverse position, an article can be read if it is accompanied by details that dramatically influence attraction, such as interesting content or colours (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470357211434029">Küpper, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1470357211434029">Josephson and Holmes, 2002</xref>). On average, however, newspaper readers see objects on the left spread/part of a page before they see objects on the right, which for printed newspapers can be explained as a habit developed from years of reading newspaper layout constructed in a certain way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470357211434029">Holmqvist and Wartenberg, 2005</xref>). That is, in print the most prominent stories are placed on top, especially on the left page, and ads are most likely placed on the right, especially on the lower part of the page. The fact that Western reading is performed from left to right, top to bottom, might also influence this behaviour. Regarding online newspapers, this behaviour can be explained by the fact that many online papers place their logotype, dominant image and most prominent stories at the top, often upper left, of the page.</p>

<title>Size property</title>
<p>Larger newspaper items (e.g. ads, images and headlines) are seen significantly earlier than smaller objects, in both print and online newspapers (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470357211434029">Garcia and Stark, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470357211434029">Lundqvist and Holmqvist, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1470357211434029">Outing and Ruel, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470357211434029">Holmberg and Holmqvist, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470357211434029">Holmqvist and Wartenberg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1470357211434029">Quinn et al., 2007</xref>). However, there is no statistical significance in the assertion that longer texts receive earlier attention than shorter ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470357211434029">Hansen, 1994</xref>). Additionally, larger items are looked at for significantly longer than smaller items are, which is not surprising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470357211434029">Holmqvist and Wartenberg, 2005</xref>). Larger items may be more attractive because of their size, however the probability that the eye cannot ‘avoid’ looking at them is higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470357211434029">Hedman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470357211434029">Holmqvist and Wartenberg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470357211434029">Leckner, 2007</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470357211434029">Holmberg and Holmqvist’s (2005)</xref> study showed statistical significance of longer dwell time<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1470357211434029">7</xref></sup> only for especially large image sizes. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1470357211434029">Wartenberg and Holmqvist (2005)</xref> claim that designers tend to overestimate the importance of image size, as larger images are given considerably less time than predicted by designers (on average, 9% less).</p>
<p>Although longer texts are read for a longer time, shorter texts have a better chance of being read to the end, regardless of subject, and the larger the font size, the more scanning and less focused viewing takes place, in both media (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1470357211434029">Outing and Ruel, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1470357211434029">Wartenberg and Holmqvist, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Drop quotes, fact boxes, briefs and teasers</title>

The same is true about short text paragraphs like fact boxes, briefs and teasers, especially if combined with images (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1470357211434029">Schumacher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1470357211434029">Quinn et al., 2007</xref>). These elements serve a double function: partly they determine the reader’s decision to read the longer text of an article or not; partly, they have an overview function for readers who want a quick summary.</p>

<title>Images</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1470357211434029">Melin (1999)</xref> images used in informative texts can be motivated in two ways, emotionally and objectively. Emotionally, images should catch the eye of the reader, draw attention to the text, or lend an aesthetic touch to the text. In the objective perspective, ‘a picture is worth a thousand words’ and should concretize, demonstrate or verify the content of the text. The magnitude of the results of both these perspectives is difficult to predict. However, images in general, often in combination with headlines, offer good insight into the contents of the text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470357211434029">Holmqvist and Wartenberg, 2005</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section18-1470357211434029">
<title>Type of image</title>
<p>Type of image influences when and if it will attract attention. Photos, especially those that include content the reader can easily interpret and familiarize him/herself with, possess attraction independent of an article’s subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1470357211434029">Lundberg, 2002</xref>), and documentary photos receive more visual attention than staged photos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1470357211434029">Quinn et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, images with faces get earlier fixations, but not longer durations, than images of inanimate objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470357211434029">Holmberg et al., 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470357211434029">Garcia and Stark (1991)</xref>, however, found no indication of more fixations depending on photo content. In their study, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470357211434029">Hansen (1994)</xref>, artwork followed by photos draw most attention. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470357211434029">Holmqvist and Wartenberg (2005)</xref> divided images into information graphics, maps, drawings and photos. Their results showed that all images except information graphics contributed significantly to early fixations in printed newspapers, although their data did not convey why. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470357211434029">Holmberg (2004)</xref> suggests that, since information graphics signals information that readers judge as inherently interesting, but demanding on cognitive resources, news including more accessible content is attended to first, and articles including information graphics are dealt with if time and interest remain. Online, graphics that receive a vast majority of attention are, for example, weather graphics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1470357211434029">Quinn et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1470357211434029">
<title>The relationship between images and text</title>
<p>As mentioned, the fixation time of images may depend on their relation to text elements. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470357211434029">Holmberg (2004)</xref> divided articles with information graphics into a text portion and an image portion and found that the textual and pictorial information received almost the same viewing time, which according to Holmberg means that text and pictorial information in an article can co-exist. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470357211434029">Holmqvist and Wartenberg (2005)</xref> found that texts illustrated by images were regarded for a significantly longer time than other texts, and for texts that included information graphics the total reading time more than doubled (38% compared to 15%). In the examination of the spatial layout of text and information graphics, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470357211434029">Holsanova et al. (2008b)</xref> found that an integrated format with spatial contiguity between text and illustrations facilitated integration. Reading of information graphics was moreover significantly enhanced by a serial format, resulting from a dual attentional guidance. Holsanova et al. concluded that these formats not only attracted readers’ initial attention but sustained the readers’ interest, thereby promoting a longer and deeper processing of the complex material.</p>
<p>Text and images can be regarded as complementary factors, meaning that the reader must mentally integrate the information across both sources of information, which has been shown to be cognitively demanding. Hence, images always increase processing time in the reading of a text. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1470357211434029">Melin (1999)</xref>, text and images can be assumed to exhibit three functions in relation to each other:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1470357211434029">7</xref></sup> (1) the image information doubles the text information; (2) the image complements the text with extra information not available purely from the text; or (3) the image provides irrelevant extra information. In case (1), a negligible amount of extra time was needed to process both text and image, and in (2) the information was assimilated faster if it included an image; overall, an image contributed positively to the understanding/estimation of the text – to the smallest degree when the image was the only information carrier, that is, provided new information. Even irrelevant images (3) contribute to a positive reception of the text, however, decrease the memory retention of it.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, designers tend to overestimate the duration of attention to images such as drawings and photographs, but underestimate the duration of attention to information graphics, whereas attention to maps is estimated rather precisely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1470357211434029">Wartenberg and Holmqvist, 2005</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section20-1470357211434029">
<title>Images in printed newspapers</title>
<p>Early fixations on images are perhaps the most consistent result in all eye-tracking studies of print newspaper reading. For example, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470357211434029">Holmberg (2004)</xref>, elements including images received earlier attention during initial scan paths than did other objects (followed by large headlines, articles, short paragraphs, drop quotes, information graphics and advertisements). In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470357211434029">Leckner (2007)</xref>, headlines were fixated almost the same amount of time as images, followed by briefs, fact boxes, captions and drop quotes. Also in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470357211434029">Garcia and Stark (1991)</xref>, images received more attention than did headlines, advertising, briefs and captions, in that order. On average, 75 per cent of the photos were seen in their study, consistent with results by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470357211434029">Hansen (1994)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470357211434029">Holmberg and Holmqvist (2005)</xref>, in which 70 per cent of the images were seen altogether.</p>

<title>Images in online newspapers</title>
<p>The results on early fixations on images in online newspapers are not consistent, as mentioned before, but past the front-page level, images and elements other than text, receive few fixations in general (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470357211434029">Leckner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1470357211434029">Zambarbieri et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Captions</title>
<p>The probability of a caption being fixated on in a print newspaper, depends on the colour and size of the photo, and on the section of the newspaper in which the photo appears (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470357211434029">Garcia and Stark, 1991</xref>). Captions accompanying photos in lead stories, commonly larger photos, are more likely to be seen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1470357211434029">Quinn et al., 2007</xref>). Captions accompanying smaller photos were processed to 16 per cent in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470357211434029">Garcia and Stark (1991)</xref>, compared to captions of larger photos, processed to 38 per cent.

<title>The importance of colour</title>
<p>Research results regarding the importance of the colour property of early fixations in printed newspapers are ambiguous. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470357211434029">Garcia and Stark (1991)</xref> claim that colour in a newspaper spread affects the order in which different elements are regarded, for example when the image is in colour (in their case an ad) it attracts a second fixation, but when it is in greyscale the second fixation goes to the text. They also report that readers devote more time to photo groupings when the photos are in colour. Besides this, they found no particular difference between objects in colour and those in black and white. Analogously, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1470357211434029">Quinn, Stark and Edmonds (2007)</xref> found that advertisements in colour draw twice as much attention as advertisements in black and white. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470357211434029">Hansen (1994)</xref> did not confirm any significant effect of colour on fixation order;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1470357211434029">8</xref></sup> neither could <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1470357211434029">Wartenberg and Holmqvist (2005)</xref>. These authors argue that the effect of colour on visual attention is difficult to prove, as colour interacts with image content and other design factors in a way that makes it difficult to determine exactly what produced the behaviour. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1470357211434029">Wartenberg and Holmqvist (2005)</xref> assert that newspaper designers behave as if they strongly believe in the effect of colour for early attention to an object. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1470357211434029">Josephson (1996)</xref> found that ‘overall, colour does not seem to draw more attention to photographs unless the sole colour picture on a page is in a subordinate position’, for example if a colour image is placed at the bottom of an otherwise black-and-white spread. Josephson’s findings indicate that the position of the photo on the page is more important than the colour/greyscale factor, however the poor position of a photo can be compensated for with colour.</p>
<p>However, text beside colour images, or text itself containing colour, is read for a significantly longer time than other texts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470357211434029">Holmqvist and Wartenberg, 2005</xref>). Hence, these results indicate that colour should be used not to attract attention, but to keep it. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470357211434029">Hansen (1994)</xref> found that text received more attention if it was placed on a differentiated (i.e. colour or pattern) background, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470357211434029">Garcia and Stark (1991)</xref> found no indication that screens affected how the text was processed.</p>

In a follow-up study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470357211434029">Lundqvist and Holmqvist (2001)</xref> focusing on the effect of size, attitude and memory on the attention to ads, results showed that these variables correlate strongly: a larger size makes the reader see, like and remember the ad better. Eighty-three per cent of full-page ads and 77 per cent of half-page ads were fixated on in this study. Also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1470357211434029">Quinn, Stark and Edmonds (2007)</xref> found that full-page and half-page ads attract similar attention. However, dwell time is a strong predictor of how well an ad will be remembered. In the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470357211434029">Lundqvist and Holmqvist (2001)</xref>, full-page ads were dwelled on more than twice as long (c. 5s) as half-page ads or smaller (≤ 2s). Approximately half of the full-page ads were remembered shortly after the test was performed. A study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1470357211434029">Widman and Lundqvist (2001)</xref> received the same fixation percentage for full-page and half-page ads, but the dwell times were somewhat higher (6s and 3s). The recollection of the ads was 56 per cent when the subjects were asked directly after the experiment. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470357211434029">Holmqvist and Wartenberg (2005)</xref> 66 per cent of the ads were seen and 37 per cent were skipped. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470357211434029">Khattak (2005)</xref> investigated fixation on ads in different formats; broadsheet and tabloid. In this study, approximately 55 per cent of full-page ads were observed, but generated somewhat higher scores in tabloid than in broadsheet, whereas half-page advertisements in broadsheet format yielded higher observation scores (52%) compared to equal ads in the tabloid format (40%). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470357211434029">Lundqvist and Holmqvist (2001)</xref>, however, indicated that there were no differences in how ads were perceived in tabloid and broadsheet formats.</p>
<p>The total number of ads on a page, compared to the amount of editorial content, affects the probability of an ad being seen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470357211434029">Khattak, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1470357211434029">Quinn et al., 2007</xref>); the higher the number of ads, the more likely the reader is to skip that page. Also, the placement of an ad matters. Like other content, ads are more likely to be seen if they are placed slightly towards the middle of the left page (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1470357211434029">Widman and Polansky, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470357211434029">Hansen, 1994</xref>), but compared to other material, ads are also fixated on if positioned at the lower parts of a page (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1470357211434029">Widman and Polansky, 1990</xref>). Although ads are never the point of entry, even if they are in colour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470357211434029">Garcia and Stark, 1991</xref>), a dramatic change in visual pattern can help an ad be noticed, as with other items in a newspaper. Advertisements in printed newspapers are, however, the most accepted by users, compared to ads in other traditional media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470357211434029">Nordicom, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Advertisements in online newspapers</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470357211434029">Stenfors and Holmqvist (1999)</xref> claim that online readers notice ads while reading, but exercise strategic control behaviour over both visual selection and visual attention on web pages, with additional help from experience-based expectations, that is, readers know where the ads are commonly located and can hence avoid them without fixating on them, and do not remember looking at the ads in memory tests afterwards. During downloading, when ads could be the only object on the screen, some subjects even find ways to distract themselves, for example with the mouse cursor, in order to avoid looking at an ad. In later studies (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470357211434029">Andersson 2006</xref>: 5), Stenfors has shown that subjects are very determined when reading online news; when they find an interesting article they keep their eyes fixated on the text. Strong colours or moving objects, which under other circumstances might catch the online readers’ attention, had no or a negligible effect on their fixation during the reading of online news; avoidance strategies can be both active and passive. In the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1470357211434029">Lewenstein et al. (2000)</xref>, 45 per cent of the ads were fixated on, for an average of one second, during a 34-minute reading session. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1470357211434029">Outing and Ruel (2004)</xref> found that the probability of an ad being seen depended on the placement of the ad, as in printed newspapers. Ads positioned at the top left of the page (which received the most fixations in general in their study), received most fixations (68%), for an average of 0.5–1.5 seconds, compared to the opposite right side (34%). Moreover, close proximity to popular editorial content helped ads be seen, but they received fewer fixations if the ads and editorial text were separated by a barrier such as a line or white space. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470357211434029">Drén (2005)</xref> found similar results: ads positioned in the news frame received more fixations compared to those positioned in other areas, since the attention of online newspaper readers is most commonly focused on the news. These ads are also harder to avoid, largely because the scrolling of a page ‘forces’ subjects to interact with the interface in order to continue reading the text, which increases the occurrence of unintentional fixation on an ad. Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470357211434029">Stenfors and Holmqvist (1999)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470357211434029">Drén (2005)</xref> states that subjects are well aware of which content includes ads and where the ads are located, and apply avoidance strategies (or efficiency of search).</p>
<p>The web advertisements were fixated on for between 0.1 and 0.25 seconds on average in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470357211434029">Leckner (2007)</xref>, independently of whether the ads were dynamic or not. The position of ads on secondary or further page levels got the highest probability of being fixated on, but as with other elements than text, got very few fixations in general. When asked, the participants found banners especially irritating, although banners were never fixated on during the experiment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1470357211434029">Quinn, Stark and Edmonds (2007)</xref>, however, found that moving elements attracted more than 25 per cent of the fixations on ads, and that banners and small ads generated most fixations. Previously, however, no evidence has been found that animated advertisements receive earlier fixation than do static ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1470357211434029">Outing and Ruel, 2004</xref>), or are remembered better (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470357211434029">Bayles, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470357211434029">Drèze and Hussherr, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The majority of the subjects in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470357211434029">Hedman (2003)</xref> claimed that they never read online advertisements and did not like ads in online newspapers, especially pop-ups and blinking ads, because their reading was interrupted. However, the result from the eye-tracking study with the same subjects showed that they <italic>do</italic> watch advertisements, and even if they do not remember all the ads afterwards, they actually do remember quite a few. Hedman found no evidence that the subjects deliberately tried to avoid advertisements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470357211434029">2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1470357211434029">Lundberg (2004)</xref> also reported that many respondents expressed a clear lack of interest in advertisements in online newspapers.</p>

<title>How presentation factors affect reading behaviour</title>
<p>Whereas not all layout cues within the traditional genre can be figuratively utilized in a digital structure, some cues can provide a familiar paradigm and improve effectiveness of interaction within utilization. Independent of media, the main practice for helping and guiding the reader into reading a specific content is through providing layout cues or entry points to increase the salience of an item. Text items such as headlines, briefs, lists and fact boxes, as well as the placement of items, are important entry points in both printed and online newspapers. Items placed at the top and preferably to the left on a page, are seen first and for the longest time. Size also applies as a prominent cue: larger items are seen earlier and dwelt on for significantly longer than smaller items. More ambiguous is the use of colour and images. The effect of colour on visual attention has been difficult to determine. Nonetheless, it is often used, by for example designers, as if it elicits early attention. However, text seems to benefit from colour when it comes to duration of reading; in the text itself or its background, or, when the text is positioned next to coloured items. Images, which are main entry points in printed newspapers, have generated ambiguous results as entry points online, mostly being found not to elicit major visual attention. These differing results may, on the one hand, depend on the varying designs of online newspapers. On the other hand, online readers have been found to be more goal oriented, and therefore more directly focused on the text to read, especially on page levels below the front page (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1470357211434029">Leckner, 2011</xref>). This focused behaviour also relates to how advertisements are perceived. During reading of online newspapers, readers seem to apply strategic avoidance strategies to avoid fixating on ads, both unconsciously and consciously. This is possible since readers seem to have adapted to how information is usually placed on online newspaper pages, directly or indirectly.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1470357211434029">9</xref></sup> About half of the advertisements are fixated on in an online newspaper, which is somewhat less than printed newspapers, and the ads are fixated on for a very short time. Animated advertisements are not popular among readers, and have in most cases not been found to elicit earlier fixations or be remembered better in comparison to static advertisements. The behavioural tendency to neglect advertisements online may be troublesome for newspaper companies, since business models based on advertising are common.</p>

<title>The development of newspapers</title>
<p>A design, and by extension its immediacy, is dependent on implicit or explicit assumptions about contextual factors, such as technology, current trends, fashions and economy. A changing context can make a design solution obsolete or inappropriate in ways that are hard to predict (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1470357211434029">Lundberg, 2004</xref>). The refashioning of existing media and the introduction of new publishing channels are, however, important and widely anticipated in the development of the newspaper mass medium.</p>
<p>Regardless of newspaper medium, there are several challenges in initiating new formats: how to adjust the presentation to, in most cases, a smaller format, and how to attract and keep readers’ focus, and distinguish the presentation from other newspaper brands, while still maintaining brand identity. In the offline world, different media, for example broadcast and newspapers, are clearly different, whereas online they have the same basic conditions. The digital environment offers competition not only from traditional media, but also from new content providers, of both a professional and private nature. Nevertheless, the graphical interface of the World Wide Web fits the newspaper genre well, and a genre-specific visual grammar for online newspapers is emerging (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1470357211434029">Knox, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1470357211434029">Seelig, 2008</xref>). Digital newspapers will be even more efficient when presentation and features are further developed.</p>
<p>The knowledge of how and what the reader consumes in a newspaper can facilitate the development of efficient presentation styles in existing and new newspaper media, yielding satisfied customers, which may increase the loyalty to the newspaper and its producer. Reading behaviour is, however, a complex phenomenon, affected by implicit and explicit factors that can be complicated to predict and measure. This is reflected in the results of eye-tracking research, which consistently do not point in one direction. More effort should be put into understanding users and their intentions when consuming a newspaper, along with the development of new technologies.</p>

<p>Reading behaviour in this study is defined as the process by which the reader interacts with factors that influence and affect the partaking in information, such as presentation (layout, design, interactive elements, etc.), news content and interface; it is a process that includes both strategic and non-strategic behaviour.</p>
