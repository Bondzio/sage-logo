<p>This research note presents an overview of how and why social researchers influenced by critical perspectives are using fiction as a means of producing and disseminating research. Over the past two decades fiction has increasingly been used by social researchers as a means of building critical consciousness, unsettling stereotypes, accessing hard-to-get-at dimensions of human experience and extending public scholarship. This research note reviews how fiction has grown as a research practice within the context of the growing interdisciplinary field of arts-based research practices. The piece ends with examples of academic novels and a play written from queer, feminist, and critical race theoretical perspectives.</p>

<p>The natural history of conventional social science is that of a real world being articulated in imagined details; the natural history of fiction is that of an imaginary world being articulated in real details. The former helps us understand what people are, while the latter helps us understand who people can be.</p>

<title>Reflexive Statement</title>
<p>
<italic>As a feminist sociologist, I am committed to producing work that exposes and subverts gender inequality, addresses the concerns and experiences of women, and seeks to empower. I am equally committed to finding forms that allow me to disseminate my research to diverse and public audiences. My turn to fiction as a form of qualitative research came about at the intersection of my work in feminist sociology and in arts-based research. When I wrote my academic novel, Low-Fat Love, I felt for the first time in my career that I was able to fully address and communicate what I have learned with respect to female identity-building within the context of interpersonal relationships and popular culture. It was only through the novel format that I felt able to really teach what I have learned over the past decade, and to do so in a way that had the hope of reaching the very audiences that might benefit the most from my work. The responses I have received from students, professors, and lay people have all confirmed that fiction is uniquely suited to tap into a range of social and psychological issues and to encourage personal reflection through resonance, identification, and empathy.</italic>
</p>
<p>In this essay, I illustrate how social researchers with critical perspectives are using fiction in order to meet research goals such as building critical consciousness, unsettling stereotypes, and building empathy across differences. Over the past two decade, qualitative researchers have shown that fiction is a vital and valid method of inquiry in the social sciences (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0160597612451244">Bagley and Cancienne 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0160597612451244">Banks 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0160597612451244">Banks and Banks 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160597612451244">Barone and Eisner 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0160597612451244">Dunlop 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0160597612451244">Iser 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0160597612451244">Knowles and Cole 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0160597612451244">Leavy 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0160597612451244">Norris 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0160597612451244">Viswesaran 1994</xref>). Fiction enables researchers to access and express aspects of the human condition that may otherwise be out of reach, making social research accessible to the public. Fiction as method has become an important part of the social science enterprise including the publication of short stories, novellas, novels, plays (ethnodramas), poems, parables, and more. This growing body of scholarship points to (1) the frailty of the fact/fiction (nonfiction/fiction) dualism on which traditional social science rests and (2) the utility of fiction for serving research agendas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0160597612451244">Leavy 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0160597612451244">2012</xref>). I begin with the former.</p>

<title>The Winding Paths of Nonfiction and Fiction</title>
<p>While the explicit use of fiction as a qualitative method has grown over the last two decades (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0160597612451244">Bagley and Cancienne 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160597612451244">Barone and Eisner 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0160597612451244">de Freitas 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0160597612451244">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0160597612451244">Gosse 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0160597612451244">Knowles and Cole 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0160597612451244">Leavy 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0160597612451244">2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0160597612451244">2012</xref>; Richardson 2001; Springgay et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0160597612451244">2008</xref>) the interplay between fiction and social research has a much longer history. To illustrate this history in brief I consider the history of novels.</p>
<p>Throughout the 300-year history of what we term “novels,” the fact–fiction dichotomy has always been a winding path where each category slips into the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160597612451244">Franklin 2011</xref>). Ben <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0160597612451244">Yagoda (2010</xref>) remarks that novels began as fake memoirs noting Daniel Defoe’s (1719) <italic>Robinson Crusoe</italic> in which the title page makes the book seem like an “authentic” account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160597612451244">Franklin 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0160597612451244">Yagoda 2010</xref>). Genres such as “nonfiction novels” and “historical novels” point to the persistent blurring of fictional and nonfictional modes of representation. Consider, for example, Holocaust “novels”—a much contested terrain. In her book <italic>A Thousand Darknesses: Lies and Truth in Holocaust Fiction</italic>, Ruth Franklin details the conflict over Holocaust fiction. She notes that some view using the horrors of the Holocaust as the material for fiction as inappropriate for a range of reasons (including using human suffering as entertainment) and how others view fiction as a way to enter into and bring others into the experience of the event in emotionally evocative ways. There is also the blurred genre of “creative nonfiction” or fiction “inspired by actual events.” Truman Capote’s <italic>In Cold Blood</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160597612451244">1965</xref>) has long been held up as an example of the blur between fact and fiction, as some suggest the book could be considered a qualitative research project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0160597612451244">Norris 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0160597612451244">Banks (2008</xref>) notes fiction is only somewhat fictional. All fictional works draw on the “real” world. Put differently, “real life is the material of fiction” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0160597612451244">Banks and Banks 1998</xref>:26). Readers must be able to recognize, identify, and relate to the world or worlds presented in the fictional rendering. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0160597612451244">Abbott (2008</xref>) notes, the “actual” world plays a huge role in fictional worlds. Primo Levi suggested that fictional characters are never “either wholly true or wholly invented” (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160597612451244">Franklin 2011</xref>:16). Commenting on the blur between social science and fiction, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0160597612451244">Viswesaran (1994</xref>) notes that fiction attempts to create a believable world, as does ethnography. Interestingly, Marcel Mauss observed that the anthropologist has to be a novelist in order to write effectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0160597612451244">Viswesaran 1994</xref>). Similarly, Faye Harrison has suggested that ethnography is a kind of fiction and fiction is a kind of ethnography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160597612451244">Behar 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0160597612451244">Iser (1997</xref>) offers a model for the generation of fiction that clearly illustrates the overlaps between “fiction” and “the real.” According to Iser the fictionalizing process is threefold. <italic>Selection</italic> is the process of selecting elements from the “real world” (or referential world) to include in the fictional work. These elements may be taken from “social, historical, cultural and literary systems” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0160597612451244">Iser 1997</xref>:2). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160597612451244">Barone and Eisner (2012</xref>) suggest researchers use the term “empirical” world instead of “real” world. Simultaneously the second phase occurs as elements are <italic>combined</italic> through the compositional/meaning-making process. The third act of fictionalizing is <italic>self-disclosure</italic>. During this phase, the author employs conventions to signal the fictional nature of the text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160597612451244">Barone and Eisner 2012</xref>) such as deeming a work a short story or novel on the title page.</p>
<p>In addition to the use of “the real” in the creation of “the fictional,” the world of novel writing, even traditionally, draws on many social science practices. To begin, most novelists conduct extensive research (historical, document analysis, field research, interviews, etc.) in order to write effectively—depicting times and places authentically, using cultural expressions appropriately and so forth, ultimately creating believability—a hallmark of effective fiction. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0160597612451244">Banks (2008</xref>) notes, novelists seek verisimilitude just as social researchers. Roiphe expresses this as follows: “the basic talent of the novelist is to observe social behavior—the way a person furnishes his house or makes love or reacts to death or folds an envelope or constructs his sentences or plans his career” (1988:840). In this context, the addition of fiction to the social scientist’s methodological “tool box” is easy to understand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0160597612451244">Leavy 2012</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0160597612451244">
<title>Fiction and the Goals of Social Research</title>
<p>The turn to fiction in the practice of social research can be attributed to the deep accord between the goals of both forms. Social research aims to generate human understanding which is what fiction, at its best, does. Qualitative researchers aim to portray lives (Coles and Knowles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0160597612451244">2001</xref>:11), as does the novelist. Dunlop notes that novels illuminate human experiences and thus become “exploratory, explanatory, hopeful and generative” (2001:12). I suggest the following objectives of social research can be achieved via fiction: raising critical consciousness, accessing hard-to-get-at dimensions of social life, extending public scholarship, opening up a multiplicity of meanings, building bridges across differences, unsettling stereotypes, and developing empathy and resonance as ways of knowing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0160597612451244">Leavy 2009</xref>, 2011a, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0160597612451244">2012</xref>). A compassionate and social justice–oriented approach to social science demands attention to these aspects of research. Moreover, fiction, as other arts-based practices, allows the public access to the products of social research in ways that traditional forms exclude. This does not necessarily mean that social researchers need to abandon their traditional approaches to data collection and analysis. Rather, for some fiction can be used as a form to communicate research carried out in conventional ways. For others, the rigorous process of writing fiction influenced by a social science perspective becomes the entire methodology. I am presently writing a book about fiction as qualitative research that explores this continuum (forthcoming with Left Coast Press).</p>
<p>Beyond the accessibility of fiction for broad audiences, there are three distinct features of fiction that make it attractive to social researchers. First, drawing on the strength of the arts-based research movement, many qualitative researchers are interested in pursuing creative license in order to make their work more evocative—fiction allows for this (Richardson 2001). Second, fictional narratives draw on literary conventions including “master plots” (story lines that reemerge in the culture such as “quest” plots), genres (recurring literary forms), and character “types” (recurrent types of characters; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0160597612451244">Abbott 2008</xref>). All of these fictional devices have the potential to carry great “emotional capital” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0160597612451244">Abbott 2008</xref>:46-9). When qualitative researchers tap into these narrative components, they have the potential to get deeper into the minds of readers, promoting reflexive engagement and the emergence of critical consciousness. Finally, perhaps the biggest distinction between fiction and nonfiction is that fiction allows readers into the minds of characters through “interior monologue” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0160597612451244">Caulley 2008</xref>). Put differently, fiction allows us to get at and express interiority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0160597612451244">Banks 2008</xref>) which is arguably a goal in all research, though seldom achieved. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0160597612451244">de Freitas (2003</xref>) rightfully suggests that getting at the “inner life” of characters and building “empathetic engagement” in readers is a core strength of fiction as method. The value of getting into the minds of “characters”—their feelings, motivations, and beliefs, cannot be underestimated. In this regard, historian Inga Clendinnen has said that fiction has taught her most of what she knows by giving her access to characters’ inner thoughts (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160597612451244">Franklin 2011</xref>:15).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0160597612451244">
<title>Fiction and Critical Frameworks</title>
<p>Researchers working from critical theoretical perspectives may find fiction particularly well suited for their projects. Fiction is able to “get at” and express complex layers of meaning without closing off the interpretive process in an authoritative manner. Furthermore, due to the pleasure that can be derived from reading fiction as well as its familiarity it is uniquely able to tap into a different dimension of readers’ consciousness, promote reflexive engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0160597612451244">Leavy 2009</xref>, 2011a) and create “me too” moments (Pelias <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0160597612451244">2004</xref>). As women are the largest commercial audience for fiction perhaps it is not surprising how many feminist scholars, particularly in anthropology and sociology, have turned to fiction. Some well-known examples of feminist novelists that clearly draw on social science practices (many of whom have degrees in the social sciences) include Maya Angelou, Ella Deloria, Zora Neale Hurston, Ruth Landes, Ruth Underhill, Alice Walker, and Virginia Woolf. These authors have used fiction to write evocatively about the complex interconnections between gender, race, class, and sexuality in our lives—they seek to promote feminist consciousness and ask readers to actively engage with their narratives. These researcher–writers use fiction to illustrate how our personal experiences (micro level) are played out within a larger social–historical context (macro level). Moreover, they invite us behind the doors into the lives of others and allow us to see ourselves within those realities.</p>
<p>I conclude by offering a few examples of contemporary social justice scholars turning to fiction as a part of their political project in queer, feminist, and/or critical race theories.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0160597612451244">
<title>Queer Theory and the Academic Novel: Jackytar</title>
<p>Douglas Gosse’s academic novel, <italic>Jackytar</italic>, is a seminal work in the field. In its prepublication form <italic>Jackytar</italic>, along with a “hypertext” (academic footnotes), was honored by the American Educational Research Association (AERA) with the outstanding dissertation award. This recognition exemplifies a major shift within the academic landscape. Ultimately the novel was published on its own, without the hypertext. <italic>Jackytar</italic> explicitly intertwines and thus teaches queer theory and maintains a strong social justice undercurrent. As with most researcher–writers who turn to fiction, Gosse aimed to bridge the public and academia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0160597612451244">Gosse 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In Newfoundland “jackytar” is a derogatory term for a mixed race person of Mi’Kmaq and French origins (Gosse 2008). <italic>Jackytar</italic> follows the protagonist, Alex Murphy, a gay “jackytar” on a trip home. The action unfolds over nine days as Alex confronts unresolved family issues, the contested nature of identity, the power of language, and the relationship between our cultural heritage and individual biographies. The novel disrupts stereotypes and dominant ways of thinking about sexual identity and other status characteristics. Gosse writes “I creatively investigate the intertwining identity markers of race, class, gender and sexual orientation, geographical location, ablebodiness, and language and culture, in the lives of fictional characters” (2008:183). Moreover, by employing the novel format Gosse aimed to promote critical self and social reflection in readers (2008:185).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0160597612451244">
<title>Feminist Novel: Low-Fat Love</title>
<p>My feminist novel, <italic>Low-Fat Love</italic>, is grounded in a decade of research and teaching about gender, relationships, body image, and popular culture, which informs the pop-feminist undertone of the book (Leavy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0160597612451244">2011b</xref>). Although I had published research articles over the years addressing these topics, I had felt that the traditional academic form did not allow me to fully express what I had learned about the social psychological and cultural contexts in which women come to develop their sense of self and their relationships with others. Nor did I have any expectation that journal articles would reach diverse audiences of women. The turn to the academic novel was in many ways simply pragmatic with my commitment to a feminist agenda at the forefront. <italic>Low-Fat Love</italic> is the first book in the Sense book series <italic>Social Fictions</italic> which only publishes research-driven books that are written entirely in literary forms. The books are intended to be used in college classrooms and thus the series signifies a major shift in academic book publishing.</p>
<p>
<italic>Low-Fat Love</italic> is written as a classic “chick-lit” novel; however, with a feminist subtext running throughout in attempt to use and subvert the dominant form. By employing the chick-lit <italic>genre</italic>, and drawing on the pleasure and emotional capital college-age women in particular find in this form, I was best able to pursue my agenda. My intent was to invite engaged self-reflection and social critique. The story unfolds over three seasons as Prilly Greene and Janice Goldwyn, adversarial editors at a New York press, experience personal change relating to the men (and absence of women) in their lives. Ultimately, each woman is pushed to confront her own image of herself, exploring her insecurities, the stagnation in her life and her reasons for having settled for low-fat love. I employ third-person narration as a means of layering the narrative with feminist readings of pop culture and relationships. Moreover, I rely extensively on “interior monologue” as a means of getting inside the heads of characters to reveal their feelings, motivations, and psychological processes. Through this process readers come to understand the characters’ actions on a much deeper level than would otherwise be possible while also building empathy, creating resonance, and, at times, even productive frustration as we watch characters disadvantage themselves and suffer as a result.</p>
<p>
<italic>Low-Fat Love</italic> is underscored with a commentary about female identity building and self-acceptance and how, too often, women become trapped in limited visions of themselves. Women’s media is used as a signpost throughout the book in order to make visible the context in which women come to think of themselves as well as the men and women in their lives. In this respect, <italic>Low-Fat Love</italic> offers a critical commentary about popular culture and the social construction of femininity.</p>

<title>Ethnodrama and Critical Race Theory: Athabasca’s Going Unmanned</title>
<p>Diane Conrad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0160597612451244">2012</xref>) spent several years conducting research with “at-risk” youth in schools as well as incarcerated youth before penning <italic>Athabasca’s Going Unmanned</italic>. Her research included the collection of extensive original field observations and interview data. Her findings cover a wide range of complex and multilayered dimensions of what it means to be an incarcerated youth, ranging from issues of race and class to stigmatization and labeling to the transformative power of art education and resocialization. The questions for Conrad became how can these layers of meanings be expressed most effectively? How can readers enter into the lives of incarcerated youth in ways that challenge stereotypes and promote understanding? How can this research be used to influence-related public policies? The fictional form of a dramatic script was an appropriate medium.</p>
<p>Athabasca’s Going Unmanned is set in a youth offender jail in Alberta, Canada, and tells the story of three incarcerated youth and the corrections staff who work with them. The story centers on an escape plot hatched by the inmates and ultimately examines the needs of incarcerated youth and the prospects for offering them programming with transformative potential. Based on extensive research, the play addresses a range of real-world issues with sociological, criminal justice, policy, and educational implications. Moreover, issues of race and ethnicity feature prominently. The play raises many challenging issues at the level of fantasy and imagination in order to draw attention to and elicit discussion around these controversial issues. As a means of disseminating the research, ethnodrama aims to engage a more diverse audience and engender empathic understandings of the experiences of incarcerated youth leading to more constructive attitudes regarding their needs, with the potential for radically re-envisioning social relations. The fictionalized format invites readers to engage with complex questions without relying on an “authoritative” text that closes off meaning making. Rather, readers are invited into the meaning-making process as they engage with the play and its alternative endings. There is no other format that would invite readers into the minds of “characters” in the same way nor provide an opportunity to engage so fully in the interpretive process.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The use of fiction as a qualitative method has escalated rapidly over the past two decades as arts-based research practices have grown; however, the blurring of the practices of fiction writers and social researchers has a much longer history. Fiction is a powerful tool that social researchers can add to their methods box in order to effectively and evocatively represent their work. Fiction may be of particular interest to social researchers working from critical theoretical perspectives because this form is uniquely suited to build critical consciousness, disrupt stereotypes, cultivate empathetic understanding across differences, promote reflection through resonance, open up a multiplicity of meanings, and extend the reach of our scholarship. As we train the next generation of researchers, increasingly so with an eye toward public scholarship, it is important to include arts-based research practices in our methods education; at my own undergraduate institution arts-based research is taught alongside quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods research in our survey of research methods course and advanced approaches to arts-based research are taught in our qualitative research course. Arts-based research is also increasingly being taught in graduate qualitative methods and narrative inquiry courses and there is a sharp increase in dissertations that include arts-based components.</p>
