<abstract>
<p>This Internet-based study used data from a convenience sample of 176 gay men in current partnerships to examine differences in outness, cohesion, and relationship quality between three types of gay male couples: first cohabiting partnerships, repartnerships, and gay stepfamilies. Also, we tested whether relationship quality mediated the link between outness and cohesion and the moderating role of type of relationship. Results showed that those in first cohabiting partnerships had the lowest levels of relationship quality and cohesion, whereas those in gay stepfamilies reported having the highest levels of relationship quality and those in repartnerships reported the highest levels of cohesion. For all couples, the link between outness and cohesion was partially mediated by relationship quality, and this was moderated for those in repartnerships.</p>

<body>
<p>There is a vast history of research that examines the role of family structure in influencing and differentiating various types of heterosexual families and their relationship experiences (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0192513X11418180">Bradbury, Fincham, &amp; Beach, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0192513X11418180">Brown &amp; Booth, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192513X11418180">Coleman, Ganong, &amp; Fine, 2000</xref>). Generally, this research indicates that certain types of heterosexual families (cohabiting, intact, remarried, stepfamilies) differ in terms of relationship processes and outcomes, thereby suggesting the importance of structure. There is also strong and consistent research suggesting that gay couples are comparable to various types of heterosexual couples (e.g., cohabiting, married) in terms of relationship processes and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0192513X11418180">Kurdek, 2004</xref>). However, one potentially important factor unique to gay couples is that of outness, or the degree to which others know one’s sexual orientation, and research suggests this influences relational outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0192513X11418180">Elizur &amp; Mintzer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0192513X11418180">Mohr &amp; Fassinger, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In spite of calls for more studies that address within-group variation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0192513X11418180">Demo, Aquilino, &amp; Fine, 2005</xref>), studies such as those mentioned above (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0192513X11418180">Kurdek, 2004</xref>) often have treated gay couples as monolithic or simply controlled for the influence of certain variables (e.g., length of relationship), potentially masking differences in structure (see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0192513X11418180">Lewis, Derlega, Berndt, Morris, &amp; Rose, 2001</xref>). It is likely that the lack of social recognition, the changing nature of legal status, and the resulting difficulty of conceptually differentiating types of gay couples has played a role in their monolithic presentation. However, recent changes in legal status (e.g., establishment of civil unions, domestic partner registries, same-sex marriage) led some scholars to examine the diversity within gay families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0192513X11418180">Solomon, Rothblum, &amp; Balsam, 2004</xref>). Such research suggests that type of relationship or family structure might be an important determinant of relationship processes and outcomes.</p>
<p>Here, we add to this literature by focusing on the relational differences among three types of gay relationships: those in first cohabiting relationships (first partnerships), in repartnerships (second cohabiting relationships), and in gay stepfamilies (gay cohabiting couples in which one or both were in a previous relationship and had at least one child in that relationship). Given previous research that finds some gender differences among same-sex couples (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0192513X11418180">Kurdek, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192513X11418180">Lynch, 2000</xref>), especially when children are present (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0192513X11418180">Goldberg, 2009</xref>) and to maximize our exploration of within-group variation among gay couples, only gay male couples are examined here. Additionally, we hypothesized that the more gay men in relationships are out (i.e., the extent to which others are aware of one’s sexual orientation), the more cohesive their relationships will be (i.e., perceived couple unity), and this link will be mediated by relationship quality (i.e., perceived match between current and ideal relationship standards around companionship, trust, and conflict) and moderated by type of relationship.</p>
<sec id="section1-0192513X11418180">
<title>Conceptual Framework</title>
<p>We draw on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0192513X11418180">Demo et al. (2005)</xref> and use a family composition and transitions framework. This framework suggests that common transitions affecting family composition include transitions from singlehood to cohabitation, marriage to divorce, and divorce to remarriage. These transitions are associated with myriad stressors (e.g., changes in family relationships among extended family members, changes in parenting and child custody, changes in daily routines and rituals, changes in residence). Such stressors are linked to changes in individual, couple, and family well-being and other outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0192513X11418180">Demo et al., 2005</xref>). Unique to gay couples, outness would be expected to affect couple/family functioning and outcomes. Theoretically, if one or both partners are less out to others, they likely will hide their relationships and this can create stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0192513X11418180">Elizur &amp; Mintzer, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, these stressors also might differ by family composition. For example, married couples who divorce necessarily experience different stress based on the presence or absence of children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192513X11418180">Coleman et al., 2000</xref>). Couples without children will experience stress from dividing marital assets, whereas couples with children will experience the added stress of both dividing assets and determining custody and visitation arrangements.</p>
<p>For gay couples, transitions that affect family composition can take several forms, such as entering a first cohabiting partnership or subsequent cohabiting partnerships, which we term <italic>repartnerships</italic>. Another transition affecting family composition occurs when a heterosexually married man comes out as gay (at least to himself), divorces his wife, and eventually enters a cohabiting relationship with another man. When a child is present from his previous marriage, the resulting family is a gay stepfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0192513X11418180">Berger, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0192513X11418180">Crosbie-Burnett &amp; Helmbrecht, 1993</xref>). We recognize that some gay stepfamilies are not formed following a heterosexual marriage, but this is the most common pathway currently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0192513X11418180">Berger, 2000</xref>). Our interest here is how these three family structures (first partnerships, repartnerships, and gay stepfamilies) differ. This framework also is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0192513X11418180">Cherlin’s (1978)</xref> <italic>incomplete institutionalization hypothesis</italic>, which asserts those in remarriages and stepfamilies experience more difficulty and decreased relational stability because their relationships are not supported socially. Applied to gay couples, none of their relationships are institutionalized in most respects or in most states; for those in repartnerships and stepfamilies, there is a double deinstitutionalization. Furthermore, within the gay community children who are part of a relationship are embraced by some and said to be a symbol of heteronormative conformity by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0192513X11418180">Lannutti, 2005</xref>). As such, it may well be that gay stepfamilies are particularly vulnerable to ambiguity and effects of incomplete institutionalism.</p>

<title>Differences in Outness, Relationship Quality, and Cohesion</title>
<sec id="section3-0192513X11418180">
<title>Outness</title>
<p>For gay men, coming out is a significant life event that partially defines one’s sexual identity and is associated with various individual and couple outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0192513X11418180">Elizur &amp; Mintzer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0192513X11418180">Haas &amp; Stafford, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0192513X11418180">Savin-Williams, 2001</xref>). However, research has focused more explicitly on how outness and other gay identity variables influence individual outcomes. What we do know suggests that gay men who are more out report less depression and higher relationship quality than those who are not out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0192513X11418180">Elizur &amp; Mintzer, 2003</xref>). Alternatively, those who are less out also report lower self-acceptance and lower relationship quality.</p>
<p>Coming out can occur at various ages over one’s life and continues as men interact with new others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0192513X11418180">Savin-Williams, 2001</xref>). In this way, it is a dynamic and continuous developmental process. Because transitions that affect family composition include meeting and interacting with new individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0192513X11418180">Demo et al., 2005</xref>), we hypothesized that outness differs by type of couple. Based on where individuals likely are developmentally, including their age (i.e., younger), we expect those making a transition to a first cohabiting relationship are least out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0192513X11418180">Rutter &amp; Schwartz, 1996</xref>). Conversely, we assumed that those in a repartnership will be more out on average than those in a first partnership. Gay stepfamilies present a unique group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192513X11418180">Lynch, 2000</xref>). Previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0192513X11418180">Berger, 2000</xref>) suggests that some gay individuals in stepfamilies are likely to hide their sexual orientation, most often because of the added difficulty over child custody issues. Additionally, many of these individuals come out as part of the divorce process nonetheless, and this is more common among gay men exiting a previous heterosexual marriage than it is among lesbians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192513X11418180">Lynch, 2000</xref>). Thus, we predicted that gay men in stepfamilies will be more out than those in first partnerships but similar to those in repartnerships.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0192513X11418180">
<title>Relationship quality</title>
<p>The second variable of interest here is relationship quality. Generally, research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0192513X11418180">Brown &amp; Booth, 1996</xref>) suggests that relationship quality among heterosexual couples differs by family structure and is comparable between heterosexual and gay relationships (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0192513X11418180">Kurdek, 2004</xref>). However, findings that compare relationship quality between those heterosexual couples in first marriages and remarriages are mixed. For example, some studies found higher relationship quality among first marriages than remarriages, whereas others reported no differences between groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192513X11418180">Coleman et al., 2000</xref>). Taken together, we do not expect to find differences in relationship quality between those in first cohabiting relationships and repartnerships. However, again we believe that gay stepfamilies represent a unique group, and they will report higher levels of relationship quality than those in first partnerships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0192513X11418180">Crosbie-Burnett &amp; Helmbrecht, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192513X11418180">Lynch, 2000</xref>). We posited this for two reasons. First, gay men who were in a heterosexual relationship should experience a heightened level of relationship quality when they enter into a partnership that is consistent with their sexual identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0192513X11418180">Stets, 1993</xref>) and their relationship ideals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0192513X11418180">Fletcher, Simpson, &amp; Thomas, 2000</xref>). Second, lowered marital quality in stepfamilies often is attributed partially to issues of stepparenting (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0192513X11418180">Braithwaite &amp; Baxter, 2006</xref>). Because the focus here is on gay men, and men are less likely to be custodial parents, we believe that the negative effects of stepfamily living on relationship quality will not be present or will be lessened. In this way, gay stepfamilies should differ from first partnership and repartnership structures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0192513X11418180">
<title>Cohesion</title>
<p>Previous studies found differences in cohesion associated with family structure and composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0192513X11418180">Brines &amp; Joyner, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0192513X11418180">Lavee &amp; Olson, 1991</xref>). However, to date no research has examined cohesion in gay relationships explicitly or from a quantitative perspective, as is done here. Thus, we offer a tentative prediction on how cohesion differs among the groups we studied. We speculated that the lack of legal status and difficulty finding social support to build and maintain cohesion will result in lower levels of cohesion among those in first partnerships than either of the other two groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0192513X11418180">LaSala, 2000</xref>). For those in repartnerships, we expected that they are more adept at navigating these issues because of prior relationship experiences. Thus, prior partnerships might help couples develop certain relationship maintenance skills of which cohesion is one such skill. In fact, cohesion includes the ability to establish and maintain boundaries with the outside world, as well as maintain emotional bonds within the family system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0192513X11418180">Olson &amp; Gorall, 2003</xref>). Given the discrimination experienced by gay men and couples, the need to navigate and establish boundaries within a stigmatizing social world is paramount to couple development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0192513X11418180">Mohr &amp; Fassinger, 2006</xref>). As such, prior relationship experience may be crucial to the development of cohesion. Gay stepfamilies are formed after prior relationship experiences that aid in general relationship skill development specific to heterosexual relationships; however, they might lack skills needed to combat social stigma that accompanies gay stepfamilies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0192513X11418180">Crosbie-Burnett &amp; Helmbrecht, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192513X11418180">Lynch, 2000</xref>), both as part of being gay and a stepfamily. Thus, we speculated that cohesion among gay stepfamilies will fall between those in first partnerships and those in repartnerships.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0192513X11418180">
<title>Our Model Explaining Cohesion in Gay Relationships</title>
<p>Our second goal was to examine how level of outness, relationship quality, and cohesion are linked and to explore variations by relationship type. Specifically, we hypothesized that the more out gay men in relationships are, the more cohesive their relationships will be, and that this link will be mediated partially by the quality of their relationship. Furthermore, we posited that the mediated model will differ by type of relationship.</p>
<p>As stated earlier, previous research indicates that level of outness influences various relationship processes and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0192513X11418180">Elizur &amp; Mintzer, 2003</xref>). Specific to outness and couple outcomes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0192513X11418180">Mohr and Fassinger (2006)</xref> found that each dimension of LGB identity influenced relationship quality and that perceived identity similarity between partners also affected relationship quality. However, actor rather than partner effects matter most. Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0192513X11418180">LaSala (2000)</xref> interviewed 20 gay couples and found that being out played an important role in allowing them to feel more connected as a couple, a feeling that reflects cohesion. It is likely that being out reduces internal stressors such as homonegativity and stigma consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0192513X11418180">Pinel, 1999</xref>) and that fewer internal stressors reduce depression and anxiety among individuals, thereby influencing the relationship directly and indirectly. Additionally, other research found that being out also is linked to increased relationship quality (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0192513X11418180">Lewis, Kozac, Milardo, &amp; Grosnick, 1992</xref>) and that relationship quality is associated with cohesion (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0192513X11418180">Fisiloglu &amp; Lorenzetti, 1994</xref>). Qualitative scholars (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0192513X11418180">McQueeney, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0192513X11418180">Oswald, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0192513X11418180">2002</xref>) found that being out as a couple and subsequently being recognized and treated as a couple provided a sense of cohesion and positively influenced relationship quality. However, none of these studies examined or measured cohesion explicitly. Similar findings related to the link between relationship quality and cohesion also are reported for heterosexual couples (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0192513X11418180">Craddock, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0192513X11418180">Fisiloglu &amp; Lorenzetti, 1994</xref>) and grandparent–grandchild dyads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0192513X11418180">Ruiz &amp; Silverstein, 2007</xref>). Thus, we argue that the link between outness and cohesion is at least partially mediated by relationship quality. Because we outlined previous research earlier suggesting that each of the variables in our model differs by type of relationship, we assumed that the links in the proposed model are moderated by the type of relationship.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section8-0192513X11418180">
<title>Procedures and Sample</title>
<p>An Internet-based survey was used to collect data because previous findings demonstrate increased access to marginalized populations (e.g., LGBT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0192513X11418180">Davis, Bolding, Hart, Sherr, &amp; Elford, 2004</xref>), efficiency, and the cost-effectiveness of using the Internet in this way (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0192513X11418180">Murray &amp; Fisher, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0192513X11418180">Rhodes, DiClemente, Cecil, Hergenrather, &amp; Yee, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0192513X11418180">van Eeden-Moorefield, Proulx, &amp; Pasley, 2008</xref>). Although we acknowledge that this method limits the ability to reach certain populations (e.g., those who live in rural areas where Internet access is not widely available, those who have fewer financial resources), Internet users are becoming more diverse in ethnicity and socioeconomic status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0192513X11418180">Pew Internet Life Project, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0192513X11418180">U.S. Department of Commerce, 2004</xref>). Most research on LGBT families has relied on more affluent and homogeneous samples (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0192513X11418180">Kurdek, 2004</xref>). Although we hoped to obtain a more diverse sample through this method, we also recognize that samples obtained by Internet methods might be similar to those garnered by more traditional sampling methods. The Internet provides an added benefit particularly appropriate for research on gay men—that of greater confidentiality. As such, we hoped that marginalized individuals, who might otherwise not participate for fear of being <italic>outed</italic> or experiencing further social stigmatization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0192513X11418180">Davis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0192513X11418180">van Eeden-Moorefield et al., 2008</xref>), would participate in this study.</p>
<p>To date, most online research relies on creating survey websites and registering them with search engines or establishing links from other sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0192513X11418180">Rhodes et al., 2002</xref>). In many cases, the surveys are open to anyone (as opposed to screening and use of passwords) for participation (including multiple completions by the same individual), thereby producing an opportunity for increased bias (i.e., lack of independence; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0192513X11418180">Copeland &amp; White, 1991</xref>). Measures taken in the current study to reduce this potential are outlined below.</p>
<p>A convenience sample of 43 nationally and locally based (southeastern) organizations that cater to gay men and or gay couples was contacted. Local organizations were targeted for oversampling due to needs related to meeting the goals of a larger study. Eighteen e-mails were returned as invalid, and 14 responded and agreed to assist in recruitment by sending study announcements via listservs or newsletters. Those who responded and declined to assist in recruitment (11) did so because of organizational policies or because their next newsletter would not be sent until after the scheduled study completion date. Although organizations also were asked for available member demographic information (e.g., the number of gay men that potentially would receive study notification), they reported that they did not maintain such information.</p>
<p>Potential participants contacted the first author directly to obtain additional information and be screened for participation (i.e., participants must self-identify as gay, currently be involved in a gay relationship of at least 3 months, and only one partner was asked to participate). Those interested were provided with the secure survey link, a username, and a password. Adding screening and e-mail communication steps to the participation process decreases the likelihood of problems with independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0192513X11418180">Murray &amp; Fisher, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0192513X11418180">Rhodes et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>These methods resulted in a total of 249 e-mail inquiries, of which 228 met study criteria and received passwords to complete the survey. Because online studies that offer incentives demonstrate high completion rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0192513X11418180">Reips, 2002</xref>), participants were given the opportunity to chose from three national charities (e.g., Human Rights Campaign), and an anonymous donation was made on their behalf. The resulting participation rate was 83%, which is consistent with previous studies and represents a high rate of participation.</p>
<p>The sample used in this analysis was drawn from a larger study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0192513X11418180">van Eeden-Moorefield, 2005</xref>) and includes only those men (<italic>N</italic> = 176) who self-identified as gay, were in a cohabiting relationship, and did not adopt or otherwise bring children into the current relationship (e.g., use of a surrogate; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0192513X11418180">Table 1</xref>). Overall, the sample was mostly White, well educated (79% had at least a bachelor’s degree), and employed, and almost half (48%) earned at least $50,000 or more. They represented 26 states and the District of Columbia. Their mean age was 40.7 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 11.66 years), the average length of their relationship was 8.48 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 8.44 years), and most (72.9%) were in closed (i.e., monogamous) relationships. Taken together, the sample was fairly homogeneous.</p>

<title>Measurement</title>
<sec id="section10-0192513X11418180">
<title>Family structure</title>
<p>Family structure was measured using responses to several relationship history questions (e.g., whether they were previously cohabiting with another man, whether they were previously married, whether they had a previous relationship) and questions about children from previous heterosexual marriages. Based on responses to these questions, respondents were grouped into three structures: first partnerships (<italic>n</italic> = 85), repartnerships (<italic>n</italic> = 63), and gay stepfamilies (<italic>n</italic> = 28). Unfortunately, no questions assessed residential status, age of child, or whether there was more than one prior cohabiting relationship with another man.</p>

<title>Outness</title>
<p>The Outness Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0192513X11418180">Mohr &amp; Fassinger, 2003</xref>) is a 15-item summed measure that assesses the extent to which the respondent’s sexual orientation is known and openly discussed with others (e.g., mother, best friend). Although it is likely that the importance of any individual who knows one’s sexual identity (e.g., mother vs. coworker) might differentially affect certain outcomes, scholars suggest a more linear process in who is told and when (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0192513X11418180">Savin-Williams, 2001</xref>; close friends, followed by siblings, mothers, etc.). As such, the more people to whom one is out represents a global level of outness, and that is our focus here. Individual item responses vary from <italic>does not know</italic> (1) to <italic>definitely knows, openly discussed</italic> (7). Higher scores reflect higher levels of being out with a possible range from 15 to 105, and the α for this sample was .66. Previous research reports αs ranging from .72 to .97 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0192513X11418180">Balsam &amp; Szymanski, 2005</xref>).</p>

Responses range from <italic>worse than I expected</italic> (−3) to <italic>better than I expected</italic> (+3). All words related to marriage were replaced with relationship or partnership.

The subscale contains 10 items that ask about the jointness, or cohesion, between the partners (sample item: “togetherness is important”) and should not be interpreted as a measure of enmeshment. The summed items are scored on a Likert-type scale, ranging from <italic>almost never</italic> (1) to <italic>almost always</italic> (5).

<title>Differences by Family Structure</title>
<p>As hypothesized, results from three one-way ANOVAs suggest that there are differences in mean scores by family structure for each of the variables (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0192513X11418180">Table 3</xref>). Post hoc analyses showed that generally our hypotheses were supported with one exception. Specifically, we hypothesized that mean outness scores would be lowest for those in first partnerships and highest for those in repartnerships and that these would be significantly different. We also suggested that those in gay stepfamilies would have scores between the other two groups but differ significantly from those in first partnerships only.

<p>We also hypothesized that those in first partnerships would have the lowest relationship quality scores, but they would not differ significantly from those in repartnerships. In our analyses this was not the case. In fact, those in repartnerships reported higher relationship quality than those in first partnerships. Furthermore, we hypothesized that those in gay stepfamilies would report scores between the other two groups. Our results indicated that gay stepfamilies differed significantly from both those in first partnerships and repartnerships with the highest levels of relationship quality. Finally, we hypothesized that those in first partnerships would report the lowest levels of cohesion followed by gay stepfamilies and then those in repartnerships. Although this was the case in terms of mean scores, the difference was between first partnerships and repartnerships only.</p>
<p>Generally, our results suggest that those in their first partnerships are the group most at risk for poor relationship outcomes, given their lower levels of outness, relationship quality, and cohesion compared with those in repartnerships and stepfamilies. However, overall the differences are not large.</p>

<sec id="section17-0192513X11418180">
<title>Testing the Overall Model Explaining Cohesion</title>
<p>We first tested the mediating model with the full sample, in which we hypothesized that the effect of outness on cohesion would be partially mediated by relationship quality. Relationship duration, education level, and income were included as control variables given the correlation between these variables and both outness and relationship outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0192513X11418180">Kurdek, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0192513X11418180">Lewis et al., 1992</xref>). Education level and income were not significant and, thus, were dropped from the model. Relationship duration was retained. Results of the hierarchical regression suggest that relationship quality partially mediated the relationship between outness and cohesion, accounting for 44% of the variance in cohesion (see results of Model 3 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0192513X11418180">Table 4</xref>). Specifically, those who reported being more out to others also reported higher relationship quality, which then was associated with higher levels of cohesion. This finding is consistent with previous qualitative studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0192513X11418180">LaSala, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0192513X11418180">Oswald, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0192513X11418180">2002</xref>). Note that the second step suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0192513X11418180">Baron and Kenny (1986)</xref>, in which outness predicts relationship quality, is not reported in the model. Results were significant for this step, β = .35, <italic>t</italic> = 4.87, <italic>p</italic> = .00. Additionally, results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0192513X11418180">Sobel’s (1982)</xref> test suggest that partial mediation was significant, <italic>t</italic>(173) = 4.28, <italic>p</italic> = .00.</p>

<p>Next, we examined the same mediating relationship with the inclusion of family structure as a moderator (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0192513X11418180">Table 5</xref>). Results showed that family structure did moderate the model once the mediator was included. Compared with those in first partnerships, there was a significant interaction between being out and family structure for those in repartnerships. Thus, it appears that being out may play a more significant role in predicting relationship quality and cohesion for those in repartnerships beyond that of first cohabiting couples and stepfamilies. However, before the mediator was entered the link between outness and cohesion was also moderated such that outness played a significant role for those in first partnerships only. Consistent with results for the full model, the final model was partially mediated, again accounting for 44% of the variance in cohesion.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The pathways that some gay couples and families take to recognize and legitimize their relationships have transformed with the development and passage of domestic partnership policies and civil union and marriage laws in several U.S. states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0192513X11418180">Solomon et al., 2004</xref>) although it can be argued that these families remain incomplete institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0192513X11418180">Cherlin, 1978</xref>). Whereas some gay couples continue to live in “invisible” relationships (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0192513X11418180">LaSala, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0192513X11418180">Oswald, 2000</xref>), others now enjoy some of the benefits of cohabiting, civil unions, and legal marriage, or at least the opportunity to choose these and other relational options that recognize and make visible their partnerships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0192513X11418180">Solomon et al., 2004</xref>). Added to this is the increasing likelihood and opportunity for gay couples to bring a child into their relationships either through adoption, surrogacy, or from a previous heterosexual marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0192513X11418180">Crosbie-Burnett &amp; Helmbrecht, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192513X11418180">Lynch, 2000</xref>). As such, the individual and relational experiences of transitions that affect family composition differ, leading to an increased need to examine within-group variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0192513X11418180">Demo et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The results of our study contribute to the literature on within-group variation in gay couples in three ways. First, the results respond to the call by scholars (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0192513X11418180">Demo et al., 2005</xref>) to add to a scant literature examining within-group variation among couples in general and gay couples in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0192513X11418180">Elizur &amp; Mintzer, 2003</xref>). However, the current study did not produce the desired diverse sample especially in terms of ethnicity, which likely is another key moderating variable to consider in future research. There is research showing that responses to homosexuality and experiences of such couples is ethnically unique (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0192513X11418180">McQueeney, 2003</xref>). With few exceptions, our findings related to differences in outness, relationship quality, and cohesion between those in first partnerships, repartnerships, and gay stepfamilies were as expected. In some cases our findings were somewhat unlike those of others (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0192513X11418180">Kurdek, 2004</xref>) where, on average, gay couples were similar to their heterosexual counterparts. We assert that this is because our findings demonstrate variation that potentially was masked in previous research where all gay couples were treated as similar rather than distinct. Instead, our findings are more consistent with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0192513X11418180">Lewis et al. (2001)</xref>, who suggested some level of influence of structure on relational experiences.</p>
<p>A second and noteworthy contribution is the finding that gay couples in repartnerships reported higher relationship quality and cohesion than those in first partnerships—a finding that adds to the mixed findings from other studies about the nature of marital quality among heterosexual couples in first marriages compared with remarriages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192513X11418180">Coleman et al., 2000</xref>). We also found support for our prediction that relationship quality would be higher among gay stepfamilies compared with other gay couples, consistent with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0192513X11418180">Crosbie-Burnett &amp; Helmbrecht, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192513X11418180">Lynch, 2000</xref>). Earlier we suggested that gay stepfamilies were unique in that they present an opportunity for a man in a previous heterosexual marriage to reconcile his sexual identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0192513X11418180">Stets, 1993</xref>) and his relationship ideals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0192513X11418180">Fletcher et al., 2000</xref>). We also suggested that lowered marital quality in stepfamilies is attributed partially to issues of stepparenting or selection effects (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0192513X11418180">Braithwaite &amp; Baxter, 2006</xref>) and that because gay stepfamilies were less likely to have custodial children present, they would have higher relationship quality. The potential for selection effects to operate in our sample is possible. From <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0192513X11418180">Cherlin’s (1978)</xref> hypothesis, we argue that none of these couples, regardless of type, enter institutionalized relationships. Thus, these hypothesized effects are equally experienced by all gay couples, but the degree to which they are experienced likely differs by state of residence and the individual marriage laws within the state. Taken together, the fact that we did not ask specific questions about child custody, stepparenting, or perceived social deinstitutionalization are limitations of the current study and should be addressed in future research.</p>
<p>The findings from testing our model of relationship processes predicting cohesion showed that the model worked equally well for all couples. However, when family structure was added as a moderator, and before relationship quality was entered, there was a moderating effect of family structure on cohesion. That is, those in stepfamilies who were more out had lower cohesion. Once relationship quality was entered as a mediator, this effect was reduced to nonsignificance and a significant effect emerged for those in repartnerships (e.g., higher outness was related to higher cohesion as mediated by relationship quality). It may be that this finding can be explained in future studies that also incorporate adaptability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0192513X11418180">Olson &amp; Gorall, 2003</xref>) into the model. For example, those in repartnerships were more out, and this may mean that less change and adaptability are needed in daily life and relationships. As such, cohesion might be more important for these couples. Alternatively, those in first cohabiting relationships and stepfamilies were less out, representing more potential changes, in addition to the added transitions related to forming a stepfamily. For these two groups of couples, adaptability may be more salient in conjunction with relationship quality. Certainly, these are speculations and should be tested in future studies. Furthermore, the lack of data on custodial arrangements and other stepfamily life variables are limitations affecting interpretation of our results. Importantly, this result differs from the established literature on heterosexuals that generally suggests relationship processes do not differ among those in remarriages and those in stepfamilies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192513X11418180">Coleman et al., 2000</xref>). Our findings also slightly differ from literature suggesting differences between those in first marriages compared with remarriages and stepfamilies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0192513X11418180">Bradbury et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0192513X11418180">Brown &amp; Booth, 1996</xref>). Clearly, the inclusion of family structure and level of outness are important in understanding the diversity within gay relationships, and future research should include these. We make this recommendation realizing that the reliability of the outness measure was less than desirable and any recommendations must be made with caution.</p>
<p>Overall and consistent with previous research, the results presented here suggest that although family structure is important, family processes appear to be more important in explaining family life and family outcomes among gay couples in our study. Clearly our results support those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0192513X11418180">Kurdek (2004)</xref>, suggesting that gay and heterosexual families are more similar than different. Our hypotheses were derived from the broader literature on remarriage and stepfamilies and generally were consistent. For gay men, however, we believe that the role of outness is both unique and important when examining the relationship experiences of gay couples.</p>
