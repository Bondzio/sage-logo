<abstract>
<p>This study theorizes about the behavioral and knowledge creation implications of betting on the losing technology in a competing technology situation and focuses on three main outcomes. First, in a situation with competing technological options, firms that invest initially in the losing technology will be less successful subsequently in building new knowledge in the winning technology because their experience with failure will lead them to update their expectations of the industry and choose to pursue less risky alternatives. Second, two classic risk-reducing strategies—investing in both technologies or entering after uncertainty is resolved—will not be completely effective. Firms investing in both technologies are likely to suffer the incentive and coordination-driven innovation penalties of generalists, while late entrants will suffer learning disadvantages. Third, the possession of key and relevant complementary assets—upstream and downstream—will positively moderate the observed inertial effect on firms that backed the failed technology and generalists that backed both technologies, as these complementary assets will increase incentives to adapt to the winning technology. I find empirical support for my hypotheses using a novel data set on the evolution of the global flat panel display industry from 1964 to 2003 to investigate the technological competition between plasma and liquid crystal displays. Results show that firms initially pursuing plasma generated less subsequent knowledge in liquid crystal displays, and that firms betting on both technologies were also slow to build knowledge in liquid crystal displays. Meanwhile, firms with upstream and downstream complementary assets were able to moderate, but not overcome, this barrier to knowledge creation. The findings have implications for our study of technological evolution and adaption, for learning from failure and reinforcement learning, and for the relationship between resource partitioning and adaptation.</p>

<p>Managerial choices made at entry into an industry—and the unfolding success or failure of those choices—can have a significant impact on the evolution of a firm’s position in an emerging industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0001839212447181">Romanelli and Tushman, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0001839212447181">Barnett and Burgelman, 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0001839212447181">Noda and Collis (2001</xref>: 920) highlighted the “important role of managerial discretion in shaping and changing a firm’s evolutionary path.” One way in which managerial choice may affect outcomes is through technological choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0001839212447181">Tegarden, Hatfield, and Echols, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0001839212447181">Bayus and Agarwal, 2007</xref>). Managers at firms confronting technological uncertainty in newly emerging industries face important choices about the timing of entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0001839212447181">Mitchell, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0001839212447181">Christensen, Suárez, and Utterback, 1998</xref>) and, in the case of competing options, which technology to support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0001839212447181">Kretschmer, 2008</xref>). Some of these choices will likely result in failure because of the technological uncertainty that precedes the emergence of a dominant design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0001839212447181">Garud, Nayyar, and Shapira, 1997</xref>). These failed technological efforts may have important ramifications for the technological capabilities of the firm by affecting managerial decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0001839212447181">Staw, Sandelands, and Dutton, 1981</xref>) and limiting effective knowledge creation in the winning technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0001839212447181">Cohen and Levinthal, 1990</xref>). In this respect, technological choices are the seeds of organizational path dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0001839212447181">Liebowitz and Margolis, 1995</xref>) and represent an imprinting process with long-term implications. A firm that bet on the winning technology initially would be fine. But a firm’s future knowledge-generating ability in the winning technology may be constrained by initially betting on the losing technology.</p>
<p>Prior research on technological competition has largely focused on the competition between an existing technology and an emerging one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0001839212447181">Dosi, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0001839212447181">Tushman and Anderson, 1986</xref>), with special attention given to the competition between new entrants and industry incumbents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0001839212447181">Christensen and Bower, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0001839212447181">Klepper, 1996</xref>). Such studies effectively select on technological success and investigate the constraints on incumbents in switching to the new technology. Those studies that specifically examine the competition between two new and uncertain technologies focus on which technology wins and why (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0001839212447181">Arthur, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0001839212447181">Schilling, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0001839212447181">2002</xref>). Neither perspective provides insights into the long-term implications of the four core choices available to a firm facing competing technologies: to invest early in technology A, invest early in technology B, invest early in both, or wait until uncertainty is resolved. Understanding how the failure of technological investments affects a firm’s evolution can provide insight into how managers do and should make decisions under technological uncertainty.</p>
<p>This study fills this gap with a different approach from most research on technology evolution, integrating feedback-based learning theories to offer a perspective of the imprinting effect of an initial investment choice on subsequent knowledge accumulation in the emerging dominant technology. The core idea is that the failure of a speculative investment will lead to an updating of expectations that manifests as inertia and retreat. Parallel investment in multiple options and the possession of complementary assets may decrease, but not eliminate, this failure-driven inertia. Empirically, I test my hypotheses by investigating failed technological decisions in the global flat panel display industry from 1964 to 2003. In the early stages of the industry’s development, a number of competing technologies existed, but speculation primarily focused on liquid crystal (LCD) and plasma displays. Engineers and managers expressed uncertainty about which technology would produce profitable products. A series of subsequent technological innovations propelled LCD to its status as the dominant technology. It became clear that firms originally supporting plasma had backed the wrong technology and faced important strategic choices about how to respond. This paper investigates how prior failed support for plasma affected the organizational ability to respond to LCD’s success.</p>

<title>Technology Investment Under Uncertainty</title>
<p>Managers at firms entering a new and uncertain industry face a variety of choices, most notably the choices of when to enter the industry and which technology or technologies to support. Firms willing to enter an industry rife with technological uncertainty are most likely to be those whose managers view the industry as strategically important for the firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0001839212447181">Mitchell, 1989</xref>). Thus the ability of a firm that initially supported the losing technology to reorient around the winning one is a strategically important measure of firm performance. Prior work on technological choices and industry evolution suggests that firms making the wrong technological choices would be more likely to survive if they switched to the winning technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0001839212447181">Tegarden, Hatfield, and Echols, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0001839212447181">Bayus and Agarwal, 2007</xref>). But the process by which firms experiencing an initial failure may switch by building technological competence in the winning technology is likely to be non-trivial.</p>
<p>Theories of path dependence suggest that seemingly small events, such as technological choices, can shape long-term industry and organizational evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0001839212447181">Nelson and Winter, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0001839212447181">Arthur, 1989</xref>). Reversing path-dependent processes may be difficult, suggesting that “an initial unfavorable experience will create a downward spiral of failure” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0001839212447181">Noda and Collis, 2001</xref>: 922). Prior failures generate informational feedback, and though feedback-based learning has important implications for strategic decisions, it is easy to misinterpret and may lead to undesirable outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0001839212447181">Sterman, 1989</xref>). The qualitative outcome of the firm’s initial forays into a new industry can have a powerful effect on the types of inferences managers draw about the viability of the emerging technological path, which in turn affects investment, knowledge creation, and long-term strategic opportunities and positioning. This perspective suggests that initial choices may be of great significance, and reorienting around the winning technology after originally supporting the losing technology may not be a simple process despite the potential benefits of doing so.</p>

<title>The Effect of Failure on Knowledge Creation</title>
<p>For investigating how firms respond to the failure of their technological efforts, the literature on learning from failure provides useful insights. Most research in this stream focuses on why learning from failure is difficult and offers two primary reasons. First, managers must agree on the root causes of failure to facilitate learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0001839212447181">Cannon and Edmondson, 2001</xref>), but they often refuse to take responsibility or share information among the various parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0001839212447181">Husted and Michailova, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0001839212447181">Haunschild and Rhee (2004)</xref> found that more learning took place when automobile firms voluntarily recalled their products as opposed to being forced to recall them, with the implication that voluntary recalls suggest internal consensus. Reaching consensus on the causes of failure is especially difficult in fast-changing environments, in which assigning blame within the organization is problematic because of the complex interaction of internal and external forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0001839212447181">Lant, Milliken, and Batra, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, learning from failure is a sensemaking process tied to how managers interpret available data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0001839212447181">Huff and Schwenk, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0001839212447181">Weick, 1993</xref>). Failure events generally provide infrequent data, which can lead to poor organizational learning as managers make inaccurate generalizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0001839212447181">Haas and Hansen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0001839212447181">Kim, Kim, and Miner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0001839212447181">Zollo and Reuer, 2010</xref>). Organizational attempts to learn from incomplete and insufficient experience are less likely to be successful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0001839212447181">Miner et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0001839212447181">Beckman and Haunschild, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0001839212447181">Haunschild and Sullivan, 2002</xref>). To the extent that data are available from failure events, the data are often encapsulated in “weak cues” that are easy for managers to miss or misinterpret (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0001839212447181">Rerup, 2009</xref>). Instead, managers have a tendency to write off small failures as random events and explain away large failures as products of the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0001839212447181">Starbuck and Hedberg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0001839212447181">Baumard and Starbuck, 2005</xref>). Even if the organization and its managers realize that the available data are unreliable, any learning is still likely to be uncertain and ineffective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0001839212447181">Mezias and Starbuck, 2003</xref>). Taken together, these two key elements identified in the prior literature on learning from failure suggest that firms will under-learn from failure and are likely to take away improper inferences.</p>
<p>When firm are confronted with uncertain outcomes, typical in new technological industries, failure can lead them to behave myopically. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0001839212447181">Denrell and March (2001)</xref> used a two-armed bandit model to show that firms receiving negative feedback from an initial encounter with an alternative with unknown payoffs are likely to allocate resources to better-understood alternatives. As they stated, firm-level “adaptation will often fail to correct errors involving alternatives that initially appear worse than they actually are” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0001839212447181">Denrell and March, 2001</xref>: 524), suggesting that firms experiencing failure in an uncertain arena may be highly unlikely to make additional investment in that arena in the future. The result is a bias against risky alternatives that looks like a change in risk preferences but is actually a sampling and reinforcement learning process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0001839212447181">March, 1996</xref>). In line with this suggestion, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0001839212447181">Baumard and Starbuck (2005)</xref> reported that the telecommunications firm they studied interpreted many of its failures as signals to move in a different direction and abandon the technological path that led to failure, such as the response to PageMe that led the firm to move away from text/data and back toward voice communications.</p>
<p>The result is that failure of one uncertain technological path within an industry will lead to a lowered effort and ability to generate new knowledge in the winning technology through the following process. First, firms choose to invest in an uncertain new technology when technologies are competing. Second, technological evolution reveals that choice to have been a failure. Third, in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0001839212447181">Denrell and March (2001)</xref>, managers update their estimations of the value of the uncertain options available, and they implement organizational changes, likely through the resource allocation process, that decrease the attractiveness of options perceived as risky and refocus efforts on better-understood alternatives. Fourth, the firm allocates fewer resources to risky and uncertain alternatives like the emerging winning technology. And fifth, the firm generates less new knowledge in the winning technology due to the imprinting effect of the initial failure. This leads to the first hypothesis in the study:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>Hypothesis 1 (H1):</bold> Early entrants who enter supporting the losing technology will exhibit slower subsequent knowledge growth in the winning technology than firms supporting the winning technology initially.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In addition to the rationale offered above from feedback-based learning and updating, there are three alternate reasons why firms initially supporting the failed technology might be less successful in generating new knowledge in the winning technology. The first is that there is a tendency for firms to persist in their R&amp;D activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0001839212447181">Griliches, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0001839212447181">Helfat, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0001839212447181">Breschi, Lissoni, and Malerba, 2003</xref>). This fact will lead firms to continue to invest in the failed technology, manifesting an escalation of commitment to a losing cause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0001839212447181">Staw, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0001839212447181">Guler, 2007</xref>), which may decrease the resources available for research on the winning technology. The validity of this concern can be addressed empirically. Second, due to the potential cumulativeness of the winning technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0001839212447181">Dierickx and Cool, 1989</xref>), firms that initially supported the competing technology may be constrained in their ability to generate new knowledge in the winning technology. The effect of the cumulative nature of the winning technology can also be examined empirically.</p>
<p>The third concern is that firms may choose whether to pursue any given technology based on their competences. Firms may possess capabilities important for the losing technology that drove their initial choice and may lack capabilities in the winning technology. This potential concern can be investigated by looking at a specific technological evolutionary pattern: the situation in which the losing technology reemerges after the initial technological competition with potentially profitable niche applications. If the initial decision about which technology to pursue was based on what capabilities the firm possessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0001839212447181">Dierickx and Cool, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0001839212447181">Barney, 1991</xref>), then firms initially supporting the losing technology are likely to reinvest in that technology should it reemerge as a viable alternative later. Given the reinforcement learning rationale offered above for H1, however, firms initially supporting the losing technology should be more likely to abandon that technology completely, even if the technology reemerges through the efforts of other firms in the industry. The opportunity still has a high degree of uncertainty, and the updating process wrought by the initial failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0001839212447181">Denrell and March, 2001</xref>) will diminish the appeal of that technological path irrespective of any competences accumulated. This manifests as a “once bitten, twice shy” effect whereby firms that initially supported the technology but saw it fail to achieve major commercial success would be unlikely to jump back into that technology later, despite the knowledge and capabilities that they may possess. Thus, even though firms that initially supported the failed technology may have relevant capabilities in that technology, the learning effects discussed above make the investment in new knowledge generation in that area less likely.</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>Hypothesis 2 (H2):</bold> Should the losing technology reemerge subsequently, early entrants initially supporting that technology will be less likely to reinvest than firms initially supporting the winning technology.</p></list-item>

<title>Complementary Assets as a Moderator of Failed Investments</title>
<p>Given the earlier suggestion that failure will cause firms to draw inferences from their initial experiences that may limit how much they learn and can create new knowledge in the future, a key question becomes what might counteract this inertia—what choices and circumstances might lead firms to generate greater new knowledge despite the experience of failure? In this study, I investigate two potential moderating effects on failure: the possession of complementary assets that increase the incentives for generating new knowledge in the winning technology and the decision to enter by investing simultaneously in both uncertain technologies.</p>
<p>The logic offered for H1 above to describe why firms that invest early and fail would be unable to build knowledge in the winning technology was tied to reinforcement learning: the firm is uncertain of the potential payoffs attached to the new area, and the initial failure leads the firm to update its expectations in a way that reduces incentives to pursue the winning technology. This suggests that conditions that increase the incentives to pursue the winning technology, by increasing the expected payoff, would diminish inertial behavior. This logic offers a parallel to the broader literature on incumbents’ inertia in response to technological change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0001839212447181">Tushman and Anderson, 1986</xref>). The most prominent caveat suggested by this literature about when incumbent firms would be more likely to adapt to changing conditions is based on the possession of complementary assets that would be vital to commercializing the new technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0001839212447181">Teece, 1986</xref>). Studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0001839212447181">Mitchell (1989)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0001839212447181">Tripsas (1997)</xref> showed that firms facing uncertainty but possessing key complementary assets were much more likely to pursue potentially attractive options. With greater complementary assets, the perceived value of technological investments should increase as the firm’s ability to appropriate the gains from that innovation increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0001839212447181">King and Tucci, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0001839212447181">Cattani, 2005</xref>), which increases the incentives to adapt. Translating this perspective to failed technological investments, firms possessing relevant complementary assets should be more likely to overcome the inertial burden of failure and build more knowledge in the winning technology specifically because their perceived payoff from the uncertain technological space is higher than the payoff for firms lacking complementary assets.</p>
<p>Relevant complementary assets may be either upstream, relating to design and manufacturing, such as component parts for the final product, or downstream assets, related to commercialization, such as brand name and distribution networks. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0001839212447181">Tripsas (1997)</xref>, in looking at the role of manufacturing capacity and font libraries in the typesetting industry, focused largely on upstream complementary assets. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0001839212447181">Rothaermel (2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0001839212447181">2001b</xref>) argued that upstream complementary assets rarely retain their value in times of technological change but that downstream complementary assets are more likely to be useful across technologies. Other than the potential for more significant degradation of the value of upstream complementary assets in changing technological environments, there is no specific reason why either upstream or downstream assets, if relevant to the emerging winning technology, would not increase incentives to build knowledge in the winning technology. Thus although I will empirically test both upstream and downstream complementary assets, I will offer only a single hypothesis about the moderating effects of complementary assets on the failure of a technological investment:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>Hypothesis 3 (H3):</bold> Possession of relevant complementary assets will positively moderate the dampening effect on knowledge growth of having invested primarily in the losing technology.</p></list-item>

<title>Investments in Both Technologies: Generalists vs. Specialists</title>
<p>The most logical course of action for a firm facing competing uncertain technologies would be to invest in both technologies. This would embody a strategic real-options view of investment in the case of competing technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0001839212447181">Miller and Folta, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0001839212447181">McGrath and Nerkar, 2004</xref>). Looking at how evolving technological competition might affect the ability of firms investing in both technologies through the lens of resource partitioning, however, raises questions about the efficacy of this strategy.</p>
<p>In the literature on resource partitioning, firms are viewed as generalists or specialists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0001839212447181">Carroll, 1985</xref>), a distinction that is appropriate for competing technologies, as firms that invest in one technology or the other may be viewed as technological specialists, while those investing in both technologies can be seen as technological generalists. A great deal of work suggests that generalists learn poorly from their own direct experiences, compared with specialists (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0001839212447181">Ingram and Baum, 1997</xref>). One argument is that accountability is lower in specialist organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0001839212447181">Morris and Moore, 2000</xref>) and that the broader organizational structure of generalists buffers the firm from external factors and reduces incentives to learn from experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0001839212447181">Barnett, Greve, and Park, 1994</xref>). A second argument is that generalist organizations are more complex than specialists, and that complexity makes control and coordination of behaviors across the firm problematic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0001839212447181">Haunschild and Sullivan, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The result is that generalist organizations will be more inert in the face of rapidly changing external environments, as the firm’s incentives and ability to coordinate across activities limit flexibility. This explains why prior research on feature films found that generalist firms are less innovative than specialist firms, especially in the early stages of an industry’s evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0001839212447181">Mezias and Mezias, 2000</xref>). In the context of competing technologies, the ability to coordinate across activities, to better assess the relative strengths and weaknesses of the evolving technologies, and remain flexible, to shift resources between related projects, increases in importance. Therefore generalist firms may be less successful in accelerating innovation as one technology emerges as dominant. This reduced level of innovation may lead to generalists making less effective use of their knowledge creation resources as they escalate their focus on the winning technology. By contrast, specialist firms supporting the winning technology will be better able to evaluate their own experiences with the technology, recognize its emerging potential, and marshal resources to pursue its expanding technological scope. Therefore, although hedging on both technologies may improve outcomes compared with having bet only on the losing technology, it is unlikely to solve the problem completely. Generalist firms backing both technologies are likely to be less effective in generating new knowledge in the winning technology than firms that specialized in that technology from the beginning:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>Hypothesis 4 (H4):</bold> Early entrants who enter supporting both the winning and losing technologies will exhibit slower subsequent knowledge growth in the winning technology than firms supporting the winning technology initially.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The argument offered for H3 on the benefits of complementary assets largely focused on the additional incentives and ability to build knowledge in the winning technology that firms in possession of complementary assets would perceive. Given that reduced incentives were suggested above for H4 as a driving reason why generalist firms might be unable to be as effective in building knowledge as specialist firms, it follows that the effect of complementary assets should extend to those firms investing in both technologies, as well. Therefore I hypothesize:</p>

<list-item><p><bold>Hypothesis 5 (H5):</bold> Possession of relevant complementary assets will positively moderate the dampening effect on knowledge growth of having invested in both the losing and winning technologies.</p></list-item>

<title>Late Investment in the Winning Technology</title>
<p>The final option available to managers facing technological uncertainty and competition is to wait for uncertainty to be resolved before making irreversible technological commitments. This approach has the clear advantage of allowing the firm to avoid failed investments, but the firm is likely to face significant hurdles in building knowledge and momentum in the dominant technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0001839212447181">Christensen, Suárez, and Utterback,1998</xref>). From a learning perspective, the effect of learning curves in accumulating knowledge may mean that firms without the required underlying basic knowledge may be unable to assimilate and use new knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0001839212447181">Cohen and Levinthal, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0001839212447181">Argote, 1999</xref>). If there are assets and other resources that must be acquired to speed knowledge accumulation, then late entry may create additional barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0001839212447181">Lieberman and Montgomery, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0001839212447181">Dierickx and Cool, 1989</xref>). As a result, late entrants to the technological space will lag behind those firms that entered early supporting the winning technology. It is less clear how these late entrants might fare in relation to early entrants supporting the losing technology initially, as it requires comparing the inertial effects of failure and the learning effects of being late. This comparison can be investigated empirically, but it is clear that late entrants will be slower to build knowledge than early entrants supporting the winning technology:</p>

<title>Research Setting</title>
<p>The empirical tests of these hypotheses are set in the global flat panel display industry from 1963 to 2003. According to Display Source, the 2006 flat panel display industry generated sales of $85.5 billion worldwide, up 14 percent from 2004. Korean manufacturers LG Electronics and Samsung were the two leading branded suppliers, while Taiwanese companies AU Optronics and Chi Mei Optronics were two of the leading OEM providers. Despite the current dominance of Korean and Taiwanese manufacturers, however, the industry has long roots in both the U.S. and Japan.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, research in U.S. universities indicated the possibility of creating large flat panel screens to replace cathode ray tubes (CRT), first for computer monitors, which would facilitate the creation of portable computers, and eventually for televisions. In this early stage, there were a number of competing technologies, most notably liquid crystal (LCD) and gas plasma displays. Between 1964 and 1982, firms filed for and later received 899 patents in LCD technology and 1,083 patents in plasma technology, with very few years in that span with a single technology receiving less than 20 percent of the flat panel patents applied for. There was a great deal of uncertainty about which technology would develop into profitable products. Firms had identified key criteria for making it acceptable to customers and consumers (i.e., screen resolution, weight, power consumption, brightness, etc.), and scientists viewed this as a race to see which technology would be able to deliver on these criteria in a cost-effective way. In this early, uncertain stage, firms made research and development investments hoping to achieve the breakthrough discoveries that would make one of these technologies commercially viable. These firms came from a variety of backgrounds, including television manufacturers, computer companies, and watch companies. But the majority of firms viewed the primary short-term application of flat panel technologies as enabling laptop computers, whether they were computer makers themselves or viewed this as an opportunity to supply that market.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0001839212447181"><bold>1</bold></xref></sup></p>
<p>In the 1980s, a series of technological advances led to the emergence of LCD as the dominant technology. Specifically, three core elements of the eventual dominant design emerged independently during this period: active matrix thin film transistors (TFTs) instead of super-twisted nematic (STN) displays, the use of color instead of monochrome displays, and the use of amorphous silicon instead of polisilicon as an “addressing” element for controlling the activation of individual pixels. In San Diego, at the 1983 Society for Information Display (SID) Conference, the primary display technology trade show, Seiko-Epson presented a 2-inch color LCD prototype screen. Researchers in other firms discussed this event as an “eye-opening” experience. One market insider called the product “spectacular,” and another remembered telling his superiors that “this could really be the key for the future of flat panels.” This spurred R&amp;D managers from firms with LCD investments to ask senior management for additional funding to pursue LCD technology and led managers from plasma firms to question their commitment to plasma and consider reorienting around LCD technology. The result was that more than 20 other companies exhibited active-matrix LCD screens at SID events between 1984 and 1991 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0001839212447181">Howard, 1992</xref>). At this point, the central question shifted from “Which technology will be successful?” to “Which type of LCD technology will be dominant?” This dramatic shift in the level of interest in LCD versus plasma can be readily seen in the patent data. In 1982, 75 percent of the flat panel patents applied for were in LCD technology, marking the first time that any technology had captured more than 65 percent of the market. The share of LCD patents quickly rose above 90 percent and stayed above 87 percent through at least 2003 (the extent of my data). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0001839212447181">Figure 1</xref> presents a graphical view of the patent data for both LCD and plasma.</p>

</fig>
<p>The emerging momentum behind LCD significantly diminished interest in plasma displays. Most early plasma pioneers, including Owens-Illinois, IBM, Texas Instruments, Fujitsu, Philips, and Hitachi, dropped their plasma research programs by 1985.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0001839212447181"><bold>2</bold></xref></sup> All of the managers with whom I spoke confirmed that they viewed their previous plasma investments as failures and that this early research produced practically no commercially viable products. One manager stated that “we realized pretty early that [plasma] just didn’t make much sense any more,” while another manager called his firm’s early plasma investments “worthless.” Early leaders in plasma research redirected their efforts, as IBM sold off its intellectual property and manufacturing equipment to a scientist in upstate New York, Sony spun off its plasma computer display division into a new company that quickly closed, and managers at companies like Fujitsu gave orders that scientists should be retasked to work on LCD technologies, as there were scarce scientific resources available.</p>
<p>As we know anecdotally, though, while LCD went on to dominate computer displays, plasma did reemerge in the 1990s and 2000s for high-end, large-format television screens. As most early plasma supporters had sold off their early plasma investments, firms wishing to pursue plasma for the limited opportunity in televisions had to buy back into plasma in the 1990s. For example, Matsushita had been an early leader in plasma but bought a startup U.S. company to make significant headway into plasma displays in the 1990s. The reemergence of plasma offers a relatively unique opportunity to test hypothesis 2, which provides important insights into the mechanisms of failure-driven inertia.</p>
<p>More generally, this setting is an especially appropriate one in which to test the hypotheses for four reasons. First, this setting features multiple technologies and real uncertainty, which leads to significant heterogeneity in the patenting patterns of the firms involved. Second, despite early uncertainty, this setting features clear technological winners and losers, namely LCD and plasma, respectively, at least in terms of the returns on early investments. Third, this setting presents a situation with non-obvious outcomes. If the early period of technological uncertainty were very short and/or firms generally did not make any significant technology-specific investments during this period, then the expected effects of experiencing failure would be negligible. Conversely, if the winning technology were not clearly established until after a significant period of downstream capital investment, then it might be impossible for firms to recover from failure. In this situation, there was a significant period of uncertainty with investment in both research and rudimentary manufacturing in both technologies by a number of firms, but the dominant technology emerged before the significant ramp-up period in patenting and large-scale manufacturing. Finally, data to study this context are readily available and have many appealing features, as discussed below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0001839212447181">
<title>Data Sources and Sample</title>
<p>I relied primarily on patent data drawn from the Derwent Innovations Index, covering every flat panel display patent granted between 1964 and 2003 and every firm listed on those patents (more than 6,000 firms and 500,000 patents). I used Derwent data because the industry was truly global and U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) data excludes important non-U.S. companies, and because Derwent provides a fine-grained patent classification system that distinguishes between LCD and plasma patents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0001839212447181"><bold>3</bold></xref></sup> I assigned patents useful in both LCD and plasma displays as “general flat panel technologies” (these patents generally focus on component parts such as glass and power supply), so measures of LCD and plasma patents are applicable only to those technologies. Derwent groups patents into patent families, so that identical patents filed in multiple countries around the world are consolidated into a single patent family to prevent double counting (my dataset has more than 500,000 patents organized into about 250,000 patent families). All analyses done in this paper were based on patent families and not on individual patents, though I use the term “patent” for convenience. To prevent misclassification errors, I also excluded data on firms with fewer than four flat panel patents over their lifetime and focused only on for-profit firms, excluding government organizations, universities, individuals, etc. To remove the potential for selection biases and because I observed historical patenting data and current financial data on firms that abandoned their flat panel display efforts, I included firms throughout the entire panel (with a zero for the dependent variable) if they ceased patenting in flat panel technologies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0001839212447181"><bold>4</bold></xref></sup> Due to the sparseness of the pre-1970 data, my panel runs from 1970 through 2003 (though I counted pre-1970 patents in the firms’ totals). The final sample has 11,194 firm-year observations on 1,063 firms.</p>
<p>I supplemented this patent database with financial, company history, and qualitative interview data. Financial data came from a number of sources, including Compustat (U.S. and Global), Amadeus, Osiris, and <italic>Moody’s Review</italic> annual financial books. Company history data came from detailed searches through company history websites, annual reports, and secondary texts. Qualitative data came from detailed interviews with executives and research managers with long histories in the flat panel display market, both in the U.S. and Japan. Despite the fact that events that are the primary focus of this research took place more than 25 years ago, I was able to conduct more than 20 interviews (averaging about 90 minutes each) with 25 individuals with personal experience from at least 15 companies and secondary knowledge of at least 15 more (through personal friends and colleagues). These interviews, as well as previous qualitative work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0001839212447181">Matsui, West, and Bowen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0001839212447181">Murtha, Lenway, and Hart, 2001</xref>), help provide important context and firsthand knowledge of the decisions that firms made and why they made those decisions. All quotes and references to “experts” were drawn from those interviews.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0001839212447181">
<title>Dependent and Independent Variables</title>
<p>For H1 and H3–H6, the dependent variable is new knowledge created in the winning technology, which I proxied with the annual count of LCD patents the firm applied for and later received (<italic>LCD patents</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0001839212447181"><bold>5</bold></xref></sup> To test hypothesis 2 (about abandoning the failed technology as it is refocused on a specific niche), I used a dummy noting whether the firm had any plasma patents in the given year (from 1989 to 2003, during plasma’s renaissance), as more than 88 percent of firms had no plasma patents in this period.</p>
<p>The main independent variables were based on the timing of the firm’s first flat panel display patent and the composition of its patenting choices in the five years after entry. First, firms whose first flat panel display patent was after 1982 were classified as late entrants (<italic>Late entrant dummy</italic>). Second, as an initial test of hypothesis 1, I included the ratio of LCD patents to all flat panel display patents in the early entrants’ (not late entrants, as these firms entered after uncertainty was settled and focused almost exclusively on LCD) first five years in the industry (<italic>Share LCD at entry</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0001839212447181"><bold>6</bold></xref></sup> H1 predicted that this will be positively related to LCD patenting. To provide for the possibility that firms entering the industry with both technologies might behave differently (to test H4), I created categorical dummies as an alternate test. Early entrants with 80 percent or higher for share LCD at entry were classified as <italic>Enter with LCD</italic>, firms with 80 percent or more of their patents in plasma were classified as <italic>Enter with plasma</italic>, and those with ratios in between as <italic>Enter with both</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0001839212447181"><bold>7</bold></xref></sup> As I used the first five years of data to construct the classifications for the early entrants, I dropped the first five years of observations for all firms in the sample. I chose five years primarily because most early entrants patented only sporadically in the early years, so using only the first two years of data, for example, would lead to only 5 percent of all early entrants being classified as entering with both technologies.</p>
<p>To test H3 and H5 on the moderating effect of complementary assets, I included two measures of complementary assets, one upstream (component technology) and one downstream (commercialization capabilities). For the upstream component, I included the stock of the firm’s patenting in general flat panel patents. Derwent categorizes some patents as applying to both LCD and plasma displays, and I considered these innovations as useful irrespective of which technology won the competition. Two examples from 1979 include a Hitachi patent on an IR-reflecting film covering for a display screen and an American Cyanamid patent for display driver circuitry. Hypotheses 3 and 5 suggested that knowledge accumulated on general component technology should moderate the inertial effect of initial support for the failed technology. Therefore the specific test of H3 focused on the interaction between the firm’s stock of general flat panel display patents (<italic>General FPD patent stock</italic>) and the dummy for early supporters of plasma (enter with plasma, H3) and early supporters of both LCD and plasma (enter with both, H5).</p>
<p>The second measure of complementary assets was a commercialization measure based on pre-entry experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0001839212447181">Helfat and Lieberman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0001839212447181">Bayus and Agarwal, 2007</xref>). Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0001839212447181">Klepper and Simons (2000)</xref>, I categorized firms based on their activity in a different industry before entry. In this case, I was interested in the firm’s possession of commercialization capabilities (e.g., brand names and product designers) and architectural knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0001839212447181">Henderson and Clark, 1990</xref>) that might affect the firm’s ability to commercialize and profit from its potential investments in R&amp;D for flat panel displays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0001839212447181">Teece, 1986</xref>). These resources and assets were most likely to be possessed by firms with previous new product development and commercialization experience in existing downstream product segments that were the leading segments in adopting flat panel displays. The three primary segments in which displays made significant inroads initially were computers (desktop and, eventually, portable computers), televisions (replacing CRT televisions), and watches (providing a viable display for electronic watches). Firms that had been incumbents in one or more of these industries would likely possess knowledge, distribution capabilities, and brand names that would increase their expected profitability from any investments in speculative flat panel display research. I therefore used company history data obtained from annual reports, company websites, and media reports to identify all firms with experience in the television, computer, or watch industries before their entry into flat panel displays (<italic>PC/TV/watch experience</italic>). The specific test of H3 or H5 was the interaction between this dummy and enter with plasma or enter with both, respectively.</p>

<sec id="section10-0001839212447181">
<title>Control Variables, Analyses, Method, and Summary Statistics</title>
<p>The first controls are stocks of the firm’s LCD and plasma display patents after its first five years in the industry (<italic>LCD patent stock</italic> and <italic>Plasma patent stock</italic>). The primary importance of the former is to control for the concern that the cumulative nature of LCD patenting made those firms that entered with plasma less inclined to pursue LCD because they would be unable to catch up to early LCD entrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0001839212447181">Griliches, 1990</xref>). By including a stock of the dependent variable (LCD patents), the models actually predict the differences in the growth rate of that stock for firms making different initial technological choices, irrespective of the size of that stock in any given year.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0001839212447181"><bold>8</bold></xref></sup> The importance of the plasma patent stock variable is to control for the concern that some plasma display supporters might have been continuing to allocate resources to plasma and thus were unable to devote resources to LCD. If the results show a strong negative relationship between plasma patent stock and the dependent variable (LCD patents), then this concern may be significant. These variables, like the general FPD patent stock introduced above, were logged for overdispersion and lagged one year.</p>
<p>When selecting additional controls, my primary concern was for heterogeneity in resource constraints. Because alliance activity was an important part of the development of flat panel technologies and allowed firms to share the cost of development (freeing more resources for additional research), I included a dummy (<italic>Alliance or partner</italic>) noting whether the firm had a shared patent (assigned to more than one firm in the sample) or a joint venture patent in the previous year. This measure of alliance activity is preferable to traditional measures as it captures co-development activity that may not be formally documented, and it is specific to the flat panel market. I controlled for firm size with financial data on overall corporate sales (<italic>Firm sales</italic>), logged and lagged one year. For observations without an observed sales figure (a common problem, especially at the beginning of the panel, for private and non-U.S. firms), I included a dummy to remove the effect (<italic>Firm sales missing dummy</italic>), a common tactic when dealing with systematically missing data on firm size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0001839212447181">Greene, 2003</xref>). Given the time- and location-specific nature of resource availability and technological evolution, and because the financial pressures facing firms may be different in different regions of the world, I measured the percent of the firm’s patents that were filed in the U.S. (<italic>American focus</italic>), Japan (<italic>Japanese focus</italic>), Western Europe (<italic>Western European focus</italic>), and the rest of the world (omitted category; the four variables sum to 1 for each firm). I also included year fixed-effects, as there may have been consistent financial pressures and shared confidence in the viability of LCD that would affect patenting decisions.</p>
<p>As the primary dependent variable is a count variable, the two best specification choices are a Poisson model and a negative binomial model. The rule of thumb for a Poisson model is that the mean and the variance of the dependent variable should be roughly equal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0001839212447181">Hausman, Hall, and Griliches, 1984</xref>). In my data, the mean is 6.8 and the variance is 1425.2, a sign of significant overdispersion. I therefore used the negative binomial model, though similar results were obtained from a Poisson model. Given that my data contain repeated observations of the same firm over time and that there may be relevant organization-level factors affecting the dependent variable for which I was unable to control, there is a concern about unobserved heterogeneity. To deal with unobserved heterogeneity, I present results from a generalized estimating equation (GEE) negative binomial model with a one period autoregressive (AR1) correlation structure. This type of model returns population-average coefficients, allowing for comparison across firms (as opposed to within firms) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0001839212447181">Zeger, Liang, and Albert, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0001839212447181">Hu et al., 1998</xref>). The model is similar to nested or hierarchical models in that the observations are presumed to be correlated within groups (firms in this case), but it allows for count dependent variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0001839212447181">Ballinger, 2004</xref>). Given that I have repeated observations over time and given the inherently consistent nature of firm-level patenting, a first-order autoregressive correlation structure (AR1) is the most appropriate choice. Although few published articles in the organizational sciences have utilized a GEE model (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0001839212447181">Schneper and Guillen, 2004</xref>, for one exception), recent articles on methods for dealing with repeated measures of the same organization have called for expanded use of this method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0001839212447181">Ballinger, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0001839212447181">Echambadi, Campbell, and Agarwal, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>To test H2, about the likelihood of pursuing plasma during its reemergence, the dependent variable was dichotomous (equal to 1 if the firm had any plasma patents in that year, and 0 otherwise, as most of the variation in the data exists at that level) and so a different approach was used. To deal with unobserved, firm-level heterogeneity I used a model with random effects, though removing those does not change the qualitative result. In theory, either a logit or a probit model would be appropriate for such data, but as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0001839212447181">Greene (2003</xref>: 773–775) stated, there is no clear reason to prefer one to the other. As there are a reasonable number of observations with each response (approximately 11 percent of the observations have one or more plasma patents in any given year) and the tails of the distribution are relatively sparse, the models are likely to produce identical results. For the sake of convenience, I present only the logit model results below, but robustness checks using a probit model produce similar results, and the correlation between the two sets of predictions is 0.9995.</p>
<p>The summary statistics for the data are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0001839212447181">table 1</xref>. The statistics show that the data set contains 64 percent observations from late (1983 or later) entrants to the industry, providing a good mix of early and late entrant firms. A total of 48 percent of the observations come from firms with prior experience in the computer, television, or watch industries. Also, firms in the sample have 53 percent of their filed patents in Japan, demonstrating both the higher rate of patenting overall in Japan and the importance of Japan to the development of this industry. Among firms that entered early (193 firms in total), the average firm had 4.0 plasma patents and 3.7 LCD patents. Despite the presence of some moderately high correlations, the variance inflation factors (VIFs) are relatively low, with all below 6 and only one (Japan focus) above 3.25. Thus the data appear both appropriate to test the hypotheses and unaffected by strong multicolinearity concerns.</p>

<p>The results of the primary specification are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0001839212447181">table 2</xref>, which allow for tests of H1 and H3–H6.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0001839212447181"><bold>9</bold></xref></sup> Most of the control variables perform as expected, and multiple control variables are significant and worth discussing. First, as expected, the stock of LCD patents is positive and highly significant, indicating the path-dependent nature of knowledge accumulation in LCD technology. Interestingly, the coefficient on plasma patent stock is positive and significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 in some models and <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10 in the full model), as well, suggesting that firms were not trading off continued efforts in plasma versus a focus on LCD but were accelerating or decelerating the pace of knowledge accumulation in both simultaneously.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0001839212447181"><bold>10</bold></xref></sup> General FPD patents is also positive and significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), suggesting that firms with greater knowledge of the component parts of flat panel displays generated more LCD-specific knowledge. The three region controls suggest that firms from Japan, the U.S., and the E.U. were all less active in generating new knowledge than firms from countries such as Korea and Taiwan. The other controls are not significant in the full model, though PC/TV/watch experience and firm size are both positive and marginally significant in one or more intermediate models.</p>

<p>Standard errors are listed in parentheses below coefficient estimates. Changes in deviance and degrees of freedom are measured from model 0 for models 1 and 2, and from model 2 for model 3. Year fixed effects are included in all models. N = 11,194 observations, 1,063 firms. Enter with LCD is the omitted variable.</p>

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>As a first test of hypothesis 1, that initial investment in the failed technology decreases knowledge creation in the winning technology, model 1 includes the ratio of LCD patenting in the firm’s first five years in the industry (share LCD at entry). The coefficient is positive and highly significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), indicating that the greater the firm’s initial focus on LCD, the more successful it is subsequently in LCD patenting. This result shows preliminary support for both H1 and H4, about the behavior of firms investing in both technologies. Model 2 removes the ratio and uses dummies to identify the types of firms (enter with LCD is the omitted category). The results show that late entrants (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), early plasma supporters (<italic>p</italic> &lt;.001) and early investors in both technologies (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) are all less successful in LCD patenting than early LCD supporters. Additionally, the coefficient for enter with plasma is significantly smaller than those for enter with both and late entrant. This produces a rank ordering in which firms supporting the winning technology generate the most knowledge, firms supporting both technologies and late entrant firms are next, and firms initially supporting plasma generate the least knowledge in LCD. The goodness-of-fit statistics noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0001839212447181">table 2</xref> also show that both the ratio and dummy variable construction of the variables adds to the fitness of the model (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). These results provide strong support for both hypotheses 1 and 4, about the effect of entering supporting both technologies.</p>
<p>As reducing risk by betting on both technologies is not completely effective at eliminating inertia, H6 suggested that the strategy of entering late to reduce risk would not be effective, either. The results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0001839212447181">table 2</xref> strongly support this assertion, as the coefficient on the late entrant dummy is negative and significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 in models 1 and 2, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01 in model 3) when compared with the effect of investing in LCD initially. As discussed above, however, the inertial effect of late entry is significantly smaller than the inertial effect of failed investments. In this respect, both risk-reducing strategies (H4 and H6) improve outcomes more than making a failed investment, but they do not allow these firms to catch up to early investors in the winning technology.</p>
<p>Model 3 adds the interaction terms to test the moderating effects of complementary assets on early plasma supporters (H3) and early supporters of both technologies (H5). The theory predicts that all four interaction terms will be positive, and three of the four are. The interactions of enter with plasma with both general FPD patent stock (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and PC/TV/watch experience (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) are both positive and significant, providing strong support for H3. The increased incentives for reorienting around LCD technology brought about by possession of key complementary assets do indeed increase knowledge creation in LCD. This aligns with basic observations in the industry, in which early plasma supporter IBM (a computer company) was able to reorient around LCD but Owens-Illinois (a glass bottle manufacturer) was not. For firms entering with both LCD and plasma, only the interaction with general FPD patent stock is significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), providing weak support for H5. It is possible that downstream complementary assets derived from pre-entry experience were not useful for these firms for some reason, but neither the archival data nor my qualitative research can offer clear suggestions as to why. It is worth noting, however, that the coefficients on the complementary asset variables are relatively small in relation to the enter with plasma and enter with both dummies in model 3, suggesting that though these complementary assets moderate the inertial effects of failure or being a generalist, they did not eliminate them entirely. The results show strong support for H3 and limited support for H5.</p>
<p>As H2, which suggests that initial supporters of the failed technology will not even pursue the same technology when it reemerges for a niche opportunity, requires a different econometric approach with a random effects logit model (as discussed earlier), the results are shown separately in model 1 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0001839212447181">table 3</xref>. The results are consistent with H2: early plasma supporters are significantly less likely (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) than early LCD supporters to invest in plasma in the 1990s and early 2000s. If the reason for early plasma supporters’ inertia in the face of the rising interest in LCD was based on a lack of technological capabilities, I would expect that these firms would at least support plasma when it reemerged. Instead, these firms show the same inertia during the reemergence of plasma.</p>

<title>Understanding the Effects of Failed Investments</title>
<p>This study focuses on what happens to firms that enter a nascent industry with competing technologies but wind up supporting the losing technological option in the race. The results show that they do not simply escalate their commitment to the losing technology (H2) and that they suffer a penalty in terms of their ability to create knowledge in the winning technology (H1). The most relevant question then is how and why this happens. In the empirical approach, I attempted to control for some obvious explanations. First, I controlled for the cumulativeness of LCD technology with the stock of the firm’s LCD patents, meaning that the model focuses on how fast the firm’s knowledge stock grows and not the absolute level. Second, the finding in H2 that plasma firms do not reenter plasma when it emerges as a niche opportunity suggests that the explanation is not that the firms were better suited to plasma and thus only focused their efforts on that technology.</p>
<p>It appears that, in line with prior literature on reinforcement learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0001839212447181">Denrell and March, 2001</xref>) and learning from failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0001839212447181">Haunschild and Sullivan, 2002</xref>), firms drew inferences from their initial failed experiences in plasma that limited their efficient learning processes in LCD. These literatures suggest that managers experiencing the failure of an investment in an uncertain industry will downgrade their expectations of the value of that industry to the firm and make internal changes that will have the effect of limiting subsequent effort and knowledge growth. My interviews suggest three processes by which the updating of managerial expectations led to decreased subsequent knowledge creation. First, one R&amp;D manager discussed the increased internal “legitimacy hurdles” that he faced in validating LCD technology to a group of executives that had already seen their firm’s plasma investment fail. He reported:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I mean naturally you are always dealing with past failures. “Why is this not like that?” And, “Oh wait, this story sounds good but so did the plasma story. Look what they made us do. Look what they sold us.” Well [the plasma investment] was basically scrap and move on. . . . So the technical management was therefore more skeptical and more demanding of proof because they had been fooled. So that probably raised the bar for us.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This firm was able to navigate this hurdle and reorient its flat panel operations, but many other firms may not have been as successful in overcoming this hurdle. Other firms, like Polaroid (which retreated to its camera and film business) and AT&amp;T/Bell Labs (which retreated to its telecommunications operations), chose to leave the market completely in the wake of a significant failed investment, in part because senior management was unwilling to allocate the necessary resources to make the project work. Second, a different manager related how the parent organization supported the division’s desire to switch from plasma to LCD in the 1980s but installed a new division head from the legal group who was very reluctant to make significant risky investments. The firm responded relatively slowly to the emergence of LCD, consistently lagging behind other firms in terms of research and manufacturing knowledge, and eventually partnered with a competitor to have access to required knowledge. Finally, managers from multiple firms discussed how the initial failure in plasma technology made managers question the firm’s ability to distinguish potentially successful technologies from unsuccessful ones. Executives at these firms were aware of progress made elsewhere in LCD technology but were less certain about whether these advances actually destined LCD to be the dominant technology because they doubted the validity of the criteria used to evaluate the technology. These three anecdotes are merely suggestive of the ways in which the updating processes might have an impact in organizations struggling with failure and uncertainty. Executives lost faith in the managers in the flat panel research operations and became less likely to follow their advice, either directly by removing their autonomy or indirectly by fabricating additional hurdles that limit choices.</p>
<p>The scale and significance of these different learning processes based on technological entry choices can be seen by graphing the projected LCD patenting history of four types of early entrants: early LCD supporters, early plasma supporters, early hedgers that invested in both, and early plasma supporters that had previous computer, television, or watch experience. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0001839212447181">Figure 2</xref> shows the curves based on the simulated predicted values from the marginal effects of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0001839212447181">table 2</xref> (model 3). The figure shows that although the initial difference between early LCD and early plasma supporters is relatively small, the cumulative nature of the models and the investment process puts both early plasma supporters and those firms investing in both technologies at a significant disadvantage in relation to early LCD supporters. The graph also shows that, though having relevant experience that increases the strategic imperative of succeeding in the flat panel display industry does increase subsequent LCD patenting for early plasma supporters, this effect does not compensate for the full inertial effects of the early plasma investment.</p>

<title>Robustness Checks</title>
<p>I performed a number of robustness checks dealing with the sample and model structure. First, to prevent misclassification errors, the results presented here excluded all firms with fewer than four flat panel patents throughout their entire history. Changing or eliminating the minimum number of patents does not change the results. Second, as noted in footnote 4, I set up the model as a two-stage analysis, first predicting whether the firm remains active in flat panel display patenting and then predicting annual LCD patenting. This is an alternate way of addressing selection concerns and produces the same results. Third, I have tested aggregated models with only one observation per firm (as opposed to a full panel structure), since many of the primary variables of interest are time-invariant across the post-1982 period. In this case, I used the first five years of firm-level data to categorize the firm and then predicted all future years in aggregate. The results are similar to the models reported here. Fourth, there may be legitimate concern about the endogeneity of the primary independent variables in this study. There is little that I can do about the endogeneity of which technology early-entrant firms chose to pursue, but looking at the firms in the data suggests that there were a roughly equal number of firms from each region and with each type of background (i.e., computer versus television) making each early technological choice. In addition, there are a number of firms that would be identified as “high quality” firms supporting plasma initially (such as NEC, IBM, and Fujitsu), and the failure of plasma as a candidate for the overall dominant design was not due to poor support from its sponsors but, instead, was related to the realities of the two technologies. Thus the endogeneity of technological choice does not appear to be an issue. The endogeneity that is of some real concern, though, is the endogeneity of entry timing, because firms entering earlier may have a greater strategic imperative to succeed in the industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0001839212447181">Mitchell, 1989</xref>). To deal with this source of endogeneity, I evaluated models focusing only on early-entrant firms. The results of the model are reported in model 2 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0001839212447181">table 3</xref> and show that the core findings hold true for this sample as well.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0001839212447181">Table 3</xref> contains a number of other robustness checks, as well. In general, none of these tests produce significant changes in the core results. In model 3, I excluded the plasma patent stock variable to ensure that multicolinearity between this variable and the technology choice at entry was not driving the results. In model 4, I excluded all observations without sales data, as there may be concerns that selection biases associated with having almost 50 percent small firms (and therefore with unobserved sales data) may be affecting the results. In model 5, I used only the first two years of post-entry data to categorize early entrants based on which technology they supported, though this dramatically decreases the number of firms supporting both technologies. The remaining robustness checks entail alternate model specifications. Model 6 tests a standard negative binomial regression (not a GEE model) with clustered standard errors. Model 7 adds firm-level random effects to the standard negative binomial model. Model 8 uses a Poisson model instead of a negative binomial and includes firm-level random effects as well. All of these models show similar results, with the exception of the coefficient on enter with both in models 4 and 8, which is nonsignificant. Additionally, I performed multiple robustness checks with respect to the time spans of the panels modeled here. First, I modified the start date of the primary panel (currently 1970 to deal with the sparseness of the data before that year) between 1965 and 1975 without any changes to the core results. Second, I modified the start date for the plasma patent panel (to test H2, currently set at 1989 as plasma began its resurgence) from 1985 to 1993 without any change in the primary results. Third, I modified the time distinguishing between early and late entrants (currently set at 1983). Given the growth in the LCD patent curve and the qualitative data from my sources, a time between 1981 and 1985 seems most appropriate, and any cut-off date in this range produces similar results.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This research theorized and empirically investigated the implications of technological choices in the context of competing technologies. Specifically, I examined the learning-based consequences of betting on the right horse early, the right horse late, the wrong horse early, or both horses simultaneously. The central finding is that initial investment in a failed technology reduces subsequent knowledge creation ability in the emerging dominant technology. This inertia is not eliminated by simultaneous support for both technologies, and it even extends to the reemergence of the same technology later. The quantitative and qualitative results suggest that the inertia is driven by inferences drawn by managers of the expected value of the uncertain industry that result in lowered effort, investment, and knowledge creation by the firms that initially supported the losing technology. The possession of relevant complementary assets—which should increase organizational incentives to pursue the winning technology—moderate but do not alleviate the inertial effects of failure.</p>
<p>This study makes three primary contributions. First, it extends work on reinforcement learning in organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0001839212447181">Denrell and March, 2001</xref>) and learning from failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0001839212447181">Haunschild and Rhee, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0001839212447181">Baumard and Starbuck, 2005</xref>) by focusing on how failure in one technology may have organizational implications in a related technology. This shifts the focus of failure-based learning from the question of whether failure helps prevent future similar failures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0001839212447181">Cannon and Edmondson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0001839212447181">Haunschild and Sullivan, 2002</xref>) to the question of how failure affects the broader organization. Second, the study draws on the relationships between resource partitioning and both innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0001839212447181">Mezias and Mezias, 2000</xref>) and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0001839212447181">Barnett, Greve, and Park, 1994</xref>) to argue that betting on multiple technologies at once will not eliminate inertia. This suggests that further research on the innovativeness of generalists and specialists, especially how this relates to performance in innovation-intensive industries, may be fruitful. Third, through these two primary theoretical contributions, the study offers an important look at the firm-level implications of technological choices made under conditions of technological competition. In this respect, the study offers important caveats on existing prescriptive research on how flexible firms should be in response to technological change by highlighting the important downsides of making a failed technological bet. Thus the study has implications for three streams of research: technological change, learning from failure, and resource partitioning.</p>
<sec id="section15-0001839212447181">
<title>Implications for Technological Change and Evolution</title>
<p>This study’s implications for literatures on first-mover advantage (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0001839212447181">Franco et al., 2009</xref>) and firm adaptation to technological change (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0001839212447181">Eggers and Kaplan, 2009</xref>) are similar. In both cases, researchers have traditionally selected on successful new industries and technologies. It would seem, however, that any potential desirability of being an early entrant to an industry or being responsive to external technological change is highly dependent on making the right choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0001839212447181">Christensen, Suárez, and Utterback, 1998</xref>). Firms adopting the right new technology early may be advantaged in their ability to build a strong market position, but making the wrong choice (even if the firm supports the right technology at the same time) can dilute or eliminate the potential for advantage. The idea that the risk of failure has implications for the decision about whether more adaptive firms can create an advantage has been obliquely addressed in terms of the downside of adapting an early and inefficient generation of a new technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0001839212447181">Bohlmann, Golder, and Mitra, 2002</xref>) or the risks of abruptly evolving technological industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0001839212447181">Suárez and Lanzolla, 2007</xref>). But without a full consideration of the risks of failure and its long-term consequences, we as scholars are not in a position to offer prescriptive advice about when and how managers should seek first-mover advantages or be responsive to technological change.</p>
<p>While this study highlights the need to consider the potential failure of technological investments in any study about adaptation or flexibility, and it offers a first look at the inertial effects resulting from failure, more work is needed to understand how this process plays out further downstream by looking at product- and firm-level outcomes. As a means of mitigating the effects of failed investments on future decision making, this study validates the role of complementary assets in helping firms survive technological discontinuities in the knowledge space, in addition to the product space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0001839212447181">Tripsas, 1997</xref>). This broadens our understanding of the potential value of complementary assets for decision making and knowledge creation, but further work on exactly how the possession of complementary assets affects outcomes would facilitate understanding of their value. More generally, a deeper investigation into how firms are able to recover from failed investments is needed, and such work would contribute greatly to our understanding of strategic renewal and industry evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0001839212447181">Agarwal and Helfat, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, though not a core focus of this paper, the idea of firms making parallel investments in multiple competing technologies raises interesting and novel questions. Most research on search in general and technological search specifically does not consider the potential hedging behavior of firms. The fact that these firms actually display different behavior than those that focused on the winning technology from the start suggests that a classic real-options approach to technological search management may not be as effective in practice as in theory and that the management of the entire portfolio of choices may not be as simple as originally conceived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0001839212447181">Eggers, 2012</xref>). More research is needed on the factors that lead firms to search down multiple competing paths simultaneously and the consequences of such behavior, as this behavior is an understudied but potentially vital aspect of how firms deal with technological uncertainty.</p>

<title>Implications for Learning from Failure and Reinforcement Learning</title>
<p>For the core theory behind the first hypothesis, this study drew on the literatures on learning from failure and reinforcement learning. Many of these issues have been investigated either through simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0001839212447181">Denrell and March, 2001</xref>) or qualitative research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0001839212447181">Baumard and Starbuck, 2005</xref>). There has been comparatively limited large-scale empirical investigation, and what exists largely focuses on organizations learning to prevent similar failures in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0001839212447181">Haunschild and Sullivan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0001839212447181">Haunschild and Rhee, 2004</xref>). By comparison, this study suggests that we need to know more about the broader organizational and longer-term implications of failures for decision making, knowledge-creation, and performance.</p>
<p>Such a broad perspective on the effects of failure raises an interesting question. Most of the literature mentioned above suggests that failures are bad for the organization, as they may generate improper inferences that limit learning potential, and this aligns with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0001839212447181">Noda and Collis’s (2001</xref>: 922) suggestion that “an initial unfavorable experience will create a downward spiral of failure.” By contrast, some studies have focused on the potential benefits of technological failures, specifically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0001839212447181">Henderson and Stern (2004)</xref>, with their theory of partial external selection, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0001839212447181">Burgelman (1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0001839212447181">2002</xref>), with his discussion of how failure in memory chips led Intel to success in microprocessors. Similarly, work on performance below aspirations (not identical to specific failures, but a likely result of failures) suggests that such low performance is an important mechanism to jar firms from path-dependent and potentially destructive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0001839212447181">March and Heath, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0001839212447181">Greve, 2003</xref>). How can we align these different perspectives on failure?</p>
<p>One answer may be related to the location of the failure. The modeling work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0001839212447181">Denrell and March (2001)</xref> and the core idea of a failure trap as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0001839212447181">Levinthal and March (1993)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0001839212447181">Noda and Collis (2001)</xref> all focus on the initial failure as being in a new domain about which the firm has little direct knowledge and very weak prior expectations. This failure leads to reducing those prior expectations in a way that closes off that avenue of search but also decreases performance and thus necessitates exploratory search again. By contrast, the idea of problem-driven search brings the organization back to exploitation as its focus, suggesting that the source of the problem is in a core domain in which exploitation can be used to solve it. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0001839212447181">Cyert and March (1963</xref>: 34) said, “failure-induced search increases efficiency and reduces foolishness” and cuts back on “activities . . . for which the connection with major goals is difficult to calculate concretely (e.g., research in many firms)” (p. 171). Thus failure in a core area for the firm may be perceived differently from failure in a new area. The current study looks specifically at failure in a new area for the firm, but a broader investigation into how the domain of the failed efforts affects recovery, motivation, and search behavior would help to clarify when and why failure may be good or bad for an organization.</p>

<sec id="section17-0001839212447181">
<title>Implications for Resource Partitioning</title>
<p>To explain why betting on both uncertain technologies simultaneously may not be the perfect answer for firms facing competing technologies, this study draws on the literature on resource partitioning and learning. Generalists—those firms that bet on multiple technologies—are liable to learn less from their own experiences and to be less successful in innovation during early periods of industry growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0001839212447181">Mezias and Mezias, 2000</xref>) than are specialists that focus on the winning technology from the start. To the extent that this perspective is correct, a broader suggestion might be that generalist firms would deal poorly with environmental change and uncertainty. This would result not simply from being large firms, but because their organizational breadth reduces incentives to learn and adapt to changing conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0001839212447181">Morris and Moore, 2000</xref>) and because the internal complexity of the firm makes adaptation and communication challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0001839212447181">Haunschild and Sullivan, 2002</xref>). The results of the inertia of technological generalists in this study hold even when controlling for potential correlates with the mechanisms above, such as organizational size and pre-entry experience. This suggests that being a technological generalist may have an effect on flexibility and adaptation in the context of technological change and uncertainty. In fact, pre-entry experience in affected industries was suggested in this study as a source of downstream complementary assets that would increase incentives for knowledge creation in the winning technology, but it also may increase organizational complexity in ways that limit coordination and adaptation. These countervailing effects may explain why pre-entry experience was helpful to firms that specialized in plasma initially, but not for firms that were technological generalists. More work to tease out this generalist versus specialist phenomenon in the context of technological change is warranted, specifically either to align this perspective with existing models of incumbents’ inertia in technological change (e.g., an incentive-based view; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0001839212447181">Kaplan and Henderson, 2005</xref>) or to establish its independence as a mechanism for inertia.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0001839212447181">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study, of course, has its limitations. Some are typical limitations for similar studies, such as testing data only within a single industry that may limit the generalizability of the results and the use of patent data as a proxy for knowledge creation. Both are concerns, but unavoidable when investigating the questions asked in this research. A larger issue is the inability to measure the intervening processes between failure and reduced knowledge generation. Based on work on reinforcement learning, the mechanism is presumed to be based on learning and the drawing of inferences that then result in organizational changes in policy and resource allocation. This is the central argument of the paper, but it can only be made by excluding other explanations for the observed data. In the end, I believe that such behavioral explanations are the only explanations that fit the data, but this does require a leap of faith. Future work might further investigate the mechanisms that lead to inertial behavior, qualitatively within organizations to understand the processes and interactions, via experimental methods testing multilevel hypotheses about inefficiencies, or through careful consideration of theory on individual- and group-level biases. All of these would provide a more nuanced understanding of where inertia comes from. Additionally, there may be concerns about the limited scale of the failure tested here. For many firms, the failed investment was financing a handful of patents in a technology that bore no fruit. Often, failures are much more costly and significant, as firms invest money in manufacturing, marketing, and distribution before receiving little or no return—high technology products like the Apple Newton and the Pioneer Laser Disc player come to mind. Yet it seems that the smaller scale of the failure evaluated in this study offers a strong test of the theory, as this is a circumstance in which we would least expect to see changes in decision-making behavior based on the failure. It would still be helpful to investigate failure in other contexts to answer questions about generalizability and to provide insight into broader ranges of failed investments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0001839212447181">
<title>Generalizing These Findings on Failure and Inertia</title>
<p>Although this paper focused on technological choices specifically, the proposed mechanisms that lead to the observed inertial response to failure are more general. As such, they might logically be applied to any type of failed investments beyond technology and have important implications for the broad literature on learning from failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0001839212447181">Cannon and Edmondson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0001839212447181">Baumard and Starbuck, 2005</xref>). Though I believe the findings of this study will hold beyond the bounds of technological failure, it is important to point out specific boundary conditions based on prior research and logic that may exist for such broader application. First, there would need to be a link between the failed investment and the future decision being made. Prior work on learning from failure has shown that attempts to learn from failure do not produce far-reaching changes in behavior but, instead, have more localized effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0001839212447181">Baumard and Starbuck, 2005</xref>). Thus a failed technological investment may have no implications for future efforts to enter a new geographic market, but it might have an effect on future knowledge generation efforts even in different industries.</p>
<p>Second, the failure would have to be of a size that is both large enough and not too large. On one hand, research on learning from failure has shown significantly greater potential to learn from smaller failures than from larger ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0001839212447181">Sitkin, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0001839212447181">Cannon and Edmondson, 2001</xref>). Large failures would be more likely to result in organizational failure or a comprehensive turnover in management, both of which would limit any sort of observable response. On the other hand, failures that are too small would not have enough visibility in the organization to cause senior managers to change decision-making behavior. Therefore I would expect a nonlinear (inverted U-shaped) relationship between the size of the failure and the observed inertia.</p>
<p>Third, the organizational response might differ based on the perceived cause of failure. In the industry studied in this research, the source of failure was largely exogenous: LCD developed faster than plasma due to inherent qualities of the technology, not due to mistakes made by firms. As such, it can be difficult to assign blame for failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0001839212447181">Lant, Milliken, and Batra, 1992</xref>), which may lead to inefficient attempts to respond to failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0001839212447181">Husted and Michailova, 2002</xref>). In cases in which the failure is more clearly endogenous and blame can be allocated to a single person, the organizational response may be simply to remove that person from the organization and make no other changes. The results would be little or no inertia.</p>
<p>Fourth, I would expect the inertial effect of prior failure to dissipate over time. Research on learning and memory in organizations has generally shown that the effect of prior experiences will decay over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0001839212447181">Walsh and Ungson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0001839212447181">Cohen and Bacdayan, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0001839212447181">Ingram and Baum, 1997</xref>). From this study, comparing the results of the various robustness checks that involved shortening the ending point of the panel model all produced stronger inertial results than the ones reported in the full model, suggesting that the effect did dissipate over time in this study. But, of course, the finding that firms initially investing in plasma in the 1960s and 1970s were averse to reinvesting in plasma in the 1990s suggests that the effect of failure does not dissipate immediately.</p>
<p>Finally, the effect of a prior failure will depend on the exact future responsibilities and autonomy of the person responsible for making the initial failed investment. If the original decision maker is the same person making the subsequent decision <italic>and</italic> that person has the same degree of autonomy at the time of the subsequent decision, then I expect to see the risk-seeking behavior outlined in prospect theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0001839212447181">Kahneman and Tversky, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0001839212447181">Thaler and Johnson, 1990</xref>) and the behavioral theory of the firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0001839212447181">Cyert and March, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0001839212447181">March and Shapira, 1987</xref>). Thus, for any given individual, an early failure experience may lead to a future acceleration of activity. This perspective presents a picture of managers out to validate the initial decision to pursue the new technological market in the first place, whatever the organizational and financial cost. As discussed earlier, this circumstance seems unlikely in a traditional hierarchical organizational setting, but there may be specific circumstances (such as sequential decisions with little time separating them) in which this may be the case. Overall, these five boundary conditions—similarity, size, cause, time, and autonomy—present a view of when we may expect to see the inertial behavior exhibited in this study, but they are merely suggestions based on prior theory and the results of this very specific study. Future research would need to ascertain the validity and the exact nature of these limiting factors, and how firms that fall flat in betting on the losing technology can dust themselves off and move forward.</p>

<p>Technically, IBM did not abandon plasma until 1986, when it shut down its manufacturing facility, but the firm ceased all new plasma investment in 1983 and began looking for means to exit.</p>

<p>One advantage of Derwent is that professional patent analysts look at each individual patent and assign it to one or more of Derwent’s “manual codes.” There are, for example, dozens of manual codes applying to LCD patents. The USPTO, in contrast, sometimes groups patents together by end purpose (i.e., televisions), without clear respect for the underlying technology. Derwent also provides this finer-grained level of classification back to 1963, while the USPTO only provides searchable data through 1975.</p>

<p>An alternative specification, with a first-stage selection model and the inclusion of an inverse Mills ratio in the second stage, produces similar results. Because implementing a Heckman correction with a count model can bias the results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0001839212447181">Greene, 2001</xref>), I focused on the specification discussed later.</p>

<p>In many technology studies, technology licensing activity may play a significant role in understanding future investment. Licensing would suggest that firms may use different strategies and that patent counts may not always correlate with investment in the industry. Unfortunately, data are not available on technology licensing to use as a control variable. My qualitative research in this industry suggests that licensing was very uncommon in the early stages of the industry, only becoming a viable strategy in the early 1990s.</p>

<p>I used a cutoff of 80 percent because this ensures that the population of early entrants is split into three roughly even groups. The empirical results, however, are robust to any cutoff that ensures a reasonable number of firms in each group, as well as to using continuous measures of patenting in the different technologies (as done with the share LCD at entry variable and in alternate specifications omitted for the sake of brevity).</p>

<p>As an alternate specification, models with a simple lagged DV (instead of a stock of the DV) produced qualitatively similar results. The same is true if the plasma patent stock variable is changed to a count of patents in <italic>t-1</italic>, as well.</p>

<p>Though the generalized negative binomial model reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0001839212447181">table 2</xref> is a nonlinear model, and thus it is appropriate to focus on the marginal effects instead of reported coefficients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0001839212447181">Salomon and Jin, 2008</xref>), these are omitted from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0001839212447181">table 2</xref> for two reasons. First, tests of the marginal effects show that every significant coefficient in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0001839212447181">table 2</xref> is also significant when considering marginal effects. Second, a graphical analysis later in this paper uses marginal effects to demonstrate the size of the effects reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0001839212447181">table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>This could be interpreted as a sign that investment in plasma was a good thing for LCD knowledge creation, but there are two reasons to doubt this claim. First, most early plasma supporters later abandoned plasma completely, meaning that much of the growth in the plasma patent stock variable is coming from early LCD supporters that later added plasma to their portfolio or late entrants to the industry. Second, an interaction term (not reported here) between enter with plasma and plasma patent stock is negative, though just outside of significance. This suggests that firms other than early plasma supporters largely reaped the benefits for LCD knowledge creation from simultaneous patenting in plasma.</p>
