<p>Migration has remained a crucial factor in contouring the channels of development in most developing countries. In particular, the South Asian countries have increasingly become an important source of migrant labour. Thus, a dedicated account of the levels of migration, its patterns, economic returns and policies is imperative for this region. This volume is a step in the right direction. Micro-level studies involving the two sets of countries—some of which have a history of supplying migrant workers such as India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh vis-à-vis those which are studied for the first time (such as Nepal, Bhutan, the Maldives and Afghanistan) certainly add coverage and credibility. The academic justice to the subject, however, is less than what one hoped for.</p>
<p>The book has tried to capture the aggregate picture of migration in South Asia as well as in each of the eight South Asian countries, individually. These include India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, the Maldives and Afghanistan as laid out in Chapters 2 to 9. It is preceded by a substantive foreword by Philip Martin and a comprehensive introduction by the editor. The foreword clearly sets the tone for involved research in labour migration, as one prepares to encounter a complex subject in the domain of labour, international and development economics and applied microeconomics. The introduction asserts that migrant remittances have the potential of augmenting economic development in both the source as well as the destination countries. However, benefits from remittances can be reaped only if the respective countries have effective and transparent migration policies integrated with their respective long-term development policies. The country-specific studies (Section 1) are helpful in capturing the idiosyncratic socio-economic and political situations and subsequent comprehension of the policies regulating migration in the region.</p>
<p>India, which is the largest country of origin, destination and transit in the sub-region, has more than one million Indians spread in 23 countries of the world in 2001. It is well known that the Middle East has been the preferred destination for 75 per cent of the migrants till 2002. Not surprisingly, India has been the highest remittance receiving country at US$27 billion (2.8 per cent of its GDP) in 2007. The study of Kerala within India is the most natural case—it is the state which sends the highest number of workers overseas. Besides, although the Reserve Bank of India, the Central Bank regularly maintains data on state-wise receipt of migrant remittances, they never make it public. The state government of Kerala, on the other hand, makes all related data available, with extreme alacrity typically because it is heavily dependent on Gulf-bound migrants and the remittance received. It accounts for no less than 25 per cent of the state domestic product of Kerala. However, the chapter offers ideas and results that have already been discussed by the author in several other places. The thirst for a fresh set of results remains unquenched.</p>
<p>For Pakistan, the emigrant group seems to be dominated by skilled workers. A relationship between poverty and the share of remittances in GDP has been explored. It suggests that since the year 2000, the increased inflow of remittances has been associated with a steady fall in the level of poverty in Pakistan. The results could have benefited from a clearer econometric specification controlling for factors that can potentially affect the head count ratio along with remittances. Nonetheless, other supporting results may still evoke research questions relating remittance and development.</p>
<p>For Sri Lanka, migrant remittances account for nearly 8 per cent of the country’s GDP. A comparative study of different sources of foreign capital inflow shows that remittances are not only the most stable among all sources but also the most substantial. The emigrant profile of Sri Lanka is heavily loaded in favour of women workers. The vulnerability of such workforce in the destination countries makes for an alarming socio-economic and political phenomenon in recent times which requires further study.</p>
<p>Bangladesh has been an interesting study since out-migration from Bangladesh has increased by 60 per cent in recent years. The low-skilled workers constitute the migrants mainly moving to the Middle East. The total remittance inflow in the country is shown to have increased at a ‘faster rate’ and it seems truly exogenous both for the country as well as for the chapter! Despite such deficits, an important section on the impact of global economic crisis on remittances and hence on growth and poverty in Bangladesh adds value to this chapter.</p>
<p>The dependence of Nepalese economy on remittances is extensive and increasing. The effect of remittance on the macro variables, for Nepal, has been compared with the revenue from tourism. Such specific comparison, endogenous to the characteristics of the country, has helped to fathom the regional issues, problems and advantages. A micro-level study of the impact of migration revealed that remittances must have played an important role in poverty alleviation since it formed about 35 per cent of the income of the recipient households from 2003 to 2007. A discussion of the problems associated with migration and a study of their causes and policy implications have brought out various dimensions of out-migration that are atypical of small economies like Nepal. The case study of Bhutan, on the other hand, reflects its traditional inward-looking policies, where labour mobility has not received much importance. In fact, the benefits of migration seem to be offset by the problems arising out of it. For instance, emigration has led to scarcity of farm labourers in the country. It also turns out that remittance provides the chief source for purchasing inputs and machines contributing to higher productivity. Remittance has also led to human resource development as 11 per cent of the remittance received is invested in education. Maldives, on the other hand, is a net recipient of labour that leads to outflow of capital from the country and keeps the internal wages low. The study also explores the skill and macroeconomic impacts of in-migration and suggests scope for policies. Afghanistan, finally, is a case where remittance serves the day-to-day needs more than the long-term plans it manifests elsewhere. In terms of policy implications, remittance-to-education link is perhaps the more direct impact one observes, apart from the fact that appearance of Bhutan, the Maldives or Afghanistan in a major book project should enrich the contested nuances of a complex interaction and influence further research.</p>
<p>The second section of the book discusses governance, protection, development linkages and sub-regional cooperation among the countries along with policy measures that need to be undertaken for improving the migration conditions in the sub-region. It aims to offer a favourable case for the formation of a Migration Commission in South Asia. The existing migration policies in the region seem dismal, although it is hard to see why a regional policy is needed unless the countries categorically intend to export their low-skilled workforce under Mode 4 type of movements. High-skilled or medium-skilled workers usually do not need a commission to facilitate their mobility. All through the book, these issues have only been cursorily touched upon when one actually required dedicated attention in some cases. In fact, the book despite providing a plethora of information creates a strange disjuncture with the much-developed theoretical and empirical discussions on the subject. None of the chapters (but for the foreword) seems to entertain the microeconomic and macroeconomic foundations and developments in the subject and revels in the profiling of South Asian countries in an academic vacuum. Treating the South Asian case as special and distancing it from the global academic lineage is extremely problematic, needs a lot of justification if pursued and in the absence of which should have been carefully avoided. The worst fear is that, it might limit the readership to a small circuit that survives within such limits despite many other attributes of this volume.</p>
