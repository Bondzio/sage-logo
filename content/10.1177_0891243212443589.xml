<p>The ageist U.S. society tends to ignore and condescend to the oldest old people. In <italic>Aging Our Way: Lessons for Living from 85 and Beyond</italic>, social gerontologist Meika Loe turns to the eldest members of U.S. society to ask their advice and draw on their experience with aging and self-care. Loe privileges elders’ voices while dispelling myths about their dependence and intransigence by elucidating how elders manage to stay in their homes and communities, adapt themselves and their environments to physical changes, and maintain meaningful social connections over time.</p>
<p>Loe’s study is based on three years of intensive ethnographic work with 30 nonagenarians (ages 85 to 102) in upstate New York. She distills their knowledge and experience into 13 lessons, each adding another new dimension to the challenges of aging in place and making it work. Loe provides rich ethnographic data, while also acknowledging the strengths and weaknesses of her sample. While her sample overrepresents women and Jews, it is more representative of the population of nonagenarians in terms of health. Readers without backgrounds in social gerontology will find the introduction to be an accessible overview of the sociological context of aging and the primary concepts and trends in social gerontology. Loe presents academic context from interdisciplinary social gerontology and couples it with lively evidence from her in-depth interviews.</p>
<p>The book’s first half (lessons one through five) emphasizes elders’ self-care regimens, specifically addressing how they manage to age in place. These early chapters stress the importance of continuity over the life course and of designing living spaces that work for changing bodies and abilities. Loe also links the life course concepts of historical time and place with elders’ emphasis on living in moderation. For example, this generation lived through the Great Depression and two World Wars (her sample includes a Holocaust survivor), events that influenced their frugality in old age. Participants also challenge the assumption that growing old is synonymous with loneliness. Instead, they explain that taking time for oneself is a necessity for well-being. The final lesson in this section is central to the goal of the book and addresses how elders manage their own systems of care, asking for help and mobilizing informal and formal resources. Research often assumes that elders are passive recipients of care; however, Loe finds that elders are always balancing dependence and independence. Indeed, elders act as their own care providers, maintaining dignity and control over their lives as they make choices about asking for help and from whom.</p>
<p>The second half of the book (lessons six through 13) highlights elders’ social capital and connections. Loe’s participants illustrate how connecting with peers and reaching across generations—through humor, caring for others, reaching out to family members, and seeking and maintaining intergenerational relationships—contributes to their longevity. Two compelling lessons explore some of the most taboo topics about aging: touch and death. Loe explores the importance of physical affection for well-being and shows how elders get sensory stimulation through hugs, pets, and holding (great)grandchildren. Some social-gerontological research examines sexuality in old age, but Loe’s analysis moves beyond sexual intimacy to even more fundamental notions of touch. Her findings relate to scholarship on bodywork and carework by emphasizing the need for touch among old people whose bodies are stereotyped as unhealthy, unattractive, and untouchable.</p>
<p>The final substantive chapter addresses elders’ attitudes about the end of life, focusing on the social and relational aspects of death. Loe’s elders have outlived many friends and family members. Nonetheless, their experiences illustrate how people engage with death and exercise control over its circumstances. She also provides a useful discussion of hospice and its role in helping prepare for the end of life. Six of her study participants died by the time she completed the book, and Loe reflects on their deaths and contributions to her work.</p>
<p>The study is not specifically designed to address macro issues of stratification over the life course, but Loe problematizes how social location (race/ethnicity, social class, and gender) and geography (rural vs. urban) influence well-being in old age. She also addresses how social and material conditions constrain elders’ ability to maintain control over their circumstances and environments. However, her sample does not allow her to interrogate these issues of inequality in great depth. Still, it is reasonable to suggest that the lessons she gleaned from these 30 elders apply across the age spectrum and across social strata. Loe ends with a proposition for a new paradigm focused on meaningful and comfortable aging (rather than “successful” or “productive” aging), allowing for the complexities and ambiguities of elders’ lives.</p>
<p><italic>Aging Our Way</italic> is a welcome addition to aging scholarship on the importance of social networks, continuity over the life course, self-reliance, dignity, and autonomy for well-being and comfortable aging.</p>
