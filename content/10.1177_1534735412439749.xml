<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Doxorubicin (adriamycin), an anthracycline antibiotic, plus cyclophosphamide is a standard combination for adjuvant therapy for early-stage breast cancer. This combination significantly improves disease-free and overall survival. Despite these benefits, 3% to 20% of doxorubicin-treated breast cancer patients develop chronic cardiomyopathic changes and congestive heart failure because of doxorubicin therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534735412439749">1</xref></sup> Currently, no treatments are available to prevent this cardiotoxicity that have been proven to be safe and effective in breast cancer patients receiving the current standard dose of doxorubicin. A recent Cochrane review suggests that dexrazoxane may decrease the risk of cardiac toxicity from anthracyclines, but the majority of studies were not conducted in breast cancer patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534735412439749">2</xref></sup> Effective agents need to be identified as being both safe and effective for the prevention of doxorubicin-induced cardiac toxicity.</p>
<p>The differential toxicity of doxorubicin to cardiac myocytes as compared with other tissues is hypothesized to be due to an interaction between doxorubicin and a mitochondrial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase enzyme specific to cardiac myocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534735412439749">3</xref></sup> In all cells, the mitochondria are the site of adenosine triphosphate generation via the electron transport chain. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10, also known as ubiquinone) is located within the mitochondrial inner membrane and plays an integral role in generating intracellular adenosine triphosphate by serving as an electron acceptor within the electron transport chain. CoQ10 also quenches intracellular oxidative stress by accepting electrons.</p>
<p>In most tissues, the mitochondrial inner membrane serves as a barrier to pro-oxidant doxorubicin metabolites. However, the mitochondrial inner membrane of cardiac myocytes uniquely contains a specific form of mitochondrial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase that reduces doxorubicin to its semiquinone form and subsequently generates high concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within the mitochondrial cytosol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534735412439749">3</xref></sup> Doxorubicin semiquinones donate electrons to oxygen, which generates superoxide radicals, and are also auto-oxidized and cleaved to form aglycones. The aglycones displace CoQ10 from the mitochondrial inner membrane and serve as electron acceptors from complex I and complex II (which is a function of CoQ10). However, instead of transferring electrons to complex III, as CoQ10 does, the aglycones transfer electrons to molecular oxygen, resulting in the formation of superoxide radicals. The cumulative high levels of ROS cause irreversible damage to mitochondrial DNA, which blocks the regenerative capability of the organelle and leads to cardiac myocyte apoptosis or necrosis. Animal and human studies support this proposed mechanism of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534735412439749">3</xref></sup> During doxorubicin treatment, an acute rise in plasma CoQ10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534735412439749">4</xref></sup> is followed by a marked posttreatment decrease in the CoQ10 content of cardiac and skeletal muscle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534735412439749">5</xref></sup> Damage to the mitochondria of cardiac myocytes is one of the earliest and most prominent histological findings of doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy.</p>
<p>It has been hypothesized that dietary supplementation of CoQ10 prior to and during doxorubicin treatment can prevent doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity by preventing or slowing the displacement of CoQ10 by doxorubicin metabolites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534735412439749">3</xref></sup> CoQ10 is a lipid-soluble antioxidant that is synthesized in the mitochondria and in most intracellular membranes and is ingested via the diet. Intake of CoQ10 via dietary supplements is generally considered to be safe at doses of up to 1200 mg per day.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534735412439749">6</xref></sup> A daily dose of 300 mg per day for 11 days has been shown to raise plasma CoQ10 concentrations by 300% to 400%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534735412439749">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>In vitro studies have shown that administering CoQ10 either before or during doxorubicin administration can prevent doxorubicin-induced changes including cardiac beat inhibition, increase in lipid peroxidation, and reduced cardiac contractile tension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534735412439749">3</xref></sup> Animal studies suggest that the impact of doxorubicin on mitochondria is cardioselective and that CoQ10 can prevent doxorubicin-induced mitochondrial damage and progression of cardiomyopathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534735412439749">3</xref></sup> Clinical studies of CoQ10 administered before or during doxorubicin treatment have shown that CoQ10 prevented changes in left ventricular ejection fraction, systolic time intervals, fractional shortening, intraventricular septal wall thickening, cardiac output, and electrocardiograms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534735412439749">3</xref></sup> In addition, CoQ10 allowed for increased doses of doxorubicin to be administered.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534735412439749">3</xref></sup> However, these studies were small and included patients with mixed tumor types. No studies have focused on aggressive early-stage breast cancer, in which doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy regimens are a standard of care.</p>
<p>In addition to the cytotoxic mechanisms of topoisomerase II inhibition, DNA intercalation, and inhibition of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, doxorubicin treatment also produces DNA-damaging cytotoxic oxygen free radicals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534735412439749">8</xref></sup> Previous in vitro and animal studies in a lymphoma model suggested that high doses of vitamin C may diminish doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity, perhaps by preserving mitochondrial membrane potential.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534735412439749">9</xref></sup> Another study found that blockade of CoQ10 synthesis increased the sensitivity of cancer cells to the chemotherapeutic agent camptothecin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534735412439749">10</xref></sup> Despite the potential benefits of CoQ10 in preventing doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, there is concern that CoQ10 may decrease the desired pro-oxidant treatment effects of doxorubicin. One previous study assessed the effects of CoQ10 on the in vitro efficacy of doxorubicin. CoQ10 increased the cytotoxic activity of doxorubicin in L-1210 leukemia cells and had no effect in Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534735412439749">3</xref></sup> Similar preclinical studies examining the effects of CoQ10 in breast cancer models are lacking. Here we report on a series of in vitro breast cancer cell culture experiments examining the effects of CoQ10 on doxorubicin cytotoxicity.</p>

<title>Coenzyme Q10 Quantification</title>
<p>Cells from both cell lines were grown to 80% confluency in 6-well dishes before treatment with CoQ10 and/or doxorubicin for 48 hours. All cells receiving both drugs were pretreated with CoQ10 for 24 hours prior to doxorubicin exposure. On the day of harvest for whole-cell quantification, cells were washed thrice with phosphate-buffered saline, trypsinized, and spun down. Cell pellets were stored at −20°C until CoQ10 level was quantified using a modified form of a previously established high-performance liquid chromotography (HPLC) method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534735412439749">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534735412439749">12</xref></sup> For mitochondrial fractions, Mitosciences (Eugene, OR) Mitochondria Isolation Kit for Cultured Cells (MS852) was used to separate the mitochondrial portion of the cells before following the same HPLC protocol to quantify the CoQ10 levels. Immunoblotting was used to validate the separation of mitochondria.

<title>Exogenous Coenzyme Q10 Increases Cellular Level of Coenzyme Q10</title>
<p>Triple-negative breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-468 and BT549 were tested for their ability to uptake exogenous CoQ10 over a dose range of 0.09 to 9 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534735412439749">Figure 1</xref>). In humans, the standard supplementation dose raises plasma CoQ10 levels from 0.5 to 2 µM; breast cancer patients have a typical plasma level of 0.9 µM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534735412439749">13</xref></sup> Both cell lines demonstrated that in vitro cellular CoQ10 concentration increases as higher exogenous concentrations are administered to cells.

<p>Exogenous CoQ10 increases CoQ10 levels in the mitochondria of breast cancer cells in vitro, even in the presence of doxorubicin. To determine if exogenous CoQ10 was able to concentrate in the mitochondria of the breast cancer cells, cellular fractionation was performed to separate out the mitochondria before testing the levels of CoQ10 after exogenous treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1534735412439749">Figure 2</xref>). In both cell lines, the highest treatment of CoQ10, 9 µM, caused a substantial increase in CoQ10 detected over the baseline, up to a third of the amount measured in the whole-cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1534735412439749">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1534735412439749">B</xref>).

In both cell lines, the level of CoQ10 detected after treatment with doxorubicin alone was similar to the baseline CoQ10 levels. However, the 2 cell lines differed in their mitochondrial CoQ10 levels after the combined treatment with CoQ10 and doxorubicin. MDA-MB-468 cells had a substantially decreased level of mitochondrial CoQ10 in the presence of doxorubicin, decreasing the amount of CoQ10 detected by approximately two thirds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1534735412439749">Figure 2E</xref>).

<p>To confirm our findings, colony formation assays were also performed on both cell lines after CoQ10 and doxorubicin treatments alone and in combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1534735412439749">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1534735412439749">D</xref>). Colony formation assays are a more stringent test of cell fitness as they measure the ability of every cell in the population to undergo unlimited growth and are therefore much more sensitive at identifying small differences between treatment groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534735412439749">14</xref></sup> In both breast cancer cell lines, doxorubicin severely reduced the number of colonies, and the addition of CoQ10 did not alter doxorubicin’s inhibitory capacity. The addition of CoQ10 alone did not substantially affect the colony formation of the cells.</p>

<title>Coenzyme Q10 Does Not Diminish the Apoptotic Effect of Doxorubicin</title>
<p>Given that doxorubicin kills cancer cells, at least in part, by inducing apoptosis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534735412439749">14</xref></sup> we directly measured whether or not CoQ10 altered the level of doxorubicin-mediated apoptosis. Cells pretreated with CoQ10 were compared against cells pretreated with vehicle control for induction of cleaved Caspase-3 after doxorubicin treatment for 24 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1534735412439749">Figure 5</xref>). Both cell lines showed substantial cleaved Caspase-3 activity on exposure to doxorubicin, and this effect was not diminished by pretreatment with up to 9 µM of CoQ10. MDA-MB-468 cells were exposed to excessive levels of CoQ10, 180 µM, to determine if CoQ10 might induce apoptosis at high levels, but apoptosis was not detected.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity is a significant concern in the care of breast cancer patients, causing death or disability and limiting the use of potentially more effective concurrent drug combinations (ie, with trastuzumab). Effective treatments are needed to prevent this cardiotoxicity while not decreasing the antitumor effects of doxorubicin. We conducted a series of in vitro cell culture experiments to determine the effects of CoQ10 on doxorubicin cytotoxicity using 2 different triple-negative breast cancer cell lines that are sensitive to doxorubicin treatment. We demonstrated that there was CoQ10 uptake by the breast cancer cells, that the CoQ10 entered the mitochondria, and that CoQ10 did not limit the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin.</p>
<p>The strengths of this work include our expertise and ability to measure and confirm the dose-dependent delivery of CoQ10 to the mitochondria of breast cancer cells. In this setting, we have demonstrated, using 2 separate assays (proliferation and colony formation), that cell death induced by clinically relevant doses of doxorubicin is not altered by CoQ10 administered over a wide dose range and up to doses higher than that achievable through oral supplementation. Our work is consistent with prior studies on non–breast cancer cell lines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534735412439749">3</xref></sup> The observation that measured CoQ10 levels were decreased in the setting of doxorubicin treatment may be due to a doxorubicin-induced increase in ROS production, which has been observed in other cancer cell lines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534735412439749">10</xref></sup> Our work sets the stage for much needed in vivo experimentation requiring a large cohort of animals with a noninferiority design and correlative studies showing the activity and effects of both chemotherapy and CoQ10.</p>
<p>There is high use of antioxidant supplements by breast cancer patients after diagnosis, including during the time of treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534735412439749">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534735412439749"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534735412439749">17</xref></sup> Many patients use antioxidant supplements in the hope of decreasing treatment-related side effects and preventing recurrence, but the long-term effect of such use has not been rigorously studied for many supplement, disease, and treatment combinations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534735412439749">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534735412439749">18</xref></sup> Given the high cost of conducting long-term clinical trials, combined with recent findings of harm from antioxidant supplements being tested for the purposes of primary cancer prevention,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534735412439749">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534735412439749">20</xref></sup> we need efficient methods to identify, screen, and test dietary supplements that may be beneficial.

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In a series of in vitro cell culture experiments, we found that CoQ10 did not inhibit doxorubicin cytotoxicity in breast cancer cell lines. These results are far from informing clinical practice. Rather, they can inform subsequent preclinical and clinical studies.</p>
