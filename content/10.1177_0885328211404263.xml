<abstract>
<p>Two series of 3D scaffolds based on ε-caprolactone were synthesized. The pore size and architecture (spherical interconnected pores) was the same in all the scaffolds. In one of the series of scaffolds, made of pure ε-polycaprolactone, the volume fraction of pores varied between 60% and 85% with the main consequence of varying the interconnectivity between pores since the pore size was kept constant. The other scaffolds were prepared with copolymers made of a ε-caprolactone-based hydrophobous monomer and hydroxyethyl acrylate, as the hydrophilic component. Thus, the hydrophilicity and, presumably, the adhesion properties varied monotonously in the copolymer series while porosity was kept constant. A suspension of human chondrocytes in culture medium was injected in the 3D scaffolds and cultured in static conditions up to 28 days. SEM and immunofluorescence assays allowed characterizing cells and extracellular matrix inside the scaffolds after different culture times. To do that, cross sections of the scaffolds were observed by SEM and confocal microscopy. The quantity of cells inside the scaffolds decreases with a decrease of the volume fraction of pores, due to the lack of interconnectivity between the cavities. The scaffolds up to a 30% of hydrophilicity behave in a similar way than the hydrophobous; a further increase of the hydrophilicity rapidly decreases cell viability. In all the experiments production of collagen type I, type II, and aggrecan was found, and some cells were Ki-67 positive, showing that some cells are adhered to the pore walls and maintain their dedifferentiated phenotype even when cultured in three-dimensional conditions.</p>

<p>Regeneration of articular cartilage using autologous chondrocytes transplantation is a technique of clinical use since 1987.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328211404263">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328211404263">2</xref></sup> This technique needs harvesting of a small cartilage biopsy from which chondrocytes are extracted. Chondrocytes are then expanded in monolayer culture to obtain a number high enough for subsequent transplantation to the defect site. Cells should condense <italic>in vivo</italic> and produce a tissue with the composition (with collagen type II and aggrecan as main components of the extracellular matrix – ECM), morphology (with cells isolated in lacunae that protect them of the high compression loading to which articular cartilage is subjected), and functional characteristics of hyaline cartilage.</p>
<p>When chondrocytes of hyaline cartilage, or those of fibrocartilage, or fibroblasts of fibrous tissue are cultured in monolayer they can dedifferentiate up to the level that they become morphologically indistinguishable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328211404263">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328211404263">4</xref></sup> Dedifferentiation and proliferation in monolayer culture is highly associated to cell-substrate adhesion. Different characteristics of substrate’s surface such as chemical structure of substrate’s surface, amount, and confirmation of the proteins adsorbed to it, the surface microtopography, and others influence cell adhesion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328211404263">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328211404263"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328211404263"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328211404263"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328211404263"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328211404263"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328211404263"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328211404263">12</xref></sup> The composition of the culture medium and the presence of growth factors also affect growth and differentiation of chondrocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328211404263">11</xref></sup> The addition of insulin-transferring-selenium (ITS) has been proved to prevent chondrocyte dedifferentiation in monolayer culture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328211404263">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>On the other hand, culture of chondrocytes in 3D constructs such as alginate or other gels preserve hyaline chondrocyte rounded morphology although the ability of expansion is low.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328211404263">14</xref></sup> Nevertheless, it has been proved that chondrocytes expanded in monolayer culture can redifferentiate when seeded in a 3D construct as detected by the expression of collagen type II and aggrecan.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328211404263">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Animal models and clinical practice of autologous chondrocyte transplantation indicates that the correct regeneration of hyaline cartilage after implantation in the site of the defect needs a 3D support, the scaffold that protects the cells in the first stages of regeneration of the imposed loads and organize the regenerated tissue. A lot of different scaffolding materials, with different pore architecture and seeding protocols have been used in research work, <italic>in vitro</italic> and in <italic>in vivo</italic> animal models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328211404263">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328211404263"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328211404263"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328211404263"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885328211404263"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328211404263">21</xref></sup> and in clinical use as well.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885328211404263">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885328211404263">23</xref></sup></p>

Immunostaining of the components of the ECM and gene expression studies using real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) proved that chondrocytes maintained their differentiated phenotype in PCL 3D supports, with fixed pore connectivity, and produced cartilage specific ECM components. The aim of this work is to study the influence of pore connectivity and hydrophilicity of the support material based on ε-caprolactone scaffolds with varying hydrophilicity and porosity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328211404263">Figure 1</xref>) on the behavior of the cells that occupy the pores of the scaffold; in particular, cell adhesion of the chondrocytes to the pore walls, their proliferative ability, and ECM composition have been determined.

<sec id="sec3-0885328211404263"><title>PCL scaffolds</title>
<p>PCL scaffolds were synthesized as described in Lebourg et al<italic>.</italic> (2008).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328211404263">26</xref></sup> Shortly, templates of the scaffolds were synthesized by sintering of poly(ethyl methacrylate) microspheres (Elvacite 2043, Lucite International) at 140°C. The porosity of the templates was changed by varying the compression degree to which the templates were submitted. If the temperature and the pressure applied (when sintering porogen microspheres to produce the template) are higher, the contact surface between microspheres increases. These contact surfaces will generate pore throats in the scaffold, thus, mechanical and thermal treatments in template fabrication determine porosity and pore connectivity in the scaffold. PCL scaffolds were obtained by injection of melt PCL (Polysciences, Mw = 50,000) at 110°C into the templates by means of a custom-made injection device. The pressure of nitrogen gas in the device forced the melted PCL to get into the template. Thereafter, the porogen was leached out by repeated washings in ethanol. For the culture of chondrocytes, three different sets of scaffolds were used, with porosities of 60 ± 2%, 70 ± 2%, and 85 ± 2% (standard deviation calculated from the measurement of 5 replica of each scaffold) that will be named PCL60, PCL70, and PCL85 respectively hereafter. Porosity was calculated as the quotient of the volume of pores and the total volume of the scaffold. The porosity was measured using gravimetric methods. The samples were weighed dry, and then filled with distilled water, and subsequently weighed again. Water was injected in a chamber containing the scaffold under vacuum. Around 20 min was allowed for equilibration after immersing the samples in water. Water fills the pores nearly instantaneously and since bulk PCL is very hidrophobous no further water absorption is expected. Pore connectivity was characterized by measuring the diameter of the pore throats observed in SEM pictures of the scaffold cross-sections. Mean value and standard deviation were calculated from 45 measurements from three different SEM pictures for each sample.</p>

<p>Poly(methyl methacrylate), PMMA, porogen microspheres (Colacryl DP300) were introduced between two plates and sintered by keeping temperature at 180°C for 1 h at a constant pressure. After cooling that template at room temperature, a (co)monomer solution was introduced in the empty space between the PMMA spheres. A whole set of hydrophilic/hydrophobic materials were prepared by changing the percentage of HEA and CLMA in the original solution; besides 1 wt% benzoin and 2 wt% EGDMA was always added to the corresponding monomers solution. The copolymerization was carried out up to limiting conversion under a UV radiation source at room temperature. Once polymerization took place, the PMMA template was removed by Soxhlet extraction with ethyl acetate during 24 h. After this stage the porogen template was completely removed. The porous sample was kept 24 h more in a Soxhlet with ethanol in order to completely remove remaining low molecular weight substances. Samples were dried in vacuum to constant weight before use. The measured volume fraction of pores in the scaffolds of this series was 77 ± 3% independent of the HEA content of the copolymer. It was determined from the weight increase of samples after immersion in water for 24 h.

<sec id="sec5-0885328211404263"><title>Chondrocyte isolation</title>
<p>Healthy pieces of human articular cartilage from the superficial zone of the knee of a patient undergoing total knee arthroplasty were processed for chondrocyte isolation. The study was conducted in accordance with the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki, as revised in 1983, and approved by our local Ethics Committee. All patients submitted written informed consent before their inclusion in the study. Briefly, the cartilage tissue was aseptically dissected from the joint, minced, and washed with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Life Technologies). Then, the cartilage was incubated for 30 min with a 0.5 mg/mL hyaluronidase (Sigma-Aldrich) solution and for 1 h with a 1 mg/mL pronase (Merck) solution in a shaking water bath at 37°C. After that, the cartilage fragments were washed with DMEM and incubated with a 0.5 mg/mL collagenase-IA (Sigma-Aldrich) solution in a shaking water bath at 37°C overnight. The resulting cell suspension was filtered with a 70 µm cell strainer (BD Biosciences) to remove any undigested tissue and collagenase was rinsed off with DMEM containing 10% FBS (Invitrogen SA). Finally, the cell suspension obtained was transferred in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 50 µg/mL ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) to a 75 cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328211404263">2</xref></sup> tissue culture flask (Nunc) and maintained at 37°C, in a humidified atmosphere under 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The culture medium was replaced every 2 days and cells were allowed to grow until subconfluence.

After cell expansion in monolayer, cultured cells were seeded into the 3D materials in a high concentration (500,000 cells) using a precision syringe for 50 µL of culture medium with 10% FBS and 50 µg/mL ascorbic acid. After cell injection, medium was gently added to ensure that the material was covered.

The following antibodies were incubated overnight in 0.1% FBS and 0.1% Triton x-100 at 4°C: polyclonal rabbit antihuman collagen I (Chemicon International, no AB745, 1:50); monoclonal mouse antihuman collagen II (Chemicon International, no MAB1330, 1:50); monoclonal mouse antihuman Agrecan (Invitrogen, n° AHP0022, 1:50), and monoclonal mouse antihuman Ki-67 (DAKO, no M7240, 1:50). Then, biomaterials with seeding cells were incubated for 2 h at RT with secondary antibodies: Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse (Invitrogen, 1:200), Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-mouse (Invitrogen, 1:200) or Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit (Invitrogen, 1:200). Subsequently, the cell-scaffold constructs were washed 3 times for 10 min with PBS 0.1 M at room temperature and cut in half by using microsurgical instruments in order to have a view of the internal part.

<sec id="sec10-0885328211404263"><title>Architecture and physical properties of PCL and poly(CLMA-co-HEA) scaffolds</title>
<p>The pore architecture of PCL scaffolds of different porosity can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885328211404263">Figure 2</xref>. Pore interconnectivity increases with scaffold porosity. The structure of PCL 85 scaffold can be observed with more detail in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328211404263">Figure 3</xref>. In the PCL scaffolds the porosity was varied by changing the compression ratio when sintering the porogen particles in the preparation of the template. Since the porogen particles were identical for all samples, the pore size, that is, the diameter of the spherical cavities is the same in all the series. That is to say, higher porosity is achieved by increasing the compression ratio which leads to larger pore throats and higher interconnectivity. The porosity of the PCL scaffolds (volume fraction of pores) was 60 ± 2%, 70 ± 2%, and 85 ± 2% for PCL60, PCL70, and PCL85 respectively. Polycaprolactone is a semicrystalline polymer with melting temperature around 60°C and glass transition temperature around − 60°C. So in spite of the high porosity these scaffolds are rather stiff materials. Their compression modulus measured in stress–strain compressive tests with dry samples ranged from 0.6 MPa for the most porous to 8.1 MPa for the scaffold with 60% porosity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328211404263">26</xref></sup> All produced scaffolds were homogeneous with well interconnected pores, nevertheless the mean size of the throats between pores in PCL60 is quite small, 38 ± 9 µm in average, whereas in PCL70 and PCL85 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885328211404263">Figure 2</xref>) pore throats are larger with mean values 52 ± 13 and 80 ± 25 µm, respectively. Pore structure of poly(CLMA-co-HEA) scaffolds is the same in all the scaffolds, independent of the chemical composition of the material and is analogous to that of PCL scaffolds. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328211404263">Figure 4</xref> shows the SEM microphotography of a cross section of poly(CLMA-co-HEA) 70/30. Porosity is 77 ± 3% and mean diameter of pores around 100 µm. Both polyCLMA and PHEA are amorphous polymers with glass transition temperatures, <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub>, below room temperature as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0885328211404263">Table 1</xref>. The <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> of the copolymer networks is between those of the homopolymers. Thus, all the copolymers behave as elastomers at the temperature of the cell culture even if they are in the dry state. On the other hand, the equilibrium water content of the samples immersed in water at 37°C or in culture medium rapidly increases with increasing content of HEA from that of polyCLMA, that is, 10% (measured on dry basis). This means that it is quite hidrophobous, to around 370% of the hydrophilic PHEA homopolymer network. Thus, all the copolymer sponges are soft and deform easily when swollen in water or in culture medium. More details about the physical behavior of poly(CLMA-co-HEA) copolymers can be obtained from reference.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885328211404263">27</xref></sup>

<sec id="sec11-0885328211404263"><title>Cell viability of chondrocytes into PCL and poly(CLMA-co-HEA) scaffolds in vitro</title>
<p>Cell seeding into the scaffolds by injection of a cell suspension in the middle of the scaffold piece proved to be effective in introducing chondrocytes into the pore structure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885328211404263">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885328211404263">25</xref></sup> Nevertheless, in spite that the volume of cell suspension was kept at the minimum possible, a fraction of the cells leave the scaffold in the seeding process (these cells were eliminated by changing the scaffold to a different well) and other adhere on the external surface. Cells adhered on the surface of the scaffold behave as in monolayer culture in the sense that they proliferate until confluence. If the less hydrophilic scaffolds of the series: in PCL series or in poly(CLMA-co-HEA) copolymers up to 30% HEA after 28 days culture the complete surface of the scaffold appears covered by a layer of cells and ECM, as can be seen in the SEM pictures of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328211404263">Figures 3</xref>(a) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328211404263">4</xref>(a). In poly(CLMA-co-HEA) 50/50 and 30/70 still the cell layer can be seen by SEM but covering partially the scaffold surface, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0885328211404263">Figure 5</xref>(a) for the sample containing 70% HEA.
<fig id="fig5-0885328211404263" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>SEM pictures of the surface (a) and cross section (b) of poly(CLMA-co-HEA) 30/70 after 28 days culture.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0885328211404263-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The behavior of the cells inside the pores is different to those in the surface and the cross-sections of the scaffolds observed after 28 days culture show a much smaller cell density than in the surface. Cells and ECM spread inside the spherical cavities showing a large number of adhesion points to the pore walls, as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328211404263">Figure 3</xref>(b) and (c) for PCL85 and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328211404263">Figure 4</xref>(b) and (c) for poly(CLMA-co-HEA) 70/30. Some round cells can be seen bulging under a carpet of matrix. In the most hydrophilic copolymers the number of cells found in the pores of the scaffolds is very small, but their morphology resembles that of the hydrophobous polymers.</p>
<p>The different behavior of cells inside the pores and on the surface prevents any attempt of quantification of the number of cells in the different materials. Nevertheless, a qualitative approach obtained by immunostaining shows a clear dependence of the number of chondrocytes located inside the scaffolds as a function of porosity and hydrophylicity of the materials. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0885328211404263">Figure 6</xref> shows typical confocal microscopy images of cross sections of PCL70 and PCL85 scaffolds after 7 or 14 days culture. The cell nuclei were stained with DAPI. Although no quantitative evaluation with sufficient accuracy was possible, one can observe that the number of cells inside the scaffolds decreases with decreasing volume fraction of pores due to the lack of interconnectivity between the spherical cavities. Very few cells were found in PCL60 scaffolds, with 60% volume fraction of pores (results not shown). Non-specific staining of PCL allows seeing the pores contor. Chondrocytes seem to form clusters close to the pore walls.

<p>In a previous work it was shown that cell adhesion and proliferation of human chondrocytes in monolayer culture on polyCLMA and poly(CLMA-co-HEA) 70/30 was similar and only slightly lower than in the TCPS control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885328211404263">27</xref></sup> In 3D culture inside the scaffolds, the results seem to be also analogous in these two macroporous materials as can be seen in the confocal pictures of cross-sections after culture at 7 or 14 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0885328211404263">Figure 7</xref>). The number of cells in these materials seem to be of the same order as in PCL scaffolds. Nevertheless, for higher HEA content in poly(CLMA-co-HEA) copolymer scaffolds only few cells can be localized in the immunostained cross sections, that confirms the SEM results. The SEM pictures clearly show that even in the most hydrophilic copolymers, cell attachment to the substrate is possible although probably the adhesion forces are smaller than in hydrophobous materials.

<p>The adhesion force to the scaffold has been shown to play and important role in the morphology of chondrocytes seeded in macroporous 3D scaffolds. Miot et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0885328211404263">31</xref></sup> found that scaffolds made of polyethylene glycol terephtalate/polybutylene terephtalate hydrophilic materials chondrocytes maintain better the differentiated phenotype <italic>in vitro</italic> in the scaffolds with the highest hydrophilicity, what was ascribed to a reduced fibronectin adsorption to the substrate. Nevertheless, as happens in monolayer culture, dedifferentiation of the cultured chondrocytes does not take place in all the materials at the same culture time, it has been shown that the development of actin cytoskeleton takes place in monolayer culture on PLLA at longer culture periods than in control substrates,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328211404263">7</xref></sup> a behavior that was also found in monolayer culture on foamed or unfoamed poly(ethyl methacrylate) supports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0885328211404263">32</xref></sup> On the other hand, the average density of hydrophilic groups on the surface is not the key factor and their distribution and the way in which they are exposed for protein adsorption also plays an important role.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328211404263">9</xref></sup> In 3D culture in macroporous scaffolds the pore architecture seems to be very important as well, the adhesion to micro or nanofiber. 3D supports could be different to that found in scaffolds with pore cavities made of the same materials and the round morphology could also be better preserved in the former.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0885328211404263">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0885328211404263">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>The hydrophilic/hydrophobic copolymers of Miot et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0885328211404263">31</xref></sup> and also the series presented in this work seem to sustain cell attachment even for high hydrophilicity. Nevertheless, the biological response is quite different. In our poly(CLMA-co-HEA) series of scaffolds the results obtained in the copolymer containing 30% HEA groups are very similar to that in polyCLMA with low hydrophilicity or PCL85 which is hydrophobous. A further increase of the HEA content seems to avoid the viability of the cells inside the scaffold. This behavior could be associated to the need of cell attachment to the pore walls at least in the initial phases of cell seeding.</p>

<p>Immunofluorescence shows that cells cluster close to the pore walls and express both Collagen type I and Collagen type II (green color in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0885328211404263">Figure 8</xref>), and aggrecan (red color in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0885328211404263">Figure 9</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0885328211404263">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0885328211404263">9</xref> present the results of representative cross sections of PCL85 and poly(CLMA-co-HEA) 70/30 scaffolds both with an important number of cells. In all materials, Collagen type I and Collagen type II were expressed by all cell clusters observed up to 14 days culture. The adhesion of a chondrocyte to a substrate starts with the recognition by the transmembrane integrins of the cell with some binding sequences of the proteins adsorbed on the biomaterial surface that triggers a sequence of events that include the aggregation of the integrins, the formation of focal adhesions, and the development of the actin cytoskeleton. This changes the rounded physiological morphology of the cell to the spread one characteristic of the dedifferentiated cell and yields the change of the cell phenotype. The change of phenotype is mainly characterized by the switch from expressing Collagen type II to express Collagen type I since it is believed that a single dedifferentiating cell is not able to produce both types of collagen simultaneously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328211404263">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0885328211404263">35</xref></sup> The pores of the scaffold are large enough compared with the size of the cells in such a way that when chondrocytes are seeded into the 3D pore structure, at least part of them adhere to the surfaces of the pore walls and maintain the dedifferentiated phenotype while other redifferentiate and start to produce Collagen type II and aggrecan. Interestingly enough is the ability of the cells, adhered to the substrate, to proliferate. As mentioned above, no quantification of the evolution of the number of cells inside the scaffold with the culture time was possible, since the result of tests such as MTT or MTS or DNA quantification would be representative mainly of the proliferative cells in the external surfaces of the scaffold. Nevertheless Ki-67 positive cells were found in the cell clusters that occupy the pores, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0885328211404263">Figure 9</xref> and with higher magnification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0885328211404263">Figure 10</xref> by the green points situated inside or close to the cells nuclei. This indicates that the cells adhered to the scaffold walls maintain the mitotic capacity.

<p>Two series of ε-caprolactone based scaffolds were prepared, one of them of varying porosity and the other with copolymers in which the ratio of hydrophilic/hydrophobic component varies. The number of cells inside poly(ε-caprolactone) scaffolds clearly increased as porosity increased as expected. A minimum of around 70% porosity seems to be necessary with this scaffold architecture to allow seeding and viability of the cells inside the scaffold. Nearly no cells were observed inside the poly(CLMA-co-HEA) copolymer scaffolds with 50% or more of the hydrophilic component. Nevertheless, the scaffold made by the copolymer containing 30% of the hydrophilic monomeric units showed a result as good as pure polycaprolactone. Interestingly enough, both SEM and non-specific staining of the scaffold material by the inmunofluorescent antibodies allowed observing that chondrocytes inside the scaffold form aggregates adhered or very close to the pores walls. In addition a small fraction of the cells were Ki-67 positive thus showing some proliferation inside the scaffold in spite of the fact that major part of the culture was performed in ITS supplemented medium, a fact that was not observed in polycaprolactone scaffolds in a previous paper.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885328211404263">25</xref></sup> On the other hand chondrocytes expressed both type I and type II collagen in addition to aggrecan. It can be inferred that part of the cells inside the scaffold adhered to the pore walls and kept the dedifferentiated phenotype characteristic of chondrocytes cultured in monolayer, while others redifferentiate.</p>
