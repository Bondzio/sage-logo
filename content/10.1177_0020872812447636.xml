<abstract>
<p>War and war-related events can cause disintegration of vital community dimensions at the micro-level (related to everyday life of habitants), meso-level (regarding social relations) and macro-level (factors that make community autonomous entity). This article presents an example of a community that manifests characteristics of a disintegrated community in Croatia: at the micro-level with reduced living standards; at the meso-level with divided ethnic groups and non-functional social ties; at the macro-level with incomplete institutional development and underdeveloped economy. Approaches in community rebuilding tackling all three dimensions are proposed. On those grounds, the role of social work in rebuilding post-war communities is suggested.</p>

<title>Introduction: War as a factor of community disintegration</title>
<p>War events are those circumstances that cause severe changes in a community as a system, including total disintegration. Community as an entity is defined by its members and their characteristics, qualities of social relations and elements that give it certain autonomy and self-sufficiency (institutional infrastructure, culture, geographic area). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020872812447636">Derienzo (2007)</xref> finds that community is defined by its members (at micro- or individual levels), their reciprocity (meso- or interpersonal levels) and collective capacity (macro- or structural levels). When such an entity faces a dramatic event, such as war, collapse can be expected in all dimensions. War events can cause deconstruction of all vital features. Direct consequences for members at the micro-level first become obvious through deterioration of living standards; at the meso-level there are conflicts between ethnic groups that can result in forceful migration, ethnic cleansing or even genocide, or the difficult position of vulnerable groups (e.g. children, women, elderly and disabled persons); at the macro-level, a collapse of physical, institutional and cultural identity can take place. What does this mean for community work? Some authors who deal with community rebuilding mention that it should be done by respecting all three levels of what a community is (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020872812447636">Derienzo, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020872812447636">Mulligan and Nadarajah, 2011</xref>). Basic assistance comes from outside and is directed toward the most severe consequences. By its nature, this aid provides necessary resources. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020872812447636">Derienzo (2007)</xref> names it the ‘static enhancement model’ and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020872812447636">Mulligan and Nadarajah (2011)</xref> call it ‘asset replacement’. However, the further rebuilding process should not rely on outdoor solutions, but rather on building a community from within and developing its own capacities. It is called the ‘transformative model’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020872812447636">Derienzo, 2007</xref>) or ‘community development approach’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020872812447636">Mulligan and Nadarajah, 2011</xref>). Some already known approaches in community work can be useful for tackling each dimension: the human needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020872812447636">Max-Neff, 1991</xref>) or ‘people-centred’ approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020872812447636">Carmen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020872812447636">Uphoff, 1996</xref>) directed at the micro-level; the law-based approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020872812447636">Lorentzen and Turpin, 1998</xref>) or conflict resolution theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020872812447636">Curle, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020872812447636">Lederach, 1997</xref>), useful in strengthening social ties or the position of certain vulnerable groups; the social reconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020872812447636">Wessels and Monteiro, 2001</xref>) process is suitable for the community as a whole, aiming to ‘renew social fabric of the community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020872812447636">Ajduković, 2003</xref>: 20). War events should be also considered during complete community assessment as the basis for further interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020872812447636">Friedman, 2005</xref>). On this ground, the central issue of this article will be exploring levels of community disintegration through an example of one community in Croatia and prospects for its rebuilding. The final purpose is to create a basis for systematic elaboration of social work possibilities. While abundant information on the impact of war on community development can be found in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020872812447636">Bellows and Miguel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020872812447636">Frančišković et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020872812447636">Mitchell and Correa-Velez, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020872812447636">Mooren and Kleber, 2001</xref>), it seems there are not many relevant studies in social work. While it is clear that war should have an impact on social work practice through introduction of new programmes or replacement of the old ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020872812447636">Chandler, 2004</xref>), systematic elaboration of its role in community development in a post-war context seems unclear. This article will therefore try to contribute to elaboration of social workers’ role in community rebuilding in a post-war context.</p>

<title>Context of the war in Croatia</title>
<p>The Croatian War of Independence from 1991 to 1995 was significant for entire national development. It was initiated by local Serbs’ rebellion on one hand, and military forces of Yugoslavian army on the other. It is estimated that there were 20,091 direct victims: 71.8 percent of them were Croatian combatants and civilians who were killed or died; 8.3 percent were Croatian combatants and civilians listed as missing and 19.9 percent were Serbian paramilitaries and civilians who were killed or died (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0020872812447636">Živić, 2006</xref>). According to the official estimates of the Croatian Government, the overall war damage was approximately €35 billion. Of this amount, material damage accounted for 40.2 % cost of war and lack of maintenance of assets, 26.1 % and the damage inflicted upon lives and health of people, 33.7 percent. While there were 30,000 refugees and displaced persons registered in mid-1991, their number increased to 703,000 (14 percent of total population) by the end of that year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020872812447636">Šakić et al., 1993</xref>). This context of suffering, destruction and civil displacement damaged crucial social structures, such as social welfare, health care and education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020872812447636">Ajduković, 1995</xref>). During and long after the war, significant demographic upheavals in the form of accelerated aging could be felt. Today, Croatia’s population is one of the oldest in Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020872812447636">Žganec et al., 2008</xref>). These processes are partially a result of a general social trend of reduction of birth rate and extension of life-span, and partially of war-related factors. It is estimated that, due to the war-related developments, 10 percent of the overall population has been excluded, directly and indirectly, from the reproduction of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020872812447636">Šterc and Pokos, 1993</xref>). When we add almost half a million registered war veterans and approximately 35,000 invalids of war (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020872812447636">Government of the Republic of Croatia, 2006</xref>), we must then anticipate numerous psychosocial consequences. The war has also had substantial impact at the top of the ladder of income and wealth distribution. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020872812447636">Bićanić and Franičević (2005</xref>: 24) point out, ‘a large number of people have become rich as a result of the war, either directly – often as war profiteers, arms dealers, smugglers – and/or indirectly, by taking part in looting’. Research has shown that citizens generally think their quality of life has substantially deteriorated and they pinpoint the consequences of war and war-related events as some of the main causes. For example, the research carried out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020872812447636">Milas (1997)</xref> indicates consistent occurrence of problems related to neglect of regions, social problems and consequences of war. Some regions, such as eastern Croatia, have suffered massive damage, including elements of genocide, culturecide and ecocide. The research carried out in eastern Croatia clearly indicates that the respondents think the war and its effects on life in the region are largely to blame for regional inequalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020872812447636">Šundalić, 2006</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section4-0020872812447636">
<title>Disintegration of Croatian communities directly affected by the war</title>
<p>Altogether, 101 Croatian municipalities were affected by the war on their entire territory: at that time, they had 695,714 inhabitants or 14.5 percent of the total population.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0020872812447636">1</xref></sup> The consequences for development were so dramatic that, even today, 15 years later, they have not recovered. However, there has been no systematic elaboration of community disintegration at the micro-, meso- and macro-levels. Partially, certain data suggest that these communities have not finished their rebuilding. For instance, most of them are among the most underdeveloped communities in Croatia. Based on the development index calculated in 2008 for all municipalities,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0020872812447636">2</xref></sup> the development of most post-war communities (76 percent) is below average. Twenty-two percent of them are even below 50 percent of the Croatian average with very unfavourable structural indicators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0020872812447636">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The share of the directly affected communities in the first two groups of the most underdeveloped communities in Croatia is far larger compared to their general share in Croatia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0020872812447636">Figure 2</xref>). The two communities that exceed the Croatian average owe their development to their position on the southern Adriatic, favourable for tourism.</p>

</fig>
<p>Only 6.24 percent of all municipalities fall into the least favourable group, but 60 percent of them were directly affected by the war. Further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020872812447636">Čavrak (2004)</xref> points out that these communities have underdeveloped infrastructure, a centralized system and limited autonomy, public stigmatization and unsolved relations with the neighbouring countries (Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina).</p>
<p>Regarding the meso-level, so far it is known that communities face issues connected with coexistence between ethnic groups, mostly domestic Serbs and Croats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020872812447636">Čorkalo et al., 2008</xref>) and the unresolved issue of the return of their population and property relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020872812447636">Čavrak, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The best known indicators are the ones at the micro-level that suggest decreased living standards and unsatisfied needs. For example, it is known that this population deals with low income and difficulties in accessing the labour market. Using the available data of the Croatian Employment Service,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0020872812447636">3</xref></sup> the share of unemployed persons in the population of 58.41 percent of the post-war communities is substantially higher than the national level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0020872812447636">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Only 10 percent of post-war communities have an unemployment rate lower than the national rate (13.8%); in all other cases, the unemployment rate is much higher, with as many as 34.7 percent of them having an exceptionally high rate (above 30%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0020872812447636">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Only five communities record an income comparable to the national income per capita (HRK 26,280). In 23 percent of the communities, the income per capita is at least two times lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0020872812447636">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Besides this, some research indicate issues connected with the mental health of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020872812447636">Ajduković et al., 2007</xref>) and poorer future prospects of youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020872812447636">Raboteg Šarić and Rogić, 2002</xref>). Demographic trends indicate that these areas are still unfavourable for their habitants. Dramatic demographic changes are manifested in reduction of population (far larger than at the national level) and change of ethnic structure: many communities recorded an outflow of the Serb population and inflow of Croats from Bosnia-Herzegovina. Expectedly, the biggest drop in population was recorded between 1991 and 2001, when a large majority of these communities recorded a drop that by far exceeded that at the national level. Between 2001 and 2011, only 10 percent of communities recorded population growth; at the same time, a population drop exceeding the national level continued in a majority of communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0020872812447636">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>This suggests not only that the demographic reconstruction has failed, but also that the demographic erosion in these communities has continued. Of the original 695,714 inhabitants, only 422,940 remained in 2011, which is a drop of 39.21 percent (some three times higher that the drop at national level, which is 10.32%).</p>
<p>So far, social responses to these problems have been centralized, mostly rudimentary, passive and have not allowed further autonomous development. It could be said that the static enhancement model or asset replacement approach have been in place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020872812447636">Derienzo, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020872812447636">Mulligan and Nadarajah, 2011</xref>). These units have been declared as <italic>areas of special state concern</italic>. Legislative solutions were reduced to several measures: provision of housing, tax benefits (in property transactions and profit tax), additional natural resource royalties, co-financing of transport, staying in schools and infant nurseries. These measures assumed certain preconditions that haven’t been met (e.g. existence of institutions that had not even been established in some places) and didn’t deal with many other problems.</p>
<p>As for the incomplete knowledge and practice base in Croatia concerning these communities, we will try to provide a more holistic insight into dimensions of disintegration and rebuilding prospects with the example of Vojnić Municipality.</p>

<title>Case study: Disintegration and rebuilding opportunities of Vojnić Municipality</title>
<p>Vojnić is one of the larger municipalities that were affected by war across their entire territory. It was occupied from October 1991 to August 1995. Vojnić experienced drastic demographic changes: the municipality that had had a population of 8236 in 1991 recorded a population drop of 33.28 percent in 2001 and an additional 18.02 percent in 2011. The population has also changed in ethnic structure: because of the war in Croatia, and later in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Serb population left Vojnić and the Croat population from Bosnia moved in. With its level of development reaching only 38.54 percent of the national level, Vojnić falls into the first category of the most underdeveloped communities. The unemployment rate is 43.9 percent – more than three times higher than the national level (13.8%) – and the average income per capita is 61.98 percent lower than the national level. The share of welfare beneficiaries is also much higher: according to the July 2011 data, the share of welfare beneficiaries in the Croatian population is 2.44 percent and in Vojnić it is around four times higher (8.59%).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0020872812447636">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this qualitative research we explored levels of community disintegration, and, based on that, suggest further approaches in community rebuilding. Research was conducted by interviewing the key informants, the leading persons in the main institutions: primary school, social welfare centre, local government, Red Cross, parish church and the NGO Centre for Civil Initiatives that has been active in Vojnić area for 10 years. Questions were focused on descriptions of current developmental facts, and how they see their future developmental prospects. Data were analysed using thematic analysis, which identifies key themes within a group of data relevant for certain phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020872812447636">Braun and Clarke, 2006</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section6-0020872812447636">
<title>Levels of community disintegration</title>
<p>Based on analysed interviews, it is obvious that Vojnić still faces disintegration at all three levels: individual, interpersonal and structural.</p>
<list id="list1-0020872812447636" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>At the individual level, the population is facing essential existential issues: unemployment and risky employment, lack of finance and housing problems. Accompanying the high unemployment rate are low employment prospects and the fact that the population represents cheap labour with unstable jobs as a result of discontinued economic activities. The labour force from Bosnia-Herzegovina still have housing problems because they live in the houses given by the government. They have no real estates in Croatia and no access to their property back in their motherland: ‘People lack everything. They lack drinking water and, in some places, electricity’ (2). There is a predominant blocking and non-stimulating atmosphere in which people show their dissatisfaction, uncertainty and fear of the future, their experience of loss (of their property or their former higher living standards), indifference, monotony, lack of initiative or motivation for work, and non-acceptance of the rural way of life (a large number of the settlers used to live in urban areas): ‘Life used to be good here. Everyone had a job. The worst curse here was: may you be rich and then poor . . . And this is exactly what happened here’ (2). ‘People seem to be without hope, they see no future, no prospects . . . This is a realistic fear and uncertainty’ (6). Stimulating atmosphere in the community was rarely mentioned: only two participants pointed out that some of the locals wanted to work and to be active, that they had accepted the changes. ‘So it is my impression that they see it more and more as their home, where they and their children will spend their future life’ (6).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Vojnić also deals with <italic>unfunctional social relations</italic> among habitants that do not support its development. Participants have emphasized the creation of a <italic>complex ethnic structure</italic> that resulted from the war in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Once predominantly a Serb and Orthodox community, today Vojnić has equal shares of a domiciled Serb Orthodox population and Croat Catholic settlers. Their current relations could be called a <italic>separated coexistence of differences</italic>, because there have been no major conflicts. Some participants claim that occasional verbal conflicts take place, but very rarely. On the other hand, these groups are not connected and are divided in terms of political options and cultural activities. Schools offer additional separate religious instructions and language lessons. A higher level of active coexistence can be seen among the youth. As regards general relations among local people, it can be said that the <italic>population is not connected</italic>. This is manifested in lack of self-initiative in spending their leisure time, increasingly infrequent neighbourly assistance and large distances between villages: ‘Some of these values are now lost . . . And this neighbourly assistance . . . it is not assistance any more as much as it is business for some’ (4).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>At the macro-level, viewing Vojnić as one entity, it is apparent that it has disintegrated in the sense of institutional base, demographic erosion and lack of external constructive support. Several sectors (public, private and civil) vital for the functioning of the community are rudimentary.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Participants underline <italic>problems in functioning of economic protagonists</italic>: in agriculture, which isn’t systematically organized; local industry is unstable and unprepared for market competition: ‘our timber and wood industry has been shut down for seven years . . . because its owner, who had bought it from the state, could not manage it’ (1). There is no initiative from local entrepreneurs . . . Even those who do produce something – honey or brandy – do not have the mind-set required for developing their products and marketing them so that they could benefit from them’ (3).</p>
<p>Furthermore, <italic>incomplete functioning of public institutions</italic> is obvious. Although all fundamental social, educational, cultural and health institutions can be found, their activities are basic and do not meet the population’s additional needs. Some institutions have been closed in the past few years (e.g. ambulance service) and there has been no continued cooperation between the proponents of the institutions: ‘Until last year, we expected that these structures in Vojnić would organize some meeting. It was the first time we talked – only because it was our legal obligation’ (4).</p>
<p>However, besides public institutions, <italic>a number of foreign and external Croatian civil society organizations were active</italic>. They mobilized the population to take part in community development, become active citizens and launch economic activities. On the other hand, <italic>internal civil society organizations are functioning in a discontinued way.</italic> There are women’s and youth associations, cultural and sporting activities, but there is no continuity in their activities, financing and membership: ‘These cultural societies, for instance . . . they are still polarized due to these new demographic trends. These divisions create additional costs that we cannot organize’ (1). ‘The problem here is the fact that these initiatives have never been continued and sustainable. There were cases when CCI would withdraw and the activity would just fade out’ (3). Besides public, economic and civil institutions, there are <italic>areas of social life that lack services</italic>: children’s facilities, adequate care for elderly persons (such persons are then accommodated in foster families or in homes outside the community), culture, health care, family issues, access to education and basic necessities: ‘For some school children, the only fun is getting together here, in school . . . some even don’t have computers at home, some live far from others, so school means practically everything to them’ (5).</p>
<p>Finally, there is a <italic>crisis of local governance</italic>: local authorities have issues with conflicting political interests, financial and structural obstacles in obtaining funds for important infrastructural projects (unsolved administrative preconditions such as regulated cadastral and land-registry documents and property relations with a population that has moved): ‘This political issue in Vojnić is very clearly emphasized. Not even so much on ethnic basis . . . mostly on a political basis . . . there is not much discipline here . . . there is a trade going on with the councillors’ (3).</p>
<p>As regards the relations with the neighbouring communities, there are two aspects. On one hand, there is <italic>partial cooperation with the neighbours</italic> when it comes to local authorities, but not when it comes to the people: ‘As for the neighbouring municipalities, I think our cooperation with them is very good . . . these are all very poor municipalities and stories are mostly the same everywhere. So they have realized it is better to join hands with each other’ (3). On the other hand, the participants see Vojnić as a ‘non-Croat’ <italic>stigmatized community</italic>, because of its antifascist movement during World War II and predominant Serb population. ‘And, truth be told, Vojnić is so rarely mentioned at all – and even then it is mocked – and will probably keep paying a toll to the events of the past for some time’ (4).</p>
<p>In addition, <italic>the community is in an inferior position compared to its neighbours.</italic> It is manifested in several examples – abuse of housing assistance on the part of the government: ‘Let me tell you – the applicants claim they’ve been told to change their political option and only then they will receive housing assistance’ (1); lack of control and disposal of internal resources: ‘The government gave a concession for white clay to Inker Zaprešić . . . and the factory that was built in Vojnić imports white clay from Prijedor’ (1); the tendency to launch unpopular or hazardous activities in Vojnić: ‘a company that deals in hazardous waste. They have a plant in the centre of Vojnić, right across from the school and kindergarten . . . it is a sensitive issue . . . if they close it down, 50 or 100 people will lose their jobs’ (3); and, finally, better jobs are reserved for people from more developed places, instead of for unemployed locals: ‘The County is solving its unemployment problems at the expense of Vojnić Municipality . . . On the other hand, the unemployment rate of my own population here is too high’ (1). It is a company that was moved here from Karlovac . . . a large part of its workforce are people from Karlovac, who commute from Karlovac to here by van, because of tax relief’ (3).</p>
<p>In this context, the participants talk about unfavourable demographic changes heading towards <italic>demographic erosion</italic>. ‘In some villages there are only a few households left. I am afraid these villages are gone’ (4). ‘These parts are beautiful, but depopulated. And they are getting more and more depopulated’ (6).</p>

<title>Prospects for community rebuilding</title>
<p>Altogether, the respondents are not unanimous when it comes to future development, and while some believe that the community is moving up in its development and that prospects are positive, others are concerned about the threat that the community could sink further into underdevelopment and depopulation, without the means to adapt for the changes coming up with the accession to the European Union. However, their ideas reflect that the focus is on building community capacities from within, and rarely in maintaining a passive role in the asset-replacement approach, meaning that resources for economic activities and civil society organizations should be brought in from outside.</p>
<p>The possibilities regarding community rebuilding from within (the first transformative approach) are again grouped in three levels:</p>
<list id="list2-0020872812447636" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>Raising individual capacities and mobilizing population: <italic>raising living standards</italic>. First of all, raising the rate of employment, dealing with property-related and housing issues, and conceiving facilities for everyday activities of the local people. <italic>Mobilization of the population</italic>, including development of entrepreneurship, encouraging the inhabitants’ proactive behaviour, introduction of external mobilizing influences that can offer ideas and information, and strengthening the population’s educational capacity (providing new knowledge and skills): ‘People must change the attitude that the government is here to give you everything’ (6). ‘The intellectual elite should help . . . people with ideas and knowledge should come . . . The people who can tell us how to start a company, how to do business – how to do it in a clever way’ (6).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Strengthening <italic>social ties</italic>. People should be encouraged to self-organize and a sense of unity of various sectors should be promoted; people should be connected with the administrative structure in the community and the community should establish contacts with its neighbours (other municipalities, people in other towns and villages and cross-border cooperation with Bosnia and Herzegovina). ‘Well, we should start with the county here, and even with the city of Karlovac. We need a sense of unity of a sort . . . to realize that we all live here’ (6).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Strengthening the community as an autonomous system with the following directions:
<list id="list3-0020872812447636" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Strategic approach of endogenous development</italic>: This approach relies on the use of internal resources of a community, long-term planning, defining priorities and systematic work. ‘We in Vojnić have lots of mineral resources . . . woods . . . exceptional quantities of high-quality drinking water . . . large areas under healthy, unpolluted crops’ (1).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Strengthening impact in decision-making</italic>. Specifically, of the younger population, local government, and the population’s more responsible participation in political processes: ‘First of all, the people should think more thoroughly about who to vote for, who will be in power, who will offer something to them’ (4).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The participants have recognized the <italic>priority of economic development</italic>, notably in the following areas: organized agriculture based on cooperative farms and family farms, and war/memorial tourism: ‘these parts are really swarming with all these microlocations. Indeed, clever tourist packages could be designed . . . The partisan hospital could be renovated . . . it was one of the largest hospitals that existed in Europe’ (3). Two participants mention limitations in some activities, for example, that the expectations that many will find jobs in large-scale industrial plants are not realistic and that the idea of concentrating institutional social welfare in a deserted and vast area should be avoided: ‘I wouldn’t like this area to be used for accommodation and for social welfare homes, regardless of the certain number of jobs that it would create’ (4).</p></list-item>

<title>The role of social work in community post-war rebuilding: Concluding remarks</title>
<p>To conclude, we can say that the war events in Vojnić in the early 1990s caused a collapse of the fundamental community elements: individual living standards, erosion of functional social ties and erosion of basic institutional functioning, and an unfavourable position compared to the external macro-environment. Further, there are several directions in community rebuilding that mostly rely on inner initiatives in building community capacity. They are targeting the same level of community disintegration: raising individual capacity and activity, strengthening social ties, and strengthening the community as an autonomous system through raising influence in decision-making, promoting strategic endogenous development and building economic activities.</p>
<p>Alongside this local context, we should be aware of the national context, too. Croatian society is facing accelerated transitional changes. Some areas have had more success in activating their local capacities, while some still have not recovered from the war events. Further development of such communities must be sustainable, integrated and oriented to strengthening of both collective and individual welfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020872812447636">Espinoza and Ferguson, 2006</xref>). Community rebuilding in such areas could have two directions. One is based on organizing new realities (e.g. with new ethnic groups), and the other one is based on reviving the old elements (e.g. rebuilding social relations among returnee Serbs and local Croats). However, in terms of the national context, these processes can be distracted by the context of clear regional inequalities and the communist heritage without developed community practice.</p>
<p>We see social work as a profession that can promote community practice in the post-war context at all three levels of the rebuilding process. At individual levels, social workers can advocate fulfilment of basic human needs and increased living standards. In particular, they can introduce new services and a practice that promotes inclusion of vulnerable groups, particularly those coming directly from war (e.g. returnees, war veterans, etc.). In order to achieve these goals, social workers both from governmental and nongovernmental organizations can be involved. However, in other dimensions of community rebuilding, social workers from the nongovernmental sector seem to be more open, but joint activities with those in public institutions should not be avoided. It refers, for example, to establishing functional social ties through promotion of mutuality, overcoming of differences, engaging in resolution of conflicts, facilitating joint activities and introducing new communication mechanisms. In other words, social workers could bring people together to work on resolution of conflicts, interconnecting and meeting their basic needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020872812447636">O’Brien, 2003</xref>). Finally, social workers could contribute to rebuilding of structural or macro-levels through advocacy practice and making these issues more visible in wider society. Within a community, they can facilitate and coordinate cooperation among institutions and work on strengthening capacities of some organizations, primarily civil organizations and public institutions.</p>
