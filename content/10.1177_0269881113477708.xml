<abstract>
<p>We previously reported that regular recreational intranasal cocaine users exhibit impaired recognition of facial expressions of fear compared to occasional cocaine users and cocaine-naïve controls. The aim of the present study was to re-investigate this phenomenon after controlling for impulsivity, conduct disorder (CD) and anti-social personality disorder (ASPD). We employed a cross-sectional design to compare 31 cocaine-naïve participants, 35 occasional cocaine users and 20 regular recreational cocaine users. An emotional facial expression (EFE) task which comprised a male and a female face expressing six basic emotions morphed to differing degrees of emotional intensity was administered together with questionnaires to assess: CD, ASPD and impulsiveness. ASPD was not a significant covariate for EFE performance but impulsiveness and CD were significant covariates. After treating impulsiveness and CD as covariates we again observed a group difference in fear recognition ability attributable to the particularly impaired performance of regular cocaine users. This suggests that, although elevated impulsiveness and CD before the age of 15 years, may predispose a relative inability to recognize facial expressions of fear in adulthood, subsequent regular recreational use of cocaine represents an additional factor that is specifically associated with a selective deficit in fear recognition.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The ability to decode non-verbal emotional cues such as facial expressions conveying the six basic emotions: happiness, surprise, fear, sadness, disgust and anger (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881113477708">Ekman and Friesen, 1976</xref>) is fundamental for normal socialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881113477708">Blair, 2003</xref>). Reduced responsiveness to facial expressions of sadness and fear has been implicated in the development of psychopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881113477708">Blair, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881113477708">Blair 2001</xref>) and related to amygdala dysfunction (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269881113477708">Adolphs et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881113477708">Morris et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269881113477708">Whalen et al., 1998</xref>). Like psychopaths, cocaine users also appear to have particular difficulties in recognizing emotional facial expressions (EFEs) of fear. We previously reported that recently abstinent regular recreational cocaine users are selectively impaired in their ability to recognize fear EFE compared to occasional cocaine users and healthy controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881113477708">Kemmis et al., 2007</xref>). Our finding was supported by a report that abstinent recovering cocaine users exhibited particularly impaired recognition of fear EFE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269881113477708">Verdejo-Garcia et al., 2007</xref>) and that lifetime dose and duration of cocaine use were the best predictors of overall EFE recognition ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881113477708">Fernández-Serrano et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Since children and adults with psychopathic tendencies also exhibit selective deficits in fear recognition ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881113477708">Blair 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881113477708">Blair, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881113477708">Marsh and Blair, 2008</xref>), cocaine addicts with conduct disorder (CD) exhibit reduced cortisol responsivity to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269881113477708">Buydens-Branchey and Branchey, 2004</xref>) and both cocaine users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881113477708">Makris et al., 2004</xref>) and psychopaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269881113477708">Tiihonen et al., 2000</xref>) exhibit reduced amygdaloid volume, we previously suggested that there may be neurological parallels between cocaine abusers and psychopaths and interpreted the selective deficit in the ability of cocaine users to recognize fear as suggestive of amygdala dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881113477708">Kemmis et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, such parallels introduce the possibility that anti-social personality disorder (ASPD) and CD might confound the EFE findings in cocaine users. Thus, the impaired fear recognition ability that we observed may be more related to elevated anti-social tendencies among regular cocaine abusers than their use of cocaine per se. This possibility is reinforced by a report that ASPD clients exhibited higher rates of recent cocaine use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269881113477708">Mueser et al., 2006</xref>), and evidence of co-morbidity between cocaine misuse and psychopathy (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269881113477708">Rutherford et al., 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881113477708">Moeller and colleagues (2002)</xref> also reported that cocaine dependent participants with ASPD used more cocaine, and were more likely to use other drugs, than cocaine dependent subjects without ASPD. Furthermore, regardless of whether or not they had concomitant ASPD, cocaine-dependent participants were more impulsive than controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881113477708">Moeller et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, self-reported impulsiveness is another potential confound for the interpretation of a selective deficit in the ability to recognize fear EFE in cocaine users.</p>
<p>There is also emerging evidence of gender differences in the development and course of cocaine dependence. Although men are twice as likely to be cocaine-dependent than women, women appear to experience negative outcomes more rapidly than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881113477708">McCance-Katz et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269881113477708">Sinha and Rounsaville, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, there are gender differences in the prevalence of personality disorders in inpatient substance users. For example, males exhibit elevated rates of ASPD (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881113477708">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, there are reports that gender might moderate associations between impulsivity and abuse of some substances and not others (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881113477708">Grano et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269881113477708">Stoltenberg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269881113477708">Waldeck and Miller, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, the aim of the present study was to replicate and extend our earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881113477708">Kemmis et al., 2007</xref>) that compared regular recreational intranasal cocaine users with occasional users and cocaine-naïve controls to test a novel cohort of participants and determine if concomitant ASPD, CD and impulsivity are significant confounds for fear EFE recognition ability. We also sought to investigate gender differences in EFE recognition abilities and interactions between gender and cocaine use group. Our hypotheses were: (a) regular recreational intranasal cocaine users would exhibit a selective deficit in the ability to recognize fearful EFE as in our earlier study; (b) regular and occasional recreational cocaine users would report elevated impulsiveness, adult antisocial behavior (ASPD) and CD compared to cocaine-naive controls; (c) across all participants the extent of: impulsiveness, adult ASPD, and CD would be negatively correlated with fear EFE recognition ability; (d) regular cocaine users would continue to exhibit selective deficits in the ability to recognize fear after controlling for these expected covariates.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-0269881113477708">
<title>Participants and design</title>
<p>A total of 86 non-patient or non-treatment seeking/engaging male (<italic>n</italic>=46) and female (<italic>n</italic>=40) participants aged 23–49 years old (mean=34.1, standard error (SE) =0.76) were recruited using the ‘snowball’ procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269881113477708">Solowij et al., 1992</xref>). All participants completed detailed questionnaires to ascertain their history of drug use, their general and mental health, and demographic characteristics. A cross-sectional design was used to compare cocaine-naïve participants (NC, <italic>n</italic>=31, 18M/13F), occasional intranasal cocaine users (OC, <italic>n</italic>=35, 16M/19F) and regular intranasal cocaine users who reported using it at least once a month (RC, <italic>n</italic>=20, 12M/8F). Exclusion criteria were: visual impairment, a history of schizophrenia, depression, dependence on alcohol or opiates, current use of any legal psychoactive substances that could impair performance (e.g. benzodiazepines, anti-histamines), use of cocaine within three days prior to assessment or meeting Personality Disorder Questionnaire version 4 (PDQ-4) criteria for exclusion for ‘too good’ or ‘lie’ scores. All data was collected anonymously and each participant received a written explanation of the study and was debriefed. The study was approved by the University of Sussex Life Sciences School ethics committee and all participants provided written informed consent.</p>
<sec id="section4-0269881113477708">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were tested under similar conditions in a quiet room. All participants were instructed to refrain from consuming alcohol and cannabis for at least 12 h prior to testing. Participants were entered into a prize draw for two prizes of £20 for their participation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0269881113477708">
<title>Assessments</title>
<p>EFE recognition task: A computerized EFE recognition task programmed with Super Lab 2.0, that employed morphed images from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881113477708">Ekman and Friesen (1976)</xref> <italic>Pictures of Facial Affect</italic>, was presented on a laptop computer. A total of 60 morphed and original facial expressions were presented comprising a male (JJ) and a female (MO) face expressing five levels of emotional intensity (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100%) to produce a total of 10 presentations (one at each level of morphed intensity for the male and the female facial expressions) for each of the six basic facial emotional expressions (happiness, anger, fear, sadness, disgust and surprise). Between trials a central fixation cross was presented for 1 sec. Participants were required to respond using labeled keys to indicate which of the six basic emotions was being expressed within a cut-off time of 5 sec per stimulus presentation. The percent accuracy for responses across the 10 (five male and five female) face presentations was derived for each of the six basic facial expressions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0269881113477708">
<title>Questionnaire measures</title>
<p>Personal details were assessed with a questionnaire which included items relating to: age, gender, smoking status, personal and family psychiatric history and substance use within the past 24 h. Drug histories were recorded with a General Drug Use Questionnaire (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881113477708">Morgan, 1998</xref>) that was presented in table form, and records the age of first use, duration of use, time since last use, usual frequency of use and dose of: alcohol, nicotine and all illicit substances ever used. More detail concerning past cocaine use among the cocaine users was collected with a 34-item cocaine questionnaire that included items relating to: dose, frequency, settings, attitudes to drug use, self and interpersonal observations, craving. ASPD and CD were assessed with the 99-item PDQ-4+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881113477708">Hyler, 1994</xref>), a true/false questionnaire that screens for personality disorder (PD) types consistent with the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for paranoid, histrionic, antisocial, obsessive compulsive, schizoid, narcissistic, avoidant, negativistic, schizotypal, borderline, dependent and depressive PDs (DSM IV-TR published by the APA in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881113477708">2000</xref>). Item 99 lists 15 behavioral symptoms of childhood CD to be ticked if present before the age of 15 years. At least three of these pre-15 CD items (in addition to ASPD symptoms) are needed to reach the criteria for a diagnosis of adult ASPD. The PDQ-4+ also includes ‘too good’ and ‘suspicious’ items in order to identify participants not fully involved in answering the questions or not providing genuine answers. Impulsivity was assessed with the Impulsiveness, Venturesomeness and Empathy scale (IVE, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269881113477708">Eysenck and Eysenck, 1991</xref>). The IVE yields three independent scores for impulsiveness, venturesomeness and empathy, which ranged from 0–19 for impulsiveness and empathy and 0–16 for venturesomeness. High scores indicate high levels of these personality characteristics.</p>

<sec id="section7-0269881113477708">
<title>Statistics</title>
<p>The data were first analyzed with SPSS version 18 with an overall alpha level set at <italic>p</italic>=0.05. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests were employed to investigate group differences in personal characteristics such as age, education and cigarette smoking. The two-way ANOVA was employed to compare most drug group, gender and gender by group interactions for personal details and substance use history. However, in cases of significantly skewed distributions non-parametric tests were employed to analyze group differences (e.g. frequency of use and time since last use). Multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA) was used to investigate group differences, gender differences and gender by group interactions in: PDS including ASPD (using the PDQ-4) and impulsiveness, venturesomeness and empathy (the three factor scores of the IVE). Pearson’s product moment correlation coefficient was used to analyze relationships between ASPD, CD, IVE venturesomeness, impulsiveness and EFE recognition ability to determine if any were significant confounds for performance on the EFE facial expression recognition task. multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA), with IVE impulsiveness and PDQ-4 CD treated as covariates, was employed to investigate group differences, gender differences and gender by group interactions in: EFE recognition ability, including fear. Bonferroni post-hoc analysis was performed to analyze significant group differences and partial eta squared estimates of effect size are presented for all statistically significant MANOVA and MANCOVA findings.</p>

A significant number of participants in all three groups also reported using ecstasy (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269881113477708">Table 3</xref>).

However, a Kruskal-Wallis test indicated a group difference in the time since last use of ecstasy (<italic>p</italic>=0.009) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269881113477708">Table 3</xref>). The cocaine naïve participants were much less frequent users of other illicit drugs than participants in the two cocaine user groups. Nevertheless the proportions that used other illicit drugs were similar for both cocaine user groups (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269881113477708">Table 3</xref>) and Kruskal-Wallis tests indicated no significant group differences in the frequency of use, or usual dose consumed for: amphetamine, ketamine, poppers, psilocybin and LSD among those that did report using these drugs.</p>

However, the usual dose of cocaine correlated negatively with empathy (<italic>r</italic>= −0.314, <italic>p</italic>=0.030) and the usual dose of ecstasy correlated positively with impulsiveness (<italic>r</italic>=0.431, <italic>p</italic>=0.002).

<title>PDQ-4 measures</title>
<p>Pearson’s correlations were conducted to investigate relationships between measures of past consumption of licit and illicit substances and PDQ-4 measures of CD and ASPD. Usual dose and frequency of use of alcohol, cocaine and cannabis were not correlated with either CD or ASPD. Usual dose of ecstasy was also not correlated with either CD or ASPD but frequency of use of ecstasy was positively correlated with ASPD (<italic>r</italic>=0.330, <italic>p</italic>=0.023) and CD (<italic>r</italic>=0.566, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001), however it should be noted that CD refers to anti-social behavior before the age of 15 years and only two participants reported starting taking ecstasy before this age. Spearman’s correlations indicated no significant non-parametric relationships between ASPD or CD and the time since last use of alcohol, cocaine, cannabis and ecstasy. Pearson’s correlations indicated that IVE impulsiveness was highly positively correlated with both ASPD (<italic>r</italic>=0.583, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001), and CD (<italic>r</italic>=0.414, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) and IVE venturesomeness was also positively correlated with ASPD (<italic>r</italic>=0.345, <italic>p</italic>=0.002).

<title>EFE performance</title>
<p>Pearson’s correlations were conducted to investigate possible relationships between: past consumption of licit and illicit substances, IVE impulsiveness and PDQ-4 measures of CD and ASPD and EFE performance for the six basic facial expressions. EFE accuracy for each of the six facial expressions was not correlated with usual dose of alcohol, cannabis, cocaine or ecstasy. Frequency of use of alcohol and ecstasy was not correlated with accuracy of recognition of any of the EFE facial expressions but frequency of cannabis use was positively correlated with EFE disgust accuracy (<italic>r</italic>=0.252, <italic>p</italic>=0.043), and frequency of cocaine use was positively correlated with surprise accuracy (<italic>r</italic>=0.356, <italic>p</italic>=0.004), and negatively correlated with fear accuracy (<italic>r</italic>= −0.282, <italic>p</italic>=0.023). ASPD scores were not significantly correlated with any measures of EFE accuracy whereas IVE impulsiveness was negatively correlated with the recognition accuracy for fear (<italic>r</italic>= −0.225, <italic>p</italic>=0.045), and CD scores were negatively correlated with the recognition accuracy of both fear (<italic>r</italic>= −0.292, <italic>p</italic>=0.007), and sadness (<italic>r</italic>=0.222, <italic>p</italic>=0.043). Two-way MANCOVA of the EFE accuracy scores with group and gender as between factors and IVE impulsiveness and CD scores treated as a covariates indicated no gender differences for mean EFE performance or for specific facial expressions of: anger, fear, surprise, happy or sad. However, female participants were more impaired at recognizing disgust (<italic>F</italic>(1,70)=4.000, p=0.049, partial eta squared=0.054). There were no group by gender interactions for mean EFE scores or any of the facial expressions other than a significant interaction for fear (<italic>F</italic>(2,70)=4.924, <italic>p</italic>=0.010, partial eta squared=0.123). Furthermore, there were no group differences for mean EFE scores or for: anger, disgust, surprise, happy or sad after treating IVE impulsiveness and CD scores as covariates, but there was a significant group difference in fear recognition accuracy (<italic>F</italic>(2,70)=4.989, <italic>p</italic>=0.009, partial eta squared=0.125). Post-hoc comparisons indicated that regular cocaine users exhibited worse fear recognition performance than occasional cocaine users and cocaine naïve participants (<italic>p</italic>=0.002 and 0.003 respectively) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269881113477708">Figure 1</xref>). The group difference in fear recognition accuracy was also significant when the male participant data were analyzed independently (<italic>F</italic>(2,35)=10.983, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, partial eta squared=0.386), whereas independent analysis of the female data alone yielded no group differences in recognition accuracy for any of the facial expressions.</p>

<title>Inaccurate EFE responses</title>
<p>Surprise was the most common facial expression to be confused with fear for both the male (JJ) and female (MO) facial expressions of fear. This tendency was associated with the extent of cocaine use. The number of mistaken identifications of fear as surprise for all of the morphed images of male and female facial expressions of fear increased from 1.3 errors per participant for cocaine naïve controls, to 1.4 for occasional cocaine users and 3.1 for regular cocaine users. In contrast the number of mistaken identifications of surprise as fear decreased from 1.1 errors per participant for both cocaine naïve controls and occasional cocaine users to only 0.6 for regular cocaine users. The incidence of misidentification of any of the other expressions as facial expressions of fear was too low for meaningful analysis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present findings corroborates our earlier report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881113477708">Kemmis et al., 2007</xref>) in which we also reported that regular cocaine users exhibit significantly and selectively impaired fear recognition accuracy compared to both occasional cocaine users and cocaine naïve controls and suggests that this is a robust phenomenon. The present results are also consistent with reports that abstinent recovering cocaine using poly-substance users exhibited selective deficits in fear recognition accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269881113477708">Verdejo-Garcia et al., 2007</xref>) and reports that lifetime dose and duration of cocaine use were the best predictors of overall fear recognition ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881113477708">Fernández-Serrano et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The past use of substances other than cocaine by the three groups did differ with respect to some measures of: alcohol, cannabis and ecstasy. However, none of these correlated with any measure of EFE accuracy (other than a modest positive correlation between the frequency of cannabis use and the recognition accuracy for disgust). Furthermore, the extent of past use of alcohol, cannabis and cocaine were not positively correlated with impulsiveness, ASPD or CD. However, we did observe the usual dose of ecstasy (or MDMA) to be positively correlated with IVE impulsiveness and the frequency of its use to be positively correlated with ASPD and CD scores. This is consistent with our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881113477708">Morgan 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269881113477708">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881113477708">Morgan et al., 2006</xref>) and a report by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269881113477708">Falck and colleagues (2006)</xref>. Nevertheless, the lack of any correlations between fear EFE accuracy and the extent of use of any substance other than cocaine suggests the impaired fear recognition that we have again observed in regular cocaine users in the present study is primarily related to the frequency of their use of cocaine.</p>
<p>Although our findings indicated that the PDQ-4 adult ASPD score was not a significant covariate for fear EFE recognition accuracy, impulsiveness was found to be negatively correlated with fear EFE accuracy and highly positively correlated with CD and ASPD scores. Furthermore, CD score was also a significant covariate. CD scores were negatively correlated with fear EFE recognition accuracy and the group means differed significantly with regular cocaine users reporting the highest CD scores. Contrary to our hypothesis, and to earlier reports (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269881113477708">Mueser et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881113477708">Moeller et al., 2002</xref>) however, we failed to observe a positive correlation between ASPD scores and the frequency of cocaine use, and the ASPD scores of the three cocaine user groups did not differ. But it should be noted that we only used the adult antisocial item scores from the PDQ-4. The clinical diagnosis of PDQ-4 ASPD requires the endorsement of at least three CD items plus at least three additional adult ASPD items. Therefore, restricting our measure of ASPD to only the adult PDQ-4 items may have rendered this measure less sensitive than measures of ASPD employed by other investigators. However, consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881113477708">Moeller and colleagues (2002)</xref> we did find IVE impulsiveness to be negatively correlated with fear EFE recognition accuracy. We also observed IVE impulsiveness to be highly positively correlated with CD and ASPD scores and, as hypothesized, CD scores were also a significant covariate for fear EFE recognition accuracy.</p>
<p>The PDQ-4 definition of CD requires ‘evidence of CD with onset before age 15 years.’ This is potentially relevant to the etiology of the fear recognition deficit in the present cocaine users since all but one of them reported initiating cocaine use after the age of 15 years. Thus, if CD specifically predisposed later cocaine use this might explain the selective deficit in fear recognition ability. However, although CD score was positively correlated with frequency of ecstasy use, it was not correlated with the extent of use of cocaine or any other illicit drug. Thus, in agreement with earlier reports (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881113477708">Kessler et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269881113477708">Regier et al., 1990</xref>), it would appear that CD (the developmental precursor of ASPD), is more likely to predispose a more general elevated risk of illicit drug and other substance abuse.</p>
<p>There was a significant group by gender interaction for fear recognition which was attributable to the female cocaine-naïve participants exhibiting relatively poor fear recognition compared to their male cocaine-naïve counterparts. Furthermore, although the group difference in fear recognition accuracy remained statistically significant when the male participant data was analyzed independently this was not the case for the female data. However, in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881113477708">Kemmis et al., 2007</xref>), we found that the group difference in fear recognition remained significant when both the male and female data were analyzed independently which suggests that this might simply reflect the smaller sample of females in the present study. Nevertheless, the significant group by gender interaction for fear recognition should be subject to further investigation.</p>
<p>Participants who made errors recognizing fearful facial expressions in the present study tended to confuse fear with surprise. This tendency was associated with the extent of cocaine use and is consistent with reports of EFE performance in healthy controls (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269881113477708">Adolphs, 2002</xref>). We observed a positive correlation between frequency of cocaine use and surprise recognition accuracy which suggests that the selective deficit in fear recognition ability, after treating impulsiveness and CD as covariates, could perhaps be more accurately viewed as a bias towards mistaking fear for surprise which increases as a function of the frequency of recreational cocaine use.</p>
<p>Our hypothesis that ASPD and CD might be significant covariates for impaired fear recognition ability in cocaine users was based on evidence that psychopaths exhibit impaired recognition of fear and sadness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881113477708">Blair 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881113477708">Blair, 2003</xref>) and that cocaine addicts with CD exhibit reduced cortisol responsivity to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269881113477708">Buydens-Branchey and Branchey, 2004</xref>). Since we published our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881113477708">Kemmis et al., 2007</xref>), the latter evidence has been corroborated by reports that psychopaths exhibit selective deficits in identifying fearful EFEs of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881113477708">Marsh and Blair, 2008</xref>), and that children and adolescents with psychopathic traits experience less subjective fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881113477708">Marsh et al., 2011</xref>). This suggests that the selective deficit in fear recognition ability that we observed in regular cocaine users could also reflect a deficit in the ability to experience fear. If so, this would be consistent with reports that healthy volunteers under the influence of diazepam displayed impaired fear recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269881113477708">Zangara et al., 2002</xref>) and that anxious individuals exhibit better fear recognition ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269881113477708">Surcinelli et al., 2006</xref>). It would also suggest that cocaine users are less likely to be motivated by clinical interventions based on negative reinforcement.</p>
<p>The existence of a residual selective deficit in the fear recognition ability of regular recreational cocaine users, after controlling for impulsiveness and CD, leaves open the possibility that frequent cocaine use plays a causal role in the etiology of the phenomenon. In our earlier report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881113477708">Kemmis et al., 2007</xref>), we speculated that that repeated exposure to cocaine might disrupt the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Subsequently it has become apparent that repeated exposure to cocaine promotes prolonged epigenetic alterations in the nucleus accumbens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269881113477708">Renthal and Nestler, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269881113477708">Moreno-Lopez and colleagues (2012)</xref> recently reported that cocaine-dependent individuals had lower gray matter volumes than controls in specific cortical and sub-cortical regions. These reports suggest that there may be a neural basis for the present findings. Clearly, however, since the present study employed a cross-sectional design, the present data set does not allow us to draw any firm conclusions regarding the etiology of the residual fear recognition deficits in regular cocaine users after controlling for impulsiveness and CD.</p>
<p>Another limitation was that we did not employ biochemical assays to fully validate self-reported drug histories. However, we have previously found that oral serum assays corroborated recent self-reported drug use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269881113477708">Pirona and Morgan, 2010</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269881113477708">Thomasius and colleagues (2003)</xref> reported 95% concordance between self-reported longer-term drug use and the results of hair analyses. Other limitations included the possible contribution of the residual effects of cocaine and the possibility that the deficient fear recognition that we observed in the group of regular cocaine users might reflect a more general cognitive deficit. However, if the latter was true then the observed fear recognition impairment would be expected to also be associated with more general impairments of other aspects of EFE performance which we did not observe. Furthermore, we excluded all regular users who had taken cocaine within three days of assessment so it would appear unlikely that the phenomenon was attributable to the sub-acute effects of recent cocaine use.</p>
<p>The present findings provide the basis for a number of directions for future research including: the use of imaging methods to compare the performance of regular recreational cocaine users, cocaine dependent users, adult psychopaths and amygdala-lesioned participants with the EFE task. It would also be interesting to determine the acute and sub-acute effects of cocaine on fear recognition and explore other potential similarities between regular cocaine users, CD and psychopathic individuals (e.g. their ability to experience subjective fear and to show fear conditioning). Finally, prospective longitudinal studies are required to further explore the etiology of the selective fear recognition deficit observed in regular cocaine users.</p>
<p>In summary, the present findings suggest that, although elevated impulsiveness and CD before the age of 15 years may predispose individuals to express a selective deficit in the ability to recognize facial expressions of fear in adulthood, the subsequent recreational use of cocaine represents an additional factor specifically associated with selective deficits in fear recognition.</p>
