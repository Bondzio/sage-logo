<body>
<p>Since first published in 1999, the Cochrane review of patient decision aids (PtDAs) for people facing health treatment and screening decisions has reported that PtDAs improve patients’ knowledge, enhance their accurate perception of risks, help patients achieve choices that match their values, and stimulate patients to be more actively involved in decision making.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272989X12443311">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272989X12443311"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272989X12443311">3</xref></sup> PtDAs are video- (or DVD-) based, paper-based, or Web-based resources that provide information on options, their benefits, and their harms and implicitly help patients determine their values for outcomes of options. They are intended to be used by patients as an adjunct to consultation with a health care professional.</p>
<p>Although some trials of PtDAs have included decision coaching, little is known about the contribution of decision coaching. Decision coaching aims to develop patients’ confidence and skills in deliberating about options and helps prepare patients to discuss decisions with their practitioner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272989X12443311">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272989X12443311">5</xref></sup> Decision coaching refers to the process by which a supportive and knowledgeable health professional provides a patient with individualized, nondirective guidance to meet decision-making needs in preparation for consultation with the person responsible for ultimately sharing the decision with the patient. The decision coach role has also been referred to as a decision counselor, decision educator, facilitator, and knowledge broker.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272989X12443311">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272989X12443311"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272989X12443311"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272989X12443311">7</xref></sup> Specific behaviors for decision coaching include a) assessing patients’ decision-making needs (e.g., decisional conflict and related modifiable deficits in knowledge, values clarity, and support/resources); b) providing information on options, benefits, and harms; c) verifying patients’ understanding of their options; d) clarifying and discussing patients’ values about the outcomes of options; e) building skills in deliberating, communicating preferences, and accessing support; f) monitoring and facilitating progress in decision making; and g) screening for implementation needs. Decision coaching can occur face to face or through communication technologies such as the telephone. Decision coaches may also provide PtDAs as the key source for information on the options, benefits, and harms.</p>
<p>Compared with untrained practitioners, potential advantages of decision coaches include less demand on the person responsible for ultimately sharing the option with the patient, efficient delivery of patient-centered counseling, and provision of higher quality decision counseling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272989X12443311">7</xref></sup> However, decision coaches, who are independent of the health care team, may lack contextual clinical expertise and may be less effective when their services are not coordinated with the practitioner’s role. Furthermore, decision coaching may not be a reimbursable service in some health plans, which can affect uptake of the role. Ideally, having someone from within the interprofessional health care team prepared to assume the decision coaching role has the potential to overcome some of these disadvantages by being more integrated, sharing the workload, more fully using expertise across the team, and allowing the patients’ practitioners to reinforce the skills their patients acquire through coaching.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12443311">8</xref></sup> However, little is known about the effectiveness of the decision coach role.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272989X12443311">2</xref></sup> Given current and emerging legislation to implement shared decision making and PtDAs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272989X12443311">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272989X12443311"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272989X12443311">11</xref></sup> it is important to determine the effect of decision coaching.</p>
<p>The purpose of this systematic review was to explore the characteristics and effectiveness of decision coaching evaluated within trials of PtDAs for people making screening or treatment decisions. Specific questions included these: 1) What decision coaching behaviors, length of time, and individuals were used? 2) How did decision coaching affect the attributes (quality) of the decision and decision-making process compared with usual care or alternate interventions? 3) Were there changes in the patients’ behaviors, health outcomes, or health system outcomes when patients were exposed to decision coaching?</p>
<sec id="section1-0272989X12443311" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Given that decision coaching is often used alongside PtDAs and that it is difficult to narrow down the concept of decision coaching in the literature, a reasonable first step was to conduct this review as a subanalysis of the Cochrane Review of Decision Aids for People Facing Health Treatment or Screening Decisions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272989X12443311">2</xref></sup> This updated review includes citations from the start of each database (MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, PsycINFO) to December 2009 and to September 2008 for CINAHL.</p>
<p>A detailed description of the methods can be found in the full review available in the Cochrane Library.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272989X12443311">2</xref></sup> For this subanalysis review, 3 reviewers (JK, DS, SM) independently screened all included trials by first examining the table of characteristics of trials included in the full Cochrane Review and subsequently reviewing the full text of potentially relevant trials. Eligible trials for this subanalysis review needed to have measured the effects of decision coaching compared with another intervention or usual care. Therefore, eligible comparisons were a) coaching v. usual care; b) coaching plus PtDA v. usual care; c) coaching v. PtDA; and d) coaching plus PtDA v. PtDA alone. Eligible trials also described decision coaching provided by a health care professional who was not the person responsible for ultimately sharing the decision with the patient. Two reviewers independently extracted data from the trials. For decision coaching behaviors, 5 authors independently coded the data (DS, CB, MAM, JK, SM). Disagreements were resolved by discussion to reach consensus.</p>
<p>Data were entered into an Excel database. Data synthesis was guided by the research questions and reported descriptively. Similar to the Cochrane Review,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272989X12443311">2</xref></sup> the primary outcomes for this subanalysis focused on the effectiveness criteria of the IPDAS Collaboration: attributes or quality of the decision (e.g., knowledge, match between values and choice) and attributes of the decision-making process (e.g., participation in decision making, satisfaction, decisional conflict).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272989X12443311">12</xref></sup> The effects on behaviors (e.g., actual choice, adherence), health, and health systems were considered secondary outcomes. Given the small number of trials meeting the criteria for inclusion on this subanalysis, meta-analysis was not conducted and no trials were excluded based on quality.</p>

<title>Characteristics of the Coaching Intervention</title>
<p>Characteristics of the decision coaching interventions are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0272989X12443311">Table 2</xref>. Specific terms used to describe the decision coaching included counseling, consultation, preference-elicitation interview, planning talk, coached-care, empowerment, and decision education session. Decision coaching was provided to patients by pharmacists, genetic counselors, nurses, physicians, psychologists, or health educators in preparation for their consultation with practitioners in specialty care (<italic>n</italic> = 7), primary care (<italic>n</italic> = 2), or the community (<italic>n</italic> = 1). The length of time for the coaching intervention reported in 7 trials was a median of 45 minutes (range, 20–270 minutes).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aim of this review was to explore the characteristics and effectiveness of decision coaching when evaluated within trials of PtDAs. Ten trials evaluated the effect of decision coaching in contrast with other interventions and/or usual care. Compared with usual care, decision coaching with or without a PtDA consistently improved knowledge. However, the improvement in knowledge observed in those exposed to coaching was similar to that observed in those exposed to a PtDA alone. For all other outcomes measured, there were variable results, with some trials showing positive effects and other trials reporting no difference between interventions with coaching and comparisons. Reassuringly, coaching did not produce worse outcomes compared with alternate interventions.</p>
<p>Three trials with the largest effects compared coaching with or without a PtDA to usual care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0272989X12443311">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0272989X12443311">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0272989X12443311">26</xref></sup> Although the largest trial found that women exposed to decision coaching plus the PtDA were more satisfied with the decision-making process, reported fewer physical limitations to lifestyle activities, and had lower hysterectomy rates compared with usual care, the PtDA alone showed similar benefits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0272989X12443311">26</xref></sup> However, the addition of coaching further enhanced its cost-effectiveness. The second trial showed that patients exposed to coaching plus PtDA had improved knowledge, higher level of participation in the decision making, and increased uptake of psychoeducational interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0272989X12443311">25</xref></sup> The third trial showed significant improvements in knowledge for those receiving coaching compared with usual care, and no other outcomes were measured.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0272989X12443311">19</xref></sup> For all 3 of these positive trials, the coaching interventions included 3 key behaviors: information on the options, benefits, and harms; explicit values clarification; and facilitation of progress in decision making. Notably, the trial that did not report any improved outcomes with decision coaching compared with usual care did not provide values clarification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0272989X12443311">21</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section22-0272989X12443311">
<title>Taxonomy of Decision Coaching</title>
<p>A variety of terms were used for the intervention that we have described as coaching, and, overall, limited information was provided about the intervention. Decision coaches in these trials were health professionals who provided information on options and facilitated progress in decision making in preparation for discussion with the practitioner who would ultimately be responsible for making the decision with the patient. As well, many decision coaches also explicitly helped patients clarify their values and build their skills in deliberating and/or communicating their preferences with others. The set of coaching behaviors used in this review were based on several descriptions of decision coaching in the literature and/or conceptual frameworks that include the concept of decision coaching.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272989X12443311">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272989X12443311"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272989X12443311"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272989X12443311">7</xref></sup> Achieving agreement on behaviors of decision coaching and a standardized reporting would facilitate making comparisons across trials. In particular, it would be helpful to identify the effectiveness of the components of the intervention that could be attributed to the PtDA v. unique to the coach. Having more consistently reported details about the patient characteristics such as education and the intervention including information on implementation and training may also illuminate the mechanism by which decision coaching has its effect.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0272989X12443311">
<title>Decision Coaching Includes PtDAs</title>
<p>Although PtDAs were designed to be used as an adjunct to practitioner consultation, most have been evaluated in randomized controlled trials to determine their effectiveness without attention to implementation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0272989X12443311">31</xref></sup> With an increasing focus on use of PtDAs across health systems, it is becoming apparent that someone needs to take responsibility for their implementation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0272989X12443311">32</xref></sup> Decision coaching by someone within the health care team is one strategy for ensuring that relevant PtDAs are provided to and subsequently discussed with patients. For specialty areas, decision coaching may encompass a more focused and/or limited set of typical decisions faced by that patient population, whereas in a generalist practice such as primary care, the decision coach may be faced with myriad decisions. In both situations, the role involves identifying patients requiring help with decision making, guiding patients in the process of decision making, and tapping into evidence-based information resources such as PtDAs as necessary. In both of these situations, it appears that the decision coach role should be embedded within the team and articulated in a way to best meet the decision making needs of the patient population being served by that team.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272989X12443311">7</xref></sup> PtDAs seem to have a similar impact on improving knowledge compared with decision coaching, whereas coaching appears to provide additional contribution to decision making as a social process in clarifying and discussing values, verifying understanding, and facilitating progress in decision making.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0272989X12443311">
<title>Coaching to Clarify Values</title>
<p>Explicit values clarification is considered an important ingredient for effective interventions to support patients preparing to make decisions with their health care team.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272989X12443311">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0272989X12443311">33</xref></sup> Values clarification can be delivered either in the PtDA or through decision coaching. One trial that compared PtDA to coaching had similar behaviors in both interventions (e.g., information on options, explicit values clarification, facilitate progress in decision making).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0272989X12443311">24</xref></sup> This trial reported that couples were more satisfied with coaching but had no difference in knowledge (because similar information was provided to both groups), decisional conflict, uptake of prenatal screening, or pregnancy outcomes. Two other trials compared coaching interventions that included explicit values clarification to PtDA without explicit values clarification and reported the combined intervention was more cost-effective,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0272989X12443311">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0272989X12443311">30</xref></sup> improved values-choice agreement, and decreased decisional conflict.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272989X12443311">17</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0272989X12443311">
<title>Coaching to Improve Patient Experience</title>
<p>Interestingly, among 4 trials that compared decision coaching alone to a PtDA alone, 1 of 2 trials that measured satisfaction demonstrated that participants were more satisfied with the decision-making process when exposed to a decision coach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0272989X12443311">24</xref></sup> Although improving the patient experience with health care is of great interest to policy makers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0272989X12443311">34</xref></sup> it is unlikely that patient satisfaction alone will sway policy makers and administrators to include this option given that there were similar improvements in knowledge and reduction in decisional conflict across all groups. A recent report summarizing cost drivers in health care indicates that a substantial proportion of health care expenditures may be related to the use of expensive technologies, changes in chronic illness patterns, and patient actions and preferences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0272989X12443311">35</xref></sup> This is consistent with the current review, which revealed that only 1 trial examined cost implications of decision coaching as an intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0272989X12443311">26</xref></sup> Hence, researchers are challenged to identify which patients and families would benefit most to justify the added cost of individualized sessions to improve decision making and/or to find ways to incorporate the coaching role into current health services. Further research is also required to better determine what types of decision support interventions are required for what types of patients and/or health situations in order to improve health outcomes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0272989X12443311">
<title>Positioning Decision Coaches in Relation to the Team</title>
<p>Decision coaches within these trials have been independent of the health care team and as such were evaluated as part of the trial intervention rather than usual practices. Woolf and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272989X12443311">7</xref></sup> describe decision coaches who are not integrated into the health care team as being more limited in supporting patient decision making. Having the decision coach role exist as a parallel resource for patients, rather than as an inherent part of the care team, could exacerbate fragmentation of care and create an additional level of activity that requires extra resources and co-ordination. Légaré and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12443311">8</xref></sup> put forth an Interprofessional Shared Decision Making (IP-SDM) conceptual model that makes explicit the decision coach role within the interprofessional team. This role is described as facilitating progress through deliberation by making explicit the decision, exchanging information on options and their outcomes, discussing values, considering feasibility of implementing options, and arriving at a decision to be implemented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12443311">8</xref></sup> Emerging evidence in a broader decision-making framework, such as the IP-SDM, may lend support for the role of decision coaching and additional behaviors included in the role. Further investigation into the economics of decision making and long-term outcomes is required.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-0272989X12443311">
<title>Decision Coaching for More Disadvantaged Populations</title>
<p>There is limited evidence about the effect of PtDAs and/or decision coaching on the very sick, children, the very old, individuals who have the most difficulty accessing health care, or those of lower socioeconomic status, lower numeracy, or lower literacy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272989X12443311">2</xref></sup> Particularly for these groups of individuals, decision coaching may prove more responsive to diverse needs than PtDAs alone (typically paper-based and/or available on the Internet),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0272989X12443311">36</xref></sup> which may not be flexible enough to help individuals with more complex needs or individuals faced with complex, multioption, multiattribute decisions. However, given the resource intensiveness of decision coaching, further evaluation is required to determine when and for whom it is indicated, as well as whether decision coaching or PtDAs are better approaches for delivering specific elements of interventions necessary to support patient participation in decision making. This type of evidence would assist health policy leaders in determining the level of improvement that would be necessary to warrant additional upfront health care costs that might arise from the implementation of decision coaching with select populations. Alternatively, the role of decision coaching could be assumed by a health care professional such as the nurse, pharmacist, or psychologist on the team.</p>

<sec id="section28-0272989X12443311">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Four main limitations to this review are related to conducting a subanalysis of a systematic review, the methodological quality of included trials, the small number of trials available, and the minimal descriptions of the decision coaching interventions. Given that we conducted a subanalysis of an existing systematic review, we constrained this review to the search strategy and underlying methods used in the review of PtDAs evaluated in randomized controlled trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272989X12443311">2</xref></sup> Therefore, this review did not include any trials of decision coaching without having a PtDA within at least 1 arm in the study. The rationale for this limited focus was the need to explore how decision coaching was being operationalized, to understand the concepts being used, and to consider undertaking a more in-depth review to determine the effectiveness of decision coaching.</p>
<p>In addition to low quality ratings of the 10 trials included in this review due to lack of blinding, the inadequate reporting about follow-up of participants may have resulted in an overestimate of the effect. Although 3 included trials predate 1997 and may bring into question their relevance to current health care systems, the goal was to transparently present the current state of knowledge about decision coaching such that readers could judge their relevance. However, the single trial that was published in 2002 and scored highest on methodological quality had the largest number of participants, and its findings were consistent with outcomes found in this review.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0272989X12443311">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Unfortunately, with a limited number of included trials, there was inadequate power to conduct analyses focused on the decision contexts, behaviors included within decision coaching, and the targeted outcomes. Interestingly, only 3 of the 10 trials conducted power calculations, and these were conducted on decisional conflict as an attribute of the decision-making process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0272989X12443311">21</xref></sup> and secondary outcomes of health outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0272989X12443311">26</xref></sup> and uptake of the choice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0272989X12443311">22</xref></sup> (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0272989X12443311">Table 3</xref>). As trials accrue this may be possible and will be facilitated by careful description of the decision coaching interventions that are needed by future trialists. Furthermore, subsequent evaluation of the decision coaching intervention needs to be more explicit about the training programs and the quality of the decision coaching provided. Although trials evaluating training to enhance skills in decision coaching have reported improvements in the provision of decision coaching to simulated patients compared with controls,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0272989X12443311">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0272989X12443311">38</xref></sup> the effect of these training programs on patient outcomes has not been evaluated. Finally, a concept analysis of decision coaching would better inform the design of instruments for measuring the interaction between a decision coach and patient.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Although this review is limited to 10 trials, the evidence it provides indicates a growing interest in decision coaching and can help to inform decisions about the role of decision coaching in trials to evaluate PtDAs. Our findings clearly highlight areas needing further research. Decision coaching to prepare patients for participating in decision making related to their clinical care has been provided by a range of health care professionals in various health care settings. Decision coaching appears to improve knowledge when compared with usual care, and knowledge is considered an important yet partial element of a quality decision.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272989X12443311">12</xref></sup> The impact on values-choice agreement, another important element of decision quality, has not been established. Notably improvement in knowledge was similar when coaching was compared with PtDA alone. Therefore, decision coaching may be a reasonable strategy to consider for improving knowledge when a specific PtDA is not available.</p>
<p>Although no negative effects were reported to be linked to decision coaching, additional positive outcomes varied across the trials. Therefore, further research is needed to develop a better understanding of the contribution of decision coaching to the quality of the decision, the quality of the decision-making process, and other outcomes including impact on health status and health services. As well, research is required to determine the cost-effectiveness of decision coaching and to determine the opportunity costs of decision coaching above those for PtDAs. Further evaluation is required to determine whether decision coaching being assumed by a member of the team is better or worse than coaching by a third party. Notwithstanding that there are many unanswered questions about the effectiveness of decision coaching that require further research, decision coaching does not appear to negatively affect patient participation in health care decisions.</p>
