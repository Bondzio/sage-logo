<p>The Book of Lamentations is grief unvarnished. Like fingernails screeching across a chalkboard, its cry pierces God’s inexplicable silence in the face of suffering and loss. “Look and see,” the speaker says, “if there is any sorrow like my sorrow” (1:12). The major essays in this issue respond to this challenge.</p>
<p>Erhard Gerstenbger summarizes major literary and theological features of these “elusive lamentations,” asking, “What are they about?” Gerstenberger demonstrates how and why texts like Lamentations both “preserve the collective memories of ‘real’ . . . catastrophes [and provide] a therapeutic means to overcome historical trauma.”</p>
<p>Carleen Mandolfo and Beau Harris show why Lamentations requires us to develop a “theology of God’s silence.” God’s silence occupies “negative spaces” in the book that map a torturous journey in the midst of profound suffering. Why is God silent in Lamentations? The authors explore a range of possible answers, from Zion’s offense to God’s own bafflement. They conclude that a theology of God’s silence “requires deep sensitivity and respect for the pained voices calling out to us from the text, from our own world, and from our future generations in order to better understand what we might learn even and especially when God is silent.”</p>
<p>“Far too many cities have cried out, ‘O Lord, look at my affliction, for the enemy has triumphed’ ” (Lam 1:9). Dianne Bergant notes that Daughter Zion’s first words,<italic>’êkāh</italic> (Lam 1:1) are a “gasp of desperation” that does not end in hope. Instead, the book lingers on Zion’s profound experience of desolation. Has God surrendered mercy to wrath? Bergant directs our attention to the center of the book, where she finds a faint but resilient hope: “The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases . . . therefore I will hope in him” (Lam 3:22, 24).</p>
<p>Nancy Lee puts Lamentations into conversation with contemporary Syrian traditions of laments, which articulate both “polemic against” the abusive power of President Assad’s regime and “polemic for compassion, justice, limiting violence, and the common good of all.” If we heed dissident Syrian poets like Hala Mohammad, what might we learn about the role of lament in socio-political upheavals? Lee urges us to the task: “the irrepressible ‘living’ lamenting, which like a rushing stream finds its way to the sea of peoples struggling,” demands nothing less.</p>
<p>“Lamentations is adult-only material,” Kandy Queen-Sutherland says. If preachers and teachers are to deal with it honestly, they must resist the temptation to jump prematurely to an “all’s-well-that-ends-well” resolution. For those who search for a word from God but do not find it, gilded promises are “a form of abuse.” Queen-Sutherland ends with a sharp question:</p>
<p>There is nothing easy about teaching and preaching Lamentations. There never is when the context is suffering and the cause is thought to be God. The voices of Lamentations call God out. If God is falsely accused, then God deserves a witness. God needs a way out, and if God chooses to remain silent . . . can God get a witness?</p>
