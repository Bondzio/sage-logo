<abstract>
<p>Methylation is a ubiquitous covalent modification used to control the function of diverse biomolecules including hormones, neurotransmitters, xenobiotics, proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids. Histone methyltransferases (HMTs) are currently of high interest as drug targets because of their role in epigenetic regulation; however, most HMT assay methods are either not amenable to a high-throughput screening (HTS) environment or are applicable to a limited number of enzymes. The authors developed a generic methyltransferase assay method using fluorescent immunodetection of adenosine monophosphate (AMP), which is formed from the MT reaction product S-adenosylhomocysteine in a dual-enzyme coupling step. The detection range of the assay; its suitability for HTS, including stability of reagents following dispensing and after addition to reactions; and the potential for interference from drug-like molecules was investigated. In addition, the use of the assay for measuring inhibitor potencies with peptide or intact protein substrates was examined through pilot screening with selected reference enzymes including HMT G9a. By combining a novel enzymatic coupling step with the well-characterized Transcreener AMP/GMP assay, the authors have developed a robust HTS assay for HMTs that should be broadly applicable to other types of methyltransferases as well.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Methyltransferases are a diverse family of enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to amino, thiol, or hydroxyl groups of acceptor molecules, generating S-adenosyl-homocysteine (SAH) as a by-product. Acceptor substrates include endogenous and xenobiotic small molecules,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087057111421624">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087057111421624">2</xref></sup> proteins,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087057111421624">3</xref></sup> DNA,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087057111421624">4</xref></sup> and RNA,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087057111421624">5</xref></sup> and lipids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087057111421624">6</xref></sup> Their role in epigenetic regulation includes methylation of histones at lysine and arginine residues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087057111421624">7</xref></sup> and methylation of DNA at cytosines in hemimethylated CpG sites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087057111421624">8</xref></sup> There are more than 50 protein lysine methyltransferases (PKMTs) in humans, at least 10 protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs), and 2 DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087057111421624">9</xref></sup> Together, these enzymes play a critical role in the dynamic modification of chromatin, and they are increasingly being targeted for cancer and other diseases with an epigenetic component.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087057111421624">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087057111421624">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087057111421624">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Assay methods for methyltransferases rely on either detection of the methylated product or detection of SAH.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087057111421624">9</xref></sup> Filter- or flash plate–based radioassays using <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087057111421624">3</xref></sup>H-SAM to generate <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087057111421624">3</xref></sup>H-methylated products<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1087057111421624">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087057111421624">12</xref></sup> are the most quantitative and reliable methods; however, the associated regulatory and disposal costs are a liability for high-throughput screening (HTS). Immunoassays for methylated lysine, arginine, and cytosine have been used for both PKMT and DNMT enzyme assays, either in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) format or in a homogenous format such as time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087057111421624">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087057111421624">14</xref></sup> Antibody selectivity is critical for this approach and can limit the utility of the assay. For instance, some histone methyltransferases can generate both mono- and dimethylated lysine products, and the known antibodies do not recognize both forms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087057111421624">9</xref></sup> Assays based on enzymatic cleavage (or protection) of products have been applied to both PKMTs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087057111421624">15</xref></sup> and DNMTs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087057111421624">16</xref></sup> using methylation state–dependent restriction enzymes or endoproteinase Lys C, which are unable to cleave at methylated lysine residues. Although application of this approach has generally relied on a solid-phase method such as ELISA, or a separation step, a more HTS-friendly fluorescence dequenching configuration was recently developed for DNMT1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087057111421624">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Detection of SAH formation has the advantage of providing universal detection of MT enzymes regardless of the acceptor substrate or the mix of methylated reaction products. Several coupled enzyme assays have been deployed for SAH detection. For instance, SAH can be converted to homocysteine and adenosine using SAH hydrolase, and homocysteine is then detected using covalent reaction with a thiol-sensitive fluor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087057111421624">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087057111421624">18</xref></sup> Alternatively, the adenine portion of SAH can be converted to urate by the sequential action of three coupling enzymes, with coproduction of hydrogen peroxide in the final step.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087057111421624">19</xref></sup> Hydrogen peroxide can be detected colorimetrically or fluorescently, via formation of resorufin. Recently, a luciferase-based coupled assay was developed that relies on the sequential conversion of SAH to adenine, adenosine monophosphate (AMP), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), with the final step catalyzed by pyruvate phosphate dikinase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087057111421624">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>BellBrook has developed a line of HTS assays, called Transcreener, that use highly specific immunodetection of nucleotide reaction products with homogenous fluorescent readouts including fluorescence polarization (FP), time-resolved fluorescence, and fluorescence intensity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087057111421624">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1087057111421624">25</xref></sup> Direct immunodetection of SAH would be advantageous as it would eliminate the potential for compound interference with coupling enzymes; however, it requires an antibody that specifically binds SAH in the presence of excess SAM, that is, that differentiates on the basis of a single methyl group. Although we have produced polyclonal antibodies in rabbits with more than 100-fold selectivity for SAH versus SAM (data not shown), we have been unable to produce sufficient quantities of high-titer antibodies to support commercialization of an HTS assay kit. There is one literature report of an FP-based methyltransferase assay using an anti-SAH antibody from a diagnostic assay kit for homocysteine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087057111421624">26</xref></sup> However, we and others have been unable to obtain the antibody from the commercial suppliers.</p>
<p>To overcome this hurdle, we used two coupling enzymes, SAH hydrolase and adenosine kinase, to convert the SAH consecutively to adenosine and AMP. The AMP can be measured with nanomolar sensitivity using an existing Transcreener monoclonal antibody and tracer with negligible cross-reactivity with the other nucleotides present, SAM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1087057111421624">25</xref></sup> and dGTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1087057111421624"><bold>Fig. 1</bold></xref>). We optimized the assay components for measuring methyltransferase initial velocity using initial SAM concentrations ranging from 0.20 µM to 50 µM and tested reagent and signal stability and interference from drug molecules. We next showed that the assay could be used to detect histone methyltransferases and DNA methyltransferases and examined the response to known inhibitors. Last, we performed a pilot screen of 8800 small molecules with HMT G9a in 1536-well format. The results show that combining coupling enzymes for conversion of SAH with the Transcreener AMP/GMP assay provides a robust, HTS-compatible approach for screening methyltransferases.</p>

<p>The monoclonal antibody and Alexa Fluor633 tracer for immunodetection of AMP were developed at BellBrook Labs (Madison, WI). Alexa Fluor633 succinimidyl ester used was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) and conjugated to AMP. The Tocriscreen Mini compound library was from Tocris Bioscience (Ellisville, MO). SAM was obtained from AK Scientific (Mountain View, CA). SAH, AMP, and other nucleotides were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Buffer components were purchased from Sigma or Fisher Scientific (Hampton, NH). All methyltransferases were recombinant human proteins with an N-terminal GST tag. G9a HMT, SUV39H1 HMT, DNMT1 MT, and DNMT3a MT were purchased from BPS Biosciences (San Diego, CA), and Set7/Set9 HMT was from Prospec Protein Specialists (Ness-Ziona, Israel). G9a (amino acids 785–1210) was expressed using <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (specific activity = 146 pmol/min/mg) and baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells (specific activity = 10 pmol/min/mg).

<p>Assay development was carried out using mock reactions containing SAM and SAH at ratios representing quenched MT enzyme reactions. Mock reactions were run similarly to endpoint enzymatic reactions (i.e., with the inclusion of a quench step prior to addition of detection reagents). SAM/SAH mixtures were added to wells at the indicated concentrations in 10 µL of HMT buffer (50 mM Tris, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 mM DTT, pH 8.5), followed by addition of 5 µL of HMT Stop Buffer (400 mM MES, 1 M NaCl, and 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, pH of 6.0) and by 5 µL of Detection Mix (40 mM HEPES, 0.04% Brij-35, 16 nM Alexa Fluor633 AMP tracer, and AMP antibody as indicated, pH 7.25). Unless otherwise indicated, final read conditions were 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), 12.5 mM Tris (pH 8.5), 100 mM MES (pH 6.0), 250 mM NaCl, MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM DTT, 250 µM cofactor, 0.01% Brij-35, 4 nM tracer, 2 ng/µL SAH hydrolase, 5 ng/µL adenosine kinase and antibody.</p>

<sec id="section7-1087057111421624">
<title>Coupling enzymes</title>
<p>The two coupling enzymes, SAH hydrolase and adenosine kinase, were first tested separately for each of the two steps in the conversion of SAH to AMP and then tested together in a matrix fashion to determine the relative amounts of each to use in the assay. Enzymes from different commercial sources as well as enzymes produced in house were tested. An FP-based immunoassay for the disappearance of SAH was used to monitor SAH hydrolase (BellBrook Labs, unpublished data), and AMP immunodetection was used to monitor the adenosine kinase. A recombinant human SAH hydrolase and a recombinant human adenosine kinase were selected for use in the assay; both are available from commercial sources. The final SAH hydrolase and adenosine kinase concentrations used for the assay were 2.5-fold and 100-fold in excess of what was required for a maximal signal in mock reactions representing initial velocity MT reactions with initial SAM concentrations ranging from 0.5 µM to 100 µM.</p>

<sec id="section8-1087057111421624">
<title>Antibody optimization</title>
<p>In a competitive immunoassay with antibody in excess, the antibody concentration determines the dynamic range of the assay. The optimal amount of AMP antibody was determined by titrating it in two-fold dilutions into mock reactions representing 20% conversion of initial SAM concentrations of 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, 10, 50, and 100 µM (e.g., 0.2 µM SAH/0.8 µM SAM for the 1.0 µM initial SAM reaction), and polarization values were determined relative to control reactions with only SAM present (the equivalent of no-enzyme controls). Antibody concentrations of 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10 µg/mL, respectively, were selected as optimal for initial velocity reactions with SAM concentrations of &lt;1, 1 to 4 µM, 5 to 9 µM, 10 to 24 µM, and 25 to 50 µM.</p>

<title>SAM/SAH standard curves</title>
<p>Mock reactions mimicking enzymatic conversion (0, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, etc, . . . 100%) of SAM to SAH were dispensed into wells in 10 µL of HMT buffer, followed by the addition of 5 µL of Stop Buffer and 5 µL of Detection Mix as described above. For each standard curve, the total (SAM + SAH) remained constant at 0.20, 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, 10, or 50 µM, representing the initial SAM concentrations in MT enzyme reactions, and antibody was present at the optimal concentrations for each SAM concentration as determined above. Polarization was measured after 1 h at ambient temperature. The data were plotted as ΔmP versus %SAM conversion using four-parameter nonlinear regression curve fitting. ΔmP = mP<sub>initial [SAM]</sub> – mP<sub>sample</sub>. Z′ values were calculated using replicates of either 12 or 24 for each standard point.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087057111421624">27</xref></sup></p>

<title>Reagent and signal stability</title>
<p>To determine the equilibration time following addition of detection reagents and the stability of the signal, a 10 µM SAM/SAH standard curve (<italic>n</italic> = 12) was prepared as described above, and the FP signal was read periodically. To assess the stability of the SAH Detection Mixture prior to dispensing, 10 µM SAM/SAH standard curves were prepared periodically using Detection Mix that had been stored at room temperature for up to 48 h and freshly prepared SAM/SAH mock reactions. Reactions were allowed to equilibrate for 90 min prior to reading.</p>

<title>Compound interference screen</title>
<p>The potential for interference of drug molecules was assessed by screening the Tocriscreen Mini compound library (1120 compounds) in triplicate mock reactions representing 4% conversion of 10 µM SAM (9.6 µM SAM/0.4 µM SAH). Mock reactions were added to compound wells for a final concentration of 10 µM compound, 1% DMSO in 10 µL HMT buffer, followed by addition of 5 µL of Stop Buffer and 5 µL of Detection Mix. Reactions were allowed to equilibrate for 90 min prior to reading. Control reactions representing 0%, 4%, and 100% SAM conversion with no compound were included on each plate (<italic>n</italic> = 16).

<title>Enzyme and inhibitor studies</title>
<p>The protocol used for enzyme assays was identical to that used for mock reactions. MT enzyme reactions (10 µL) were incubated at room temperature for the indicated time followed by addition of 5 µL Stop Buffer and 5 µL Detection Mix, and plates were read following a 90-min equilibration period. The period between addition of Stop Buffer and Detection Mix was not carefully controlled but generally was within 1 h. HMT buffer (50 mM Tris, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 mM DTT, pH 8.5) was used for HMTs G9a, Set7/Set9, and SUV39H1, and DNMT buffer (50 mM Tris, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) was used for DNMT 1 and DNMT 3A. The Stop Buffer used for HMTs was 400 mM MES, 1 M NaCl, and 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, pH of 6.0, and the same buffer with 14 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> was used to stop DNMTs. All enzymes were highly purified recombinant preparations from commercial sources (see the Materials section). A peptide representing amino acids 1 to 25 of histone H3, generally at ≥2× K<sub>m</sub>, was used for HMT reactions, except in indicated cases when full-length histone H3 was used at 1 µM. Poly d(I-C) at 5 µM was used as a substrate for DNMT reactions. SAM was generally used at a concentration at or near its reported K<sub>m</sub> for each enzyme. Reactions were initiated by the addition of SAM. Enzyme assay signal, the decrease in polarization relative to control reactions lacking enzyme, was reported as a positive value, ΔmP. For some reactions, including inhibitor studies, SAM/SAH standard curves were used to convert the polarization values to the amount of SAH formed so that accurate enzyme velocity and IC<sub>50</sub> values could be determined.</p>

<p>Using the chemical and biological reagents provided by BellBrook as described above, the assay was run in black Greiner 1536-well microplates (part no. 789176-A, Greiner, Germany). The reagents were dispensed by the Synquad (Digilab Inc., Holliston, MA) and the Multidrop Combi (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). Library compounds in 90% DMSO (50 nL of 2 mM stock for primary screening, 100 nL of serial dilutions for dose-response experiments and counterscreening) were transferred with a Hummingbird (Digilab Inc.) directly into the destination plate and incubated for 15 min at room temperature together with 2 µL of 2× concentrated enzyme (2 nM final concentration), 2× concentrated SAH (0.7 uM final concentration) for the counterscreen or buffer for controls. After addition of 2 µL of a 2× concentrated substrate mix (4 µM SAM and 4 µM H3K9 final concentration), incubation at room temperature was continued for a further 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by 2 µL of the Stop Buffer, and the AMP production was initiated with 2 µL of SAH Detection Mixture for 90 min at room temperature and in the darkness before reading the FP of the AMP-Alexa Fluor633 tracer on an Analyst GT plate reader (Molecular Devices, provided through Bucher Biotec, Basel, Switzerland) using 620 nm (40 nm bandwidth) excitation and 688 nm (45 nm bandwidth) emission settings.

<title>Coupling enzymes and cofactor</title>
<p>To show proof of concept and optimize the key detection components, we used mock reactions lacking MT enzyme and containing various ratios of SAM and SAH to mimic a completed enzyme reaction. For instance, a mock reaction representing 10% conversion of 1 µM SAM contained 0.9 µM SAM, 0.1 µM SAH, and all of the detection reagents. In general, the desired endpoint was a maximal polarization change in mock reactions representing low fractional conversion of SAM to SAH (5–20%).</p>
<p>AMP is produced in two enzymatic steps catalyzed by SAH hydrolase and adenosine kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1087057111421624"><bold>Fig. 1</bold></xref>), the second of which requires a phosphate donor. Following evaluation of several enzyme preparations, including native and recombinant, some that we cloned and expressed, we selected two for further assay development. To minimize the potential for assay interference caused by inhibition of the coupling enzymes, we chose concentrations of each of the two coupling enzymes that were well in excess of what was required for a maximal signal. Titrating adenosine kinase in the presence of all other assay components resulted in a signal plateau at 0.01 ng/µL; we chose 5 ng/µL as the final assay concentration. SAH hydrolase exhibited more of a bell-shaped response, with signal starting to level off at 0.25 ng/µL; we selected 2 ng/µL as a final concentration.</p>
<p>We tested several nucleotide triphosphates reported to serve as phosphate donors for adenosine kinase,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1087057111421624">30</xref></sup> including ATP, GTP, dGTP, and UTP for cross-reactivity with the AMP antibody and concentration dependence in the adenosine kinase reaction. We selected dGTP based on its relatively low K<sub>m</sub> and minimal cross-reactivity with the AMP antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1087057111421624"><bold>Fig. 2</bold></xref>). We then tested a range of concentrations and selected one that is approximately 100-fold over its reported K<sub>m</sub> concentration, to drive the equilibrium toward product (AMP) formation (data not shown).</p>

<title>Antibody optimization</title>
<p>In a competitive binding assay, the concentration of antibody defines the dynamic range of the assay, which is generally about two logs. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the optimal antibody concentration for detecting different ranges of analyte. We examined dependence of assay signal on antibody concentration in mock reactions representing 20% SAM conversion with a range of initial SAM concentrations. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1087057111421624"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>, increasing the total SAM/SAH concentration requires more antibody for a maximal signal. Note that the maximal assay response increases as total SAM/SAH increases up to 50 µM and then falls off. Investigation of this effect has suggested that the decrease at higher SAM concentrations is due to production of AMP from SAM, either from SAH contamination in the SAM preparation or from direct action of SAH hydrolase on SAM (data not shown). The former is more likely the predominant cause because the assay signal is quite stable once it has equilibrated (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1087057111421624"><bold>Fig. 4B</bold></xref>). Based on these results, we selected five antibody concentrations for use over initial SAH concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 50 µM. Although the assay can be used at higher or lower SAM concentrations, the assay window may not be sufficient for HTS applications.</p>

<title>Standard curves</title>
<p>Standard curves mimicking enzyme reactions were used to test the optimized reagent concentrations over a range of initial SAM concentrations. As a rule of thumb, we consider a polarization shift of 60 to 100 mP and a Z′ value of 0.5 to be indicative of robust assay performance for HTS applications. For initial SAM concentrations of 5 µM, 10 µM, and 50 µM, these criteria were achieved when less than 5% of the SAM was converted to SAH, whereas approximately 10% conversion was required at 1 µM initial SAM and 25% conversion for 0.5 µM SAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1087057111421624"><bold>Fig. 4A</bold></xref>). For instance, a Z′ value of 0.59 and a polarization shift of 74 mP was reached at 3% conversion of 5 µM SAM. At 0.20 SAM, 40% conversion, which is beyond the initial velocity region, was required to generate an assay window suitable for HTS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1087057111421624"><bold>Fig. 4A</bold></xref>), reflecting the limits of sensitivity for the AMP immunodetection component of the assay. Efforts are currently under way to increase the sensitivity of the assay by optimizing conditions for antibody binding (i.e., decreased K<sub>d</sub> for tracer and antigen), and we have observed a two- to four-fold increase by limiting the dilution resulting from addition of quenching and detection reagents and decreasing the ionic strength (BellBrook Labs, unpublished data).</p>

<title>Deck and signal stability</title>
<p>Implementation of an assay in HTS typically requires stable reagents during dispensing and sustained signal stability after addition of detection reagents. To assess these parameters, we monitored the assay signal using standard curves mimicking MT enzyme reactions initially containing 10 µM SAM. The maximal FP signal was reached by 60 min, reflecting complete equilibration of all the detection reagents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1087057111421624"><bold>Fig. 4B</bold></xref>). After that, the curve remained unchanged for at least 8 h, with only a very slight downward shift after 48 h, reflecting excellent signal stability. To assess the “deck stability” of the assay, precombined detection reagents were used to develop standard curves following storage at room temperature. There was no detectable decay in the standard curve at 18 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1087057111421624"><bold>Fig. 4C</bold></xref>), indicating excellent stability for the precombined detection mixture.</p>

<title>Effect of drug compounds on detection reagents</title>
<p>Inhibition or activation of coupling enzymes by screening compounds is a common source of assay interference for coupled assays.

<p>A miniaturized (1536-well) assay protocol was used to screen a proprietary 8800-compound pilot library at a concentration of 25 µM for inhibitors of HMT G9a.

The overall quality of the screen was acceptable as judged from robust Z′ values (an equivalent of the well-known Z′ value based on robust statistics instead of standard deviation and thus less affected by outliers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1087057111421624">28</xref></sup>) of about 0.6.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The Transcreener Epigen MT assay was designed, developed, and validated specifically for HTS, with the key parameters being facile incorporation into an automated environment and robust performance under relevant enzyme conditions. As BellBrook is a drug discovery solutions provider, we cannot provide an unbiased comparison to alternative MT assays, many of which are also available commercially. However, we can provide a summary of the key characteristics of the assay protocol, reagents, and performance that make it well suited for HTS.</p>
<p>The assay protocol is a simple mix-and-read format, with homogenous detection, and it is miniaturizable to 384- and 1536-well densities, properties that make incorporation into a typical automated HTS environment very straightforward. Endpoint assays are generally easier to incorporate into an automated protocol, and use of the assay in this mode allows determination of initial rates using a standard curve, if desired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1087057111421624"><bold>Fig. 6C</bold></xref>). Because of the difference in pH optimum between the G9a methyltransferase and the coupling enzymes, a two-step protocol with an enzyme-quenching step prior to detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1087057111421624"><bold>Fig. 6</bold></xref>) was used for enzyme studies, and the pilot screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1087057111421624"><bold>Figs. 7</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1087057111421624"><bold>8</bold></xref>). However, because quenching conditions that would also be compatible with the detection reagents have not been identified for all methyltransferases, the ability to use continuous detection may be advantageous in some situations, and we have preliminary evidence that the assay can also be used in this fashion (data not shown, to be published later). Note that use of the assay in continuous mode yields an approximation of initial rates because the detection reactions require more than 30 min to reach equilibrium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1087057111421624"><bold>Fig. 4A</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>The sensitivity, dynamic range, and data quality of the assay combine to yield a very good signal window for initial velocity measurements within the physiological range of SAM concentrations (0.20−50 µM). Assay performance at the lower end of this range is important because screening is often done using subsaturating substrate to avoid masking competitive inhibitors, and most HMTs have SAM K<sub>m</sub>’s of less than 5 µM. The main determinants of assay performance are the sensitivity and selectivity of the AMP antibody/tracer pair and the efficiency of SAH conversion to AMP. The IC<sub>50</sub> for AMP for binding to the AMP antibody in competition with tracer was 35 nM, and selectivity versus SAH and SAM was greater than 2 000-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1087057111421624"><bold>Fig. 2</bold></xref>). Thus, if conversion of SAH by coupling enzymes is nearly complete, the assay should yield a good signal with SAH concentrations of 70 to 100 nM, even in the presence of excess SAM. In practice, we found that this was the case, with acceptable HTS performance (Z′ &gt; 0.5, ΔmP = 60–100) occurring right around 100 nM SAH for the lower SAM concentrations tested (e.g., 10%, 25%, and 40% conversion of 1 µM, 0.5 µM, and 0.25 µM SAM, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1087057111421624"><bold>Fig. 4A</bold></xref>). Preliminary studies have indicated that the sensitivity of the assay can be increased by decreasing the volume and ionic strength of the detection reactions, thus increasing the assay window at the lower SAM concentrations (BellBrook Labs, unpublished data).</p>
<p>Even in the miniaturized 1536-well format with a 4 µL reaction volume, the assay yielded an acceptable assay quality when SAM was employed at a concentration of roughly 2× its K<sub>M</sub> value of 1.8 µM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087057111421624">29</xref></sup> The assay window could have undoubtedly been increased further by using higher concentrations of SAM, which would have improved assay statistics but also might have jeopardized assay sensitivity.</p>
<p>The histogram of the primary screening results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1087057111421624"><bold>Fig. 8</bold></xref>) shows a normal distribution centered around 0% inhibition for the vast majority of the library compounds tested. Some compounds, among them the true inhibitors such as the one in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1087057111421624"><bold>Figure 7</bold></xref> (left), are observed between the threshold of −50% and full inhibition (which can be assumed at −100% ± 30% inhibition) but not on the other side of the normal distribution. Only a handful of compounds—presumably readout or other artifacts and outliers—show results significantly below −100% or significantly above 0% that cannot be explained by stoichiometric inhibition. Overall, this distribution profile is very typical of the observations we make both in small-scale pilot screens such as the one described here and large-scale high-throughput screens of up to 1.5 million compounds for multiple targets (both methyltransferases and others) with a variety of readouts.</p>
<p>The significant fraction of primary hits that show activity in the counterscreen reflects the nature of the coupled assay system as well as the fact that typical screening libraries inevitably contain some nonstoichiometric and hence nonspecific compounds. As long as there is an efficient way to rapidly distinguish them from the desired stoichiometric compounds, which we demonstrate in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1087057111421624"><bold>Figure 7</bold></xref>, this is no obstacle to finding leads.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087057111421624">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>The hit rate of 0.41% against our pilot library is in the range that we would expect for a robust screening assay that is not overly affected by readout artifacts. Nevertheless, inhibitors of the auxiliary enzymes as well as other compounds interfering with the readout undoubtedly can show up in the assay but are efficiently eliminated by appropriate counterscreening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1087057111421624"><bold>Fig. 7</bold></xref>). Although we demonstrate this by means of concentration-response experiments, the principle can be just as well applied at a single concentration, which would allow efficient work up of larger hit lists. Our confidence in this approach is corroborated by the results for the reference compounds as well as the fact that three of the four G9a-dependent hits had been observed previously in an orthogonal TR-FRET–based assay (data not shown) similar to the DELFIA assay described by Kubicek and others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087057111421624">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>As noted in the Introduction, with the exception of direct immunodetection of SAH—an approach that has proven difficult to commercialize—all of the SAH-based MT assay methods rely on coupling enzymes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087057111421624">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087057111421624">20</xref></sup> with the associated risk of compound interference. To mitigate this risk, we used coupling enzymes in significant excess of what was required for a maximal signal. Thus, nearly complete inhibition would be required to affect the assay signal. Interference with the AMP detection component of the assay is likely to be low because of the very high selectivity of the antibody<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1087057111421624">25</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1087057111421624"><bold>Fig. 2</bold></xref>) and because the tracer emits in the far red, which minimizes interference from fluorescent compounds and light scattering.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1087057111421624">32</xref></sup> Although obviously not a comprehensive study, the low level of interference that we observed in the compound interference screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1087057111421624"><bold>Fig. 5</bold></xref>) and the reasonable hit rate in the pilot screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1087057111421624"><bold>Fig. 8</bold></xref>) are both encouraging. A more complete picture of interference levels will emerge from screens by end users using larger, more diverse libraries.</p>
<p>Reagent stability and cost are sometimes overlooked in assay development, but these factors frequently prohibit the practical use of an assay for high-volume screening. All of the reagents that were used for the Transcreener Epigen MT assay are available with continuous supply and at a scale and cost that will support many millions of wells of screening annually. Moreover, the reagents are stable to multiple freeze thaws (data not shown) and for extended periods at room temperature prior to dispensing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1087057111421624"><bold>Fig. 4C</bold></xref>), which will ensure that assay performance does not decay when long dispensing times are required for large screens. In addition, the AMP detection component of the assay is extremely stable under the final quenched reaction conditions, allowing more than 12 h for plates to be read (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1087057111421624"><bold>Fig. 4B</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, combining the Transcreener AMP assay with coupling enzymes that convert SAH to AMP provides a generic, homogenous methyltransferase enzyme assay that is well suited for an automated HTS environment. The assay can accommodate SAM levels as low as 0.5 µM with initial velocity detection and lower if higher substrate conversion levels are used; thus, it should be useful for screening many methyltransferases using nonsaturating SAM concentrations.</p>
