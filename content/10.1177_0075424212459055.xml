<p>Andrea Mayr’s <italic>Language and Power: An Introduction to Institutional Discourse</italic> provides broad yet focused methodologies and multimodal discourses that will efficiently introduce undergraduates and entry-level graduates to critical discourse studies. Chapters of the book include <italic>sociohistorical</italic>, sociological, critical theoretical, and critical discourse analyses of educational, prison, news, and defense discourses. While the book is an edited collection, similar to other installments of Continuum’s <italic>Advances in Social Linguistics</italic> series (edited by Sally Johnson), the eight chapters contain only four authors, with the bulk of authorship belonging to Mayr and David Machin. This could be seen as a disadvantage, but the book’s focus is on undergraduate and early graduate education, not field advancement. The reduced authorship provides chapters with methodologies and applications easily linked to previous chapters and pedagogical imperatives. Yet the book does offer some new research as well, particularly in British defense discourse and multimodal news discourse.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 introduces students to the major concepts and theorists of critical theory and critical discourse analysis (CDA). The chapter sets the book’s agenda, focusing on Fairclough’s <italic>definition</italic> of New Capitalism, which is “the most recent of a historical series of radical re-structurings through which capitalism has maintained a fundamental continuity,” by introducing economic systems of exchange into social and political institutions and discourses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0075424212459055">Fairclough 2003</xref>:4). Mayr consistently reminds readers that institutions are a “site for ‘reality construction’” (3), never letting student readers forget the politically charged critical methods and institutional language to which they are being introduced.</p>
<p>The chapter covers the historical convergence of social, cultural, linguistic, and critical theories, but the aim of the chapter is to present the field of CDA for application, not to give a history. <italic>Language and Power</italic> acknowledges luminaries such as Foucault, Habermas, Giddens, and Fairclough, <italic>yet</italic> is also comprehensive enough to include Max Weber. The first chapter is organized around concepts, allowing Mayr to expand upon definitions of institutions, discourse, and CDA in comprehensive sections, then turn to sections on ideology, power, and Marxism, before returning to explain CDA through a systemic functional linguistics (SFL) framework that includes attention to transitivity, modality, theme, lexical items, and intertextuality. If the framework of SFL/CDA is somewhat underdescribed, this is only because it is better covered through application in later chapters, making this introduction very practical, organized, and brief for pedagogical purposes.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 begins the six chapters of practical application. The sole chapter on educational discourse, chapter 2 focuses on the “enterprise culture and discourse [that] involve[s] the <italic>reconstruction</italic> of a wide range of institutions along business lines” (27), which has been prevalent in British universities since Thatcherism. The chapter analyzes a variety of university genres, such as mission statements, web site information, job ads, and faculty seminars addressing communication skills. This variety of genres allows for a conceptual discussion of enterprise culture to emerge, downplaying intricate SFL analysis in this early chapter. This choice is a wise one, as it exposes the reader to CDA’s ideological position and foregoes, for the moment, the potentially overwhelming critical terminology of SFL. The chapter may also be the most disturbing to those in academia who are not current in educational CDA. The chapter’s selection of mission statements and job ads highlights market-based language whose consumer basis is notably different than the highly humanistic, non-profit-based role that most professors imagine when defending their disciplines.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 focuses on prison discourse, mainly that of training manuals used in Scottish prisons. The <italic>chapter</italic> includes a history of the Scottish prison system and rehabilitation manuals since the 1980s. This handbook history allows Mayr to present small changes in the prison system’s identification and treatment of cognitive and behavioral deficiencies while still showing the inadequacy of a program focused only on certain cognitive and behavioral practices. Unlike other chapters, chapter 3 includes Mayr’s own participant/observation research, as well as training manual analysis. Thus, the research is academically original and also pedagogically novel through the introduction of field work procedures and methods.</p>
<p>This chapter examines texts mainly through lexical choice and transitivity to identify “what Cohen (1985:150) has <italic>called</italic> the ‘new Behaviorism’” (59), where behaviors, not cognitive processes, are treated, and “traditional behaviorist techniques [are] accompanied by the rhetoric of cognition” (59). Mayr concludes that New Behaviorism is congruent with capitalist managerial discourse because the cause of crime is not of importance. Thus, the social order is not critiqued, and management through surveillance and control becomes rehabilitative programs and pathways. Mayr concedes that such programs may be a first step to social agency, but argues that these programs do not provide the required spectrum of cognitive, social, and communication skills for rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Chapters 4 and 5 cover news texts. Chapter 4 provides a historical and contemporary setting for journalistic practices and argues that as ownership of media has become corporatized, the range of events considered to be newsworthy has decreased and evaluation is now based upon “institutionally and historically established themes” (67) that obliterate “new” news as well as <italic>contextualized</italic> event conditions. Due to the prevalence of such established themes, fewer reporters are in the field and more reporters are rewriting stories from the news wire, reinforcing the reportorial distance from contextual conditions. The majority of discourse analysis in the chapter focuses on rewritings of news stories for different audiences, regions, and event types, with detailed analysis of event increments as small as an hour.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 also begins the book’s multimodal discussion. The multimodal/visual theory of Kress and van <italic>Leeuwen</italic> is introduced and used for the duration of the book. This chapter applies multimodal analysis to stock footage, in particular, the Getty Collection, a commercial image archive. The use of commercial image archives dovetails with the reduction of news themes, as each contributes to the removal of context from New Capitalism’s news discourse.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 turns to depictions of antiracism and neoliberalism in news media. Machin and Mayr focus on news stories and photojournalism from the <italic>Leicester Mercury</italic> because Leicester was cited by the British government as a model of assimilation and also because the paper has <italic>conservative</italic> political leanings. The chapter evaluates Leicester’s unique immigration patterns that differentiate it from cities with greater racial tension, allowing the chapter to serve as a fine pedagogical example of the sociological research congruent with CDA. This chapter then explores the complex relationship among media, private ownership, and political promotion through the <italic>Mercury</italic>’s depictions of immigrants, their relationships with natives, and natives’ opinions on immigration. Machin and Mayr conclude that overt racism is ignored and positive representation is at a premium, and such themes are an example of how the market can increase acceptance and multiculturalism. However, media representations background divisive issues and causes of racial conflict; furthermore, representations typically illustrate personal agency and individualism while backgrounding social circumstances, hostility, and marginalization. The authors suggest that “in this model, cohesion and harmony is about individual choice and talking" (114), not about recognizing and changing social structures.</p>
<p>Chapters 6 and 7 focus on defense discourses, mainly those of Britain. Chapter 6 examines war memorials, especially statues, in Britain. The linguistic analysis includes some archival news and civic texts pertaining to war memorials and memorial inscriptions. The discourses of nationalism and religion are found embedded in memorial discourse. More interestingly, the historical research covers archival cartoons, editorials, and proposals for memorials depicting war as tragic rather than heroic, illustrating war memorial discourses excluded from our iconography. This leads to a visual methodology and analysis of memorial statues from WWI to the present in Britain. This chapter is the best example of combined linguistic and sociohistorical research, and the chapter also serves as a student-centered introduction to and bibliography for iconography; but academically the chapter’s findings are predictable and serve as only a basic discussion of war memorial iconography.</p>
<p>In opposition to chapter 6’s predictability, chapter 7 offers an intricate analysis of defense discourse. In addition, chapter 7 introduces corpus linguistics and includes a discussion of the benefits of corpus linguistics as a field and in relation to CDA. The chapter compares the use of consensual <italic>we</italic> in <italic>persuasive</italic> political discourse to its use in the Collins Cobuild <italic>Bank of English</italic> corpus, finding that in the Department of Defense corpus, “the ambiguous scope of <italic>we</italic> is exploited for clearly rhetorical purposes” (144), but that differentiating between inclusive and exclusive <italic>we</italic> can be equally difficult for the researcher. Next, <italic>we</italic> is collated as part of a variety of phrases to investigate its use in a range of modalities. Once again, corpus analysis finds a rhetorically purposed <italic>we</italic> across modalities and levels of obligation. The chapter also spends ample time analyzing the binomials <italic>men and women</italic> and <italic>friends and allies</italic>, finding differences downplayed in the former and increased in the latter in defense discourse.</p>
<p><italic>Language and Power</italic> is indeed an introduction of perfect scope for undergraduates, graduate students, and nonspecialists. Both the benefits and obligations of CDA’s politics are explained, and the chapters are various enough to see the full power of CDA. If the book has a weakness, it is <italic>practically</italic> invisible. While the book does not downplay the importance of critical work to redirect the hegemony of capitalistic and market discourses, <italic>Language and Power</italic> doesn’t overstress the importance of CDA either. In neither its introduction nor its closing does the book move beyond academic style and argument to stylistically or rhetorically foreground the moral and ethical importance of the critical theory it champions. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0075424212459055">Johnson and Ensslin’s (2007</xref>:4) <italic>Language in the Media</italic>, another title in the <italic>Advances in Sociolinguistics</italic> series, immediately champions linguists’ and critical theorists’ engagement in public intellectualism. Mayr frequently acknowledges that other discourse systems are displaced when New Capitalism succeeds, but such philosophical admissions are buried in chapter and section summaries, leaving one to wonder if students or readers will feel a sense of urgency arising during this introduction to critical theory. To their credit, Gill Abousnnouga and David Machin do provide this urgency and recognition of alternative systems in their chapter on war memorials.</p>
<p>Non-British researchers, instructors, or students will not be left in the cold when reading about <italic>Language and Power</italic>’s British institutions and discourses. The discourses are not wholly unique to British cultural or historical knowledge, and the defense chapters acknowledge differences in U.S. and British defense discourses. Thus, the book should work well in American or other non-British classrooms. The educational discourse chapter may be most striking to this book’s academic audience because it collects some disturbing harbingers for our profession. In sum, Mayr has coherently synthesized a wide range of research and conceptual material into a digestible and effective CDA introduction.</p>
