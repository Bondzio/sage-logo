<abstract>
<p>Reciprocal relations between weight and psychological factors suggest that there are deep connections between mind and body. Personality traits are linked to weight gain; weight gain may likewise be associated with personality change. Using data from two diverse longitudinal samples (<italic>N</italic> = 1,919) collected at two time points an average of 10 years apart, we showed that significant weight gain is associated with increases in both impulsiveness and deliberation: In both samples, middle-aged adults who gained 10% or more of their baseline body weight by follow-up increased in their tendency to give in to temptation, yet were more thoughtful about the consequences of their actions. The present research moves beyond life events to implicate health status in adult personality development. The findings also suggest that interventions focusing on the emotional component of impulse control may be more effective because even people who become more thoughtful about the consequences of their actions may have limited success at inhibiting their behavior.</p>

<body>
<p>Body weight and indices of adiposity, such as body mass index (BMI), are associated with physical health, but weight also has significant and pervasive psychological consequences. Awareness of body size and body dissatisfaction emerge early in childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0956797612469212">Tremblay, Lovsin, Zecevic, &amp; Larivière, 2011</xref>), and the psychological effects of being an overweight child can persist into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0956797612469212">Sánchez-Villegas et al., 2010</xref>). As adults, overweight or obese individuals are at increased risk for poor body image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0956797612469212">Schwartz &amp; Brownell, 2004</xref>), depressive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0956797612469212">Luppino et al., 2010</xref>), and being targeted for discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797612469212">Puhl &amp; Heuer, 2009</xref>). Likewise, psychological factors, such as clinical depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0956797612469212">Luppino et al., 2010</xref>), depressive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0956797612469212">Sutin &amp; Zonderman, 2012</xref>), and personality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0956797612469212">Sutin, Ferrucci, Zonderman, &amp; Terracciano, 2011</xref>), increase risk for weight gain. Thus, in the case of body weight, mind and body are intimately intertwined.</p>
<p>Personality traits, which reflect individuals’ characteristic ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving, are associated with abnormal weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797612469212">Brummett et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0956797612469212">Chapman, Fiscella, Duberstein, Coletta, &amp; Kawachi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0956797612469212">Terracciano et al., 2009</xref>) and weight gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0956797612469212">Magee &amp; Heaven, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0956797612469212">Sutin et al., 2011</xref>). For example, high levels of neuroticism and low levels of conscientiousness are associated with high BMI, and aspects of impulsivity, including impulsiveness and lack of self-discipline, have been associated with weight gain across adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0956797612469212">Sutin et al., 2011</xref>). This relation is unlikely to be unidirectional. Body weight is, in part, a physical manifestation of an individual’s lifestyle and may be a source of information about the individual’s personality that could lead to personality change over time. Although previous research found that baseline weight was mostly unrelated to personality development across adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0956797612469212">Sutin et al., 2011</xref>), changes in weight, particularly weight gain, may prompt personality change. That is, weight itself may not foster changes in personality, but the process of gaining a significant amount of weight could lead individuals to view themselves differently and to think, feel, and behave differently over time. Weight gain can be a very physical reminder of the inability to control one’s impulses, and those who gain weight may come to perceive themselves to be, or actually become, more impulsive and less disciplined. Further, the stigma associated with weight gain could feed back on to how individuals perceive or describe themselves.</p>
<p>In the present study, we tested whether gaining at least 10% of baseline body weight by the time of a follow-up measurement was associated with change in impulsivity-related personality traits, which are among the traits with the strongest theoretical and empirical links with body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0956797612469212">Davis, 2010</xref>). We hypothesized that, compared with individuals who maintained a relatively stable weight, those who gained weight would become more impulsive, undisciplined, and less thoughtful because high impulsiveness, low self-discipline, and low deliberation have been associated with BMI and weight gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0956797612469212">Sutin et al., 2011</xref>). We tested this hypothesis in samples drawn from two longitudinal studies; the samples varied in age and socioeconomic status.</p>

<title>Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA)</title>
<p>Participants with at least two assessments of personality and weight were selected from the BLSA cohort (<italic>N</italic> = 1,457). This sample was 48% female and 52% male, and its ethnicity was 70% White, 23% Black, and 7% other. Participants ranged from middle to older age (<italic>M</italic> = 58.74 years at baseline, <italic>SD</italic> = 15.35) and were educated (<italic>M</italic> = 17.09 years of education, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.52).</p>

<title>Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) study</title>
<p>The second set of participants was drawn from the ECA study, a multiwave cohort study of East Baltimore residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956797612469212">Eaton et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797612469212">Eaton, Kalaydjian, Scharfstein, Mezuk, &amp; Ding, 2007</xref>). Measures of personality in the ECA sample were available from Wave 3 (referred to here as baseline) and Wave 4 (referred to here as follow-up; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956797612469212">Löckenhoff et al., 2008</xref>). A total of 462 participants had valid personality and weight measures at both waves. This sample was 64% female and 36% male, and its ethnicity was 61% White, 36% Black, and 3% other. Participants were younger (<italic>M</italic> = 45.39 years old at baseline, <italic>SD</italic> = 10.69) and less educated (<italic>M</italic> = 12.58 years of education, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.41) than participants drawn from the BLSA.</p>

<title>Personality traits</title>
<p>In both samples, personality was assessed with the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956797612469212">Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992</xref>). Participants completed it twice, approximately 10 years apart in the BLSA (<italic>M</italic> = 10.58, <italic>SD</italic> = 5.15, range = 1–21 years) and approximately 8 years apart in the ECA (<italic>M</italic> = 8.38, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.10, range = 4–12 years). We focused primarily on the impulsivity-related facets of the NEO-PI-R: Impulsiveness (N5), Excitement-Seeking (E5), Self-Discipline (C5), and Deliberation (C6). Raw scores were converted to <italic>T</italic> scores (<italic>M</italic> = 50, <italic>SD</italic> = 10) using American combined-sex norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956797612469212">Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992</xref>).</p>

<title>Weight</title>
<p>Weight and height were either measured by a trained staff clinician (at both time points for the BLSA sample and at the ECA follow-up) or self-reported (at baseline for the ECA sample). Weight gain was defined as a 10% increase in weight between baseline and follow-up; 16% of BLSA participants and 38% of ECA participants gained at least 10% of their baseline body weight by follow-up.</p>

<sec id="section8-0956797612469212">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>To test whether significant weight gain was associated with changes in impulsivity-related traits, we regressed personality at follow-up on baseline personality, age, age squared, sex, ethnicity, education, interval between testing, and weight gain (0 = &lt; 10% gain, 1 = ≥ 10% gain). In additional analyses, we controlled for baseline BMI and tested age, sex, ethnicity, education, and baseline BMI as moderators of the associations between weight gain and personality change. For comparison, we also tested whether significant weight loss (≥ 10% loss of baseline body weight) was associated with personality change.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Consistent with our hypothesis, results showed that weight gain in both samples was associated with changes in impulsiveness: Compared with participants who did not gain a significant amount of weight, those who gained more than 10% of their body weight between baseline and follow-up increased in their tendency to give in to temptations (BLSA sample: β = 0.06; ECA sample: β = 0.11, <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .01). Those who did not gain weight showed the typical normative decline (~1 <italic>T</italic>-score point over a decade) in impulsivity, whereas those who gained weight increased in impulsiveness (~1 <italic>T</italic>-score point) between baseline and follow-up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797612469212">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Surprisingly, and counter to our hypothesis, the analysis revealed that weight gain was also associated with increases in deliberation in both samples: Participants who gained weight increased in their tendency to think before acting (BLSA sample: β = 0.05; ECA sample: β = 0.09, <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0956797612469212">Fig. 2</xref>). Participants who gained weight had more than double the increase in deliberation than participants with stable weight (an increase of ~2 <italic>T</italic>-score points vs. ~1 <italic>T</italic>-score point). Weight gain was not associated with changes in either excitement seeking (BLSA sample: β = 0.02; ECA sample: β = −0.01, n.s.) or self-discipline (both βs = 0.00, n.s.). Results were similar when weight gain was entered as a continuous, rather than a dichotomous, variable and when increases in BMI were used instead of increases in weight. Controlling for baseline BMI did not alter the results, nor were there any interactions between baseline BMI and weight gain on changes in personality. Table S1 in the Supplemental Material available online shows the associations between weight gain and change in the five broad dimensions of personality. There was a small effect of weight gain on increases in conscientiousness in the BLSA sample, which was due to the association between weight gain and increases in deliberation. Weight gain was unrelated to change in any of the other personality traits.</p>

</fig>
<p>We next tested whether demographic factors moderated any of these associations. In the BLSA sample, the increase in deliberation among participants who gained weight was mainly due to younger participants (Age × Weight Gain interaction: β = −0.06, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Age did not moderate this association in the ECA sample (Age × Weight Gain interaction: β = 0.02, n.s.), which is consistent with the BLSA results in that ECA participants were younger, and this effect was apparent only among the young to middle-aged participants in the BLSA sample. Sex, ethnicity, and education did not moderate this association in either sample, and none of the demographic factors moderated the association between weight gain and change in the other three traits.</p>
<p>In contrast to weight gain, weight loss was not consistently associated with personality change. Those who lost at least 10% of their baseline weight (~7% of participants in each sample) decreased in impulsiveness in the ECA sample (β = −0.14, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), but weight loss was unrelated to changes in this trait in the BLSA sample (β = −0.01, n.s.). Weight loss was associated with a decrease in deliberation in the BLSA sample (β = −0.04, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) but was unrelated to changes in this trait in the ECA sample (β = 0.04, n.s.). Weight loss was unrelated to either excitement seeking (BLSA sample: β = −0.01; ECA sample: β = 0.04, n.s.) or self-discipline (BLSA sample: β = 0.00; ECA sample: β = 0.06, n.s.) in either sample.</p>

<sec id="section10-0956797612469212" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Across two samples that varied in age and socioeconomic status, significant weight gain was associated with increases in both impulsiveness and deliberation. That is, participants who gained at least 10% of their baseline body weight between the two measurement occasions described themselves as more likely to give in to temptations, but also as more thoughtful, than did participants who experienced less significant weight gain in the same time period. Although seemingly modest, these changes are nonetheless substantively meaningful. For example, at follow-up, there was a difference of approximately 2 <italic>T</italic>-score points in impulsiveness between participants who gained weight and those who did not. This translates into roughly one fifth of a standard-deviation increase in impulsiveness over one decade, which is larger than the expected decrease in this trait that occurs with normal aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0956797612469212">Terracciano, McCrae, Brant, &amp; Costa, 2005</xref>). The effect sizes were also of a similar magnitude as the correlation between life events and personality change, such as that between starting a new job and increases in conscientiousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0956797612469212">Lüdtke, Roberts, Trautwein, &amp; Nagy, 2011</xref>), and as the effect of personality on consequential life outcomes, including weight gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0956797612469212">Sutin et al., 2011</xref>) and longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0956797612469212">Roberts, Kuncel, Shiner, Caspi, &amp; Goldberg, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Impulsivity-related traits have been associated with weight and weight gain in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0956797612469212">Sutin et al., 2011</xref>), but weight gain did not have an equal association with changes in these traits over time in the present study. Several mechanisms, both psychological and physiological, may lead from weight gain to personality change. There is a pervasive stereotype in American society that overweight and obese individuals are lazy, weak-willed, and undisciplined and that they struggle with willpower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797612469212">Puhl &amp; Heuer, 2010</xref>). As individuals gain weight, they may internalize these stereotypes and come to view their personalities as consistent with such impressions of the obese. Although they viewed themselves as more impulsive, participants who gained weight in our two samples did not come to resemble other aspects of the stereotype. Weight gain, for example, was unrelated to changes in self-discipline and was related to an increase, not a decrease, in deliberation.</p>
<p>A second possibility is that physiological mechanisms associated with weight gain could contribute to the relation between weight gain and changes in personality. For example, overweight and obese individuals tend to have higher levels of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0956797612469212">Visser, Bouter, McQuillan, Wener, &amp; Harris, 1999</xref>), and chronic inflammation may reduce the ability to effectively regulate emotions and control behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0956797612469212">Miller, Capuron, &amp; Raison, 2005</xref>). The increase in both impulsiveness and deliberation, replicated across two diverse samples, suggests that weight gain could be associated with detrimental psychophysiological effects on the emotional components of impulsivity (e.g., giving in to urges, inability to resist cravings) and that failure to control behavior could also raise awareness of the consequences associated with those behaviors. Likewise, preliminary evidence indicates that there are psychological changes that accompany bariatric surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0956797612469212">Järvholm et al., 2012</xref>), which further suggests that physiological changes in the body are associated with psychological changes.</p>
<p>Significant weight gain can hardly go unnoticed by friends and family, and feedback from close others may heighten attention to eating behavior. For example, overweight and obese individuals most often cite friends and parents as the source of weight stigmatization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0956797612469212">Puhl, Moss-Racusin, Schwartz, &amp; Brownell, 2008</xref>), and such stigmatization may bring greater awareness to how much the individual is eating. A close friend or family member may be more likely to make an offhand comment about a second helping at dinner to someone in the midst of weight gain than to someone whose weight is stable. Receiving such heightened attention may be associated with an increased tendency to think before acting, even if those thoughts do not translate into planned and effective behaviors. Increases in deliberation may reflect the rationalization that often accompanies unhealthy eating behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797612469212">Kemp, Bui, &amp; Grier, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The present research has implications for adult personality development. Research on personality change in adulthood typically focuses on its normative trajectory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0956797612469212">Terracciano et al., 2005</xref>) and how life events potentially alter this path (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0956797612469212">Specht, Egloff, &amp; Schmukle, 2011</xref>). The present research indicates that physical changes in the body are also associated with the trajectory of personality over time. Notably, our findings both diminish and amplify normative changes in impulsivity-related traits. The normative trajectory of impulsiveness is a clear linear decline with age, but significant weight gain opposes this developmental trend. As people gain weight, they may become more impulsive, perhaps because weight gain is very physical evidence of the failure to control cravings. In contrast to impulsiveness, deliberation tends to increase for everyone across adulthood, but weight gain may amplify this normative age-related trend.</p>
<p>The present research suggests that there is a potential downward spiral for people struggling with their weight. The impulsiveness aspect of neuroticism is the strongest personality-trait contributor to weight gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0956797612469212">Sutin et al., 2011</xref>), and our current findings suggest that weight gain is associated with increases in this trait. The inability to control cravings may reinforce a vicious cycle that weakens the self-control muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956797612469212">Baumeister, Vohs, &amp; Tice, 2007</xref>): Yielding to temptation today may reduce the ability (self-control and willpower) to resist cravings tomorrow. Thus, individuals who gain weight may have increased risk for additional weight gain through changes in their personality.</p>
<p>This research had several strengths, including the use of two large independent longitudinal samples that varied in age and socioeconomic status, a well-established measure of personality traits, and two assessments of weight and personality over a significant period of time. We could not, however, distinguish between actual personality change and changes in self-perception of personality. Future research would benefit from additional personality measures, such as observer reports, which could help to disentangle these types of change. Future research could also explore the mechanisms that contribute to these effects and how consideration of an individual’s personality may improve intervention effectiveness. For example, weight-loss interventions that focus primarily on providing information about healthy lifestyle choices may be less effective than those aimed at the emotional aspects of impulsivity. In addition, with correlational data in the present study, we could not disentangle the direction of the relation between weight gain and changes in personality or whether a third variable is responsible for the observed associations. Future research would thus benefit from more than two assessments of personality and weight so that hypotheses about the temporal relations between the two could be tested. Overall, our findings suggest that even when individuals think about the consequences of their actions, their emotional impulses might be too hard to overcome.</p>
