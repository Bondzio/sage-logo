<abstract>
<p>This article analyses the role of scalar politics in the 22-day Israeli assault on the occupied Gaza Strip that happened in the winter of 2008–9, and argues that practices of organizing and representing different kinds of scale have helped normalize occupation violence. Israeli regulatory mechanisms and a variety of scalar narratives of the occupied Palestinian territory constructed geographical, material and sensorial aspects of space and scale in a way that allowed the Israeli ‘Operation Cast Lead’ to stand out as anomalous, when it was in fact part of an ongoing, systematic military occupation. The ways that space and scale have been constructed throughout the occupied Palestinian territory in many ways echo modes of fragmentation and social segregation that enable forms of violence seen in enclaved cities around the globe. The Palestinian case calls for additional attention to the imbrication of different kinds of scale – density, distance, time and destruction – as they are shaped militarily and discursively.</p>

<p>This article explores the significance of scalar politics and the control of space in the production of the Gaza Strip as a target during ‘Operation Cast Lead’, the Israeli attacks on Gaza between December 2008 and January 2009. A precondition of the way that Gaza has become a target for Israelis (and to some extent, and in a very different way, for Palestinians in the West Bank) is the skewing of physical and social distance under conditions of forced geographical separation. The Gaza Strip has become increasingly isolated, turned into a place regarded as exceptional and exceptionally problematic, thereby allowing mounting levels of violence to be perpetrated against Gaza and its residents. The ways that space and scale have been constructed throughout the occupied Palestinian territory in many ways echo the modes of fragmentation and social segregation that are seen in enclaved cities, from São Paulo to Los Angeles (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0308275X12449103">Caldeira, 1996</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0308275X12449103">1</xref></sup> But the case of Gaza calls additional attention to the imbrication of four different kinds of scale – density, distance, time and levels of destruction – as they are shaped militarily and discursively. In tandem with the process of cordoning off Gaza through closure and siege, representational and physical manipulations of scale by a range of actors, including the Israeli army, human rights groups, UN investigators and others, have had the paradoxical effect of calling attention to only certain forms and levels of violence in Gaza, while obfuscating and normalizing the ‘everyday’ violence of Israel’s military occupation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0308275X12449103">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although physical distance, population density, levels of violence and senses of time may seem to function on distinct political and experiential levels and therefore demand different analytics, they are also tightly related. On the level of spatial scale, the perceived physical distance between the Gaza Strip and the rest of Palestine/Israel has allowed Gaza and its inhabitants to come to be seen as uniquely other, and thereby especially targetable. The density of the population in that small area – nearly 20,000 people per square mile, which is one of the highest population densities in the world – likewise affected how the Israeli military carried out its attacks and how the government represented the Palestinian fighters there. The scale of the violence that was unleashed on Gaza-as-target made the attacks there seem unusual, thereby bracketing off ‘Operation Cast Lead’ as somehow unique and distinct from the rest of the occupation. The everyday violence of occupation was left, if not totally unremarked, at least diminished in significance and generally prompting less outrage. This article, then, is not so much an inquiry into ‘ideologies of scale’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0308275X12449103">Tsing, 2000</xref>: 347), as it is, rather, an investigation into the <italic>practices</italic> of controlling scale, an exploration of the people and institutions involved in shaping how scales are lived, represented, and obscured, and the forms of violence that are thereby enabled.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0308275X12449103"><title>Isolating Gaza</title>
<p>Spatial and scalar politics – forms of socio-spatial control and manipulation of scalar dimensions of socio-spatial relations (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0308275X12449103">Swyngedouw, 2007</xref>: 11) – have been a key dynamic of the Palestinian–Israeli conflict from the beginning. A historical divide between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank and Israel was formally cemented first after the 1948–9 war that saw Israel’s establishment, and Egypt and Jordan gained administrative control over the Gaza Strip and the West Bank respectively. Gaza’s population was immediately doubled as approximately 200,000 Palestinian refugees deluged the Gaza Strip, arriving from parts of Palestine that had come under Zionist control, making it one of the most crowded places on the planet. From that time, Gaza has been treated in a unique way. While Jordan annexed the West Bank and many Palestinians living there became Jordanian citizens under Jordanian law, the Gaza Strip under Egyptian military administration became undefinable, contested, and from 1948 until 1967 it was under Egyptian military authority, but no one’s sovereignty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0308275X12449103">Feldman, 2008</xref>). In 1967, the Israeli army declared the Gaza Strip a closed military area, and since then numerous Israeli bureaucratic and military actions have enhanced Gaza’s exceptional status and increased its isolation.</p>
<p>Throughout this history of political and physical seclusion, ever more intense forms of violence have been routinized in the Gaza Strip. But the intensified forms of violence used against Gazans during ‘Operation Cast Lead’ and the ways in which scalar politics were woven throughout the military actions and the media reportage and other discourse about it, allowed the attacks on Gaza to stand out as anomalous. In the case of the Israeli attacks on Gaza in December 2008 to January 2009, a severe lack of historical and spatial contextualization simultaneously brought world-wide attention to Israel’s actions in that part of the occupied territory, because of the scale of violence, and at the same time enhanced Israel’s ability to produce Gaza as a legitimate target and falsely separate it, conceptually and practically, from the broader – and ongoing – occupation.</p>
<p>‘Operation Cast Lead’, in some sense the culmination (but not the end) of a long process of targeting Gaza, began with a week of continuous Israeli airstrikes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0308275X12449103">Gisha, 2011</xref>). These were followed by ground and air incursions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0308275X12449103">ICG, 2009</xref>: 1), all accomplished with weaponry that included Apache helicopters and F16 fighter jets, air strikes and shelling of family homes, use of white phosphorous, and bulldozers systematically demolishing buildings, resulting in the loss of dozens of Palestinian lives every day.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0308275X12449103">3</xref></sup> In three weeks, approximately 1400 Palestinians were killed, including some 300 children; 5300 were injured, the vast majority civilians.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0308275X12449103">4</xref></sup> Some 2400 Palestinian houses were completely or largely destroyed, including 28 public civilian facilities, ministries, municipality buildings, the Palestinian Legislative Council building, and tens of schools, factories, mosques, and civilian police stations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0308275X12449103">Amnesty International, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0308275X12449103">PCHR, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>When the Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip began on 27 December 2008, it was quickly deemed a ‘war’ in the western and Arabic press. Although Israel never declared war, and in fact formal declarations of war are exceedingly rare these days, the label was applied to the Israeli attacks across the US, UK and Arab media, as well as throughout popular Palestinian and Israeli discourse.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0308275X12449103">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>If one were to define a war based on the scale and intensity of an assault, then it is not surprising that the media would refer to Israel’s ‘Operation Cast Lead’ as such. Israeli soldiers testified to the intensity of their assault:<disp-quote>
<p>Fire power was insane. We went in and the booms were just mad. The minute we got to our starting line, we simply began to fire at suspect places. Also, it was still dark when we went in, we got there just before dawn. You see a house, a window, shoot at the window. You don't see a terrorist there? Fire at the window. It was real urban warfare. This is the difference between urban warfare and a limited confrontation. In urban warfare, anyone is your enemy. No innocents. It was simply urban warfare in every way. … They kept repeating to us that this is war and in war opening fire is not restricted. … our brigade commander at least once … went so far as to say this was war and in war as in war, no consideration of civilians was to be taken. You shoot anyone you see. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0308275X12449103">Breaking the Silence, 2009</xref>: 20, 24, 27)</p></disp-quote>Amnesty International stated that Israeli actions violated international humanitarian law because they were ‘disproportionate, excessive and not justified by reasons of imperative military necessity’ (2009: 65).</p>
<p>The relative scales of violence during a month of increased assaults affected how Gaza was understood as a target, during and after the Israeli attacks. Here I use the notion of scale to encompass the ideas of spatial expanse, extent or reach of violence, as well as the size of populations and communities, imaginings of boundaries between different kinds of people and places, and the geographical and felt distances between them. It is scale in this sense – as opposed to a more common understanding of scale as the ‘articulations among globalist, nationalist, and regionalist projects’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0308275X12449103">Tsing, 2005</xref>:76) – that sparked an unprecedented level of investigation and condemnation. This included the Goldstone Commission, (a controversial United Nations ‘Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict’ headed by South African judge Richard Goldstone<bold>)</bold>, legal action taken by lawyers in Norway, a Turkish probe (albeit short-lived) into whether Israel committed crimes against humanity, cries of outrage from the likes of Alice Walker, UN demands for compensation for destroyed property from Israel and waves of student protests across the UK that involved ‘occupations’ of numerous campuses.</p>
<p>I do not intend with these observations to suggest that the investigations, condemnations and legal analyses that the Gaza attacks prompted were inappropriate or should not have been carried out. Rather, I am highlighting the impact of the labelling of ‘Operation Cast Lead’ as war, and that term’s implied exceptionalism. The designation of ‘Operation Cast Lead’ as war is an example of how scalar politics plays out in the defining, however implicitly, of what, on the one hand, is ordinary – and therefore implicitly acceptable violence – and what, on the other hand, is remarkable and investigable or even condemnable. In what follows I lay out the ways in which an older anthropological concept of scale can help us understand the ways in which geographical, material and sensorial manipulations of space and scale have been implemented through a combination of Israeli regulatory mechanisms, as well as through media and human rights depictions of the Israeli occupied Palestinian territory (OPT).</p>

<sec id="sec2-0308275X12449103"><title>Scale</title>
<p>Anthropologists and geographers have long been sensitive to the socially constructed nature of geographic scale, and the political, social and economic effects of how scales are constructed (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0308275X12449103">Delaney and Leitneh, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0308275X12449103">Gupta and Ferguson, 1992</xref>). The problem of scale was a hot topic in 1970s anthropology, itself a revisitation of questions that Robert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0308275X12449103">Redfield (1947)</xref> and Godfrey and Monica <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0308275X12449103">Wilson (1945)</xref> posed much earlier. For Berreman, for example, the goal was ‘to determine precisely how scale affects social structure and social relations’, with ‘scale’ taken to mean ‘the maximal size of the social, political, economic, and ideological-communication networks which significantly involve and affect the members of a social entity’ (1978: 228). Fredrik Barth correlated scale with ‘organizational apparatus’ in order to develop a typology for cross-cultural comparison (1972: 207). Questions of how size and complexity affected culture change in so-called large- and small-scale societies presaged anthropology’s parallel concerns about scale some two decades later, although since the 1990s it has been raised in much more roundabout ways, as globalization and its relationship to the urban local have come to the fore of analytical interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0308275X12449103">Kearney, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Much recent anthropological scholarship that touches on scale has focused specifically on urban spaces (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0308275X12449103">Caldeira, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0308275X12449103">Low, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0308275X12449103">Ødegaard, 2011</xref>) and the changing forms of capitalism that create them (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0308275X12449103">Smith, 1996</xref>), on methodological issues that come along with doing ethnography on the ‘awkward scale’ of globally extending, technologically networked expanses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0308275X12449103">Comaroff and Comaroff, 2003</xref>), or on the ways in which globalizing dynamics impact the idea and experience of locality, localism and marginalization (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0308275X12449103">Briggs, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0308275X12449103">Masquelier, 2002</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0308275X12449103">6</xref></sup> Where spatial studies have contributed most to the understanding of Palestinian society (under occupation and in Israel) in particular has been in the research of critical Israeli geographers and architects who have analysed the politics of space and spatial control as fundamental to the occupation and to ethnic divisions within the Green Line (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0308275X12449103">Weizman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0308275X12449103">Yiftachel and Yacobi, 2003</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0308275X12449103">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>For scholars attending to topics such as these, in Palestine/Israel and elsewhere, how to move ‘easily from the local to the large-scale’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0308275X12449103">Farmer, 2004</xref>: 323), how to track interactions between people and dynamics moving along local, regional and global levels, and finding a vocabulary to describe them, has become a central problematic (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0308275X12449103">Low, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0308275X12449103">Tsing, 2000</xref>). Earlier anthropological understandings of scale, however, especially concern with scale as the size of populations and communities, and the geographical and felt distances between them, feature only marginally in recent analyses of the social construction of space and spatial control. But it is just these prosaic features of life – population densities and distances, the rates and intensities of violence, whether under occupation, in conditions of war or in the ‘peace’ within the gates of gated communities in cosmopolitan cities – that feature so centrally in the scalar politics of the Gaza Strip.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0308275X12449103">8</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0308275X12449103"><title>Israel’s disengagement, separation, target</title>
<p>To grasp fully how a politics of scale has been structured such that everyday occupation violence in Gaza is normalized, the concept of scale must be expanded. Beyond what has become the notion’s typical confinement to concerns with local–regional–global relations, the concept must encompass four aspects: Gaza’s geographic size, its population density, the fluctuating rates, or intensities, of occupation violence that occur there, and the perceived distance dividing it from other places, specifically through the control of movement between Israel and the occupied territories of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. These intertwined kinds of scale, as they are perceived and experienced, represented and restricted, have been crucial to Israel’s control of the Gaza Strip, to making it especially vulnerable to multiple forms of political oppression and military assault, and to defining and distinguishing who are the ‘dangerous’ (and thus target-able) people that reside there (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0308275X12449103">Merry, 2001</xref>: 17).</p>
<p>Israeli measures of disengagement and separation have shaped those aspects of scale in crucial ways. Israeli disengagement from Gaza in September 2005 led some to believe that the occupation was over. The unilateral Israeli withdrawal from 21 settlements in Gaza (as well as four small settlements in the West Bank) entailed the removal of more than 8000 settlers, and on this basis Israel has argued that it is no longer the Occupying Power in the Gaza Strip.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0308275X12449103">9</xref></sup> This allowed ‘Operation Cast Lead’ to be portrayed as a war against an outside enemy, rather than attacks against an occupied population.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0308275X12449103">10</xref></sup> (And this despite the fact that the disengagement did not see an end to the occupation or to Israel’s obligations under international law as an occupier.) Disengagement was accompanied by Israel’s insistence that as a result of their withdrawal the Palestinian Authority (PA) would be responsible for everything to do with rebuilding Gaza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0308275X12449103">Siegel, 2005</xref>). Two years later, after Hamas was voted in to head the PA and suffered an international blockade in response, they were blamed for ‘engineering’ the ensuing (scare-quoted) ‘humanitarian crisis’ themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0308275X12449103">Jager, 2008</xref>). Israel’s declaration of Hamas as an ‘enemy entity’ on a ‘hostile territory’ reinforced the image of Gaza as a self-controlled, separate unit that was synonymous with Hamas and terror.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0308275X12449103">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Not only have Gazans been confined and cordoned off from people and goods, Israeli occupation policies have also imposed a strict partitioning of Jewish Israel from the OPT, as well as the West Bank from the Gaza Strip, a geographical feature with acute social and political consequences, which also affected senses of distance, through stretching of geographical scales. Since 2001, Israel has officially made it illegal for Israeli citizens to travel to areas of the West Bank and Gaza Strip under Palestinian control. At major checkpoints into Palestinian towns, such as Qalandya outside of Ramallah, visitors are greeted with large red signs with the Hebrew warning: ‘This road leads to Area A, which is under the control of the Palestinian Authority. The entry of Israelis into Area A is forbidden, endangers your lives, and constitutes a criminal offense!!’ (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0308275X12449103">Figure 1</xref>). (Although it is officially illegal for Israeli citizens to enter most PA-controlled areas, Palestinian citizens of Israel are not, in practice, generally prevented from doing so.)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0308275X12449103">12</xref></sup> This deep divide between the everyday lives of everyday Palestinians and Jewish Israelis is maintained both culturally and legally, and makes it easy for most of the latter group to ignore completely the living conditions of those whom their government and military are occupying.

<p>During a Passover celebration in Jewish west Jerusalem in 2009, one of my hosts asked me with genuine curiosity: ‘What is Ramallah like? Does it look like Tel Aviv?’ This is a remarkable question for anyone familiar with the relative glitz, consumerism, and wealth of Tel Aviv as compared to any city in the West Bank. The family commented with delight at the Arabic sweets I had brought ‘all the way’ from a West Bank city, and treated me and my experiences with Palestinians as a somewhat exotic story and surely dangerous.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0308275X12449103">13</xref></sup> As in certain versions of Israeli sociology, Palestinians have been ‘externalized … seen … as an “issue” affecting Israeli society from without, rather than as a constitutive element’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0308275X12449103">Shafir and Peled, 2002</xref>: 25). The sense that ‘what happened over there bore no relationship to us’ was prevalent among many Israelis during the Gaza crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0308275X12449103">Lagerquist, 2009</xref>: 88).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0308275X12449103">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>An Israeli Jewish friend explained how people reacted to the shocking testimonies from Israeli soldiers about the lax open fire practices during the winter attacks of ‘Operation Cast Lead’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0308275X12449103">Harel, 2009</xref>). He said that as soon as senior military commanders dismissed the confessions as being hearsay about exceptional circumstances, most people he knew were reassured and the story largely dropped from public discourse. As opposed to the presumed intimacy and familiarity thought to come along with globalization’s ‘time-space compression’, sentiments such as these expressed by my interlocutors indicate the extremity of scalar distortion, and how existentially far away the two societies have become as a result of government policies that impose physical separation. As many others have noted, the production of colonial difference is often a project of producing spaces of distinction, as evidenced everywhere from South Africa’s Bantustans and Indian Reservations, to Jim Crow segregation in the American South, ‘a project of rule that hinged on the production of spatialized and racialized difference’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0308275X12449103">Subramanian, 2009</xref>). Even when the deeply imbricated nature of Palestinian and Israeli lives erupts into full view, as it did during the attacks of ‘Operation Cast Lead’, many Israelis manage to put the occupation and the occupied territories out of mind (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0308275X12449103">Derfner, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>This was not the case for all Israelis, however. Some were candid about the targeting of Gaza, and publicly justified their support of the Israeli attacks by portraying Hamas as being inhumane and inhuman. The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs described Gaza as a harbour for a fanatically homicidal group that was making ‘calculated and cynical’ use of a population they hold hostage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0308275X12449103">IMFA, 2009a</xref>). Israeli author Amos Oz averred that the calculations of Hamas (which he referred to as a ‘gang’) were ‘simple, cynical and evil’. In his assertions of their inhumanity, Oz summarized Hamas’s presumed thinking about loss of life during ‘Operation Cast Lead’, saying, ‘If innocent Israelis are killed – good. If innocent Palestinians are killed – even better’ (2008). An Israeli editorialist who referred to ‘Operation Cast Lead’ as ‘an entirely just war’ asserted that ‘the violence in the south derives from the despicable actions of an extremist organization that turned the Strip into a district of terror’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0308275X12449103">Shavit, 2009</xref>). These are just a few examples of the ways in which Gaza has been cemented in the imagination of some as a distinct kind of place. Scales of distance have been formed to deform Gaza. A place that is, in strict geographical terms, not physically distant from Israel – it is, after all, just across the Armistice Line that was drawn around Gaza following the creation of Israel in 1948 – has been stretched far away, projected into something housing a despised, remote and thus targetable, Other.</p>
<p>The use of spatial separation to cement social exclusion is of course not unique to Israel and the OPT. Theresa Caldeira, for example, has written of such practices in the context of the Brazilian city of São Paulo:<disp-quote>
<p>social groups … have used the fear of violence and crime to justify new techniques of exclusion and their withdrawal from traditional quarters of the cities.

<p>The segregation of Gaza is likewise imposed from above. Israel’s use of the Gaza Strip as a repository for all those considered too dangerous began during the second intifada. After the month-long Israeli siege of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem in 2002, 26 Palestinians were ‘exiled’ from the West Bank to the Gaza Strip. Since their banishment, Israel has continued to send West Bankers who they deem dangerous to live confined in Gaza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0308275X12449103">IPC, 2003</xref>). This production of a ‘fortified enclave’ that imprisons those deemed a threat is a tactic of a military occupation that highlights the complex connections between politics, military technology, space and semiosis. Gaza is at once made into a scary place that holds scary people, while the geographical scope and scale of Gazans’ existence is drastically reduced, isolated and distanced from others. Over more than 60 years, a dialectical process has entrenched Gaza’s distinctiveness. Because of the history of its spatial and scalar distancing, the place and its people has come to be seen as separate and different and, at the same time, the fact that it is perceived as so radically different has facilitated Israeli and international actions that cement it into a geographically distinct, excluded place of imprisonment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0308275X12449103">16</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec4-0308275X12449103"><title>Scale and distance in an enclaved nation: isolating the Gaza Strip from the West Bank</title>
<p>The isolation of Gaza has affected Palestinian society as well. After Israel’s 1967 occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza Strip, Palestinians from both areas had greater freedom of movement across the occupied territory. Many Gazan-based industries and agricultural businesses marketed their products in the West Bank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0308275X12449103">B’Tselem, 1998</xref>). Families intermarried, students from Gaza left the Strip to study in the West Bank, where the best Palestinian colleges are located, and so on.</p>
<p>Throughout the 1990s, Israel imposed a range of new requirements, crystallizing the separation of the Gaza Strip from the West Bank and the rest of the world. In 1991 Gaza residents were required to obtain a personal exit permit to leave. By 1993, some Gaza crossings were sporadically closed and even individuals holding exit permits were not allowed through. Seven years later, Palestinian students were entirely banned from travelling from Gaza to the West Bank, and travel between the two territories came under increasing restrictions throughout the second intifada. Since that time, Palestinians have been ‘closed in from all sides by Israel and must obtain exit permits when they want to leave [Gaza,] having to face bureaucratic obstacles and arbitrary decision-making by the Israeli authorities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0308275X12449103">B’Tselem, 1999</xref>). The comprehensive closures severely disrupted all social, familial and economic ties between residents in the two territories. Levels of deep poverty in Gaza sky-rocketed, along with concomitant elevations in rates of child labour and malnutrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0308275X12449103">Roy, 1999</xref>: 76–7). The isolation intensified after Hamas assumed full control of Gaza in June 2007, when Israeli and international sanctions imposed after their election to head the PA were tightened further.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0308275X12449103">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>This conceptual and physical separation has led to the coupling of Gaza with Hamas in the imagination of the international community and, perhaps unexpectedly, the physical division between the territories continues to fuel strong opinions about Gaza among other Palestinians too.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0308275X12449103">18</xref></sup> The national scale has been eroded, allowing Gazans’ existence within a permanent state of political ambivalence to inflect outsiders’ understandings of the trapped population itself. From a West Bank perspective, the opacity of the Gaza Strip hides a somewhat mysterious and, for many, decidedly ‘backward’ population. Time and again, West Bankers told me that ‘simple people’, those perceived to be uneducated, unsophisticated, easily persuaded, especially in isolated Gaza, were being duped by Hamas. The word <italic>basit</italic> (simple) describes those who are honest, sincere, never duplicitous, even if naïve and low on cunning. The quality of being simple, which Palestinians regularly use to describe Gazans, is often considered to be a good thing in Palestinian society generally, but still contributes towards the categorical division of Gazans from other Palestinians.</p>
<p>What is also commonly known about Gaza, at least among Palestinians, is the poverty, the social conservatism, the inhumane ghetto conditions in which over 1.5 million people live cooped up in a strip of land 10 km wide and 45 km long, with no chance of exit. Israel controls most land, and all sea and air access. And while most Palestinians would recognize the occupation to be the cause of these conditions, nevertheless, Gazans regularly have been considered different, unbalanced, even dangerous. As Simmel observed:<disp-quote>
<p>Men seldom have a calm and rational attitude toward strangers or persons only partially known. The folly which treats the unknown as the non-existent, and the anxious imaginativeness which inflates the unknown at once into gigantic dangers and horrors, are wont to take turns in guiding human actions. (1906: 497)</p></disp-quote>Simmel’s insights into the dynamics of stranger-ness and the inflated scales of the dangerous unknown are illustrated in reactions to a ‘safe passage’ overland connection between Gaza and the West Bank, which opened briefly in 1999. The anxious imaginations of West Bankers began to swell. Fears that circulated throughout the West Bank around this time expanded into rumours of Gazans coming to pillage and rape.</p>
<p>Although the Interim Agreement (Oslo II Accords) between the PLO and Israel included the promise of this ‘safe passage’ along a 43 km route linking the Gaza Strip and the southern West Bank city of Hebron, like so many other promises of the Oslo period, it went unfulfilled. The route, which was never accessible for the majority of applicants, was completely closed in October 2000 when the second intifada began, and the separation since then has been almost total (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0308275X12449103">B’Tselem 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0308275X12449103">Roy, 1999</xref>: 74). As a result, one is much more likely to run across an American than a Gazan in the West Bank.</p>
<p>Since the second intifada began, the only mixing has come as a result of the forced internal exile of those whom the Israeli state wants to punish (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0308275X12449103">MacAskill, 2002</xref>). Ten years after the Bethlehem fighters were expelled to Gaza, many of them are still there, prevented from seeing their families in the West Bank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0308275X12449103">Ma’an News, 2009</xref>). During the first months of their stay in Gaza, some of the (non-Hamas) exiled Bethlehemites told me that they were most uncomfortable in their new surroundings. They derided the regnant mores and bristled especially at the social conservatism of their Gazan compatriots.</p>
<p>As a result of this sense of separation between people throughout Palestine, and the felt expansion of distances between scales of events and kinds of people in Gaza and the West Bank, when the Israeli attacks on Gaza began in 2008, West Bankers were not only consigned to the sidelines, many felt they were not even part of the same game, and some did not care. A college student told me that ‘the war on Gaza was the most depressing time’. The distress of the period was still evident on her face as she recalled the West Bank Palestinian Authority’s prevention of demonstrations. ‘The whole time all we could do was sit helplessly, watching it on the TV. There was no chance to do a march or demonstration, because the PA was preventing it. Either we could go out and march and get beat up, or sit at home and “eat air”’, she said, using a Palestinian colloquialism that reflects a deep level of frustration, despair and impotence. Another West Bank resident, an NGO worker and ex-political activist was disgusted with the whole situation. He asserted that nobody in the West Bank even cared, and after the first few days of the war, they stopped paying attention altogether. Other Palestinians told me, with notable repugnance, that some activists of Hamas’s rival faction, Fateh, actually celebrated gleefully when an Israeli airstrike killed the Hamas Interior Minister, Said Sayyam.</p>
<p>Although it may be the case that perceptions of Gaza (and Hamas) in Israel and the United States are practically more significant and more relevant to the internationally circulating justifications for targeting Gaza, perceptions of geographical and social distance between the West Bank and Gaza were important locally. They have contributed to dampened sentiments of national solidarity, localizing Hamas and its supporters. Some relegate that party and the Gaza Strip to an extra-national space, encouraging the ongoing political split between the Hanniyah-led Palestinian Authority in Gaza and the government led by Mahmood Abbas and Salam Fayyad in the West Bank.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0308275X12449103"><title>Varying the rates and intensities of violence: scales of occupation then and now</title>
<p>The disengagement and dismantling of settlements in Gaza was one of the more recent Israeli measures with spatial and scalar ramifications that spread across the oPt and Israel, and affected mutually suspicious perceptions among West Bankers, Gazans and Israelis. Two other practices, home demolitions and killing, are prongs of occupation practice that have been witnessed throughout the last 40 years, and in intensified fashion in the Gaza attacks. Here the scalar elements of temporality and rates of destruction become relevant.</p>
<p>That the scale of occupation violence has been historically variable is evident when the tactics of ‘Operation Cast Lead’, and specifically the increased concentration of violence in a period of time in a specific place, are compared to occupation events in historical context. While the pace and expanse of demolitions intensified during ‘Operation Cast Lead’, demolitions as a means of collective punishment and land expropriation have been a standard element of occupation policy for years. Throughout the 2008–9 attacks, systematic demolition of structures ‘including houses, water installations, such as tanks on the roofs of houses, and of agricultural land’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0308275X12449103">UN, 2009</xref>: 105) was apparent, occurring ‘without any evident military purpose … when there was no fighting in these areas’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0308275X12449103">HRW, 2010</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0308275X12449103">19</xref></sup> In one case, the shelling of a house also resulted in the death of 22 people from the Al-Daya family, and one attack on a mosque occurred when people were at prayer, killing and wounding many of them. But the UN reports that since the occupation began in 1967, ‘the Israeli authorities have demolished thousands of Palestinian-owned structures in the oPt, including an estimated 2000 houses in East Jerusalem’ alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0308275X12449103">UN OCHA, 2009</xref>). Israeli human rights organization B’Tselem has recorded the destruction of some 4170 Palestinian homes since the beginning of the second intifada in September 2000 through November 2004, which the group refers to as a ‘policy of mass demolition of Palestinian houses in the Occupied Territories’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0308275X12449103">B’Tselem, 2004</xref>). In that same period, Israel destroyed some 2370 housing units in the Gaza Strip alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0308275X12449103">B’Tselem, 2011</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0308275X12449103">HRW, 2011</xref>). Tactics that Israel used during ‘Operation Cast Lead’ and which were recorded in human rights reports and internationally condemned have long been part of the Palestinian experience of life under occupation in Gaza.</p>
<p>Likewise, while the level and pace of killing and physical harm rose steeply during the two-week assault of ‘Operation Cast Lead,’ the occupation has, at a steady but slower rate, caused the death and injury of thousands of Palestinians, the vast majority of them civilians. Sometimes it has been one or two Palestinians a week. At other times, it is an entire family in one day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0308275X12449103">HRW, 2006</xref>). What ‘Operation Cast Lead’ did was to increase and concentrate the scale of occupation violence.</p>
<p>Among other occupation practices and tactics that were implemented with particular vigour during the attack on Gaza were: the use of human shields, improper use of chemical weapons, the delay and denial of medical aid to the sick and wounded, torture, inhumane and humiliating treatment of prisoners, and restrictions on freedom of movement. Torture, home demolitions and movement restrictions are occupation measures that have been in clear evidence for the past 40 years (see for example Al-Haq, 1981; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0308275X12449103">B’Tselem, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0308275X12449103">HRW, 1994</xref>). The twentieth report of the UN Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Population of the Occupied Territories in 1988 gives some indication of the continuity in occupation measures:<disp-quote>
<p>The uprising has been marked by a heavy toll of casualties among the Palestinian population. Hundreds of civilians have been killed by security forces, settlers, or under various other circumstances. The death toll has included casualties caused by shooting, beating, gas inhalation or electrocution. While several thousands of civilians have been physically injured, the entire Palestinian population has suffered as a result of the implementation by the Israeli authorities of the policy of ‘force, power and blows’. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0308275X12449103">UNGA, 1988</xref>)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>As the Goldstone Commission noted, Israeli officials’ statements and military actions on the ground during the Gaza operations of 2008–9 indicated:<disp-quote>
<p>that the Israeli military conception of what was necessary in a war with Hamas viewed disproportionate destruction and creating the maximum disruption in the lives of many people as a legitimate means to achieve not only military but also political goals. Statements by Israeli leaders to the effect that the destruction of civilian objects would be justified as a response to rocket attacks (‘destroy 100 homes for every rocket fired’), indicate the possibility of resort to reprisals [which are against international humanitarian law]. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0308275X12449103">UN, 2009</xref>: 22)</p></disp-quote>A similar strain in the Israeli policy of reprisals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0308275X12449103">Blechman, 1972</xref>) and ‘force, power and blows’ has been apparent for decades.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0308275X12449103">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>‘Operation Cast Lead’ was one stark instance of a long-term approach, one which gained considerable attention because of its dramatic manifestations over those 22 days. But the fundamental contours of that violence, although engraved in bold script at that time, were wholly familiar within the occupied Palestinian territory. I would disagree with Nordstrom, then, who claims that ‘it is in the act of violence … that the definition of war is to be found’ (1997: 114). For Gaza, it is the defining of a situation as war, and its implied exceptionalism, that allows for the regular violence to continue – routinized and unremarked, passed over without outrage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0308275X12449103"><title>Population density</title>
<p>Scalar politics remained central throughout the controversy and debate that followed the publication of the Goldstone Commission’s report. The issue of population concentration, the size of a group of people in a delimited space, became particularly important as Israeli officials, Palestinians and human rights groups told conflicting stories about the protection of civilians (or lack thereof) during and after the fighting. Israel’s overall control of the Gaza Strip, their army’s military superiority and the residential density of the Strip were all factors shaping the violence during ‘Operation Cast Lead’, including Hamas’s choices about how to resist the attacks with the guerrilla tactics at their disposal. Hamas was castigated for fighting from within civilian populated areas, and indeed for actively bringing civilians to danger ‘because Hamas wants them hurt anyway’, as the Israeli Foreign Ministry’s senior deputy legal adviser at the time (later named Israeli ambassador to London), Daniel Taub, said at a talk at Cambridge University in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0308275X12449103">Taub, 2010</xref>). This representation of the ‘chilling abuse’ on the part of Hamas in Gaza contributed to the demonization of the organization and the sense that Gaza is a place beyond the pale.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0308275X12449103">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>While the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs described the Gaza Strip as a ‘launching pad’ for Hamas (IMFA, n.d.), others brought to light the manipulations of scale at work in the Israeli discourse and practices. Numerous human rights voices called attention to the ways in which the Israeli military conflated Gaza, Hamas, terror and target-ability. Kenneth Roth of Human Rights Watch observed that the Israeli military’s ‘expansive definition of a military target’ provided for their attacks against ‘a range of civilian facilities, from government offices to police stations’, and was based on the spurious justification ‘that they all provided at least indirect support to Hamas militants’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0308275X12449103">Roth, 2009</xref>). For Israel, and in the international discourse of the ‘war against terror’, ‘anything affiliated with Hamas is a legitimate target’, as Israeli human rights NGO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0308275X12449103">B’Tselem critically observed (2008)</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0308275X12449103">22</xref></sup> And the Goldstone Commission report likewise noted that in ‘the framing of Israeli military objectives with regard to the Gaza operations, the concept of Hamas’ “supporting infrastructure” is particularly worrying as it appears to transform civilians and civilian objects into legitimate targets’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0308275X12449103">UN, 2009</xref>: 22).</p>
<p>Despite these human rights warnings, the military’s approach to Gaza left many civilians and much civilian infrastructure destroyed (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0308275X12449103">HRW, 2009b</xref>). Referring to the international humanitarian law principle that forbids attacking a military target if the harm to civilians or civilian property is excessive, Israeli Foreign Ministry’s senior deputy legal adviser asserted that the nature of Hamas’s presence within the civilian population made ‘proportionality’ a ‘horrendously complicated task’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0308275X12449103">Taub, 2010</xref>). And no doubt it was. Sources outside the Israeli government, including the Goldstone Commission report and the International Crisis Group, also reported that Hamas fought from within populated urban areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0308275X12449103">ICG, 2009</xref>: 3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0308275X12449103">UN, 2009</xref>: 113). The UN Commission noted that:<disp-quote>
<p>given the densely populated character of the northern half of the Gaza Strip, once Israeli forces gained control of the more open or outlying areas during the first days of the ground invasion, most – if not all – locations still accessible to Palestinian armed groups were in urban areas. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0308275X12449103">UN, 2009</xref>: 147)</p></disp-quote>To be sure, the dynamics of guerrilla fighting, and those of an army fighting guerrillas, are also largely shaped by scalar and spatial dimensions. What I want to draw attention to here, though, is the way in which the Israeli government’s spokespeople continued to defend their actions and shift the blame, asserting that Hamas intentionally ‘brings civilians to danger’. In so doing, they deflected their own responsibility for their violence against civilians. They also ignored the causes of Gaza’s population density and Hamas fighters’ literal physical and social position within it.</p>
<p>Almost every academic analysis, human rights report or journalistic story about Gaza mentions the fact that it is one of the most densely populated tracts of land in the world. Scalar politics in particular has produced the naturalization of that density, part of the active creation of a terror-territory and the entrenchment of a notion of density that has become a common-sense, understood feature of the place, a condition that is understood to bring with it an inherently troubled and troublesome population. But the Gaza Strip is not naturally a cauldron of extreme strife. It was made that way and is kept that way by people and politics. Since the doubling of the Gaza Strip’s population with the flood of refugees in 1948–9, the over-population has been exacerbated by practices stemming from the nature of Israel’s occupation: one factor being Israel’s refusal to allow most people to leave. Another is Palestinians’ tendency towards large families, which is in part a way that people produce their own social safety nets when living under conditions of extreme deprivation such as those which exist in the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>As the attacks wound down, and journalists and human rights investigators were finally allowed in to the Gaza Strip – as Israel had banned them during the fighting – the narrative quickly shifted to questions about the scale, nature and appropriateness of the violence, thus drawing a conceptual boundary around those 22 days and around the Gaza Strip. The Goldstone Commission presented the report of the Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict to the UN Human Rights Council on 29 September 2009. Although, in its own terms, the report ‘analysed the historical context of the events that led to the military operations in Gaza between during the period from 27 December 2008 and 18 January 2009 and the links between these operations and overarching Israeli policies vis-à-vis the Occupied Palestinian Territory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0308275X12449103">UN, 2009</xref>: 14), the focus of debate and public discourse subsequent to the report has not been on the occupation. Instead, the emphasis has been on the incidents detailed in the report, questions about the objectivity or bias evident in the UN’s handling of the fact-finding mission, and whether or not Hamas and Israel have responded adequately (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0308275X12449103">Al Jazeera, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0308275X12449103">Chehata, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0308275X12449103">Goldstone, 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0308275X12449103" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Military and political strategies of the Israeli army and government, and the spatial imaginings and narrations promulgated by Palestinians, Israelis and others are all part of contesting efforts to command the ways in which the socio-spatial ‘place’ of Gaza in the world is experienced and understood. A perfect storm of different kinds of scales – of distance (spatial and experiential), time (continuity and disruption), violence (intensified and routine) and density (of population) – came together to make this ‘war’ on Gaza occur, and for many it was perceived and portrayed as extraordinary. These manipulations of space have led to a sense that Gaza is peculiar, to the equation of Gaza with Hamas, and to the strained interactions between Gaza and the West Bank.</p>
<p>Critical international relations theorists have pointed out that the ways in which war is waged, and how war is defined, are socially and historically constituted within ‘processes of global social change’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0308275X12449103">Barkawi and Laffey, 1999</xref>: 419). To an extent, then, this article has followed programmatic statements from scholars such as these who call for the centring of war as an object of inquiry, and who stress that the power of war resides in ‘political investments in truths about war’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0308275X12449103">Barkawi and Brighton, 2011</xref>: 127, 129). By expanding the analysis of scale to encompass its many dimensions, I have also attempted to intervene in the power/knowledge relations that war and other kinds of violence create and depend upon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0308275X12449103">Barkawi and Brighton, 2011</xref>: 129). The labelling of Israel’s ongoing situation of belligerent military occupation as war, and the exceptionalism implied in that term, highlights the importance of remaining vigilant to the semiotic, sensorial, scalar practices that are entailed in defining who is and who can become the targets of violence in its many forms.</p>
<p>The occupation’s circular dynamic has enabled the designation of ‘Operation Cast Lead’ as a war. Gaza has been exceptionalized and isolated, allowing it to be the target of mounting levels of violence. At the same time the exceptionally intense forms of violence during 22 days in 2008–9 drew attention to ‘Operation Cast Lead’ as a war. In the midst of the outrage about ‘Operation Cast Lead’, left unremarked were the steadily increasing levels of military violence Israel had been unleashing in Gaza. An escalation in the use of helicopter gunships against civilian institutions occurred in May and June of 2004, for example.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0308275X12449103">23</xref></sup> And in an unprecedented wave of Israeli attacks after the abduction of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in June 2006, Israeli forces bombed civilian infrastructure and by the end of August had killed 226 Palestinians, 54 of whom were minors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0308275X12449103">B’Tselem, 2006</xref>). Israel attacked the Gaza Strip several times after Shalit’s capture. As the Israeli human rights organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0308275X12449103">B’Tselem reported, between June 2006 through 26 December 2008</xref> (the beginning of ‘Operation Cast Lead’): ‘Israel killed 522 Palestinians who were not taking part in the hostilities. This number included 195 minors, 49 women, and 25 men over age 50.’ Israel loosened its open-fire regulations, increased its ‘targeted-killing’ operations, and reduced ‘the minimal space allowed between a civilian population and the area from which the army fires shells from 300 meters to only 100 meters’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0308275X12449103">B’Tselem, 2006</xref>; n.d. a). The label ‘war’, itself a function of the politics of scale, has had paradoxical effects. On the one hand the term ‘war’ expressed the widespread shock and abhorrence that the attacks on Gaza sparked across many levels of global civil society. On the other hand, ‘war’ misleadingly suggests a set of practices between two equal sides that happen within a bounded time, and which are distinct from the long-term and ongoing occupation, which was not the case in the Gaza Strip. It called attention to the 22 days of ‘Operation Cast Lead’, and helped render invisible the extent of Israel’s persistent control over the Gaza Strip and the rest of the occupied territory, thereby normalizing the everyday violence of occupation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0308275X12449103">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Berreman, writing with a different generation’s theory of scale, hoped ‘that in the effort to comprehend the relationships among size, complexity, social organization, and social relations in societies around the world we will be concerned for the people who live in them’ (1978: 226). This article shares something of that hope, and demonstrates how the ways in which scalar relationships are obscured contribute to the deliberate lack of such basic human concern.</p>
