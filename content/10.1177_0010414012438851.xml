<p>Democracy is a process revered for its facilitation of popular sovereignty but long questioned by political thinkers and observers like Aristotle and Tocqueville for its effectiveness as a primary form of government. In his book <italic>Direct Democracy Worldwide</italic>, David Altman moves beyond the classic narratives of Greek city-states and New England town halls to demonstrate that this form of government is pertinent today despite its still relatively modest use at the national level. However, although some forms of direct democracy, particularly citizen initiatives, may enhance a larger representational context, others offer little opportunity for authentic popular voice. Direct democracy here is a tool, rather than a system, a tool that has the potential to be harnessed to refine the limitations of representation. Thus, Altman provides a rich evaluation of the possibilities for such input—a much needed addition to this literature—while initiating a longer term agenda for scholars of democracy.</p>
<p>More historic understandings of direct democracy have offered a simplistic understanding of its use: Citizens gather in a common place, or through a ballot, and themselves determine the policy that will govern their polity. Yet Altman provokes the reader to consider a much more complex constellation of possibilities in his first chapter. Rather than consider direct democracy as a Weberian ideal type of political order, he effectively offers a vision of this process as a function within a larger representational system. The impact of such an instrument may vary depending on a host of factors: whether it is mandatory under law or merely permissible, whether outcomes are binding or merely a pulse poll, whether it responds to or is actually a vehicle for change, and, most important, whether it is generated by the elite or the masses. This conceptualization produces less impactful plebiscites as well as more empowering initiatives and referendums. The assortment of popular consultation is further complicated by the presence of quorum requirements for validity of the vote as well as the level of support needed for successful passage. Thus, the institutional configurations can hamper the authentic measure of the will of the people or serve as a safety valve to release popular pressure that might otherwise, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0010414012438851">Huntington’s (1968)</xref> sense, lead to unrest or revolt. In fact, Altman (p. 73) notes that the use of these measures, although not as extensive as aspiring democrats might hope, does occur more frequently than destabilizing acts such as coups and revolutions.</p>
<p>Casting aside the long-assumed dichotomy between direct and representative democracy, Altman revisits the classic works of Dahl, Madison, and others. However, rather than nesting his discussion within the establishment of minimal conditions of access, Altman is concerned about the actual engagement of the citizenry as an indicator of the quality of democracy. Certainly, the potential for this engagement, the presence of a direct mechanism in the institutional structure, does not always equate to the general will. Yet Altman disabuses the reader that the process necessarily promotes instability, undercuts representatives, or responds to incompetent citizens and even moneyed interests. He acknowledges that although not perfect, they can “serve as an intermittent safety valve against the perverse or unresponsive behavior of representative institutions and politicians” (p. 59). The key to success is an institutional design with the potential to empower the people within the representative structure.</p>
<p>In addition to a careful theoretical exposition, the author provides an impressive empirical analysis to reveal the growing presence of mechanisms of direct democracy (MDDs). Having gathered an exhaustive database of national level of MDDs and incorporated an abundance of political, social, and economic indicators, Altman’s savvy analysis yields a rich harvest. MDDs have increased, especially in the past few years, though a few particular countries (Switzerland, Italy, Lichtenstein) account for a significant portion of the use. Although nondemocratic regimes have some use of this tool, usually to generate diffuse support for their policies, democratic countries compose the largest and growing segment of use. However, only one third of the events are constituted of grassroots activity—the citizen-initiated option, which is most consistent with the nature of direct democracy. Both top down (TD-MDDs) and grassroots (CI-MDDs) mechanisms are more frequent for those countries with a higher level of democracy, a presidential system, and former communist rule as well as those that have significant numbers of neighbors using these institutions. TD-MDDs also occur less frequently in royal dictatorships, where rule is legitimated by divine right, than in civil or military dictatorships, where generation of that support is critical. CI-MDDs have greater occurrences in countries with an encouraging political culture, which has devolved power through federal or descended from the participatory culture of Great Britain’s colonial rule, or experienced economic challenge. Altman’s analysis at the global, regional, and country-specific levels of analysis provides a very robust picture of a less frequently studied institution.</p>
<p>Looking more closely at the variation across regime types, Altman spends some time engaging a paradox of his research—dictators in nondemocratic regimes and executives in weak democracies who employ their own MDDs. To maintain power, these regimes still must maintain legitimacy, or what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0010414012438851">David Easton (1965)</xref> terms “diffuse support,” and even fear. For nondemocratic countries, the irony of this popular “opportunity” is evidenced in the overwhelming support for regimes—only 3 times in 254 did the government lose; in those instances, it foreshadowed transitions where governments lost power (p. 95). Likewise, weak democracies themselves also offer a conundrum for scholars—Altman notes (p. 110) that although most Latin American constitutions provide such “opportunity for input,” it tends to be consultative and subject to a weakly institutionalized political system. The activity in this area has also been primarily elite driven. With the exception of recall measures in Bolivia and Venezuela, failed ones at that, presidents have used the mechanism to bolster support for themselves, their administrations, and their initiatives without providing much authentic response to the people. Although the brief case studies for both types of regime offer some enlightenment to the unexpected power these events can have, the reader is left wondering how MDD can consistently be used as a term to examine events in these types of regimes. Clearly the emphasis in these chapters is on the engagement of the people; yet a more nuanced use of terminology might further clarify the process. Furthermore, for the weak democracies in question, those in Latin America, the author does not effectively address the issue of culture—what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0010414012438851">Wiarda (2003)</xref> terms the Iberian-Latin tradition—a hierarchical basis that has also created a disconnect between popular civic engagement and political engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0010414012438851">Forment, 2003</xref>). This additional evidence at least raises questions as to whether Latin Americans are truly willing to use popular input in constructive ways. Thus, there is room for a more extensive cultural analysis, given that the application of democracy is conditioned by the context.</p>
<p>To unpack the impact of MDDs in an effective democracy, Altman focuses on what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0010414012438851">Eckstein (1975)</xref> might call a crucial case study—Uruguay—though one might think it a deviant case in the region given the relative divergence in its political and cultural history. Although Uruguay has experienced a variety of forms of democracy, despite a brief interruption in the 1970s and 1980s with authoritarian rule, Altman credits the effective institutionalization of democratic ideals as well as the liberalization of MDDs as an institution in providing citizens of Uruguay with a distinct opportunity to affect the political process. Examining the outcomes of these votes, the influences are remarkably similar to the voting literature in the United States, which indicates the relevance of partisanship and economic conditions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0010414012438851">Abramson, Aldrich, &amp; Rohde, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, the use of MDDs has actually had an impact of constraining the government when it attempted to eliminate critical public services, but mainly when there was significant popular mobilization around the issue. Qualitative data from interviews with several past presidents also reveal a commitment on the part of these individuals to the practice of democracy and the recognition of popular sovereignty. This thorough review might be clarified by emphasis of other significant ways in which Uruguay differs from many of its neighbors in the region: There is a very small non-European population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0010414012438851">Central Intelligence Agency, 2011</xref>), which means that the racial stratification that has scarred other countries in the area has had less political implication; likewise, its relatively low level of poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0010414012438851">Central Intelligence Agency, 2011</xref>) also provides for a population that is able to focus on higher order concerns such as political engagement.</p>
<p>In all, Altman provides an impressive array of research in a compact volume. Incorporating not only an original data set analyzed through a variety of quantitative techniques but also a careful historical discussion as supplement, the author paints a vivid picture of popular sovereignty across the globe and regime type. This research also raises questions for further study at regional (province or state) and local levels, providing a much more abundant picture of direct democracy. Yet it also begs the question as to whether any popular opportunity within any political system may be called a mechanism of direct democracy or whether this terminology needs to be revisited. With that, Altman brings the scholarly community back to the perennial question of what exactly constitutes democracy.</p>
