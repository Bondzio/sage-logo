<p>In this first issue of 2013, <italic>The Diabetes Educator</italic> (<italic>TDE</italic>) welcomes <italic>AADE in Practice</italic>, a new practice-based magazine published bimonthly (opposite <italic>TDE</italic>) by Sage Publications. For several years, AADE has conducted Information Needs Assessments to examine AADE’s current mix of publications and gather member feedback on publications and format/delivery preferences. While members have highly rated <italic>TDE</italic> as their “go-to” source for research-related articles/literature reviews on areas related to diabetes education, readers have commented that AADE’s publications need to offer more practical-related advice and tips for educators. We are delighted to meet the needs of our members/readers by expanding <italic>AADE in Practice</italic>. Strategies for working with patients will be common features published in <italic>AADE in Practice</italic>. Topics will include behavior change/self-management strategies, pharmaceuticals/emerging therapies, and standards of practice/best practices to name a few.</p>
<p>The focus and aim of <italic>AADE in Practice</italic> is to provide health care professionals who specialize in diabetes education and care with the tools and strategies for practical application of current research and best practices in diabetes education. The publication will complement <italic>TDE</italic> by emphasizing the translation of research into practice. Potential article categories include tools for improving practice, practice pearls, reviews of new technologies/apps/online resources, application of continuous quality improvement (CQI), business aspects of diabetes education, tips for translating practice into research, briefs on current practice trends, and profiles of diabetes educators who are making a difference.</p>
<p>We welcome Teresa Pearson, MS, RN, CDE, FAADE, as Executive Editor of <italic>AADE in Practice</italic>. As current Editor of <italic>AADE in Practice</italic>, we are excited about the transition and new vision Teresa brings to this valuable resource for AADE members. She has a solid history of writing and publishing articles with a keen ability to translate research, science, and current trends in a way that readers can apply it to their own practice. She is no stranger to the diabetes community and has a broad base to draw from given her expertise and experience as she launches another first for AADE.</p>
<p>Once again we welcome <italic>AADE in Practice</italic> and are pleased with the progress made on our goal of providing readers with a more practice-based publication. We are excited about moving into 2013 and look forward to your comments to help guide our publications. Let us know if there are topics you would like to see covered in future issues of <italic>TDE</italic> and <italic>AADE in Practice</italic>. Please feel free to contact me directly at the university with any comments/ideas at <email>jfain@umassd.edu</email>.</p>
