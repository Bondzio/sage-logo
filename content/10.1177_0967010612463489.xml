<abstract>
<p>The concept of human security continues to defy definitional clarity at the same time as it is being embraced by policymakers. This article proposes a practice-grounded approach that focuses on investigative method as a way of linking conceptual understanding of human security to the research process. Probing the ‘actorness’ of individuals in volatile contexts, a study of insecurity in Kosovo shows how dialogue can be applied as a research tool to access and assess human security in the field. Dialogue permits recognition of the power of the researched in the construction of knowledge of security, and accordingly reflects the conceptual shift represented by human security from states to communities and individuals. In the Kosovo study, dialogic research captured individual agency in the face of pervasive insecurity and revealed contradictory effects of such agency. This led to the formulation of the idea of the <italic>multidirectional security marker</italic> as a means of understanding experiences of insecurity in relation to strategies to combat it. Three such markers – self-reliance, informality and community solidarity – emerged and are analysed in the case of Kosovo. Simultaneously denoting restrictions on people’s security and possibilities for overcoming those very same limitations, the markers express the agential dimension of human security and show how agency and security interact.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Definitional arguments continue to dominate, even dog, debates about human security. This is despite the fact that human security ideas have become increasingly mainstreamed by practitioners in conflict and post-conflict settings. In addition, versions of the concept of human security have been appropriated by actors traditionally more concerned with geopolitics and state security (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0967010612463489">Owen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0967010612463489">Chandler, 2008a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0967010612463489">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0967010612463489">Muggah and Krause, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0967010612463489">Makarychev, 2012</xref>). Examples as diverse as US counterinsurgency doctrine, the use of ‘population security’ in Afghanistan, and the European Union’s security policies and peacebuilding discourses suggest that there is an ongoing shift towards implementing human-centred forms of security. While there may indeed be something problematic about attaching the specific label of human security to such policy initiatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0967010612463489">Martin and Owen, 2010</xref>), this has stopped neither the emergence of human security approaches by any other name nor their use ‘without hesitation by the breadth of security and development actors’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0967010612463489">Christie, forthcoming</xref>). The result is a paradox. On the one hand, there is the conceptual confusion and contestation that continues to surround human security. On the other, policy practices embrace the concept with increasing confidence and conviction. The proliferation of so-called human security approaches arguably demands a continuation of the definition debate. In this article, we propose a practice-grounded approach. This approach aims to understand human security through an exploration of method. Investigating insecurity on the ground <italic>via</italic> the application of ‘bespoke’ research tools allows us to better identify what human security is and where to find it. It also seeks to enrich our understanding through differentiating the concept from traditional types of security. In other words, our position is one of ‘finding meaning in method’.</p>
<p>We address the definitional impasse and fuzziness of meaning attached to the human security concept through a focus on the agential qualities of human security. The conceptual debate traditionally begins with an interrogation of security as being <italic>for someone –</italic> asking ‘for whom?’ – rather than with questions such as ‘security of what?’ or ‘by what means?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0967010612463489">Gasper, forthcoming</xref>). It answers by conferring a privileged position on the individual, or on groups of individuals within security discourse, rather than on the state or institutions such as sovereignty. However, this proves to be only a jumping off point, as human security debates have become preoccupied with other questions about what it is to be human, how being human modifies notions of security, how expansive the idea of risk in relation to individuals should be, whether certain threats even constitute security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0967010612463489">King and Murray, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0967010612463489">MacFarlane and Khong, 2006</xref>), how much security individuals are entitled to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0967010612463489">Krause, 2004</xref>), and whether, where and how security should be delimited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0967010612463489">Owen, 2004</xref>). As the puzzle fragments progressively, what is left, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0967010612463489">Gasper (forthcoming)</xref> notes, is a complex and contested semantic field where not only subjectivity, but also culture, community and solidarity all claim our attention as we attempt to attach meaning to the term human security.</p>
<p>The point of entry for both scholarly and practitioner-orientated discussions of meaning and definition is not agency, but rather vulnerability. Considering human security in terms of managing threats to individuals and which kinds of threats deserve attention has led down a path marked by the dualism between broad and narrow conceptions and the operational difficulties of both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0967010612463489">Paris, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0967010612463489">Werthes and Debiel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0967010612463489">Tadjbakhsh and Chenoy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0967010612463489">Glasius, 2008</xref>). This focus has the effect of immediately deactivating individuals, who are rendered more passive and objectified in the face of attacks on their personal safety and/or well-being, on the one hand, or by the techniques of control designed and deployed by others to rescue them, on the other. In contrast, we are interested in the ‘actorness’ of individuals in dangerous and difficult environments, in terms of how they confront dilemmas of survival and develop a role in articulating a picture of (in)security that provokes others to act to assist them. By putting ‘the individual at the centre of debate, analysis and policy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0967010612463489">Thakur, 2004</xref>: 347–8; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0967010612463489">Tadjbakhsh and Chenoy, 2007</xref>: 13), human security can be said to articulate an agential view of security. Indeed, for some, empowerment and emancipation constitute the whole point of offering a radical reworking of traditional security approaches, although the extent to which agency is incorporated into human security is frequently not spelled out. Engagement with agency is more evident in the case of marginalized minority groups who are given voice and power in human security discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0967010612463489">Suhrke, 1999</xref>, 271–2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0967010612463489">Hudson, 2005</xref>).</p> <p>Coming from the development field, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0967010612463489">Amartya Sen (2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0967010612463489">1999a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0967010612463489">b</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0967010612463489">Sabina Alkire (2005)</xref> are more deliberate in establishing agency as an additional prerequisite of human security. This concern is reflected in the ‘protection plus empowerment’ formula adopted by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0967010612463489">Commission on Human Security (2003)</xref>. Agency also finds expression in concerns about the sustainability of security practices premised on the need for local people to participate in reconstruction or resilience activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0967010612463489">Khagram et al., 2003</xref>: 290; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0967010612463489">Barnett and Adger, 2007</xref>). Yet, here again the emphasis is on a normative proposition of how human security can or should reshape our views of the security problematic, leaving unexplored a relative dearth of empirically grounded illustrations of how agency and security interact in practice. For some scholars, agency also forms part of the contestation of human security, contributing to the critique that it is a conservative framework that pathologizes local populations to render them susceptible to external intervention and a perpetuation of their limited or non-agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0967010612463489">McCormack, 2008</xref>: 114).</p>
<p>In this article, we develop and illustrate the use of dialogue as a research tool that allows us to pursue the ‘feedback loop’ that links conceptual understanding of human security to the research process. Dialogue permits recognition of the agential power of the researched in the construction of knowledge of human security, as well as providing insights into the complexity of lived experiences of insecurity. The dialogic approach leads us to identify self-reliance, informality and community solidarity as three <italic>multidirectional security markers</italic> in Kosovo. These <italic>markers</italic> are a means to identify and explore contradictory effects of agency in relation to security, because they simultaneously denote both opportunities and constraints on people’s ability to change their circumstances.</p>
<p>The article is structured as follows. We first make the case for dialogue as a research tool for furthering the understanding of human security. This is in line with our argument that the conceptual shift in human security towards individuals and communities requires a parallel shift in research methods. We proceed to illustrate this argument by applying dialogue as a way of investigating human security in Kosovo. A description of the research process is accompanied by a presentation of the key findings. A discussion of <italic>multidirectional security markers</italic> as a means of capturing complex enactments and effects of agency in response to multiple and interconnected sources of insecurity is followed by the presentation of empirical data from the field. We conclude by reflecting on the idea of finding ‘meaning from method’, while highlighting the importance of knowledge production in human security studies.</p>

<title>Human security: Definitional impasse and dialogic research</title>
<p>We contend that part of the reason for the gap in empirically driven knowledge about human security stems from a disconnect between the rethinking of security and the way in which security is researched. The definitional impasse and conceptual fuzziness of human security may be a product not just of an excess of normative reasoning, but also of the failure to apply suitable investigative tools. Critical thinking about security has relied largely on methods of knowledge production that are rooted in established conventions about the nature of security and its goals, while purporting to offer new analytical perspectives. The change of referent object from the state to people is the most visible sign of a transformation of analytical and operational parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0967010612463489">Newman, 2001</xref>: 239; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0967010612463489">Bilgin, 2003</xref>: 208–9). However, human security has paid scant attention to the methodological implications of shifting security away from the nation-state towards the local, individual and personal. Distance is assumed and accepted between the researcher/outsider and the insider who is individual/local. The power relationship between the targets/victims of security and the externals analysing insecurity also remains weighted in favour of the latter. This gap between concept and research practice has been further highlighted by recent scholarship that begins to probe the nature of knowledge and knowledge production within the new discourses of security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0967010612463489">Hampson, 2008</xref>: 241–2). Therefore, an exploration of how people and groups are treated in research on human security as well as in policy implementation ought to be consistent with the conceptual shift of security away from the nation-state, territory, borders and macro-politics and into individual life-worlds. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0967010612463489">Stuvøy (2010</xref>: 280) points out, human security ought to be a matter of research practice.</p>
<p>Critical security studies have begun to tap into a rich vein of insights that suggest productive avenues for human security research to pursue. In particular, by taking security as socially situated and discursively defined, these approaches begin to break down the universalism embedded in global security. Accordingly, they start to rethink it as a site of ‘shifting political imaginaries and practices’, in which ‘complex processes of accommodation, rejection and reformulation’ and the salience of uncertainty form part of the problematic to be studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0967010612463489">Bubandt, 2005</xref>: 276–7; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0967010612463489">Stern and Öjendal, 2011</xref>: 108). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0967010612463489">Stuvøy (2010)</xref> integrates subjective interpretation in the research methodology in order to validate subjects’ views and perceptions in the production of security. Here, researchers are concerned about creating bottom-up, actor-orientated and vernacular forms that can account not only for the messiness of individual perspectives but also for the fact that the (in)secure individual is part of a fluid context of power relations in which personal security is part of a dynamic of governance, regulation and biopolitics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0967010612463489">Hudson, 2005</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0967010612463489">Grayson, 2008</xref>: 395).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these insights, the unsettled and politicized nature of agency is still a nettle waiting to be grasped in efforts to elaborate human security’s claim to offer a new paradigm of security and in the fostering of new approaches to knowledge. The nature of individual agency in fragile contexts is far from straightforward. It fluctuates according to context and specifically depends on how people themselves define vulnerability as well as on the impact of securitization by other actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0967010612463489">Grayson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0967010612463489">Buzan et al., 1998</xref>). This complexity needs to be part both of our investigation and of our understanding of security. Hence, the challenge is how to position individuals in the research process in order to better understand their experiences of security and their responses to it.</p>
<p>This article identifies dialogue as a research method that allows the researcher to go beyond thinking of individuals only in terms of a referent of security – that is, as ‘those on whose behalf action is being taken’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0967010612463489">McCormack, 2008</xref>: 124). A dialogic conversation about human security is premised on the collaborative production of knowledge in the research process, recognizing <italic>a priori</italic> the research subject’s agency in the construction of specific knowledge of security. It takes on board concerns with power and positionality in the process of knowledge creation by muting the distinction between the researched and the researcher, while giving agency to the researched to shape the process of knowledge creation conceived as co-construction.</p>
<p>A dialogic method as a qualitative inquiry draws on philosophical underpinnings of dialogue that associate the latter with the notions of mutuality and egalitarianism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0967010612463489">Kvale, 2006</xref>: 481; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0967010612463489">Linell, 1998</xref>: 9–12). In this respect, it belongs with methods like the qualitative interview, which ushered in the democratization of research practice by recognizing the individual as a source of knowledge. As a process of knowledge creation, a dialogue between the researcher and the researched ‘honestly reflect[s] the difficulties of interpreting another person’s world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0967010612463489">O’Reilly, 2009</xref>: 16). The understanding of a dialogue as a collaborative effort of knowledge creation reflects a shift in the conceptualization of the qualitative interview. The idea of an interview as being an asymmetrical encounter and an exercise of extraction of information by a researcher has been revised owing to growing sensitivities to issues of agency, subjectivity, authority and reflexivity. Specifically, an active role for the research subject in the construction of information has been recognized. Accordingly, the interview is conceived as a site of co-creation of knowledge by an interviewer and an interviewee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0967010612463489">Holstein and Gubrium, 2003</xref>: 4–12; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0967010612463489">Tanggaard, 2009</xref>: 1510). Such conceptual approximation of the two research tools – the interview, on one hand, and a dialogue, on the other – is expressed in the term: dialogic interview. We use dialogue and dialogic interview interchangeably, because both are characterized by the minimization of the distinction between the researcher and the researched, and by a reconfiguration of power between them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0967010612463489">1</xref></sup> Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0967010612463489">Rubin and Rubin (2005</xref>: 97), we approach the researched as a ‘conversational partner’, which denotes a shift of power away from the researcher.</p>
<p>Dialogue as a research tool for investigating human security addresses issues of power in the research process and knowledge creation. However, the emphasis in a dialogic approach is on actively generating collaboration in knowledge production, rather than the naïve dismissal of any power asymmetries in the dialogue. Given that all communication presupposes asymmetries of knowledge and participation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0967010612463489">Linell (1998</xref>: 14) suggests the perspective of complementarity rather than symmetry to capture what takes place in a dialogue: ‘parties communicate from different positions and yet achieve some degree of shared understanding in and through their interaction’. Similarly, Wood points to interaction in a ‘<italic>process</italic> of dialogue’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0967010612463489">Wood, 2004</xref>: xviii, italics in original) as a critical dynamic that leads to authoring and co-authoring as opposed to disclosure and self-revelation. Consequently, a dialogue allows for reconfiguring of power and its location in the research process, and for conceiving of power in terms of mutual influence that is not located in persons, but between persons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0967010612463489">Anderson et al., 2004</xref>: 264). This is an alternative reading of power and positionality. It stands in contrast to the notions of ‘studying up’ or ‘studying down’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0967010612463489">Schrijvers, 1991</xref>), which reflect power inequalities in the research process, or the notion of ‘studying sideways’, which denotes displacement or distribution of power between the researcher and researched of the same or similar status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0967010612463489">Plesner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0967010612463489">Paulus et al., 2010</xref>). By contrast, dialogue as a practice in researching human security presupposes the equality of the vulnerable and marginalized, providing them with opportunities to realize and exercise that equality through collaboration and reciprocity in knowledge production.</p>
<p>Participation in a dialogue constructed around human security, but with no preconceived notions on the part of the outside researcher as to what human security is or ought to be, is aimed at reappraising individuals’ own experience and understanding of security through dialogic exposure to a new concept. The aim is reflexive engagement of both the researched and the researcher. Drawing on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0967010612463489">Latour (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0967010612463489">Lynch (2000)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0967010612463489">Plesner (2011</xref>: 490) makes an argument for ‘giving reflexivity back to actors’, as distinct from the researcher’s reflexivity towards his or her own work. The reflexivity of the researched implies paying attention to how their interpretations change during an interview. A dialogue can transform a passive awareness or unspoken experience of insecurity on the part of the researched, who change their understanding of security through the research process (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0967010612463489">Alvesson and Sköldberg, 2009</xref>: 312–3).</p>
<p>As in critical globalization research, dialogue offers a possibility of legitimizing personal, subjective experiences and understandings of insecurity through ‘co-investigation’ as an enriched knowledge creation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0967010612463489">Johnston and Goodman, 2011</xref>: 24; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0967010612463489">Barnard and Van Gerven, 2009</xref>: 821). It is defined by a removal of dualisms, such as that between a research object and subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0967010612463489">Pouliot, 2007</xref>). It also has the potential to incorporate a dynamic element into empirical observation, which derives from the active role of the researched. In line with the conceptual shift away from states to individuals and communities in the human security perspective, this bottom-up methodology ‘humanizes’ the security research process to reveal both the possibilities and the limits of human action and their unexpected effects, as demonstrated below in a case study of Kosovo.</p>

<title>Finding meaning from method: Human security in Kosovo</title>
<p>The 1999 NATO intervention ended the repressive Serb rule over Kosovo’s majority Albanian population. Kosovo became a UN-run protectorate until the Kosovo Albanians made a unilateral declaration of independence in 2008. This was rejected by Serbia, which continued to support Kosovo’s Serb minority and its so-called parallel structures in Serb-populated areas, the most populous enclave being in the north. Beyond a state- and ethnocentric perspective on insecurity in Kosovo lies a complex socioeconomic picture of vulnerabilities, with high levels of poverty, unemployment, and corruption and weak rule of law. These are associated with the recent conflict not just on account of the extensive material destruction, but also because of the distorting effect that the war economy has had on governance structures. Studies of security issues related to Kosovo have been dominated by debates about humanitarian intervention and global security institutions in the light of the external military response to Kosovo’s human rights crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0967010612463489">Williams, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0967010612463489">Shepherd, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0967010612463489">Hehir, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0967010612463489">Booth, 2001</xref>). Similarly, a mixed record of external state-building in post-conflict Kosovo is a subject of critical peace- and state-building scholarship, which seeks to highlight the disempowering effects of international administration and normative mismatch between externally defined agendas and local needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0967010612463489">Hehir, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0967010612463489">Ioannides and Collantes-Cellador, 2011</xref>). The emerging human security-defined investigations have provided complementary insights by bringing in the local perspective as a critical commentary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0967010612463489">Sabovic, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0967010612463489">Beha and Visoka, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0967010612463489">Kostovicova, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0967010612463489">Cleland Welch, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0967010612463489">Nelles, 2002</xref>). However, the contribution made by these studies to efforts to understand (in)security in Kosovo from the perspective of the people affected has been limited, owing to their use of selected understanding(s) of human security as a tool for interpretation and assessment that questioned neither the meaning of competing definitions nor the methods of investigation. Our research attempts to address this gap in the scholarship on Kosovo. Through dialogue, we approach the local voice as a resource for the reinterpretation of human security itself.</p>

<title>Dialogue in Kosovo human security research</title>
<p>Our empirical research, conducted with the aim of increasing our understanding of human security in Kosovo, took place from February to May 2010 in ten locations. It applied dialogue as a research tool on two levels as a way of investigating insecurity. At one level, the dialogue involved local parties in Kosovo: both individuals and communities, as well as local Albanian and Serbian researchers. At the second level, the dialogue involved both the latter – that is, Albanian and Serbian researchers – and UK-based researchers. The first stage of the research consisted of a three-day collaboration between UK researchers and local volunteers, structured around their familiarization with the concept of human security. The concept was explicated and operationalized using principles defined by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0967010612463489">Study Group on Europe’s Security Capabilities (2004)</xref>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0967010612463489">2</xref></sup> and placed within the broader context of the conceptual academic and policy debate on human security. It was also discussed in generic terms in relation to the political, social and economic environment in Kosovo. The second stage focused on research design and research-dialogue techniques, including the questionnaire to be used as a prompt for a dialogic interview on human security. The original draft questionnaire was adapted through discussion so that it might better correspond with local political, historical and cultural contexts and sensitivities in Kosovo. The subsequent identification of locations for empirical research was likewise a collaborative undertaking between Kosovan and UK teams.</p>
<p>The second stage consisted of local researchers entering local communities and approaching potential dialogic collaborators and initiating dialogues rather than prompting closed answers. The aim was to explore and encourage people to communicate what they felt about the security/insecurity of their daily lives while they were introduced to human security as an alternative perspective on security. For example, the headline question ‘What/who makes you feel insecure?’ was intended to capture multiple sources of insecurity experienced at both the individual and the community level. The second headline question, ‘What do you wish you could do but feel unable to do and why?’, was related to security aspirations. It aimed to capture the notion of constraints on human agency. In sum, a discussion that engaged interlocutors in rethinking security in human security terms was an integral part of the dialogue. The adoption of such an approach was instrumental in enabling the reconfiguration of the power relationship between the researcher and the researched discussed above. The research targets were no longer merely a source of information. By being brought into the dialogue on human security as a participant/collaborator, they were active contributors in constituting an open rather than predefined form of knowledge about human security in Kosovo.</p>
<p>The research was conducted in Prishtinë/Priština, Prizren/Prizren, Pejë/Peć, Podujevë/Podujevo, North Mitrovicë/Mitrovica, South Mitrovicë/Mitrovica, Shtërpcë/Štrpce, Graçanica/Gračanica, Istog/Istok and Obiliq/Obilić.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0967010612463489">3</xref></sup> The local research teams engaged a total of 100 interlocutors, making every effort to include a diversity of ethnic backgrounds, as well as securing representativeness in terms of age, gender, rural/urban location, employment and resident/internally displaced person (IDP) status.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0967010612463489">4</xref></sup> The sample included 65 Albanians, 21 Serbs, 7 Roma, 4 Ashkali, 2 Bosnians and 1 Gorani. There were 43 females and 57 males, while 62 lived in towns and cities, 33 in villages, and 5 in camps. Some 21 individuals in the sample were IDPs. In terms of employment status, 47% were employed, 31% were unemployed, 18% were university students and 4% were pensioners.</p>
<p>Dialogic approach was applied consistently in data collection and data analysis. The data obtained through the field research were initially analysed by local research teams, which led to the production of a set of key findings by location.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0967010612463489">5</xref></sup> The subsequent stage of data analysis took place in a collaborative dialogic setting over a two-day workshop between local researchers and the UK team. The focus was on finding the meaning of human security in Kosovo, including the understanding of agency and its limits in Kosovo’s unique socio-political environment. The session also included a critical reflection on the applied research method. In sum, dialogue was a tool for knowledge construction, which also included dialogic interpretation and validation of empirical data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0967010612463489">Denzin, 1989</xref>: 118–20; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0967010612463489">Kvale and Brinkmann, 2009</xref>: 253–6).</p>

<title>Multidirectional human security markers in Kosovo: Self-reliance, informality and community cohesion</title>
<p>The dialogic route to understanding human security in Kosovo led us to our key finding: the concept of the <italic>multidirectional security marker</italic> as a means of capturing contradictory and unexpected enactments and effects of agency. The initial analysis of our research findings ‘localized’ the meaning of human security in the Kosovo context. It identified unemployment, lack of strong economic growth and corruption as three principal and interconnected problems among all ethnic communities in Kosovo. In this sense, the results of the initial analysis were not surprising. They confirmed the findings of survey-based studies of security and threat perceptions in Kosovo (see Table 5 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0967010612463489">UNDP Kosovo and USAID, 2009</xref>: 24; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0967010612463489">Di Lellio, 2009</xref>: 10–12). The dialogic approach, however, revealed an additional conceptual richness of data/knowledge on human (in)security in Kosovo. We found that the capacity of the vulnerable to exercise power and agency could not be inferred automatically or directly from evidence of insecurity. For example, unemployment was understood by affected communities in Kosovo both as a constraint on agency and as a trigger for their empowerment through alternative avenues, such as informality. This led us to conclude that identifying and elaborating manifestations of insecurity had limited analytical traction. Importantly, it would leave untold a complex story of lived insecurity alongside strategies used by individuals to overcome it. Consequently, we propose the idea of a <italic>multidirectional security marker</italic> as a heuristic device to assess people’s experiences of insecurity in their daily lives in relation to strategies to combat it. The marker is <italic>multidirectional</italic> because it reflects restrictions on people’s security, while, unexpectedly, it also entails possibilities for overcoming those very same limitations. We call them <italic>markers</italic> because they express, rather than measure or rank, as an indicator might (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0967010612463489">Davis et al., 2011</xref>: 5–12), the nature of threats to individual existence, but, at the same time, encompass a specific response to that generalized sense of insecurity. In other words, <italic>multidirectional security markers</italic> provide a conceptual envelope or set of coordinates within which agency can be located, while taking account of the fact that the effects of such agency can be both empowering and disempowering. In exploring dialogically the ‘worm’s eye view’ of security concerns, as opposed to the ‘bird’s eye view’ offered by surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0967010612463489">Hakim, 2000</xref>: 36), these <italic>markers</italic> reveal ‘hidden’ dynamics of insecurity in real-life circumstances. Finally, <italic>multidirectional security markers</italic> point to the inconsistencies and paradoxes that characterize people’s attempts to lead secure or dignified lives surrounded by uncertainty. In Kosovo, we identify three <italic>multidirectional security markers</italic>: self-reliance, informality and community cohesion.</p>
<sec id="section6-0967010612463489">
<title>Self-reliance</title>
<p>The research revealed a remarkable degree of self-reliance among Kosovo’s citizens. Insofar as citizens consider themselves primary providers of security, self-reliance represents their loss of faith in state institutions, both at the national and the municipal level, as well as their ability to generate an effective substitute for inadequate public goods provision. Thus, self-reliance, which is forged out of necessity, is empowering. It testifies to the role of individual agency, enhancing the sense of security primarily understood as human dignity. But, reliance on one’s self, family and a close circle of friends has also resulted in individuals’ withdrawal from the public sphere in Kosovo. Consequently, the state’s failure to deliver public goods remains largely unchallenged, perpetuating the sense of insecurity.</p>
<p>Since the end of the 1998–9 conflict in Kosovo, an absence of overt violence, albeit with sporadic flare-ups, as in spring 2004, has contributed to making most people feel physically safe. Mostly, physical fear was not an issue in the dialogues, including in the Serb and other minority communities, as a Roma interlocutor from Obiliq/Obilić summed up: ‘If there is no violence and war, I feel more secure.’ Nonetheless, almost all interlocutors tended to think of security primarily in very tangible terms of material security. The lack of jobs and incomes was directly related to their sense of insecurity: ‘We lack the elementary living conditions and when you can’t even provide for your family, how can you feel secure?’, said an interlocutor from Prishtinë/Priština. The main variation was recorded in the Serb communities Graçanica/Gračanica and Shtërpcë/Štrpce, where Serbs spoke about restrictions on their freedom of movement as contributing to a sense of insecurity. In these communities, the absence of incidents of violence mattered less than perceptions of physical threats: people’s fears were based on what might happen to them, and on their distrust of the majority community.</p>
<p>A strong theme in dialogues about security providers concerned <italic>who</italic> interlocutors in Kosovo believed was responsible for their security and would make them feel safe. The dialogues revealed a strong sense of self-reliance, in that real security was seen as something that only those closest to them – whether immediate family or neighbours – could guarantee. In many cases, the small scale of the territory gave people the sense of knowing the town and the people, and of solidarity and reassurance within neighbourhood structures, which were also a source of empowerment. From those structures, individuals found financial, and in some cases psychological, security. This is an aspect of a closed circle of self-reliance, which marginalizes formal law enforcement agents in favour of those whom people know or are close to. For example, in North Mitrovicë/Mitrovica, nine of the ten interlocutors replied that only they can protect themselves. In other cases, interlocutors mentioned specific family members: ‘[My] husband provides security and safety to our family. I was in a situation when I needed help, on 17 March 2004 [the post-conflict Kosovo-wide Albanian rioting aimed against the Serbs], and neighbours and my husband helped and protected me,’ an interlocutor from Graçanica/Gračanica said. Police were mentioned only rarely, as generally people do not seek recourse from them to improve their sense of safety. According to an interlocutor from Istog/Istok, ‘It should [be] the police, but I don’t trust them. So I believe in my family.’ Women in all communities often named their husbands or parents as the main source of security. However, it is not clear whether this was seen solely in terms of physical protection or again as a feature of the correlation between material well-being and a general sense of security. What emerged was that security is defined by people in an intimate and personal way, rather than institutionalized as a community or a national issue. Informal yet tangible support mechanisms or self-assurance, which came about through being part of a social group, made people feel safer and more self-reliant.</p>
<p>This definition of security provision was also related to and reinforced by a general distrust of both international and local security forces, which extends across NATO’s Kosovo Force (KFOR), the Kosovo Police Service (KPS) and the Kosovo Security Force (KSF). Expectations of these institutions were low across all communities. This was sometimes based on individual experiences, as illustrated by an interlocutor in Istog/Istok who thought that NATO troops had failed to deal with an outbreak of violence in 2004 adequately. This distrust was often expressed as a generalized lack of respect for the competence of official security providers. Interlocutors from South Mitrovicë/Mitrovica commented, ‘They only finish legal procedures’ or ‘I don’t trust the police that much to make me feel secure.’ Many interlocutors referred to a perceived poor professionalism and training, and suspected the security institutions of corruption and indifference. More broadly, interlocutors spoke of a failure of law and order, as well as poor administration of justice. Such a view was shared by interlocutors who themselves worked in municipal authorities and who were dismissive of the ability of these bodies to deliver order and justice.</p>
<p>Furthermore, dialogues on security protection provided additional insights from an ethnic perspective. While the trust in official security structures is generally low, there is a widespread public perception among both Kosovo Serbs and Kosovo Albanians that the KPS and the KSF, as embodiments of Kosovo’s statehood, represent Albanian interests. In a Serb community such as Graçanica/Gračanica, however, responses were more mixed: some named the authorities of Serbia as their security providers ‘because they pay me’, although some Serbs also regarded the KPS and KFOR as agents of their security. Research in this locality also revealed a contradictory perception of security. All interlocutors confirmed that they would feel most secure if the Serbian army and police returned to Kosovo ‘as before 1999’. At the same time as they highlighted the importance of ethnicity in discussions of security, interlocutors rejected this as a sole criterion for safety provision. All interlocutors expressed their distrust towards the Serbian police officers who had joined the Kosovo Police Service. According to one interlocutor from Graçanica/Gračanica, ‘As for our protection, we have none. Who can protect me? Ever since “our folks” returned to the KPS [referring to integration of the Serbs in the multi-ethnic police service], they steal even more.’ Consequently, the security dividend of self-reliance in terms of relying on one’s own ethnic representatives as security providers was rendered void.</p>

<sec id="section7-0967010612463489">
<title>Informality</title>
<p>Informality in the context of research into human security in Kosovo denotes practices of non-compliance, avoidance, evasion or disregard of the formal rules regulating polity, economy and society. At the core of this widespread and socially accepted system of behaviour outside formal rules and regulations are complex linkages between the large informal economy and entrenched corruption, shaped by Kosovo’s post-conflict and post-communist transition. On the one hand, recourse to informality, primarily through undermining governance, has been detrimental to the provision of public facilities, and hence has impaired the security of people and communities in Kosovo. On the other hand, it has been a strategy and a means to resolve the problems and demands of everyday life. Thus, the research findings demonstrate the contradictory dynamics of agency. The disregard for formal rules and institutions was unanimously seen as disempowering. But, at the same time, people found dignity through resorting to informal means to alter their insecure situation.</p>
<p>The findings in Kosovo point to profound insecurity and existential instability stemming from the limited income-generation and employment opportunities available as a result of Kosovo’s weak economy. This is true for all communities. While the great majority of interlocutors said they are able to provide for their basic needs, Roma and Ashkali communities find it difficult to sustain even a subsistence level of material provision. Less extreme but still precarious is the hand-to-mouth existence of displaced persons, such as some Serbs in Graçanica/Gračanica and Shtërpcë/Štrpce, especially those housed in refugee accommodation and reliant on meagre social security hand-outs. Taking several different jobs, through informal arrangements, is one of the ways of securing a more adequate standard of living. This strategy is available only to some sections of the urban population, and not to those living in villages. Mirroring self-reliance in security provision, many also resort to their own means to mitigate circumstances linked to poor economic opportunities. For example, food security depends in a large number of cases on people growing their own fruit and vegetables or relying on relatives to supply them.</p>
<p>In Kosovo, remittances are an important mechanism for coping with material insecurity caused by poor economic and social conditions. Dialogues highlighted their paradoxical impact on agency and empowerment. Payments help make ends meet, but dependence on others, through receiving remittances even from close family members, is disempowering and even resented, as illustrated by an elderly interviewee from Prizren/Prizren who said, ‘I find it very hard to take [my son’s] money because even their economic conditions are not good, but there are cases when I don’t have other solutions and I have to take it’; or by a man from South Mitrovicë/Mitrovica who gets money from his brothers, who commented, ‘Most of the time I feel bad about this; I would like to be active and earn my own money, but right now it is not possible.’</p>
<p>Economic development is perceived as key to overcoming various forms of economic and social deprivation. On a personal level, having regular and adequate income is considered of crucial importance to improved well-being, as succinctly summed up by an interlocutor in Prizren/Prizren: ‘Money is the element that makes human beings feel secure. When a person has an income, he has security.’ However, such aspiration is accompanied by awareness of the existing structural constraints that limit income-generating opportunities and possibilities for overcoming those constraints. There is almost universal agreement that access to job opportunities depends on one’s social position, and that knowing or bribing someone is key to securing a job. According to a Serb from Shtërpcë/Štrpce: ‘Everything is the same if you know someone.’ The distorting effect of corruption and nepotism is spelled out in a response by a Prizren/Prizren resident: ‘If you know someone who has power in that place, then despite the [lack of] experience or educational background you get the job that belongs to a person who has a diploma.’ At the same time, the dialogues have revealed a pattern of acceptance of corruption and nepotism when it comes to employment. This is justified by the perceived unresponsiveness of state institutions in alleviating Kosovo’s high unemployment levels. A young man from Prizren/Prizren who works without a contract said: ‘It is the only job I could find, at least to be active and stay in my area of profession. I found this job thanks to my father and my experience, because otherwise I don’t think that political representatives would help me, just as they don’t help me find something more stable and profitable.’ At the same time, a villager from Vragoli/Vragolija recounts ten unsuccessful attempts to get a job at the airport without resorting to informal links.</p>
<p>Dialogues reveal that informal practices are common in efforts to secure access to education or healthcare or accomplish other goals, which reflects the acceptance of informality as a strategy of change. An interlocutor from Obiliq/Obilić who said that he would not hesitate to bribe or search for a ‘right’ connection ‘given the situation’ reflected the culture of non-compliance that reinforces weak rule of law. Another interlocutor from South Mitrovicë/Mitrovica spoke about mistrust in the fairness and impartiality of the system of governance in Kosovo, saying: ‘If I was adequate for a certain position, I would use people I know on the inside to get what I want. This is the only way the system functions.’ An interlocutor from Prizren/Prizren alleged that people do this because it is seen as offering the only possibility for survival, and therefore it is not considered to be a violation of law.</p>
<p>Legal unpredictability, weak law and order, and institutional ineffectiveness are important factors in breeding mistrust in public policy and public officials. This applies to the provision of public goods more generally, as illustrated by people’s complaints about poor physical and social infrastructure and insufficient assistance in securing livelihoods. Consequently, addressing insecurity in terms of material and social well-being in Kosovo almost inevitably involves resorting to informality, which ultimately perpetuates insecurity despite providing temporary and limited relief and gains.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0967010612463489">
<title>Community solidarity</title>
<p>In the post-conflict period in Kosovo, community solidarity has provided an infrastructure for informality and self-reliance. It has allowed citizens to cope with a range of uncertainties encountered in their daily lives, but, at the same time, emerged as a barrier to people’s attempts to alter their circumstances. The history of Albanians’ peaceful resistance to the oppressive Serbian regime of Slobodan Milošević in the 1990s testifies to the extraordinary ability of the Albanian community to self-organize in order to cope with adversity. This legacy carried over into the post-conflict stage, and impacts on people’s ability to negotiate their security situation. Social networks in the Kosovo context are based on strong familial and clan (<italic>fis</italic>) relations, as well as distinctly localized connections framed by neighbourhoods (<italic>mahallas</italic>) and regions.</p>
<p>Dialogues on human security in Kosovo point to a strong sense of community regardless of ethnicity or geographic location. A number of interlocutors talked about helping neighbours and friends with stacking firewood, babysitting, looking after the elderly, picking up the groceries, house renovation, etc. In general, voluntary activity has not been recognized by the public as an answer to the state’s inadequate public goods provision. By contrast, the activities of international and local nongovernmental organizations have been understood in terms of service provision, while their effectiveness is judged by their ability to fill gaps left by the state’s dysfunction. Hence, a resident of North Mitrovicë/Mitrovica assessed the work of an international NGO as positive precisely because it created job opportunities in the projects the organization was running in the area. But, at the same time, Albanian and Serb communities view NGOs as another site of corruption. Both local and international NGOs were depicted disparagingly as ‘working for their own interest’, according to an interlocutor from Istog/Istok, or to ‘fill their pockets with money’, according to an interlocutor from Prizren/Prizren. The criticism of formally organized civil society was accompanied by a deeply felt sense of the lack of accountability on the part of state institutions, whether municipal or national. Common to responses in all communities in Kosovo was an emphatic scepticism towards the idea that complaining against irregularities in the work of public institutions might make a difference. According to one interlocutor, ‘In South Mitrovicë/Mitrovica you can complain as much as you like, but your complaint will fall on deaf ears.’ Interlocutors talked about the length of time it took to get a response when a complaint was lodged, if one came at all. Most often, people did not pursue a formal complaint route, while reluctance towards the idea of questioning the authorities was reinforced by previous unsuccessful or ineffective attempts. An interlocutor from South Mitrovicë/Mitrovica said, ‘I keep my complaints to myself; I don’t believe expressing them would change anything.’ Similarly, Serbs in Graçanica/Gračanica believe that the battle is lost even before it has started.</p>
<p>Consequently, faced with an unresponsive state, while not viewing civil society as a possible alternative route for tackling governance weaknesses, the fallback strategy has been to use personal networks, including family or friends, to better one’s own immediate situation. A response from a citizen of Prishtinë/Priština captures the widespread opinion: ‘It is nearly impossible to achieve your goals in this country if you don’t know any officials or if you don’t have enough money to pay someone, because over here everything is done like this.’ Similarly, both men and women related a sense of security to confidence because they felt supported by those close to them.</p>
<p>At the same time, the dialogue on the nature and impact of social links revealed a specific gender perspective on security, as well as constraints on the ability of the individual to change his or her circumstances owing to the persistence of traditional and patriarchal mores. A female interlocutor in South Mitrovicë/Mitrovica said, ‘I can’t even wait for a friend alone in a café; everyone will talk.’ Others remarked on the existence of social stigma and pressure on women, which limits their opportunities in relation to such things as, say, taking a loan or starting a business on their own. At the extreme, it also affects their physical safety. According to another interlocutor in South Mitrovicë/Mitrovica, ‘I was attacked once, and managed to escape, and I couldn’t scream. I was scared the neighbours might hear. They would have said that it’s somehow my fault.’</p>
<p>Lastly, despite a recent history of mass human rights violations, interlocutors did not single out inter-ethnic relations as a major concern; rather, the emphasis was on economic well-being. Dialogues did not reveal vibrant inter-ethnic communication either. However, interlocutors did point to state institutions, mainly at the municipal level, as the focal point for inter-ethnic contact, whether this was an office, as our Istog/Istok example showed, or the multi-ethnic police service in Pejë/Peć. Apart from state institutions, dialogues point to trade and economy as another important site for fostering inter-ethnic contact and exchange. As the interlocutors from Graçanica/Gračanica testified, a number of recent friendships between Serbs and Albanians developed from what originally were business-centred inter-ethnic links, many of which were interactions in Kosovo’s grey economy.</p>
<p>While community solidarity may prove to be an actionable resource and lead to some improvement in people’s situation, a ‘privatization’ of political responsibility means that complaints are aired and discussed in familiar social settings among family and friends. Numerous dialogues referred to the ‘coffee culture’ in Kosovo, a consequence of the combination of unemployment and the paucity of ‘cultural’ distractions, such as cinemas, concerts, etc. Taking complaints into the private sphere further entrenches the lack of accountability of formal institutions. It is accompanied by the sense of powerlessness shared both by Albanians and Serbs, revealing a restrictive aspect of agency in the dense social and a dysfunctional institutional/state context in which it operates.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We have proposed not only that insights from the field may be useful in trying to break the impasse surrounding contested definitions of human security, but also that conceptualization can be inferred from methodology. Our key finding is the idea of the <italic>multidirectional security marker</italic> as a means of capturing the agential aspect of insecurity. The <italic>marker</italic> points to the agency of the vulnerable as they actively address their insecure predicament. It enriches our understanding of human security because it probes beyond multiple and interconnected sources of vulnerability. It reveals from the perspective of the vulnerable what those affected do to address insecurity, as well as the effects of their actions. One remark by an interlocutor that he ‘was not sure whom to bribe’ encapsulates the type of complexity the <italic>markers</italic> seek to denote: he was frustrated not just at the necessity of bribing but also at the uncertainty over how to bribe in the most effective way. People in Kosovo have felt empowered by resorting to self-reliance, informality and community solidarity in order to change their immediate circumstances, yet without being able to relieve the causes of pervasive and multifaceted insecurity associated with a weak state.</p>
<p>Our understanding of the nature of (in)security in Kosovo was assisted by the use of dialogue as a research tool. This tool went beyond traditional qualitative means for investigating insecurity to explore individuals’ articulations of their own insecure situations.</p> <p>Individual agency was a point of entry in the design of this methodological approach, consistent with human security’s conceptual shift of the focus of security from states to individuals and communities. In addition, our approach has been to collapse the distance between the outsider/researcher and those on the sharp end of insecurity, engaged as partners in the co-construction of the knowledge of security. Consequently, dialogue enabled us to capture aspects of security that are hidden and unacknowledged, and therefore not susceptible to traditional modes of inquiry where the subject is considered as a source of information only. Furthermore, dialogue also revealed a personal and emotional dimension, in which human security is as much about restoring a sense of self-worth as it is about initiatives to improve the economy, introduce rule-based governance or restore equality of opportunity.</p>
<p>In tracking the fine texture of data from these lived experiences and by probing the agency of individuals in fragile environments, we have thus sought to grasp the inchoate nature of security. Opening up processes of knowledge production that allow individual accounts to be constructed, acknowledged and validated has resulted in a collaborative understanding of human security. This method furthered the meaning of the concept by revealing how agency and security interact. It not only captured the agential quality of human security, pointing to people’s actorness in the face of pervasive insecurity, but also revealed its contradictory effects. Exploring the agency of the vulnerable empirically thus provides one way of deepening the understanding of human (in)security. In this case, agency centres on the relationship between individuals’ capacity to act and their ability to improve their security situation. This has paradoxical effects. Their sense of empowerment also contributes to the persistence of insecurity. This serves to highlight the important and unexpected dimension of individual agency and how it operates within the paradigm of human security. Ultimately, the method used in this research project problematized how knowledge is produced in contemporary security studies and how processes of production themselves form part of the puzzle of what human security is and where it can be located. As reflexive beings capable of computing complex security dilemmas and active agents in the construction of safer environments, individuals can thus reclaim their rightful place in a person-centred concept of security.</p>
