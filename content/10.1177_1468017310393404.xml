<abstract>
<p>• <italic>Summary</italic>: Professional social work identity emerges from particular historical, sociopolitical and organizational contexts. This article examines social work practices and identities in the context of Australian social work responses to homelessness. It draws on historical and contemporary literature and a qualitative study that interviewed 39 social workers employed in the area of homelessness in Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney, Australia.</p>
<p>• <italic>Findings</italic>: The findings of this research indicate that social workers employed in the field of homelessness constructed their professional identities by drawing on historical debates in social work literature including structural and/or individual approaches to social problems, as well as by reflecting on the personal and professional tensions that arise from their practice contexts. It also found that professional social work identity is overshadowed by managerial organizational contexts, influencing social work practice in the field of homelessness.</p>
<p>• <italic>Application</italic>: Debates have existed about social work identity since its inception. A critically informed approach to social work research, practice and literature provides significant insights into the challenges faced by social workers in this new and emerging area of practice and enables social workers to question social inequalities that disadvantage people experiencing homelessness. Further research is needed to identify differences and similarities between Australian and international social worker experiences in homelessness services.</p>

<p>Homelessness is a complex and emerging area of practice for social workers. This article discusses how social workers reflect on social work responses to homelessness and explores how social workers construct their professional social work identity within contemporary sociopolitical, policy and organizational contexts. It draws on historical and contemporary literature to analyze qualitative research findings on social work responses to homelessness in Australia. It is important to examine the contested nature of professional social work identity in the field of homelessness because social workers are increasingly involved in policy and practice responses to homelessness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468017310393404">Burke, 1998</xref>). The findings confirm that historical tensions including structural-individual debates continue to inform social workers’ understandings of their practice and policy responses to homelessness. However, professional social work identity is also shaped by the contemporary socio-political and organizational contexts in which social work is practiced.</p>
<p>A critical and social constructionist analysis of social workers’ identities and responses to homelessness is particularly important because homelessness policies, organizations and social work practices can overtly and covertly promote individual responsibility for the structural problem of homelessness. The concept of identity used in this article is informed by a social constructionist approach, which does not ‘fix’ social workers’ sense of self but argues that identity is a subjective process that changes in relation to diverse professional, personal and social experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468017310393404">Burr, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468017310393404">Fook, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468017310393404">Howe, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468017310393404">Mullaly, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468017310393404">Payne, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468017310393404">Pease &amp; Fook, 1999</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec2-1468017310393404"><title>Background: Homelessness in Australia</title>
<p>Each day, one in every 200 Australian is homeless, without safe and secure affordable housing (Homelessness Australia, n.d.). The State and Commonwealth Governments fund a network of specialist homeless services under the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program (SAAP), which was replaced in 2009 by the National Affordable Housing Agreement (NAHA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468017310393404">Commonwealth of Australia, 2008</xref>). In 2006/2007, 1539 non-government, community and local government organizations were funded nationally at a total cost of $367.3 million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468017310393404">AIHW, 2008</xref>). In Australia, the numbers of homeless people accessing specialist homelessness services have hovered around 100,000 – from 83,200 in 1996/1997 to 97,600 in 2002/2003 to 100,400 in 2004/2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468017310393404">AIHW, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468017310393404">2006</xref>). The 2001 Census results showed that there were 99,900 homeless people in Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468017310393404">ABS, 2003</xref>). During 2006/2007 it was estimated that one in every 110 Australians, or 187,900 adults or unaccompanied children (clients) received substantial support at some time and 69,100 were accompanying children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468017310393404">AIHW, 2008</xref>). Each year more women than men access homeless services in Australia. In 2006/2007, 61 percent of clients were female and 39 percent were male clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468017310393404">AIHW, 2008</xref>). Government funders of homelessness services are increasing requesting that workers employed in the field of homelessness have professional qualifications and therefore, trained social workers are increasingly being employed in this area of practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468017310393404">Burke, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>In Australia, the Supported Accommodation Assistance Act 1994, Section 4 defines homelessness as having ‘inadequate access to safe and secure housing, which includes being at risk of homelessness’. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468017310393404">ABS, 2003</xref>) defines four types of homelessness: primary homelessness, such as ‘rooflessness’ or sleeping rough or living in an improvised dwelling; secondary homelessness including staying with friends or relatives and people living in homelessness services; tertiary homelessness including people living in boarding houses or caravan parks with no secure lease and no private facilities, and marginal or ‘at risk’ of homelessness such as people in a housing crisis. The 39 social workers interviewed for this research drew on broad definitions of homelessness consistent with the above policy definitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1468017310393404">Zufferey, 2008</xref>). As well, seven social workers advocated making visible a gendered definition of homelessness, which incorporated the understanding that domestic or family violence is the main cause of women’s homelessness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1468017310393404">Zufferey, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In 2008, the Australian Commonwealth Government released the White Paper titled ‘The Road Home’ which sets out a national approach for reducing homelessness and aims to halve homelessness by 2020. Australian government responses to homelessness particularly focus on ‘rough sleepers’ (that is, visibly homeless people ‘living on the streets’), which accounts for 16 percent of homelessness in Australia (Homelessness Australia, n.d.). This is evident in the long-term goal to ‘offer accommodation to all rough sleepers who need it by 2020’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468017310393404">Commonwealth of Australia, 2008</xref>, p. vii)<italic>.</italic> This overemphasis on ‘rough sleepers’ and narrow definition of homelessness has been criticized by advocacy groups for limiting perceptions and understandings of homelessness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1468017310393404">Wright-Howie, 2009</xref>). Social workers can play a key role in challenging these dominant approaches and understandings by making visible the diversity of homelessness experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468017310393404">Horsell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1468017310393404">Zufferey, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>However, homelessness research (particularly in the British context but increasingly so in Australia) has been criticized for becoming too closely aligned with policy funding and agendas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1468017310393404">Pleace &amp; Quilgars, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1468017310393404">Pleace and Quilgars (2003)</xref> traced the politicization of homelessness research over the last 40 years and examined how individual and/or structural explanations of homelessness continue to inform homelessness research. They argued that homelessness research increasingly focuses on ‘special’ categories shaped by funding arrangements, such as young people, rough sleepers, women, and older people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1468017310393404">Pleace &amp; Quilgars, 2003</xref>). Australian researchers also construct ‘special’ categories of homelessness to research ‘homeless pathways’, which include mental health, domestic violence, housing crisis, substance abuse and youth pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468017310393404">Johnson, Gronda, &amp; Coutts, 2008</xref>). Whilst debates about individual and societal explanations of homelessness are drawn upon in research and practice, the categorization of client identities and managerial approaches dominate organizational processes, which create ethical dilemmas for social workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468017310393404">Horsell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1468017310393404">Zufferey, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The personal politics of social workers responding to homelessness play an important role in shaping their practice understandings and the dilemmas they face in this field. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1468017310393404">Perry (2003)</xref> conducted a quantitative study of 5793 social work masters students across 12 American universities about their desire to work with the poor and homeless. He found that students who politically identified themselves as ‘left-wing progressive or liberal’ and with personal motivations ‘to serve economically disadvantaged populations’ were more likely to be interested in working with the poor and homeless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1468017310393404">Perry, 2003</xref>, p. 333). An important question to further social work knowledge in the area of homelessness is: what meanings do social workers make of the relationships between their political, professional and personal identities in the area of homelessness in the Australian context?</p>
<p>Australian researchers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468017310393404">Lonne, McDonald, and Fox (2004)</xref> examined the ethical dilemmas of human service managers and practitioners in public and non-profit organizations. They found that within contemporary managerial contexts, service providers reported increased accountabilities towards employing organizations and funders, experienced negative effects of financial and resources constraints, the increased use of ‘formal procedures’ and many service providers were not aware of existing organizational strategies for addressing ethical practice issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468017310393404">Lonne et al., 2004</xref>, p. 361). This raises questions about how professional social workers negotiate organizational expectations when they perceive ethical dilemmas exist.</p>
<p>This article examines how social workers construct and negotiate their professional social work identities within contemporary sociopolitical, policy and organizational contexts. However, the concept of a ‘professional social work identity’ is contested and requires some delineation first.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1468017310393404"><title>A contested social work identity</title>
<p>The search for a professional social work identity and attempts to define ‘what is social work’ has dominated debates in literature. As well, ‘social work’ has frequently been defined in relation to the context in which it is practiced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468017310393404">Gibelman, 1999</xref>). Social work professionalism and identity has been continually debated based on ‘either/or’ positions or modernist dualisms such as the structural-individual divide. In 1901, Bernard Bosanquet published ‘The meaning of social work’ and stated:<disp-quote>
<p>Social work is today commonly interpreted in contrast with industrial or professional work … Social work is thought of as something spontaneous, human, sociable; an effort to gain direct contact with the human nature of those around us … Social workers take many different lines, but they mostly come back to these two: they want to brighten up the lives of the people or to improve the conditions in which they live. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468017310393404">Bosanquet, 1901</xref>, pp. 293–296)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>From its inception, social work was understood as both ‘individualist’ and ‘structural’ (or environmental) with the inherent tensions this continues to present for contemporary social workers. These individual and structural debates about social work practice and identity are particularly evident in the field of homelessness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1468017310393404">Zufferey, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, debates over whether or not social work is a ‘profession’ at all have a long history. Abraham Flexner, an early leader in medical education reform and in the professionalization of medicine, spoke at the 1915 National Conference on Charities and Corrections in Baltimore, and asserted that social work could not be a profession because it has diverse, vague and indefinite outcomes. He said:<disp-quote>
<p>I have made the point that all the established and recognized professions have definite and specific ends: medicine, law, architecture, engineering – one can draw a clear line of demarcation about their respective fields. This is not true of social work. It appears not so much a definite field as an aspect of work in many fields. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468017310393404">Flexner, 1915</xref>, p. 588)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In comparison with social work, medicine was seen to be a ‘true profession’ because it ‘combined knowledge and clinical skill with accountability for the quality of individual performance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468017310393404">Austin, 1983</xref>, p. 362). Since the rise of the discourse of professionalism in the nineteenth century, debates about the essential elements of professions have continued.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468017310393404">Ife (1999)</xref> accords to the social work profession the status of a generalist and secular occupation, which involves the integration of knowledge, skills and values and provides a particular service in the context of the welfare state. Frequently mentioned ‘traits’ that define a professional occupation include skills based on theoretical knowledge, the provision of training and education, testing the competence of members, scientific organization of service delivery, adherence to a professional code of conduct and offering an altruistic service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1468017310393404">Johnson, 1972</xref>). The ‘trait’ approach is criticized by authors such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1468017310393404">Johnson (1972)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468017310393404">Austin (1983)</xref> for privileging professionals’ own definition of themselves as ‘neutral’ whilst being historically, politically and culturally embedded.</p>
<p>Instead, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1468017310393404">Payne (1997</xref>, p. 21) notes that ‘clients’, ‘social workers’ and the process called ‘social work’ are socially and historically constructed within organizational contexts and institutional regimes of power. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468017310393404">Gregory and Holloway (2005)</xref> trace the historical development of social work and find three broad periods of development: the moral, therapeutic and managerial periods. This research found, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468017310393404">Payne (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468017310393404">Gregory and Holloway (2005)</xref> also argue, that social work practice exists within historically situated socio-political and organizational contexts and is shaped by managerial institutional practices, which influence how workers operate and how they respond to service users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1468017310393404">Zufferey, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1468017310393404"><title>Contemporary socio-political and organizational contexts</title>
<p>The language of ‘management’ is particularly evident in contemporary organizational contexts, which shapes social work identities and responses to homelessness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1468017310393404">Zufferey, 2008</xref>). Contemporary socio-political and organizational human services contexts are influenced by ‘increasing marketization, contractualism and managerialist practices’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468017310393404">Lonne et al., 2004</xref>, p. 345). These discourses have different ethical values from those traditionally promoted by the social work profession that are more aligned to values of social justice and human rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468017310393404">AASW, 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468017310393404">Giffords’s (2009)</xref> quantitative study examined the commitment of social workers to their organizations and their professions. She found that work environments which include professional autonomy, collegiality, being fairly treated and leave and promotional opportunities were significant in promoting employee commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468017310393404">Giffords, 2009</xref>). These are important factors that need to be considered in decisions made by managers in order to maintain employee commitments to their clients and reduce staff turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468017310393404">Giffords, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Authors such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468017310393404">Gursansky, Harvey, and Kennedy (2003)</xref> note that the presence of ‘management’ in the name ‘case management’ validates the spirit of managerialism, which assumes that solutions ‘to social problems can be found in the application of good business practices’. ‘Case management’ is increasingly central to social work service delivery, nationally and internationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468017310393404">Gursansky et al., 2003</xref>) and this is also evident in the area of homelessness. In Australia, the National Data Collection Agency Client Forms have to be filled out by government funded agencies to collect particular data relevant to the case management process. For example, Question 15 asks ‘Was a case management plan agreed to by the end of the support period?’ while Question 16 asks ‘To what extent were the client’s case management goals achieved by the end of the support period?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468017310393404">AIHW, 2008</xref>, p. 97). This illustrates how managerial discourses have shaped homelessness service delivery through funding and data collection arrangements. The language of ‘cases’ and of ‘case management’ have been criticized by some critical Australian authors for individualizing responses to homelessness and ignoring the structural causes of homelessness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468017310393404">Fopp, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468017310393404">Horsell, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, social work and social policy responses to homelessness are culturally and historically situated within broader Western individualist discourse about social problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468017310393404">Jamrozik, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468017310393404">Jamrozik &amp; Nocella, 1998</xref>). Contemporary discourses that emphasize individual self-interest and moral responsibility have influenced socio-political contexts and government policy responses to social problems such as homelessness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468017310393404">Harris, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468017310393404">Jamrozik, 2005</xref>). Thus, it is arguable that contemporary socio-political climates as well as organizational contexts can constrain social work practitioners in their espoused mission to advocate for the most disadvantaged groups in our society such as the homeless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468017310393404">Gilligan, 2007</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec5-1468017310393404"><title>Social constructions of social work identity</title>
<p>This article explores social work responses to homelessness from a critical and social constructionist perspective. It examines the discourses that shape the diverse practices and identities of social workers employed in the area of homelessness.</p>
<p>Since the 1990s, post-modernist and social constructionist ideas have influenced social work literature, including conceptualizations of social work identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468017310393404">Burr, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468017310393404">Howe, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1468017310393404">Payne, 1997/2005</xref>). Social constructionist perspectives propose that social work theory, practice and identity emerge from social interactions between people and occur within cultural, historical and local contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1468017310393404">Payne, 1997/2005</xref>). The social constructionist view of social work identity acknowledges that relationships between workers, clients and the agency context are reflexive and identities are context bound, dialogical and interrelated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1468017310393404">Payne, 1997/2005</xref>). This perspective assumes that there is no fixed ‘truth’ about ‘what is social work’ and social work identity cannot be abstracted from its particular historical, sociopolitical and organizational contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468017310393404">Fook, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468017310393404">Mullaly, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468017310393404">Pease &amp; Fook, 1999</xref>). Thus, social work identity in any context, including homelessness, cannot exist independently of ‘truth’ claims and power relations within organizational and sociopolitical contexts and these contexts pose significant challenges for social work practitioners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468017310393404">Ife, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The research insights discussed in this article are important and relevant to the exploration of social work identity in the area of homelessness, where workers are likely to have particular political motivations and be employed in organizations with institutional practices that can challenge social workers’ understandings of their professional practice and identities. Next, this article discusses how social workers employed in the field of homelessness construct and reflect upon their professional practices and identities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1468017310393404"><title>The research study</title>
<p>The qualitative research study being reported on in this article was approved by the University of South Australia, Human Research Ethics Committee. It was funded by a University of South Australia scholarship. The study involved semi-structured interviews with 39 social workers working in the area of homelessness in inner city Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney, Australia. These three cities were chosen because of their relative geographical proximity while varying in terms of population size and cultural diversity. Focusing on the subjective meanings and interpretations of social workers practicing in the area of homelessness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1468017310393404">Sarantakos, 2005</xref>), this research aimed to find out how social workers understood their professional identities, their contributions to the area of homelessness and what dilemmas and tensions they faced in their everyday practices.</p>
<p>A diverse range of agencies known by the researcher to be working with ‘homeless people’ were contacted via email and telephone and asked whether they employed social workers interested in speaking to the researcher. Interested participants then contacted the researcher directly, the research was further explained and an interview time and place was negotiated. All social workers who contacted the researcher were interviewed. The interviews were conducted between August 2003 and June 2004 and ranged in length from one to two and a half hours. Interviews were audio-taped with the consent of participants, transcribed (removing all confidential material) and coded into themes relevant to the influences shaping social workers’ responses to homelessness.</p>
<sec id="sec7-1468017310393404"><title>Sample group</title>
<p>All participants had worked or were currently working in direct service provision. Nineteen of the participants worked in not-for-profit or nongovernment organizations (NGOs including community day centers and accommodation services), 13 worked in government direct service delivery (including hospitals, specialist, and statutory services, such as drug and alcohol and mental health services) and seven worked in state and local government policy development and advocacy bodies. Three participants were currently employed or had been employed in men’s services, seven in women’s services and domestic violence policy, four in youth services and two in aged care services for the homeless.</p>
<p>This research found that the function and type of employing organization shaped social work responses to homelessness and therefore social work identities. These differences were evident across three organizational groups: nongovernment services (NGOs), policy development bodies and government direct service delivery. Government direct service delivery was strongly influenced by medical and statutory contexts, workers in NGOs were more likely to embrace benevolent, religious, charity themes while policy workers predominantly focused on mediating the political processes of government, often with the aim of improving service delivery or developing ‘partnerships’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1468017310393404">Zufferey, 2008</xref>, p. 365).</p>
<p>All participants were qualified social workers eligible for membership of the Australian Association of Social Workers (AASW). However, only 15 out of the 39 (38%) participants were actually employed in positions called ‘social work’. Participants had been employed in a number of jobs and their job titles were diverse. At the time of the interviews 12 participants were in senior positions, with titles such as senior social worker, senior counselor, senior project coordinator, chief project officer, senior clinician, manager, supervisor or ‘team leader’. Six participants had ‘counselor’ or ‘clinician’ in their job title and three were called ‘case-manager’ or ‘case coordinator’, five had ‘policy’ or ‘project officers’ in their job title and others had specific job titles such as ‘volunteer coordinator’, ‘sexual assault investigator’, ‘student support coordinator’ or ‘support worker’. This indicates the diversity of positions social workers can be employed in when working in the field of homelessness in Australia.</p>
<p>In relation to the demographics of the sample group, 29 of the 39 participants were women (74%). This reflects the gendered nature of the social work profession because it is estimated that in Australia 75–80 percent of practicing social workers are women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1468017310393404">McCormack, 2001</xref>). In addition, 26 of 39 (67%) participants identified being of Anglo/Celtic origin; 10 participants were of European origin and mostly first-generation Australians. The sample group tended to be older and more experienced practitioners, because 33 participants (85%) were over 30 years of age and 24 (62%) had over five years of post-qualifying experience, with only 10 (26%) having less than two and a half years’ experience.</p>

<sec id="sec8-1468017310393404"><title>Data analysis</title>
<p>A thematic analysis was conducted through open, axial and selective coding of the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468017310393404">Neuman, 2006</xref>). A theme can be defined as a meaningful essence that runs through the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1468017310393404">Morse, 2008</xref>). First, data were analyzed closely during and after the data collection stage and reflective notes were taken after each interview, exploring, noting and coding preliminary, emerging themes. Second, the first look at the data was reviewed and examined and category clusters were organized into main themes. Lastly, key themes were identified in the selective coding process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468017310393404">Neuman, 2006</xref>). A report on the first analysis of the data was emailed to participants for comments and their feedback was incorporated into the final analysis. Verbatim quotes are used in this article to illustrate certain themes. Themes discussed in this article particularly relate to how social workers constructed their professional identities and what tensions and dilemmas they faced within their employing organizations. The interactional event between the interviewee and interviewer also constructs themes and negotiates identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1468017310393404">Taylor &amp; White, 2000</xref>). Therefore, the findings are reported in relation to the questions asked by the researcher.</p>

<sec id="sec9-1468017310393404"><title>Findings and discussions</title>
<p>This section reports on the findings from the following two key research questions that elucidated discussions around the professional identities of social workers in the study:
<list id="list1-1468017310393404" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>What are the unique contributions that social workers can make in the homelessness area?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What are the tensions and dilemmas you face in your practice as a social worker in this field?</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The main themes related to how social workers constructed their professional identities in homelessness services included:
<list id="list2-1468017310393404" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The difficulties inherent in defining the contribution of social work as a profession independent of organizational contexts.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The interrelationships between personal and professional identities.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Tensions created by managerialist organizational processes and the impact on social work practices.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The place of a critical social work knowledge base in enabling resistance to dominant managerial and individualist practices.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>As well, social workers drew on historically informed theoretical constructions of social work, including structural-individual debates, specialist-generalist social work and ‘person in the environment’ concepts, to frame tensions in their practice.</p>
<sec id="sec10-1468017310393404"><title>Defining social work as a profession</title>
<p>Participants were asked the question: what are the unique contributions that social workers can make in the homelessness area? The themes discussed below are: that social work’s mission is to work with disadvantaged population groups but that social work identity is difficult to define and professional and personal identities are interrelated.</p>
<p>All participants commented on how social work was seen to be extremely compatible with ‘working for the poor, the homeless, the disadvantaged … there is a natural link’ (Interview 5, government worker, p. 11). Similarly:<disp-quote>
<p>Social workers respond to working with people … at great disadvantage in communities … human rights … classic social work values and social work territories … if you don’t find social workers working in the area of homelessness … where would you find them you know? (Interview 6, government policy worker, p. 14)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>However, one participant was particularly critical of the ‘buzz words’ taught in social work education and resisted using them, such as:<disp-quote>
<p>Empowering, social justice, human rights … they are all buzz words … I try not to use them because I don’t feel like I belong to a brotherhood or sisterhood of social workers. (Interview 10, NGO worker, p. 24)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This quote indicates that not all social workers feel connected to a collective professional social work identity. Social workers’ identities and social work responses to homelessness are reflexive and subjective, depending on the personal values, professional training and political commitments of individual social workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1468017310393404">Zufferey, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1468017310393404">2009</xref>).</p>
<p>All participants also noted that the ‘uniqueness’ of ‘social work’ was difficult to define and separate from a particular approach, attitude, orientation or their role within their employing organization:<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t see myself as a social worker in my job here … because it is basic … anyone can do this job … there are a number of people out there that can do it, with the right attitude … that aren’t social workers … there are some social workers that do it with the wrong attitude … so it is about the person. (Interview 7, NGO worker, p. 10)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, social workers perform in roles that are complex and valued (not ‘basic’) but they need to have the ‘right’ attitude. However, this ‘attitude’ is not always connected to professional ethics and values but to the ‘person’.</p>
<p>This research found strong interrelationships between the personal, professional and political identities of social workers interviewed (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1468017310393404">Zufferey, 2008</xref>, 2009). The theme of <italic>being</italic> a social worker was particularly strong in NGOs:<disp-quote>
<p>I see [advocacy] as my role as a human … that is just who I am … it comes back to my social values. (Interview 20, NGO worker, p. 16)</p>
<p>Social work is the thing that I love … I really am a committed social worker who loves the profession … I get a sense that I can’t not be a social worker … it is me now. (Interview 9, NGO worker, pp. 2–4)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, whilst participants were all trained social workers; this did not translate to a unified or homogenous understanding of their professional identity and practice.</p>
<p>These findings are not surprising given that the majority of the sample were not employed in jobs called ‘social work’:<disp-quote>
<p>It is hard to unpack what is social work … what is me … what is my orientation … what is my experience … most of my positions have not been social work specific … I don’t think I have had one job where I’ve had to be a social worker at all. (Interview 30, policy worker, p. 17)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>These findings reflect the heterogeneous nature of social worker identities and the complexities inherent in defining ‘social work’ but also illustrate how organizational contexts shape understandings of professional identities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the difficulty in defining the specific contributions of social work was a common finding across different employing organizations and was related to generalist understandings of social work. The generalist-specialist debate has a long history in social work literature and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468017310393404">Leighninger, 1980</xref>) and continues to be drawn upon by social workers in the field of homelessness to frame their diverse practices. All 19 NGO workers mentioned the generalist aspect of their work, as exampled by the following:<disp-quote>
<p>I am an old school generalist social work graduate … social work can have political … policy … community development … one to one overviews … We are jacks of all trades but masters of none to some extent. (Interview 22, NGO worker, p. 18)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Another NGO worker stated that social work was ‘being all things to all people’ (Interview 20, NGO worker, p. 16). Specialist government workers also had difficulty defining ‘social work’ because it is so generic: ‘social work practice is a bit of a magpie … It is almost the generic sort of profession in a way’ (Interview 38, government worker, p. 17). Another social worker employed in a specialist government mental health service said: ‘There are not many social workers employed to function as social workers … everyone is a case manager … doing similar roles’ (Interview 33, specialist government service, p. 11). Thus, ‘social work identity’ was also difficult to define within managerial organizational settings: ‘I think the position of social work has been a bit eroded or made sort of homogenous’ (Interview 3, specialist government service, p. 21). The next section explores how managerial organizational processes create tensions for social workers and shape their practices.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1468017310393404"><title>Tensions resulting from organizational contexts</title>
<p>Participants were asked the question: what are the tensions and dilemmas you face in your practice as a social worker in this field? Social workers commented on how the dominance of managerialism in their employing organizations negatively shapes their practices and discussed the importance of client-focused as well as collective social work approaches.</p>
<p>All participants commented on how government funding increasingly focused on accountability and efficiencies, which impacted on their work within their employing organizations. Social workers in the field of homelessness stated that they were increasingly required to focus on the ‘core business’ of the organization and consequently, a ‘business’ discourse was apparent in the majority of interviews (22 out of 39 interviews, 56%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1468017310393404">Zufferey, 2008</xref>). As one worker said: ‘for me working with people is a process … [but] programs are driven by bureaucratic imperatives and outcomes’ (Interview 10, NGO worker, p. 15). These findings about the dominance of managerialism and business discourses in human service organizations are consistent with findings of Australian and international research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468017310393404">Harris, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468017310393404">Lonne et al., 2004</xref>) and are further discussed elsewhere in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1468017310393404">Zufferey (2008)</xref>.</p>
<p>Contemporary sociopolitical contexts and ‘market policies’ that increased social inequalities and disadvantaged service users were also commented on:<disp-quote>
<p>All policies are governed by the market these days … this means that we do have this huge division between ‘the have and the have nots’. . . I think it’s getting worse because ‘the haves’ are getting more. (Interview 9, NGO, p. 2)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite these concerns, social workers did have a notion of what social work ‘should be doing’, which was aligned to working with people and ‘client work’:<disp-quote>
<p> Social workers have to fight for their positions and their programs … their roles have changed, it has move away from being <italic>just social work</italic> and dealing with the public and dealing with clients, to dealing with the government and getting money, it has become business oriented as well as people oriented. (Interview 35, NGO, p. 10)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Although the most common approach used by social workers in the study was the ‘client-centered approach’ (15 out of the 39 participants, 38%), which indicates a tendency toward individualist, one to one approaches (akin to casework), social workers also advocated collective or structural approaches.</p>
<p>The 12 social workers based in health settings drew on medical-social debates and positioned ‘social work’ alongside ‘holistic’ notions of working with ‘the person in his or her environment’ and against the medical pathologizing of individuals:<disp-quote>
<p>The nature of [medical] work [involves] the compartmentalization of the body and of the person … an objectification of the person … whereas our approach and values are quite different. (Interview 36, specialist government service, p. 16)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The social work values and approaches being referred to by the above social worker included feminism, empowerment and community focused interventions that aim to broaden the focus of social work away from ‘problematizing’ the individual.</p>
<p>One participant who had previously worked in a health organization strongly advocated for social and community approaches:<disp-quote>
<p>I have been a critic for many years of social workers who work in the health system and buy into that crap … the whole medical approach … without thinking carefully about the bio-psycho-social model … putting people in context with their community. (Interview 25, local government worker, p. 4)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The concept of ‘person-in-situation’ has a long history in social work, dating back to Mary Richmond in 1922 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468017310393404">Cornell, 2006</xref>). The dual social work purposes discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468017310393404">Bosanquet (1901)</xref> of influencing individual change at the micro-level and social change at the macro-level is still clearly integral to social work identity, including in the field of homelessness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1468017310393404"><title>Tensions between individualist social work tasks and structural, social justice approaches in social work</title>
<p>Social workers aligned their professional social work identities to universal social work values and ethics related to social justice and human rights but also used individualist language to describe their practices and identities. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468017310393404">Hawkins, Fook, and Ryan (2001</xref>, p. 1) note, social work as a profession was ‘founded on principles of social justice’ and espouses social justice values. However, these researchers found that social workers primarily used individually focused ‘clinical’ language and rarely focused on ‘social justice’ language to describe their practice, irrespective of the type of practice scenario being discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468017310393404">Hawkins et al., 2001</xref>, p. 10).</p>
<p>In this study the language of ‘cases’ also dominated interviews; 31 out of the 39 social workers (79%) used the word ‘case’ and 17 out of the 39 (44%) actually mentioned the word ‘clinical’. However, 16 out of the 39 (41%) social workers also discussed the importance of addressing social inequalities in the ‘community’. This implies that social workers employed in the area of homelessness may be more inclined to critically consider the impact of social inequality and injustice on their client group. Consistent with critical social work perspectives in literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468017310393404">Allen, Pease, &amp; Briskman, 2003</xref>), 15 of the 39 social workers (38%) felt that the role of social workers was to resist changes which disadvantaged their clients:<disp-quote>
<p>The breathing space is gone … everyone is trying to keep their heads above water … too busy being cost-effective … [social workers] need much more of a voice in questioning. (Interview 24, government worker, p. 15)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The individual/structural dichotomy was also merged through ‘clinical’ and ‘political’ language and practice:<disp-quote>
<p>A good social worker must be a finely tuned clinician and an astute politician and I think it’s that astuteness that we need to develop. (Interview 9, NGO worker and manager, p. 8)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Critical comments on the tensions between the structural ideals of social work and its individualist (or ‘clinical’) interventions are provided by an NGO worker advocating a structural approach:<disp-quote>
<p>If you want to make a judgment about what are the fundamental causes of homelessness, it has got very little to do with individuals and yet the focus of our work is always around individuals. (Interview 1, NGO worker, p. 7)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This same social worker merged structural and individual approaches to social work practice and identity in describing his work in the homelessness context:<disp-quote>
<p>[Homelessness] married for me an example of being able to work with what I perceived to be major structural problems as they were mediated in individual lives. (Interview 1, NGO worker, p. 2)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The structural–individual or macro–micro tension was also evident in interviews with government social workers. For example, at the macro-level, one government worker stated:<disp-quote>
<p>Social workers might think that they are social change agents … that they are of a particular political persuasion … but I don’t know that there is anybody that would employ social workers to fulfill those roles, so I think our roles are really dictated. (Interview 3, government worker, p. 18)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The same social worker felt limited to advocating for changes to individual assessment processes within her organization:<disp-quote>
<p>What happened was that my assessments would take an hour and I’d get in the shit for wasting time, but then I’d have to just say ‘well you know that’s my practice’. (Interview 3, government worker, p. 10)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This social worker drew on her professional power and its associated discretion to resist organizational procedures, which was an act of resistance not available to all staff in the organization. As a ‘professional’ social worker she was able to offer some resistance to organizational constraints by advocating and practicing differently from other service providers.</p>
<p>The findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468017310393404">Lonne et al. (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1468017310393404">Perry (2003)</xref> resonate with the findings of this research; that social workers’ constructions of their professional identities related to their political commitments and personal motivations and were often defined in relation to the contexts of their employing organizations. However, social workers were also able to offer some resistance to dominant organizational practices by drawing on their professional social work values and identities to advocate for an improved service to their client group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1468017310393404"><title>Limitations of the study</title>
<p>The study was limited to three Australian cities and does not intend to be a universal representation of the social work response to homelessness. However, some themes or features discussed in this article may be consistent with the experiences of social workers employed in homelessness services in countries other than Australia. A different sample of social workers may have produced different findings.</p>
<p>Further research is needed to identify differences and similarities in the experiences of Australian and international social workers in the field of homelessness. A comparative study of social workers employed in the areas of poverty and homelessness, with those working in areas of social work practice that are not responding to social disadvantage (such as in private practice), could further explore if and how different fields of practice influence social workers’ constructions of their professional identities.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1468017310393404" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article examines the complexities of professional social work practice in the field of homelessness. The ‘doing’ of social work and ‘being’ a social worker shapes social workers’ personal and professional identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468017310393404">Billington, Hockey, &amp; Strawbridge, 1998</xref>, p. 139). This is evident in social workers’ accounts of the interrelationships between their personal values and political commitments in their professional responses to people experiencing homelessness. As hypothesized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468017310393404">Gilligan (2007, p. 756)</xref>, all social workers agreed that the ‘purpose of social work was to improve the lives of the disadvantaged’ and they promoted both individual and collective or structural approaches to homelessness. However, this did not translate into a collective, homogenous sense of ‘being’ a social worker because professional social work identity is an evasive notion that is difficult to define. Social work has always been a diverse and ‘fluid’ profession informed by contradictory theoretical knowledge bases as well as practice and personal knowledge/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1468017310393404">Trevithick, 2008</xref>). Thus, social workers’ understandings of their professional identities are inextricably linked to their practices within their employing organizations, the theoretical knowledge/s, values and assumptions in social work literature and their personal and political motivations and commitments.</p>
<p>Consistent with themes in critical social work literature, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468017310393404">Gregory and Holloway (2005</xref>, p. 51) argue that ‘social work as a profession should never cease to question, expose, challenge and reframe’. However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468017310393404">Lonne et al. (2004)</xref> note, advocacy and ethical practice are constrained by managerial organizational contexts that increasingly prioritize business values over accountability to service users. The practice dilemmas faced by social workers in this study also relate to the contexts of their employing organizations. Nonetheless, social workers provided examples of social work resistance to managerial practices within organizations that drew upon professional social work values and ethics. Social workers in this study also merged individualist and collective approaches to homelessness, which enabled them to advocate for improving services to individuals experiencing homelessness, as well as influence social change to benefit this disadvantaged population group.</p>
<p>Social work is perpetually adapting to respond to different social problems and changing political, policy and organizational environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468017310393404">Adams, Dominelli, &amp; Payne, 2009</xref>). This study acknowledges the important contributions and reflections of professional social workers working in the field of homelessness, which enables a deepening of the social work knowledge base. This research is the first to examine social work responses to homelessness in Australia and can be expanded on by conducting comparative studies across Australian and international contexts.</p>
