<italic>Redesigning Continuing Education in the Health Professions</italic> is a report prepared by the Committee on Planning a Continuing Health Professional Education Institute which is an ad hoc Institute of Medicine (IOM) Committee chartered to identify issues and recommendations related to continuing education (CE) for the health professions. The report details the major issues of the current CE system, including how the fragmented and underdeveloped system is deficiently planned, financed, delivered, evaluated, and regulated. The Committee criticizes the absence of interdisciplinary and interprofessional collaboration stating that this leads to the disintegration of educational goals, without a common vision, to guide health care services or improve care quality.</p>
<p>The report is divided into seven chapters with six appendices. The introduction establishes the premise that the current CE system is inadequate and discusses reasons to support the role of CE in improving workforce quality. Subsequent chapters review the scientific foundation of CE development, identify the variability among states regarding regulation and financing, and describe the continuing professional development (CPD) system along with its vision, function, and structure. The last chapter of the report outlines factors essential for changing the CE culture by implementing, researching, and evaluating outcomes from the various learning methods. Each chapter provides ample references to support the Committee’s recommendations. The literature review tables (in Appendix A) are particularly helpful in identifying relevant literature and research related to various CE methods and connecting their usefulness to CPD.</p>
<p>The report presents considerations for possible reform structures and expected outcomes for a successful CPD system. These outcomes include: (a) providing patient-centered care, (b) working in interprofessional teams, (c) using evidence-based practice, (d) applying quality improvement, and (e) using health informatics. The Committee details 10 recommendations in this report and highlights the essentiality of a public–private sector partnership. The formation of this partnership aims at planning and carrying out activities that contribute to the development of a CPD model. The CPD model must be interdisciplinary-based, competency-driven, technologically enabled, performance-evaluated, and resource-enriched. In CPD, sharing information, tools, resources, and learning portfolios is an important process, not a step, because this process involves partnership actions, advancement of the scientific educational base, data dissemination across disciplines, and efficiently planned financing schemes.</p>
<p>This report describes an important model for social work CE, as social work represents one of the largest sectors in the health care workforce. Research in the CE field for social workers has found value in providing smaller modules that are professionally and academically accredited, implementing post qualifying awards as a component of CPD, instituting a partnership between employers and universities, assessing competency, and meeting service needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049731511424902">Taylor, Mullineux, &amp; Fleming, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049731511424902">Beddoe (2009)</xref> found that social workers want to be both learners and active participants in determining the CE agenda, avoiding a top–down approach or one that simply follows a trendy method. With input from a group of health care social workers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049731511424902">Bronstein, Kovacs, and Vega (2007)</xref> found that the best formats for introducing CE content were field placements, small group learning, case scenarios, and other experiential exercises. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049731511424902">Smith et al. (2006)</xref> suggested that informal learning methods are often favored over formal ones, with an understanding that CE also requires mechanisms to recognize and regulate these activities. In line with social work literature that supports CE as a means to maintain the credibility of the profession and foster market competiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049731511424902">Kent, 2006</xref>), this report shows that it is important for a CE model to focus on service quality control and professional development. It implies that CE is indeed a CPD process that engages social work practitioners, researchers, educators, and policy analysts in planning in order to provide leadership in this collaborative effort.</p>
<p>Based on the report, two common goals in CE have been highlighted—patient’s safety and quality improvements. It states, “The CPD system will benefit when its providers and researchers collaborate with other professionals in the quality improvement community; efficiencies gained from such collaborations could yield important benefits to patients” (p. 94). Continuous learning modalities must address research-based information dissemination in order to enhance knowledge, skills, and professional attitudes for improving care quality. In its conclusion, the Committee stresses that the CPD system assumes “… everyone is a learner, supported on the arc of professional development with knowledge of tailored learning goals, the tools to meet and surpass those goals, and a community of other learners with whom to share the process” (p.111). One key to success is the establishment of interdisciplinary collaboration “across disciplines and government boundaries” (p. 14) in order to enhance effectiveness in the provisions of CPD activities and promote professional commitment to ongoing evidence-based learning.</p>
