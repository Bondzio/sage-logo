<abstract>
<p>On the basis of 100 monetary policy announcements made by the U.S. Federal Reserve between 1994 and 2005, we estimate the reaction of the hotel and restaurant industry stock values to the Fed’s monetary policy actions. We find that the portfolios of hotel industry stocks react strongly to unexpected changes in the Federal Funds Target Rate. Specifically, for a hypothetical surprise 25-basis-point rate cut, the value-weighted hotel industry stock portfolio registers a one-day gain of 245 basis points (or 2.45 percent). This response is 78 percent stronger than that of the overall equity market in the United States. On the other hand, the restaurant industry is not as responsive to the unexpected changes in the monetary policy. When the Federal Reserve announces a reversal of monetary policy in either direction, hotel industry stocks react more strongly than do others.</p>

<title>Motivation</title>
<p>Consider an investor who is interested in investing in the hospitality industry, specifically in hotel and restaurant companies. Among many questions the investor has, one must be about the risks involved with the investment, especially given that many investors consider the hospitality industry to have high risk. The sources of potential risk for the hospitality industries include their business model, market risk, and interest rate risk, which is our concern in this article. Because of the high fixed costs in building hotels and restaurants, these businesses rely on volume to cover the fixed costs and make profits. When the economy is in a downturn, hotels and restaurants take heavy hits as consumers cut back on their traveling and dining. Changes in interest rates may have an impact on consumers’ borrowing and spending behaviors, which directly affect the earnings of hospitality companies. The debt-heavy capital structure (particularly for hotels) imposes financial risks to hospitality companies. Especially when they are loaded with floating-rate debt, interest rate increases limit the companies’ ability to service their debt obligations. That may be a risk to their creditworthiness and ultimately translate into losses for investors. Interest rate changes can directly affect firms’ cost of capital through changing liquidity conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938965511428967">Goyenko and Ukhov 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938965511428967">Goyenko, Subrahmanyam, and Ukhov, forthcoming</xref>). Interest rate changes also affect the companies’ valuation, which in turn affect the market for corporate control.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1938965511428967">1</xref></sup> Thus, understanding how hospitality companies’ stocks respond to interest rate changes is of paramount importance to identify one of the many risks they are exposed to—namely, the risk of the monetary policy changes. In particular, it is the reaction of the industry to unexpected changes in the monetary policy that is of interest. The efficient market hypothesis suggests that any expected change would already have been reflected in the stock prices prior to the announcement of the change.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1938965511428967">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Announcements of changes to existing monetary policy receive considerable attention from investors. Asset prices of all types react to formal Federal Reserve Board announcements regarding the changes in monetary policy. Researchers have established the relevance of the Fed’s monetary policy announcements to asset price changes by documenting an “announcement effect.” The purpose of the analysis presented in this article is to extend the findings of earlier researchers on the announcement effect by examining the relationship between unexpected changes in monetary policy and the stock prices in the hospitality industry.</p>
<p>In this article, we measure the reaction of the lodging and restaurant sectors’ stock prices to the Federal Reserve’s announcements on the federal fund target rate (FFTR), which reflect monetary policy actions. The FFTR is the base interest rate set by the Fed as a tool to implement its monetary policy, and it is the overnight rate the member banks use as a benchmark to borrow or lend to meet the reserve requirements imposed by the Fed. The changes in this benchmark rate have far-reaching consequences and normally affect the interest rates for debt instruments of all maturities.</p>
<p>We focus on the period from January 1994 through December 2005, during which there were a total of 100 announcements by the Fed about the FFTR. While monetary policies such as increasing or decreasing the federal funds target rates are responses to current economic situations, the economy usually reacts to monetary policies, directly or indirectly. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938965511428967">Bernanke and Kuttner (2005)</xref> argue that the most direct and immediate effects of such monetary policy actions are seen in the financial markets. They report that the value-weighted equity market in the United States registers a one-day gain of roughly 1 percent in response to a hypothetical unexpected 25-basis-point (0.25 percent) rate easing (i.e., a decrease). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938965511428967">Barrows and Naka (1994)</xref> studied the impact of several macroeconomic variables on stock prices of companies in the hospitality industry, including changes in the money supply, consumption, and expected inflation. They reported that increases in the expected inflation rate diminished stock prices in the hospitality industry, while increases in the supply of money or in consumption boosted stock prices. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1938965511428967">Wong and Song (2006)</xref> use the vector autoregressive (VAR) model to study the impact of certain macro variables on the stock prices in hospitality industry. They show that the 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield explains a large portion of the forecast error variance of stock prices, but the CPI, industrial production, and money supply variables explain a relatively small portion of the forecast error variance in stock prices.</p>
<p>Although studies have measured the impact of monetary policy on equity markets and bond markets, to our knowledge, none aimed to determine the impact of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy on hospitality-related industries. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1938965511428967">Rigobon and Sack (2002)</xref> estimate the response of asset prices and interest rates to changes in monetary policy, using the three-month Eurodollar rate as the measure of monetary policy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1938965511428967">3</xref></sup> We have already mentioned <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938965511428967">Bernanke and Kuttner (2005)</xref>, whom we follow in our study. They measure and analyze the stock market’s response to monetary policy actions, attempting to explain the factors responsible for changes in the stock market. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1938965511428967">Payne (2003)</xref> applies the VAR approach to analyze the macroeconomic impact of changes in the Federal Funds Rate on the risk premiums for real estate investment trusts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1938965511428967">Plazzi, Torous, and Valkanov (2010)</xref> show that the variation in commercial real estate prices is largely due to the movements in discount rates and not to cash flows. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938965511428967">Goukasian and Majbouri (2010)</xref> estimate the impact of changes in the monetary policy on the real-estate-related industries by studying the industry returns on days when a decision was made and announced to the public.</p>
<p>In this article, we examine the reaction of stock prices in the hospitality industry to unexpected changes in monetary policy. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we discuss the methodology and describe the data collected to implement the methods and conduct the study. After presenting the main findings, we discuss the implications and limitations of our study.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<sec id="section3-1938965511428967">
<title>Event-Study Approach</title>
<p>As we indicated, following the approaches used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938965511428967">Kuttner (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938965511428967">Bernanke and Kuttner (2005)</xref>, we estimate the reaction of value-weighted portfolios in the hospitality industry to changes in the federal reserve’s target rate, as announced after every Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. On average, stock prices increase on the announcement date in response to an unexpected decrease in the FFTR, and they decrease if the rate is raised unexpectedly. The empirical analysis of our article is an “event study” in which the events are the FOMC meetings. As we suggested above, the efficient market hypothesis makes estimating the impact of the announcements on stocks less than straightforward. Existing information is quickly reflected in market prices long before policy decisions are made and implemented. Because stock prices reflect existing information, and because a part of the policy changes are anticipated by the market, the impact of monetary-policy changes on the asset prices is not readily apparent. Thus, the study of the responses to the policy changes on the event days must assess the market’s reaction to the unexpected portion of the news, since the expected portion is already reflected in prices. Therefore, to measure the impact of the policy on the prices, we need to measure the unexpected part of the monetary policy action and determine its effect on prices. To measure the unexpected portion of monetary policy or the “surprise” change, we employ the method proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938965511428967">Kuttner (2001)</xref> to construct a data set of unexpected changes in the FFTR.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1938965511428967">4</xref></sup> We then divide monetary policy actions into their expected and unexpected components and study the impact of each on stock prices. The procedure to measure the unexpected component of the rate changes is as follows:</p>
<p>We use prices of front-month and one-month-out 30-day federal funds futures prices, as traded on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), to estimate the expected and unexpected portions of the changes in the fed funds target rate (as obtained from Bloomberg). Using the futures prices before and after the event, after appropriate scaling, we are able to estimate the unexpected portion of the fed funds rate change. Since we know what the actual change in the rate is, we can derive the expected portion of the rate change.</p>
<p>Assume the event occurs on the <italic>t</italic> + 1th day of a month that has <italic>N</italic> days. Denote the FFTR before the event as <italic>i</italic><sup>−</sup> and the rate after the event as <italic>i</italic><sup>+</sup>. Thus, <italic>i</italic><sup>–</sup> is an average for <italic>t</italic> days and <italic>i</italic><sup>+</sup> is the average for <italic>N − t</italic> days. Let <italic>P</italic><sub>−</sub> and <italic>P</italic><sub>0</sub> be the futures prices before and after the event. The futures prices are 100 − (the average fed funds rate for the month).</p>

<title>Sample and Data</title>
<p>One of the significant steps in collecting data on federal funds target rate changes is to determine the exact dates when changes occurred or, more to the point, when they were announced. Starting in January 1994, the Fed announces its decision concerning any changes in the FFTR on the day of the FOMC meeting when the decision is made. The announcement is generally made at about 2:15 <sc>p.m.</sc> Eastern Time. As a result, both the futures market and the stock market are aware of and respond to the new policy on the day when changes are made and announced.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1938965511428967">7</xref></sup> We have carefully accounted for the few exceptions to this pattern. We note that October 15, 1998, is the only date in our study when an announcement was made after the futures market closed. To accommodate for this singular occurrence, we use the opening price on October 16 and the closing rate on the 15th to measure the expected and unexpected portion of the monetary policy.</p>

<p>Although the Fed made no change on 55 event days, we still must perform our analysis, because the market could have expected a change, and there could be reaction to unexpected nonchange. The distribution of the actual rate changes is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1938965511428967">Exhibit 2</xref>. As can be seen, there were instances in which the Fed took relatively extreme actions, cutting the rate by 50 bps nine times and even increasing the rate by 75 bps. In 86 percent of the cases, however, there is either no change or a change of 25 basis points.</p>

<title>Data on Fed Funds Futures Prices</title>
<p>As we said, to estimate the unexpected changes in the FFTR, we used the 30-day fed funds futures from the CBOT as our data on prices of front-month and one-month-out futures for each month in which an event occurred.</p>

<title>The value-weighted portfolio of hospitality stocks</title>
<p>We used a data set of prices for all the stocks in the lodging and restaurant industries, as indicated by U.S. Department of Labor SIC codes of 7011 for lodging and 5812 for restaurants. We then extract the daily returns for these stocks from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) at the University of Chicago through Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS). For the event-days in our sample we form three value-weighted portfolios: one for all hospitality stocks, one for hotel stocks, and one for restaurant stocks. We use information on all available stocks on the day of the events, including those that subsequently were delisted or those that were nonexistent in the previous events, to fully capture the response of the industries to the unexpected changes in the policy.</p>

<title>Basic Regression Results</title>
<p>As discussed before, the assumption of the efficient market hypothesis is that stock markets are forward looking and incorporate all available information into prices. This theory suggests that expectations of upcoming rate changes (or changes in monetary policy) would have already been reflected in stock prices before an FOMC meeting and the accompanying announcement. Actual rate changes do not always coincide with market expectations, of course, and the market reacts to the unexpected component of the rate changes. Therefore, to understand the effects of monetary policy decisions on stock prices, and to accurately measure them, we need to examine the stocks’ responses to the unexpected changes in the FFTR. To estimate the responses, we ran the following regression:</p>

We also examine the reaction of the overall equity market to the changes in FFTR. As expected, hospitality-related stock portfolios’ responses to the expected change in the FFTR are not statistically significant. However, the responses to the surprise change in the rate are significant for all industries, including hospitality. Notably, the coefficient of the surprise for the hotel industry is larger (in magnitude) than that of the overall market, which in turn is larger than that of the restaurant industry.</p>

<p><italic>Notes: Combined</italic> gives the statistics for hotels and restaurants together. The sample includes 100 announcements about the Federal Funds Target Rate from January 1994 to December 2005. The dependent variable for the combined regression is the value-weighted portfolio return of all stocks in hotel and restaurant industries on the announcement day. The dependent variable for the model <italic>Hotel</italic> is the value-weighted portfolio return of all stocks in the hotel industry on the announcement day. The dependent variable for the model <italic>Restaurant</italic> is the value-weighted portfolio return of all stocks in the restaurant industry on the announcement day. <italic>Expected change</italic> is the expected rate change derived from Federal Funds Futures prices on the announcement day. <italic>Surprise change</italic> is the surprise range change on the announcement day. For each independent variable in a model, we report its regression coefficient, with its robust heteroskedastic standard errors in the parentheses. Significance levels: ***0.1%, **1%, and *5%. Data analysis was also completed excluding outliers, based on Cook’s <italic>D</italic> influence statistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938965511428967">Cook 1977</xref>). Observations for which this statistic was larger than 0.3 were excluded, resulting in 98 observations for the hotels, 100 for restaurants, and 99 for the overall market. The results are qualitatively similar and available from the authors on request.</p>
</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>The regression coefficient suggests that the reaction is economically significant. For a hypothetical surprise 25-basis-point rate cut, the combined hospitality industry stocks will roughly register a one-day gain of 119 basis points (0.25 × 4.74) or 1.19 percent. This is a strong reaction, considering the fact that these are daily returns. The hotel industry’s component of that reaction is stronger than the restaurant industry component. The hotel industry responds to the surprise 25 bps cut with an average one-day gain of 245 basis points. The hotel industry’s reaction is probably due to its greater dependence on debt financing and its substantial exposure to changes in interest rates, as compared to the restaurant industry. We should note that the overall market response to the unexpected 25 bps cut is also strong: a one-day gain of 1.37 percent. Thus, the hotel industry responds the same way as the overall market to monetary policy changes, but the magnitude is on average about 78 percent stronger than the market as a whole. To the extent that this response reflects the underlying risk, the overall results are consistent with the conventional wisdom that the hotel industry is generally riskier than other industries.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1938965511428967">
<title>Asymmetries in the Results</title>
<p>Several further questions arise regarding the asymmetries in the responses of the stock prices to the rate changes. For example, investors might wish to know whether the hospitality industries’ responses to the changes in monetary policy are the same during periods of economic expansions or contractions. It would also be interesting to learn about the reaction when the Fed reverses its policy in either direction, or when the unexpected portion of the rate change in the FFTR was positive or when it was negative.</p>
<p>The first possibility is that positive or negative surprises may cause different impacts on the market and, thus, result in different market reactions. We study the impact of surprises in one direction or the other by introducing a dummy variable that equals 1 if the surprise is positive and 0 otherwise. We multiply this dummy by the amount of surprise change and analyze the variable’s coefficient (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1938965511428967">Exhibit 4</xref>).</p>

</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>For the combined portfolio, the coefficient of the surprise rate change remains negative, which is significant at the 0.1 percent significance level. The coefficient of the interactive term with surprise change and positive surprise is positive, but the statistical significance is weak. The coefficients of this variable between the regressions for the individual hotel and restaurant portfolios, however, differ substantially. In the regression for the hotel portfolio, the coefficient is positive and significant at the 1 percent level. The positive coefficient indicates that when the surprise is positive (i.e., the actual rate increase is greater than expected or the actual rate cut is smaller than expected), the reaction of the hotel industry is weaker than when the surprise is negative.</p>
<p>For restaurants, the coefficient is positive but not significant, which is consistent with that industry’s relatively weak response to any surprise in rate changes, as shown in Exhibit 4. Once again, the coefficients of the expected rate changes in all regressions are not significant, a finding consistent with the efficient market hypothesis.</p>
<p>Similarly, we analyze another possibility for asymmetries: positive rate changes, no rate changes, and reversals in the Fed policy (the first time for an increase or decrease after a period in the other direction; i.e., tightening to easing or vice versa). We included new dummy variables multiplied by the magnitude of the surprise change in the regressions. The <italic>No rate change</italic> dummy variable is used for event days when no change actually occurred in the FFTR (regardless of whether the market expected the change or not) and the <italic>Positive rate change</italic> is set to 1 for event days with actual positive rate changes.</p>
<p>The regression results are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1938965511428967">Exhibit 5</xref>. The coefficient of <italic>No rate change</italic> dummy is positive and statistically significant for all the cases. This dummy variable is important, because it means that on the days when the Fed does not change the rate, the surprise change in the rate has less impact on the stock returns than do rate surprises on other days. This finding makes sense for the hotel and restaurant industries, because no change in the FFTR portends relatively little change in the demand for hotel rooms, dining, and other related services and products. So a nonchange in rates has little effect on the stream of future cash flows or the discount factors to be used to find properties’ present values. This is consistent with the results in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938965511428967">Bernanke and Kuttner (2005)</xref>, and, following them, we interpret it as a sign that markets might think that the Fed has effectively postponed the expected rate change to the next FOMC meeting. On the other hand, the signs of the actual rate changes are not significant. This means that the direction of actual monetary policy does not matter in affecting the magnitude of the stocks’ reaction to the policy actions.</p>

The impact of “reversals” is negative in all cases and statistically significant in the combined industry and the hotel portfolios. This finding indicates that a reversal in the direction of the monetary policy plays a significant role in explaining the hospitality industries’ reaction to monetary policy actions. This is not surprising, as markets may interpret a reversal announcement as a long-term directional change in Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. In other words, after a reversal announcement, the markets may perceive that the Fed will not change the direction of its policy for an indefinite period and, therefore, successive rate changes will be in the same direction as the one just announced. All of this leads to a stronger reaction.</p>

<p>Notes: <italic>Combined</italic> gives the statistics for hotels and restaurants together. The sample includes 100 announcements about the Federal Funds Target Rate from January 1994 to December 2005. The dependent variable for the combined regression is the value-weighted portfolio return of all stocks in hotel and restaurant industries on the announcement day. The dependent variable for the model <italic>Hotel</italic> is the value-weighted portfolio return of all stocks in the hotel industry on the announcement day. The dependent variable for the model <italic>Restaurant</italic> is the value-weighted portfolio return of all stocks in the restaurant industry on the announcement day. <italic>Expected change</italic> is the expected rate change derived from Federal Funds Futures prices on the announcement day. <italic>Surprise change</italic> is the surprise range change on the announcement day. For each independent variable in a model, we report its regression coefficient with its robust heteroskedastic standard errors in the parentheses. Significance levels: ***0.1%, **1%, *5%, and <sup>†</sup>10%.</p>

<p>In summary, there is a strong significant response in hospitality industry stocks to surprise changes in FFTR. Notably, the magnitude of the hotel industry’s response is at least twice as great as that of the overall equity market, as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938965511428967">Bernanke and Kuttner (2005)</xref>. As expected, the hotel industry reacts strongly to unexpected changes in the FFTR. The stronger reaction of the hotel industry is consistent with the view that the hotel industry is more sensitive to the “cost of money” (proxied by the FFTR and controlled by the Federal Reserve) than the other “average” industries.</p>

<title>Implications and Limitations</title>
<p>This study reports that the combined hotel and restaurant industries, and the hotel industry in particular, react strongly to unforeseen monetary policy actions, as measured by unexpected changes in the federal funds target rate. On average, a hypothetical surprise rate cut of 25 basis points results in an approximately 119-basis-point increase in returns for the combined industries and 245 basis points for the hotel industry alone. The reaction was weaker when there was a positive surprise or there was no rate change. When the rate change indicates a reversal of the Fed monetary policy, however, the market’s reaction is noticeably stronger.</p>
<p>Our findings indicate that investors interested in the hotel business should be aware that hotel stocks are sensitive to changes in the macroeconomic environment, as reflected in the Federal Reserve’s monetary policies. Our estimate indicates that the hotel business is riskier than other industries on average, when the risk is gauged by the exposure to the monetary policy. Highlighting the risk of the hotel industry, however, does not imply that investors should avoid investing in this industry or allocate less money to this industry when they construct their portfolios. Instead, the analysis here serves as a tool to account for those risks and take them into account in their risk management practices. The results also have implications for hotel industry executives, who should consider hedging the macroeconomic risks by engaging in derivatives transactions, such as those traded on the CBOT. When making capital budgeting decisions, executives of hotel companies should also adjust their discount rates depending on whether the going interest rates are high or low compared to historical averages.</p>
<p>The above analysis sheds light on some macro risks for the hospitality industry, but it has its limitations. While we report evidence that the hotel industry responds strongly to monetary policy actions, we do not discuss what fundamental sources explain the market’s reaction. That is, we do not study here whether the stock returns are driven by changes in future dividends (or cash flows, in general), by the expected change in the real interest rate (which is part of the discount rate used in capital budgeting decisions), or by changes in the future risk premium. In the context of the hotel industry, one way to explore these questions is to examine whether hotel room rates respond to monetary policy changes. We leave this question for a future research project.</p>

<p>Because we use daily data on the Fed futures, the daily premiums, the factor <italic>ε</italic><sup>0</sup> - <italic>ε</italic><sup>-</sup> is expected to be negligible for such a small time interval. When the event day is on the first day of a month, we take the open and close prices of futures on the day to find the surprise change in rates. If the event day is on the last day of the month, we take the one-month-out futures prices on the last day of the previous month and the current-month prices on the first day of the month to find the surprise change in the Fed funds target rate. We thank an anonymous referee for suggesting a simplified method to derive the unexpected portion of the rate change.</p>

<p>When the Fed funds rate change occurs on the first day of the month, we use the “next month” futures rate on the last day of the previous month for <italic>P</italic>_. When <italic>t</italic> is a day that is at the end of the month, <italic>N – t</italic> becomes small, and so the proxy becomes exponentially larger. Therefore, for events that fall on the last three days of the month, we use the unscaled change in the one-month futures rate instead of the spot month rate.</p>

<p>Rate changes announced before January 1994 are not as “clean” as those made after that time, because of the lags between FOMC meetings and the actual announcement.
