<p>This review explores the conceptualization and measurement of neighborhood and institutional relationships related to children’s educational outcomes in neighborhood effects research. The review’s analysis first summarizes early statements about neighborhood and school relationships within the field. The analysis next situates neighborhood and institutional components within a broader ecological context, relying heavily on Bronfenbrenner’s ecosystems theory. A description of six emerging models of neighborhood and institutional relationships follows and serves to organize the 83 studies within this review. The analysis concludes with an assessment of the relative importance of neighborhoods and schools in a subset of studies that measure the effects of both. The analysis findings are contextualized with the author’s identification of the major methodological complications particular to the joint estimation of neighborhood and institutional effects.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The major question addressed in this article asks how do studies conceptualize the interrelated components and effects of neighborhoods and institutions that work to influence the educational development of children. The importance of the question extends from several realities, primary among them, vast differences in the condition of each domain and the developmental opportunities it affords. Inequality between our poor and affluent areas has grown over the past three decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0013124510392779">Massey &amp; Fischer, 2003</xref>), and the schools within the least advantaged areas are also likely to be concentrated in poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0013124510392779">Newman &amp; Schnare, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0013124510392779">Saporito &amp; Sohoni, 2007</xref>). Others have noted that differences in the quality of schools according to location persist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0013124510392779">Education Trust, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0013124510392779">Lee &amp; Burkham, 2002</xref>) and that there exist large achievement disparities on the National Assessment of Educational Progress between students in the relatively disadvantaged inner city and the urban fringe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0013124510392779">Mullis, Dossey, Foertsch, Jones, &amp; Gentile, 1991</xref>). In addition, social policies often rely on what we think we know about these neighborhood–school linkages. Knowledge generated about them could inform critical policy decisions, including the option to offer year-round or extended-day schooling to limit the exposure of children to distressed neighborhood environments and the identification of the most appropriate context (the institutional or the neighborhood) in which interventions could alter problematic peer behaviors (e.g., bullying, delinquency). These are only a few issues that could be better understood by an examination of ties between neighborhoods and schools.</p>
<p>To examine neighborhood–institutional relationships, I first review other discussions of the connections between neighborhoods and educational institutions, though at times I refer to other neighborhood institutions to demonstrate similar dynamics. For this reason, the frameworks presented in this discussion have an applicability that reaches beyond the school context into other neighborhood institutions, especially public housing, which share many of the ecological qualities described in this article. I next diagram and explain neighborhood–institutional relationships within a broader ecological context, relying heavily on Bronfenbrenner’s ecosystems theory. Third, I review the neighborhood effects research and present six emerging models or frameworks of neighborhood–institutional relationships. Last, I summarize the relative importance of neighborhoods and schools to education in a subset of studies that measure the effects of both and the major methodological complications particular to the measurement of those effects. A general discussion of the review’s findings concludes the article.</p>

<title>Earlier Statements About Neighborhoods and Institutions</title>
<p>Few efforts have sought to assess the development of institutional models within the field of neighborhood effects. The interrelatedness of the two has been alluded to in recent works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013124510392779">Bowen &amp; Richman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0013124510392779">Sampson, Morenoff, &amp; Gannon-Rowley, 2002</xref>) but has not been the subject of any substantial review since 1990. At that time, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0013124510392779">Jencks and Mayer (1990)</xref> provided a detailed exploration of neighborhood effects in education, an even more extensive consideration of school composition effects, and a few comments about their coexistence. However, at the time of their review, only a few quantitative neighborhood studies had been generated and only one in education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013124510392779">Datcher, 1982</xref>). Nearly 30 years later, reviews of neighborhood effects have surfaced in the areas of mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0013124510392779">Truong &amp; Ma, 2006</xref>); problem behaviors and health-related outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0013124510392779">Sampson et al., 2002</xref>); and developmental outcomes for youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0013124510392779">Gephardt, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0013124510392779">Leventhal &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 2000</xref>) but none concerning neighborhood–school relationships.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0013124510392779">1</xref></sup></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0013124510392779">Jencks and Mayer’s (1990)</xref> initial thoughts about an “institutional model” within neighborhood effects research highlighted how local residents could be influenced by adults from outside the area who worked in the schools and the police force. This observation alluded to the possible independence of the effects of institutions within the neighborhood context if, for example, institutions take on some of the characteristics of their nonresident personnel. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0013124510392779">Jencks and Mayer (1990)</xref> were not especially sympathetic to the notion of independent school effects however, or for that matter, the distinctiveness of neighborhoods and schools. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0013124510392779">Jencks and Mayer (1990)</xref> discussed the two domains as being quite synonymous, stating that “what we describe as an effect of having affluent neighbors may be an effect of the neighborhood institutions that the affluent create for themselves and their neighbors” (p. 115) and that “the earliest quantitative studies of ‘neighborhood’ effects were conducted in the late 1950s and early 1960s and dealt with the effects of a high school’s mean SES on graduating seniors’ college plans” (p. 127). In their most direct comparison, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0013124510392779">Jencks and Mayer (1990)</xref> note that the only difference between the two was that one domain assigned grades and the other did not. This suggested similarity extended beyond the structural composition of both to the social processes that formed in them. To this point, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0013124510392779">Jencks and Mayer (1990)</xref> argue that “even if neighborhood and school mix were not strongly correlated, we would expect them to have somewhat similar effects because most of the same social processes should be at work in both contexts” (p. 138). This review in contrast supports a conceptual separation of the two domains driven by the research that has appeared since the first neighborhood effects study was published in the early 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0013124510392779">Fernandez &amp; Kulik, 1981</xref>) and the first investigating cognitive outcomes a year later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013124510392779">Datcher, 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>Perhaps, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0013124510392779">Jencks and Mayer’s (1990)</xref> most notable contribution to the exploration of neighborhood–school linkages lies in their recognition of elements of a complex ecological system. They describe structural composition and the social processes of the two domains in similar terms, leading to a conclusion explored in-depth within this review that schools—being constituted by similar components—are also ecological and, along with neighborhoods, fit in some way within a broader ecological arrangement or ecosystem. Other components of this larger ecological arrangement have been identified in other works, including the organizational community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013124510392779">Arum, 2000</xref>) and the built environments of both neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0013124510392779">Limbos &amp; Casteel, 2008</xref>) and institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0013124510392779">Currie &amp; Yelowitz, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0013124510392779">Jacob, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0013124510392779">Venkatesh, 2000</xref>). Exploring how these components are situated within a broader understanding of their shared context is instrumental to understanding their connectedness.</p>

<title>The Ecological Context of Neighborhood–School Relationships</title>
<p>“Neighborhood–institutions” as a joint conceptualization suggest a system of complicated relationships among environmental features within and between at least two environments that vary in their degree of similarity, interdependence, and in the quality of their effects. My effort to define these relationships begins with a diagram of components of an ecological system suggested by the models of neighborhood–school relationships I describe later in this article. I have aligned the model’s features with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013124510392779">Bronfenbrenner’s (1979)</xref> ecosystems theory in which he described nested layers of ecological contexts (i.e., from macro to micro) that operate in support of child development. Rather than presenting each nested layer in concentric zones of influence as has been the case in other representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0013124510392779">Simbeni &amp; Allen-Meares, 2002</xref>), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0013124510392779">Figure 1</xref> lays out each strata so that more detail can be provided about the components of each and their interactions. At the macroecological level, broader social forces define systems of relationships. Here, we locate the field’s concerns about macroeconomic conditions for example and their influence on policy making at the exo level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0013124510392779">Mirel, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0013124510392779">Wilson, 1996</xref>); neighborhood inequality at the meso level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0013124510392779">Jargowsky, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0013124510392779">Wilson, 1987</xref>); and schooling at the microecological strata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013124510392779">Anyon, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0013124510392779">Kantor &amp; Brenzel, 1992</xref>). The exo level represents concerted efforts to affect the quality of neighborhoods, schools, and their association, consisting of policies adopted by representatives of broader communities (e.g., city councils, school boards, public housing authorities, teachers’ unions, etc.) and organizations such as parent associations, auxiliary groups, and clubs.</p>

<p>The figure also reflects the suggestion within research that at the mesoecological level, neighborhoods are defined by elements that are structural; constituted by social processes; related to the physical edifice or form of the environment; and institutional. Structure in this sense alludes to an area’s population characteristics, and most frequently in the literature, to the classic social stratification indicators of social class, race, and labor market opportunity. Examinations of neighborhood structure have come to characterize much of the neighborhood effects research, owing largely to the field’s concern that limited employment opportunity led to the concentration of poverty in African American neighborhoods, which in turn depressed the social indicators of their residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0013124510392779">Wilson, 1996</xref>). Structure in this perspective then does more than denote a contextually specific location of population characteristics; more important is its supposition that a neighborhood’s and institution’s defining attributes, in isolation as well as collectively, work to determine individual- and group-level behavior.</p>
<p>The built environment (i.e., man-made surroundings) is another neighborhood feature often related in research to the educational development of children. These features include housing quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0013124510392779">Currie &amp; Yelowitz, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0013124510392779">Jacob, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0013124510392779">Limbos &amp; Casteel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0013124510392779">Thompson, Iachan, Overpeck, Ross, &amp; Gross, 2006</xref>); the location of toxic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0013124510392779">Margai &amp; Henry, 2003</xref>) and private schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013124510392779">Barrow, 2005</xref>); opportunities for community center involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013124510392779">Anderson, Sabatelli, &amp; Kosutic, 2007</xref>); and urban form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0013124510392779">Schlossberg, Greene, Phillips, Johnson, &amp; Parker, 2006</xref>), among others. Next, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0013124510392779">Figure 1</xref> incorporates social process effects which represent the geographically bound human interactions that result in behavior. Peer processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013124510392779">Darling &amp; Steinberg, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0013124510392779">Durlauf, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0013124510392779">Lopez-Turley, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0013124510392779">Nash, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0013124510392779">South, Baumer, &amp; Lutz, 2003</xref>), crime and violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013124510392779">Bowen &amp; Bowen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013124510392779">Bowen, Bowen, &amp; Ware, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013124510392779">Bowen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0013124510392779">Madyun &amp; Lee, 2008</xref>), and a neighborhood’s social capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013124510392779">Ainsworth, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013124510392779">Caughy, Nettles, O’Campo, &amp; Lohrfink, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013124510392779">Darling &amp; Steinberg, 1997</xref>) are examples of contextually determined social mechanisms that have emerged within neighborhood effects research. My conceptualization of social processes presumes that they are not static and vary in quality, frequency of occurrence, or intensity at the neighborhood level according to the seasons. Hence, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0013124510392779">Figure 1</xref> makes a distinction between social processes occurring in warmer than at cooler times of the year as neighborhoods become more ecologically relevant when climates encourage more social interaction and the use of public spaces. Last, I have included institutions at the mesoecological level because they are also important to the organization of neighborhoods and, as will be elaborated on later, an important source of variation between neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013124510392779">Brunner &amp; Sonstelie, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0013124510392779">Green, Malpezzi, &amp; Seah, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0013124510392779">Kane, Staiger, &amp; Reigg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0013124510392779">Nechyba, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0013124510392779">Figure 1</xref> provide for the interrelated nature of its components. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0013124510392779">Pattillo’s (2007)</xref> recent account of change in a Chicago neighborhood presents a thorough demonstration of these linkages. She finds that urban planning and the deconstruction of public housing units (elements of the built environment) led to an influx of higher income individuals (i.e., structural change) who collectively resisted (i.e., social process) the return of public housing to the area and supported the transformation of the local school into a charter school. These ties allow us to conceptualize the relationship between the gentrified neighborhood and the charter school in a way that may be different from other neighborhoods, schools, and their relationships. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0013124510392779">Pattillo’s (2007)</xref> work also shows how policy decisions regarding charter school development and public housing construction occurring at the exoecological level become negotiated in the neighborhood context, making less realistic these direct relationships between educational policy and local school functioning that we see emphasized in critiques of the neighborhood effects research (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013124510392779">Arum, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0013124510392779">Figure 1</xref> therefore implies that all educational policies are negotiated at the meso level, as it is at this level that parents and children are grouped—however imperfectly—into schools and, together with school staff, are expected to identify policy resources, accept or ignore them, and make sense of their use.</p>
<p>Although institutions are considered part of the neighborhood context and having direct ties with aspects of the neighborhood, they are also microecological, possessing internally those same characteristics (of unknown quality) with which they interact externally. These internal characteristics can be easily conceptualized within both schools and public housing. For example, both institutions possess a demographic composition, with the study of the school’s structural composition having a much longer history. Second, Sudhir Venkatesh’s (2002) account of public housing in Chicago suggests that one of the most significant contributors to the quality of the day-to-day experiences of public housing residents was the infrastructure of the housing itself and the larger housing complex. Likewise, the large size of urban school buildings has been credited with a general breakdown of the school’s compensatory effect and student civility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0013124510392779">Garabino &amp; Plantz, 1980</xref>) and a lack of school connectedness that persist after accounting for neighborhood differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0013124510392779">Thompson et al., 2006</xref>). Subsequently, the school-within-schools reform movement acknowledges that the built environment of schools is important to learning and to low performers in particular. Third, quantitative approaches have shed light on the stratified social organization of schools according to race, social class, and gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0013124510392779">Lucas, 1999</xref>) and the social processes within them that lead to differences between schools in their social organization and student performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013124510392779">Bryk, Lee, &amp; Holland, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013124510392779">Bryk &amp; Schneider, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0013124510392779">Figure 1</xref> accordingly recognizes a dynamic interplay not only of neighborhood features including its institutional one but also among the elements of neighborhoods and institutions in producing neighborhood–institutional relationships.</p>

<title>Emerging Models of Neighborhood– Institutional Relationships</title>
<p>The overarching organization of ecological relationships presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0013124510392779">Figure 1</xref> represents a synthesis of the approaches found in the neighborhood effects research. My goal in this section is to identify the major approaches within the field that informed the creation of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0013124510392779">Figure 1</xref>, use those approaches or models to organize existing neighborhood effects research, and summarize the findings of studies when helpful to the understanding of each approach. The following sections describe six models of neighborhood–institutional relationships.</p>
<sec id="section5-0013124510392779">
<title>Ecological Correspondence Theory: The Endogenous Institution Model</title>
<p>Early neighborhood effects research offered a framework in which education outcomes were a product of individual, family, and neighborhood qualities. Missing was any consideration of institutional influences. In fact, 60 of the 83 studies in this review do not account for school-level features. Though the conspicuous absence of institutional-level variables may have been unintentional or even unavoidable, given the constraints of data, the presumption that schools do not matter is perpetuated in the absence of institutional measures. Rather than limiting the review to the 23 neighborhood studies that interrogate the role of schools, this review takes a critical approach by making explicit the models of neighborhood–school relationships that explain, and perhaps even justify, the omission of school-level characteristics. These models reflect many of the sentiments expressed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0013124510392779">Jencks and Mayer (1990)</xref> and rely on the belief that institutions mirror closely the quality of the environments in which they are nested and students live. Therefore, the effects of schools may be no different in quality than those of neighborhoods.</p>
<p>There is ample reason to hold this view, as the ecological correspondence of the neighborhood and institutional contexts have been supported by policies at the federal and state level. Housing and Urban Development (HUD), for example, has a long history of placing public housing developments within low-income areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0013124510392779">Goetz, 2003</xref>) and imposing rules that required public housing recipients to be assigned to areas that matched their racial classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0013124510392779">Hirsch, 2000</xref>). Educational policy has also supported correspondence theory in that local school attendance mandates are still in affect for approximately three quarters of children attending public schools and consequently have achieved a similarity between the composition of neighborhoods and schools along the important dimensions of race, social class, and educational preparedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0013124510392779">Lee &amp; Burkham, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0013124510392779">Saporito &amp; Sohoni, 2007</xref>). As the majority of school resources remain locally determined despite the impact of state formulas to reduce funding disparities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013124510392779">Benabou, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0013124510392779">Education Trust, 2005</xref>), noticeable differences in school resources persist between urban, suburban, and rural schools and oftentimes between schools of different neighborhoods within the same district (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013124510392779">Brantlinger, 2003</xref>). If this is the case, the second model makes the consideration of one context less necessary if the other context is already represented in the specifications of statistical models.</p>

<title>Tightly and Loosely Coupled Status Attainment Model</title>
<p>Another approach to ecological correspondence theory is the tightly and loosely coupled status attainment model. Rather than assuming schools are similar across neighborhoods or that neighborhood and school characteristics covary, this model assesses the similarity of the qualities of the two contexts that an individual occupies and how well the quality of one context predicts the quality of the other. This framework represents a unification of sorts of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0013124510392779">Weick’s (1976)</xref> work with that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013124510392779">Blau and Duncan (1967)</xref>. In the former, distinctions are made between organizations that have components and processes that are loosely connected in function versus those that have a more strict bureaucratic quality or tightly coupled. Applying <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013124510392779">Blau and Duncan’s (1967)</xref> status attainment work, which investigates how one’s placement within one stratified domain (e.g., education) is a determinant of that person’s social location in another (e.g., labor market), allows us to consider the fit of the coupling across social domains and ecological levels.</p>
<p>Referring to the mesoecological level in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0013124510392779">Figure 1</xref> for example, a neighborhood’s structure might have a strong correspondence with the quality of its institutions. To this point, one study finds that 43% of all units in public housing family developments live in neighborhoods where 40% or more of the residents live in poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0013124510392779">Newman &amp; Schnare, 1997</xref>). A family’s receipt of public housing in this instance is highly predictive of the type of neighborhood in which a family will live. The more similar the individual’s social locations are within the two contexts, the more tightly coupled the social system is thought to be. Couplings have been demonstrated across ecological levels as well. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013124510392779">Cook, Herman, Phillips, and Settersten (2002)</xref> employ the tightly and loosely coupled model in an analysis of neighborhoods and schools in Prince Georges County, Maryland and conclude that important educational determinants are more tightly coupled at the neighborhood (mesoecological) and school (microecological) levels than between those levels and the individual level. The tightly/loosely coupled status attainment model then provides for the comparison of couplings within ecological units as well as across ecological levels and their social domains.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0013124510392779">
<title>Limited Institutional Variation Model</title>
<p>The third model of neighborhood–institutional relationships posits that institutions do not vary significantly enough in quality across contexts to require their consideration in research, either because their function is limited to academically sorting children according to their ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0013124510392779">Parsons, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0013124510392779">Sorokin, 1959</xref>) or because policies have reduced differences across schools in their resources. In the former more functional perspective, schools are constant because they possess similar and reliable mechanisms that are thought to support the demonstration of student ability. Though accounts of schooling have advanced far beyond classic functional explanations, contemporary claims about the function of schooling have replaced student ability as the primary catalyst of achievement with students’ social background. Educators and social commentators argue that schools are unable to alter the correspondence between the social background and academic achievement of children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013124510392779">Collins, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0013124510392779">Jencks et al., 1972</xref>), with neighborhoods being an important part of their social background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0013124510392779">Traub, 2000</xref>). Students therefore experience achievement in school consistent with their social backgrounds and not according to the capacity of schools to educate them.</p>
<p>The second perspective within this model extends from research conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013124510392779">Coleman et al. (1966)</xref> decades ago; they concluded that schools varied less in quality than initially thought and its features were far weaker predictors of achievement than social background indicators and school peers. More recently, school finance equalization formulas have been implemented in the overwhelming majority of states, leading some observers to suggest that parity in the funding of public schools has been reached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0013124510392779">Jencks &amp; Phillips, 1998</xref>). Others cite the adoption of common educational standards, assessment procedures, teacher credentialing requirements, and accountability mechanisms in the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 as evidence of fewer structural differences between schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0013124510392779">Meyer &amp; Rowan, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The only study in this review that provides quantitative evidence to address questions about variation in school resources and school effects offers unexpected results.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0013124510392779">2</xref></sup> The Moving to Opportunity for Fair Housing (MTO) program relocated children from low-income neighborhoods and their schools to areas and schools of less poverty. Compared with children in the control group, children in the experimental group ended up in schools with fewer poor students, higher annual expenditures, and higher average performance. MTO children within low-poverty destination schools performed better than the control group. However, the value-added residual estimates for the movers were negative in reading and math, suggesting that their advantage over the control group was largely due to the higher proportion of economically advantaged children in their schools rather than their higher level of resources. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0013124510392779">Ladd and Ludwig (2003)</xref> conclude that the higher resourced destination schools were no more effective than the schools the students left behind. One can conclude from their observations that even when school resources vary, their effects may not, which provides further support for the limited variation model. This is not to suggest that the inverse could not also be true however. Schools with equal resources, such as capable teachers, in areas that differ economically could have different effects as children from low-income neighborhoods would have the most to gain from good teaching. Hence, similarities in school quality may not protect assumptions about the similarity of their effects.</p>

<title>Autonomous Institutional Framework: The Exogenous Institution</title>
<p>The autonomous institutional framework emphasizes the ways in which the structure, built environment, and social processes of educational institutions may be less dependent on the context in which they are situated and where students live. The <italic>Brown</italic> decision and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 set in motion a drive to procure for everyone institutions able to offer all children an equal chance at social advancement no matter how unequal their social origins. Differences in the school’s structure; variation in its facilities, funding, and racial composition raised the possibility that schools had effects too and that they increased rather than reduced inequality. Today, choice policies (e.g., voucher programs, magnet programs, and open enrollment systems) drive arguments in support of school autonomy given their potential to create school populations less similar to the neighborhoods where children live.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013124510392779">Bronfenbrenner (1979)</xref> highlighted other macro-level changes, primarily within the built environment, that he believed increased the isolation of schools. He believed that schools had become larger, further away from the homes of students, on the outskirts of towns, populated by youth from across the metropolis, staffed by strangers, and subsequently disconnected from the context. Although some sectors of educational thought decry this disconnect (e.g., community schools movement), others seek to insulate aspects of the school’s functioning—such as its instructional capacity—from external influences. By identifying the productive technology of instruction and strengthening the coordination of its components, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0013124510392779">Cohen, Ball, Camburn, and Rowan (1997)</xref> argue that schools can militate against competing external sources of educational guidance. The more tightly coordinated these instructional components (i.e., curricular materials; teachers’ practice and opportunities to learn; and students), the more impervious instruction may be to extrainstitutional influences, even poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013124510392779">Cohen &amp; Moffitt, 2009</xref>). Though others have argued that Cohen’s “instructional technology” does not preclude the use of culture and community assets as important instructional resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0013124510392779">Stinson, 2006</xref>), the goal of this approach remains the identification of a productive function within instruction that supports the institution’s quest for independent and ameliorating effects.</p>
<p>Yet another argument in support of an exogenous institution is that schools have a greater investment and more explicit mechanisms with which to sort individuals socially than do neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0013124510392779">Johnson, 2008</xref>). The social organization of schools then contributes to the ways in which a school’s effect may be in quality distinct from the contexts in which it is embedded. Kenneth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013124510392779">Clark (1965)</xref> suggested as much in his seminal book chapter, “Ghetto Schooling,” in which he argued community effects and cultural deficits were not the agents responsible for the declining IQs of Black children, rather the low educational standards, expectations for students, and teacher professionalism resulted in the covariation of segregated neighborhoods and underachievement. In his view, neighborhoods had little effect, if any, whereas children’s educational institutions were most detrimental to their development.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0013124510392779">
<title>Institutional Community Model</title>
<p>Organizational sociologists have been correct to point out that institutions are also embedded within an organizational community. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0013124510392779">Figure 1</xref> depicts this possibility at the exoecological level where we find two forms of community involvement—policy making bodies and organized representatives of the communities that serve institutions. For example, qualitative works have revealed the web of organizational relationships in which public housing is immersed, constituted by law enforcement; the local housing authority; social welfare agencies; law makers; HUD; and informal social groups (gangs, advocacy groups, and racial/ethnic organizations). The school community in comparison consists of teachers’ unions; boards of education; law makers; and informal organizations. Educational researchers and organizational sociologists have been questioning the importance of the institutional community since the 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0013124510392779">Meyer &amp; Rowan, 1977</xref>). Recent questions in contrast have been concerned with its importance relative to neighborhoods. Advocates of the neoinstitutional perspective argue, for example, that the decline of urban schools that occurred during the latter half of the 20th century was due to educational policy decisions made at the exoecological strata more than the concentration of disadvantage within inner-city neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0013124510392779">Neckerman, 2007</xref>), whereas others argue a direct relationship exists between policy making bodies and school functioning that diminishes the relevance of ecological considerations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013124510392779">Arum, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Less is said within the neoinstitutional perspective about the other organizations at the exoecological level, namely parent associations, booster clubs, police within schools, and community-based organizations whose influence surely serve to contextualize institutional processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0013124510392779">Johnson, 2008</xref>). Instead, it highlights the top-down influence of policy making bodies and touts their “ecologically liberating” effects without acknowledging they simultaneously function to create “neighborhood schools.” The adoption of school catchment areas; feeder patterns between schools; and the specification of school programs according to local demands are only a few ways in which the policies made at the exoecological level that supposedly have a direct and liberating influence on schools rely on neighborhoods as a unit for policy making and, in doing so, reinforce neighborhood–school ties rather than limit them. Unfortunately, neighborhood effects research offers little with which to inform the neoinstitutional perspective. None of the quantitative studies within this review explore the role of a school’s institutional community as they estimate neighborhood influences in education. Until such research is conducted, more cautious statements about the relative importance of the organizational community and the neighborhood context are warranted.</p>

<title>Bidirectional Flow Framework</title>
<p>The bidirectional flow model stands in contrast to the unidirectional flow implied in the “neighborhoods-to-institutions and learning” function of ecological correspondence theory because it posits schools influence neighborhoods as they are influenced by them. Research within this framework has found that schools and educational policies influence heavily the residential decision making of parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013124510392779">Bayoh, Irwin, &amp; Haab, 2006</xref>) and housing prices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013124510392779">Brunner &amp; Sonstelie, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0013124510392779">Kane et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0013124510392779">Nechyba, 2000</xref>). Often the effect of educational policies on neighborhoods leads local residents to alter their relationship to local educational institutions in response. Consider for example that allowing vouchers to be redeemed at private schools may lessen demand for residency in neighborhoods with competitive public schools and in turn reduce their property value growth. Residents located near good schools may therefore choose not to support educational choice policies to protect their property values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013124510392779">Brunner &amp; Sonstelie, 2003</xref>). In another example of bidirectional flow, choice policies may affect the social cohesion of neighborhoods by limiting the interaction and “educational talk” of parents that otherwise would occur at local school events or among parents that send their children to the same local school. Consequently, less social cohesion of this sort in neighborhoods may weaken children’s educational support as all examinations of neighborhood cohesiveness in this review find it positively related to learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013124510392779">Ainsworth, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013124510392779">Caughy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0013124510392779">Lopez-Turley, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0013124510392779">Pebley &amp; Sastry, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0013124510392779">Plybon, Edwards, Butler, Belgrave, &amp; Allison, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0013124510392779">Woolley &amp; Kaylor, 2006</xref>). In such neighborhoods, organizing and gaining local support of school efforts may take a greater effort or suffer as school choice policies erode the cohesiveness of neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Last, a bidirectional flow has also been demonstrated in an examination of the social processes that happen between schools and neighborhoods. To this point, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0013124510392779">Mateu-Gelabert and Lune (2003)</xref> find that the social relationships of children that develop in either the school or neighborhood context are transported to the other where they are reinforced or changed, then returned to the context of origin. The effective handling of student conflict in schools subsequently has the potential to lessen the prevalence of violence and juvenile delinquency that would otherwise occur in neighborhoods. As a result, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0013124510392779">Figure 1</xref> depicts a transactional relationship (as indicated by the bidirectional arrows) between the social organization of neighborhoods and the microecological context of schooling.</p>

<sec id="section11-0013124510392779">
<title>The “Faucet” Model</title>
<p>So far, all of the models in this review presume static neighborhood effects. The faucet model reflects the possibility that children’s social background characteristics, such as their neighborhood characteristics, are turned off like a faucet by an institution’s operation and resumed when it ceases functioning. The idea extends from a study of Black–White test-score differences in Baltimore that determined that the gap was due to differences in what children did or did not learn during the summer months (rather than what teachers taught and students learned during the school year) and was explained entirely by differences in socioeconomic status (SES; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013124510392779">Entwisle &amp; Alexander, 1992</xref>). Their study conclusions are germane to the conceptualization of both neighborhoods and schools. Addressing schools first, this framework can assist researchers in establishing a more reliable measure of an institution’s capacity to help children learn by eliminating what children gain or lose during the time schools are not in session from estimates of a school’s effect. For certain, it is more difficult to distinguish school effects from neighborhood ones in models that do not account for the time children are not in school and more likely engaged in their neighborhood context. Subsequently, accurate conclusions about a schools capacity given their neighborhood context rely on taking into account the influence of the school’s seasonal schedule.</p>
<p>This logic also applies to the estimation of neighborhood effects, as neighborhood effects may be most detectable when they are estimated over the summer when schools are not in session. The school’s mediating influence on a neighborhood’s effect will be absent in measures of summer learning. In addition, studies will only detect neighborhood effects if children are exposed to them, which is more likely to happen during the summer when children have a climate conducive to and more free time for neighborhood activities. One study using this framework estimates the influence of the neighborhood’s economic and racial composition over the seasons finding that economic segregation was the most salient social background determinant of math and reading performance gaps during the summer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013124510392779">Benson &amp; Borman, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013124510392779">Benson and Borman (2010)</xref> as well as other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013124510392779">Burkham, Ready, Lee, &amp; Logerfo, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013124510392779">Downey, von Hippel, &amp; Broh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0013124510392779">Rathbun, Reaney, &amp; West, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0013124510392779">Wimer, 2005</xref>) have presumed that seasonal effects vary due to the scheduling of schools and its subsequent moderation of children’s exposure to social background influences. They have not considered that the social organization of neighborhoods also vary according to the seasons. One only has to look to the greater use of neighborhood public spaces and occurrence of crime during the summer to conclude that the nature of a neighborhood’s social functioning, and consequently its effects too, cannot be constant across seasons. As a result, it is unknown whether schools stop the “flow” of neighborhood influences in educational production when in session (as suggested in the autonomous institution framework) or if the flow through an otherwise permeable educational system reduces to a trickle during cooler seasons due to a lull in the neighborhood’s social activity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0013124510392779">Figure 1</xref> acknowledges this possibility; at the meso level, social processes change over the seasons yielding relationships that differ in quality between neighborhoods, schools at the microecological level, and student learning outcomes. In sum, the faucet model presents both opportunity and challenges within ecological research; its application in the estimation of a neighborhood’s seasonal variation can tell us <italic>when</italic> neighborhoods are important to learning. The challenge stands in disentangling seasonal change in school scheduling and the neighborhood’s social organization when estimating seasonal differences in cognitive growth.</p>

<p>The first conclusion supported by the examination of this subsample of studies is that schools matter. Most studies find schools make significant contributions to educational outcomes even when neighborhood measures are present, a discovery that supports the autonomous institutional framework and the notion that schools mediate neighborhood influences, often in countermanding ways. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0013124510392779">Limbos and Casteel (2008)</xref> assess the association of a neighborhood’s blight with school crime and find that the school’s percentage of certified teachers lessens the association. The presence of certified teachers was four times greater than the association of neighborhood dilapidation to school crime. Teachers’ professional development and opportunities to learn then may be among the most important elements of institutional organization to address when seeking to thwart undesirable contextual effects.</p>
<p>Although school features may not be mere proxies of neighborhood conditions, the review of this subsample revealed that, on the whole, traditional neighborhood measures such as SES, labor market participation rates, and racial composition tend to have larger effects than school characteristics. Only 5 of the 23 studies summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0013124510392779">Table 1</xref> report larger school effects than neighborhood influences. In contrast, nearly half of the subsample finds larger neighborhood than school effects with the relative strength of the two contexts in the remaining studies being fairly equal or undetermined. Consider the study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0013124510392779">Entwisle, Alexander, and Olson (1994)</xref>, for example. The authors measure the development of a gender gap in mathematics that disadvantages girls, as children in Baltimore, reach the end of middle school. The authors report that 87% of the between-school variability in the gender gap in mathematics was explained by neighborhood income, leaving only 13% to be explained by school-level factors.</p>
<p>A closer examination of the subsample’s measures suggests that no one neighborhood feature appears to be consistent among the larger estimates, primarily due to the impressive array of neighborhood features considered across the studies. Although greater repetition in the estimation of a neighborhood measure’s effects would increase our confidence and knowledge about them, one can cautiously conclude that the generally greater influence of neighborhood over school factors is robust to the type of neighborhood characteristic under consideration.</p>
<p>The summary of effects in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0013124510392779">Table 1</xref> is intriguing given the theoretical statements I reviewed earlier. Bronfenbrenner’s nested ecosystems theory suggested larger ecological strata, or distal fields, were less related to the development of children than the smaller microecological contexts. It was thought that as children were more heavily influenced by those environments in which they interacted directly, schools would have a greater association with the learning of children than their neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0013124510392779">Garabino &amp; Plantz, 1980</xref>). The review of these studies however does not bear this point out. This finding also presents a quandary for the neoinstitutional perspective which stood in counterpoint to Bronfenbrenner’s. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013124510392779">Arum (2000)</xref> asserted a greater role for the organizational community—and educational policy in particular—than the neighborhood context in educational production, despite it being a field further removed than neighborhoods in which children do not directly engage. This premise however is substantially weakened when the institutional arena in which policy decisions are implemented appears to yield less prominent effects than do neighborhoods.</p>
<p>These conclusions are tentative though as there are numerous methodological issues that could lead to an under- or overestimation of the neighborhood’s or school’s relative influence. The first of these threats, <italic>transaction underestimation</italic>, extends from the cross-currents of effects among social domains and the resulting underestimation of those domains’ effects when both are represented in statistical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0013124510392779">Duncan, Connell, &amp; Klebanov, 1997</xref>). Consider for example that schools function as truly exogenous events in the lives of children, uncorrelated with the quality of the immediate context and the social background characteristics of children. In this case, we would expect two domains to have somewhat independent effects. Inasmuch as the quality of school-level measures are determined by local considerations, the independence of the school effects becomes less likely, making it more likely that school factors once included in the analysis will deliver part of the neighborhood’s total influence and thereby depress the neighborhood effect estimate.</p>
<p>Indirect pathways such as these also work to the opposite effect and possibly understate the school’s impact. Recall the bidirectional flow model noted the strong influence that a school’s reputation has on the residential decision making of parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013124510392779">Bayoh et al., 2006</xref>) and property values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0013124510392779">Kane et al., 2005</xref>). To the degree that school quality has an influence on how a neighborhood’s quality is perceived, neighborhood measures will appear more strongly related to school outcomes than they should and school characteristics less so. Transaction underestimation is inherent within bidirectional flow models and works to compromise the estimation of both domains.</p>
<p>A second methodological concern is that of <italic>nested selection</italic> in which family choices about school selection represent another layer of decision making that influences or is influenced by a family’s residential choice. Selection effects at the neighborhood level can be explained in a scenario where low rents and affordable housing attract lower income families as residents. As children within lower income families are more likely to perform less well in school, lower income neighborhoods may attract children who are less prepared for success in school rather than cause them to perform less well. Differences in neighborhood averages of academic performance then could be explained by selection into neighborhoods rather than the variability in the quality of neighborhoods themselves. This concern is lessened somewhat at the school level as the majority of children in the United States are still assigned to schools near their residences, but its importance may be growing. Census projections (2007) estimate that 2% of U.S. students are homeschooled, another 12% attend private schools, leaving 86% within the public school system, of which a quarter of them attend schools of choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013124510392779">Briggs, Ferryman, Popkin, &amp; Rendon, 2008</xref>). Private school attendees and public school choosers together now account for one third of the total school-going population. Open school enrollment, magnet programs, and the charter school movement are increasing variability in the residential origins of a school’s student population and making our reliance on school assignment to reduce the threat of selection bias in research less convincing. If parents choose schools because of their educational programs, reputation, or selectivity, for example, the school’s structural and social process qualities relative to neighborhood ones may appear more strongly related to test scores than say if families selected schools because of nonacademic reasons (e.g., affordability, accessibility, etc.).</p>
<p>The results of a group of studies have pushed back on the selection effects argument. These studies use instrumental variable estimation (IVE) and counterfactual modeling to measure the influence of typically unobserved determinants of neighborhood selection. Studies using these approaches have found little difference between the IVE and original estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013124510392779">Foster &amp; McLanahan, 1996</xref>) that the original estimates were more conservative (rather than more inflated) than the IVE estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0013124510392779">Duncan et al., 1997</xref>); that selection effects would have to be unusually strong to suggest a biased neighborhood estimate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0013124510392779">Harding, 2003</xref>); and that large effects of living in low-income neighborhoods on children’s verbal ability persist even after making adjustments with predictors of selection into and out of neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0013124510392779">Sampson, Sharkey, &amp; Raudenbush, 2008</xref>). That said, the inability to detect selection effects does not mean that we should not be concerned about them; it merely suggest that selection, for whatever reason people come to occupy a neighborhood or school, does not seem to negate the behavioral consequences related to their choice of environment.</p>
<p>Possibly a greater complication to the juxtaposition of school and neighborhood effects is the existence of important <italic>unobserved institutional qualities</italic>. Researchers noted concern about unobservables at the institutional level in educational research decades ago when <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013124510392779">Barr and Dreeben (1983)</xref> asked what is the productive machinery of schooling? It is likely that these institutional forces are found in the social processes that emanate from the environmental structures of schooling just as the field of neighborhood studies believes neighborhood effects extend from socioecological processes. Therefore, merely controlling for a few institutional factors in neighborhood studies fails to capture the externalities emerging at the institutional level. School process measures in the school effects literature, for example, have demonstrated that constructs such as teacher learning opportunities, teacher certainty, and teacher commitment are between 3 to 7 times larger in magnitude than the traditional measures of teaching experience, school SES, and the prestige of the teacher’s undergraduate institution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0013124510392779">Rosenholtz, 1991</xref>). Another study finds that low-performing schools were more likely to experience increased academic productivity with improvements in relational trust, that is, mutual respect, competence, a personal regard for others, and integrity among school actors even after controlling for teacher background and school composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013124510392779">Bryk &amp; Schneider, 2002</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013124510392779">Bryk et al. (1993)</xref> reveal that the large advantage Catholic schools have over public ones in a teachers’ enjoyment of work, staff morale, and students’ interest in academics, is due almost entirely to their communal social organization as well as over a third of the Catholic school effect on teacher efficacy, student class cutting, and dropping out. These studies imply that social process measures are just as instrumental in accounting for school influences as they are to the consideration of neighborhoods. In neighborhood effects studies however, the school’s safety is the only social organization feature that is the subject of multiple investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013124510392779">Bowen &amp; Bowen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013124510392779">Bowen, Rose, Powers, &amp; Glennie, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013124510392779">Catsambis &amp; Beveridge, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0013124510392779">Pong &amp; Hoa, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0013124510392779">Woolley &amp; Kaylor, 2006</xref>). As long as neighborhood studies continues to represent school effects with the typical school SES, race, and resource measures that tend to lose out when estimated along with a neighborhood’s structural composition, school effects will continue to appear marginal in neighborhood effects research.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The major question guiding this review asked how research conceptualized and measured the relationships between the neighborhood and institutional contexts that contribute to children’s learning. I addressed this question by first reviewing previous statements about neighborhoods, schools, their complementariness as well as their dissonances. Decades ago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0013124510392779">Jencks and Mayer (1990)</xref> concluded that the studies available to them relied almost exclusively on a “black-box” model of neighborhood and schools effects (p. 115) because little was known about how both worked to help or hinder educational production. In an effort to capitalize on decades of research and the development of a new field, neighborhood effects research, I also addressed the research question by defining and arranging the major components of an ecological system that gathered the literature’s various conceptual approaches to the joint operation of the two domains. This heuristic brought together disparate areas of inquiry and concepts within the research—from perspectives that consider macroeconomic influences to the microecological processes within institutions, and from neoinstitutionalism to correspondence theory. This review also presented the emerging frameworks within the field, many of them supported within the literature by more presumption than empirical research while others benefitted from quantitative investigation. Here, we find that impressive growth within the field has crowded many of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0013124510392779">Jencks and Mayer’s (1990)</xref> earlier assertions and, in doing so, shaped them into one among several ways to conceptualize neighborhood and institutional relationships.</p>
<p>The last major objective of the review was to consider the relative effects of neighborhoods and schools through a juxtaposition of results from the research that estimates the association of both to education outcomes. Although informative, these studies—and consequently, the conclusions they inform—could not avoid being complicated by methodological uncertainties. Perhaps, primary among the shortcomings is that these studies have not forged strong linkages between neighborhood and school processes—a concern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0013124510392779">Sampson et al. (2002)</xref> expressed in their review. Their opinion could not be more strongly supported by this assessment of research. Institutional measures are infrequently used in these studies and school effects have not yet been conceptualized as social process effects. So in the realm of education, neighborhood effects research needs as much innovation in conceptualizing neighborhood–school processes as it does in measuring them. This task falls to the next generation of studies.</p>

<p>My search for relevant studies was conducted in two stages, beginning first with a keyword search of computerized databases. A search of the Social Science Citation Index, Wilson Index, ERIC, EconLit and PsycLIT using the keywords <italic>neighborhood, public housing, community, urban, concentration, spatial, composition, education, achievement, learning, test-scores, attainment</italic>, and <italic>dropping out</italic> in various combinations yielded thousands of studies. In Stage 2 of the study selection process, I employed a snowball sampling strategy that used the references of studies found earlier in the selection process to identify others. Many of the references that appeared relevant to this review were conference papers or working papers that also appeared as journal articles in Stage 1 of the literature search. As a result, the first selection criterion I applied to the review of studies was that only research published in journals or as publicly available agency reports (e.g., HUD, etc.). In the end, the snowball sampling approach added only a handful of studies to the sample. To identify studies that would best address the specific aims of the review, I applied four additional conditions to eliminate less relevant studies. Publications that were journal articles or agency reports were retained studies if they included (a) neighborhood features or residency as predictors or treatments; (b) individual outcomes as measures of achievement, psychosocial dispositions toward education, matriculation, or learning behaviors; (c) contemporary populations sampled circa 1960 or later; and (d) samples collected in the United States. The application of the criteria resulted in a sample of 83 studies.</p></fn>

<p>Parent opinions within the Gautreaux study suggested that urban schools were much lower in quality than the suburban schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0013124510392779">Rosenbaum, Kulieke, &amp; Rubinowitz, 1988</xref>). This study component was qualitative and no other estimates are available that measure such differences.</p></fn>
