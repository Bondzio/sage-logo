<p>Purpose</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to explore physical activity-related experiences, perceptions, and counseling expectations among urban, underactive, African American women with type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>Participants were recruited via flyers and endocrinologist referral. A professional, African American female moderator led 2 focus groups among 11 participants. Focus groups were conducted in a video- and audio-equipped focus group room in the evening hours. Using a content-based, stepped analytic approach, 2 raters independently analyzed data and collaborated to compare results and finalize themes.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>Competing priorities and lack of motivation were perceived as significant barriers to physical activity. Physical activity-related counseling expectations (ie, physician encouragement) and experiences (physician advising) were inconsistent. Participants expressed a high degree of physical activity-related health responsibility. Altruistic intentions were high relative to helping others incorporate healthful lifestyle changes.</p>
<p>Conclusions</p>
<p>When counseling women about physical activity, diabetes educators should acknowledge and provide support and resources to help women incorporate more physical activity into their regular routines and enhance motivation for physical activity. Educators should also couple physical activity-related advice with encouragement and support. Because of high levels of altruism, educators should consider implementing group- and/or peer-based physical activity interventions in this patient group.</p>

<body>
<p>Type 2 diabetes is among the leading causes of death for African American women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721712437558">1</xref></sup> Optimal diabetes self-care requires that an individual prioritize a variety of self-care behaviors each day. These behaviors include glucose self-monitoring, monitoring dietary intake, and incorporating a regular plan of physical activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721712437558">2</xref></sup> Although managing multiple self-care behaviors may be challenging for all persons with diabetes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721712437558">3</xref></sup> the extant literature suggests that among African American and white US adults, African American women are the least physically active subgroup.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721712437558">4</xref></sup> Given the known benefits of physical activity in glycemic control,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721712437558">5</xref></sup> this trend of inactivity among African American women places those with diabetes at high risk for diabetes-related complications. This underscores the need for widespread and ongoing efforts to increase physical activity in this patient group and, subsequently, increase the likelihood of improved diabetes outcomes.</p>
<p>The existing literature describes many interventions designed to increase physical activity among African American women, and many address factors that have an impact on physical activity behaviors, including neighborhood safety and personal motivation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721712437558">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721712437558">7</xref></sup> Moreover, in recent years, more attention has been given to the role of the physicians in physical activity promotion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721712437558">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721712437558">9</xref></sup> Physicians and diabetes care professionals are advised to counsel diabetes patients about the importance of physical activity in self-care management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712437558">10</xref></sup> However, many physicians report that they are not confident in their ability to provide physical activity counseling and that the brevity of most clinical encounters makes it difficult to provide physical activity counseling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721712437558">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721712437558">12</xref></sup> Previous research also suggests that discussions about physical activity between health care providers and African American women have been negatively associated with physical activity behaviors in these women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721712437558">13</xref></sup> Therefore, to the extent that physical activity counseling can be an important strategy to promote physical activity behaviors and improve diabetes outcomes among African American women, it is important to gain an understanding of factors that might contribute to negative associations between physical activity behaviors and health care provider counseling. The purpose of this study was to explore physical activity-related experiences, perceptions, and counseling expectations among urban, underactive, African American women with type 2 diabetes.</p>

<sec id="section2-0145721712437558">
<title>Research Design</title>
<p>The authors implemented focus groups in order to examine physical activity-related experiences, perceptions, and counseling expectations. Focus group methodology is a qualitative research approach in which a group of people is asked to share views about a particular topic. Under the direction of a moderator, the participants respond to a series of prepared, open-ended questions. The focus group participants typically share common characteristics (eg, sex) and/or have a mutual interest in the focus group topic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721712437558">14</xref></sup> One of the benefits of using focus group methodology is that it fosters the expression of thoughts and feelings that may not have been revealed using quantitative measures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721712437558">15</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0145721712437558">
<title>Participant Selection/Setting</title>
<p>A clinical research nurse recruited participants at an academically affiliated and community-based outpatient clinic. Participant eligibility criteria included: (1) African American; (2) female; (3) 21-50 years old; 4) clinical diagnosis of type 2 diabetes for at least 6 months; and (5) physically underactive, as defined by Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Sports Medicine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721712437558">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The clinical research nurse recruited participants using flyers placed in the elevators in the outpatient clinic area and referral by a collaborating outpatient clinic endocrinologist. For the latter method, the endocrinologist informed women about the study during clinic visits. If the patient expressed interest, the endocrinologist provided her with the clinical research nurse’s contact information. The clinical research nurse screened all women, either face-to-face or via telephone, using a study screening form prepared by the principal investigator (STM).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0145721712437558">
<title>Data Collection Procedures</title>
<p>Women who met the study eligibility criteria were invited to participate in 1 of 2 focus groups. For those who were available during either of the 2 focus group time allotments and accepted the invitation, reminder phone calls were made 2 days before the scheduled focus group. Each focus group took place during evening hours, and both were video- and audiorecorded. In addition, a complimentary evening meal was provided at each focus group. The facilitator was an African American female with over 10 years of professional moderator experience, including facilitation of focus groups among mixed-sex African American groups and African American females alone, and a member of the International Association of Facilitators.</p>
<p>Following greetings, written informed consent procedures, explanation of focus group ground rules, and meal service, the moderator asked participants a series of open-ended questions from a prepared guide (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0145721712437558">Table 1</xref>). The study research assistant or the principal investigator viewed each session through a 1-way mirror and served as observer and note taker. The clinical research nurse gave each patient a $20 general-use gift card at the conclusion of each focus group to offset participation-related expenses. Within 1 week of each focus group, the study research assistant transcribed each focus group verbatim. The Meharry Medical College Institutional Review Board approved the study protocol and informed consent procedures.</p>

<title>Focus Group Questions</title>
<p>The first 2 focus group questions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0145721712437558">Table 1</xref>) were designed to introduce and encourage participants to begin thinking about physical activity and assess general perceptions. The “most significant enabler/barrier” questions evaluated physical activity-related experiences and further evaluated perceptions. The “expectations” question explored dissonance between participants’ expectations of physician-delivered physical activity counseling and what they experienced. The inclusion of this question is supported by evidence of strong correlations between patients’ expectations and health-related outcomes and behaviors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721712437558">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721712437558">18</xref></sup></p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Using the focus group transcripts prepared by the study research assistant, 2 trained independent raters (STM, KM) conducted a content-based, stepped analytic approach. First, raters independently performed an initial review of each transcript (10-15 minutes/rater/transcript) to evaluate the discussion flow. During this phase, each rater made general notes about the content of the discussion, including the type of interjected comments made by other participants, as such comments often signify levels of affirmation, rebuttal, or clarification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721712437558">19</xref></sup> During this process, raters assigned descriptive codes to each participant response (1.0-1.5 hours/rater/transcript). For example, many women expressed physical activity-related health responsibility and the related responses were assigned the same descriptive code. Similar descriptive codes were grouped into separate themes. The raters independently identified 7 of the final themes (78%) presented here. Third, the raters compared, discussed, and reached consensus on all final themes (2.5 hours). The process for reaching consensus involved a detailed examination and discussion of participants’ quotes relative to descriptive codes and identified themes. Next, 1 of the raters (STM) compiled all identified themes in a list (30 minutes) for review by the other rater. Finally, the raters had an additional meeting to finalize the themes (10 minutes). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0145721712437558">Table 3</xref> lists the final focus group themes.</p>

<sec id="section9-0145721712437558">
<title>General physical activity/exercise perceptions</title>
<p>Participants viewed physical activity as synonymous with exercise, in general (Theme 1). For example, 64% of participants responded with 1 word, “exercise,” when asked what came to mind when hearing the phrase “physical activity.” However, they associated the word “exercise” with specific activities for example, walking or jogging (Theme 2). Participants expressed an awareness of the association between weight loss and physical activity (Theme 3). One participant acknowledged the association this way: “If you don’t move, you gain weight.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0145721712437558">
<title>Barriers to physical activity</title>
<p>Competing priorities were identified as barriers to physical activity (Theme 4). Many women stated that multiple demands on their time (ie, work, family) made it hard for them to incorporate regular physical activity. Lack of motivation was also a pervasive theme (Theme 5). Many participants described themselves as being “lazy.” One participant said, “I have the time to exercise. . .I work from 5 till 10 in the morning. So I’m just sitting around. I have no excuse not to exercise. I’m just being lazy and I need to get motivated.” Another participant expressed her general lack of motivation by stating, “I just can’t motivate myself to do it [exercise].” Although many women stated lack of motivation as a barrier, all expressed a desire to be more physically active.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0145721712437558">
<title>Enablers to physical activity</title>
<p>Enablers were generally discussed in terms of removal or management of previously stated barriers. For instance, participants felt that if they had more time (absence or management of competing priorities), they would be more physically active. Social support for physical activity (Theme 6), however, was identified as a specific enabler among participants. For example, one participant said, “If I had a positive person in my life that’s going to say ‘Come on, let’s get more exercise and let’s do it’. . . .”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0145721712437558">
<title>Comparison of physical activity counseling expectations and experiences</title>
<p>In general, there was a discrepancy between what participants expected or desired and what they actually experienced during physical activity counseling. Most patients reported getting regimen advice when what they expected or wanted was acknowledgment for behavioral efforts to reach clinical targets—even if targets had yet to be reached (Theme 7). One participant stated, “He [physician] read them [lab values], but it was like he wasn’t really concerned about them. He was concerned about putting me on a regimen that he had designed to put me on. So it was really not any encouraging of what I had done.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0145721712437558">
<title>Physical activity-related health responsibility</title>
<p>During the discussion of physical activity-related counseling expectations and experiences, many participants voiced the belief that, regardless of their physician’s counseling advice, they were ultimately responsible for finding ways to become more physically active. This “health responsibility” (Theme 8) was expressed by one patient in this way, “I know the benefits and that exercising is something I should do and probably if the doctor were to say that, then I would say okay. But as far as that being the motivator for me to it, not completely. That’s something I know I need to do; and then just actually doing it would be left totally up to me.” Another participant voiced her autonomy by saying, “That’s his [physician] job. That’s his responsibility to tell you what’s good for you as the patient. But the 1 motivating factor is more or less going to come from me realizing that I need to do this.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0145721712437558">
<title>Greater concern for health care-related needs of others</title>
<p>An “altruistic intentions” theme emerged (Theme 9). Many participants were highly empathetic toward others with diabetes or other health conditions. Participants were able to brainstorm ways to adjust their personal priorities to accommodate others, but not themselves. For instance, one participant stated, “If a family member or friend came up to me and they were sick and said, ‘Honey, if I don’t exercise, then I’m going to die. I would exercise with that person if it kills me. I’ll do it for somebody else quicker than I’ll do it for me.” This same participant reflected on her own exercise patterns by stating, “I know it’s going to take an act of Congress to get me on that track.” Another participant endorsed these sentiments of altruism by saying, “I need to exercise with them [other person with a health concern] and make sure they get better. I’m not even worried about what I feel like . . . Just as long as they are better.”</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The goal of this study was to explore physical activity-related experiences, perceptions, and counseling expectations among underactive, urban African American women with type 2 diabetes. Our work confirmed previous work and revealed some new caveats that, together, may be beneficial during physical activity-related interventions and/or counseling among this patient group.</p>
<p>The most pervasive barriers to physical activity were competing priorities and lack of motivation. These results were not novel and have previously been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721712437558">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721712437558">18</xref></sup> For example, in the authors’ previous work among rural African American women, competing priorities were viewed as a major barrier to physical activity and lack of motivation was associated with low levels of exercise readiness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721712437558">18</xref></sup> The fact that these barriers are common and persist is helpful from an intervention perspective. For instance, it is known that one’s level of motivation for any behavior change is tightly linked to the likelihood of action.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721712437558">14</xref></sup> Therefore, interventions that include methods for assessing and cultivating motivation, such as motivational interviewing,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721712437558">20</xref></sup> may be useful. After motivation has been addressed, strategies for managing competing priorities can be introduced. This temporal ordering of intervention strategies is supported by the theory that people who lack motivation will be less receptive to discussing strategies for behavior change.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721712437558">21</xref></sup> Though participants in this study expressed a lack of motivation for physical activity, they all expressed a desire to be more physically active, which further underscores the need for systematically addressing motivation.</p>
<p>A significant enabler, social support, emerged. This finding is consistent with previous research that highlights the importance but also the complexity of social support in diabetes self-care management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145721712437558">22</xref></sup> For example, social support encompasses many behaviors such as giving advice, task assistance, and listening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721712437558">23</xref></sup> Moreover, for women, there is often a high relational cost associated with seeking support from adults for whom they may provide support.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145721712437558">24</xref></sup> Therefore, in planning physical activity interventions involving African American women with type 2 diabetes, it will be useful to identify the types and potential sources of social support that women desire (ie, health care provider, family member).</p>
<p>Relative to physical activity counseling, participants reported a desire for praise or encouragement for their behavioral efforts in lieu of advice that they reported so often receiving. Discussions about physical activity with health care providers have been negatively associated with physical activity behaviors in African American women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721712437558">13</xref></sup> Though it was beyond the scope of this study to evaluate the effect of physical activity counseling on participants’ subsequent physical activity behaviors, this discrepancy in counseling expectations and actual experiences raises relevant questions. Many physicians, though encouraged to counsel patients about physical activity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712437558">10</xref></sup> acknowledge a need for training in this area.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0145721712437558">25</xref></sup> In this scenario, is it possible that giving advice becomes the default counseling strategy during physical activity consultations? For a patient who lacks motivation for sustained physical activity but has made some efforts, how might this default counseling strategy influence his/her future physical activity behaviors? These questions require additional research, but both underscore the importance of providing counseling that is relevant for patients and supports them in efforts to initiate or maintain physical activity behaviors.</p>
<p>Participants in this study were physically underactive, but many of their comments reflected a strong sense of health responsibility, the belief that individuals should accept and take control of their own health outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145721712437558">26</xref></sup> Perhaps a strong sense of health responsibility suggests that participants may not be struggling with the “why” of being more physically active, but rather the “how.” Consistent with the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721712437558">21</xref></sup> it may require different strategies to encourage individuals with low health responsibility versus high. Future research is needed to assess the degree to which physical activity-related health responsibility influences or mediates physical activity initiation and maintenance among African American women with type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>Altruistic intentions were high in this group of African American women with type 2 diabetes. Previous research suggests that high levels of altruism are associated with poorer glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0145721712437558">27</xref></sup> The authors of this previous work speculate that highly altruistic patients are more likely to put the needs of others above their own diabetes self-care management. For African American women with type 2 diabetes, altruism, in the form of multi-caregiver roles, was a previously reported barrier to diabetes self-care, in general,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0145721712437558">28</xref></sup> and to physical activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721712437558">18</xref></sup> African American women with type 2 diabetes also experienced positive emotions and health outcomes when participating in group-based diabetes and health interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0145721712437558">29</xref></sup> Collectively, these data suggest that group- and/or peer-based interventions may positively serve African American with type 2 diabetes in 2 ways. First, the opportunity to help others may appeal to their altruistic intentions. Second, if women are also the recipients of altruistic intentions, as would be the case in a peer-based support intervention per say, they might experience positive emotional and health outcomes. Therefore, group- and/or peer-based interventions are reasonable and relevant strategies for supporting physical activity behaviors in African American women, particularly those who are often caregivers to others.</p>

<title>Methodological Considerations</title>
<p>One of the major strengths of this study was its focus on African American women with type 2 diabetes, a patient group that continues to carry a disproportionate diabetes burden. Given the persistence of this burden in recent years, research aimed at improving patient outcomes remains vital. Using focus groups facilitated a richer evaluation of physical activity-related concepts than would be possible using quantitative methods. For example, exploring altruism was not an objective of this study. However, the related findings undergird the authors’ endorsement of group- and/or peer support-based interventions among African American women with type 2 diabetes. The authors’ choice of a professional moderator of the same race and sex as the participants also enhanced the quality of the study methodology.</p>
<p>Theoretically, researchers should implement focus groups on a single topic until no new themes emerge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0145721712437558">30</xref></sup> It was beyond the authors’ resource capacity to implement more than 2 focus groups. However, these 2 focus groups revealed important and potentially impactful findings in a high-risk patient group that is underrepresented in the research literature. Finally, though important, the present findings are not generalizeable to other patient groups.</p>

<title>Conclusions and Implications</title>
<p>Diabetes educators should include strategies for addressing competing priorities and lack of motivation when providing counseling to urban African American women with type 2 diabetes. In addition, physical activity counseling sessions may be more beneficial for patients when they go beyond giving advice by offering encouragement and focusing on the needs of the patient. Owing to high levels of altruistic intentions, diabetes educators and other diabetes care professionals should consider group- and/or peer-based interventions in this patient group.</p>
