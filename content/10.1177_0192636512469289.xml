<p>Involving teachers, administrators, students, parents, and community members in skillful ways promotes collective commitment to learning for all students. Launching such a shared vision and visionary journey into school improvement unites us as travelers on the journey toward school improvement that is challenging and deeply satisfying, and which leads to remarkable results for all learners.</p>

<p>If, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0192636512469289">Lambert (2003)</xref> suggests, school improvement based on shared commitment to learning for all students leads to remarkable results, which include closing achievement gaps, then systemic change involving all stakeholders is critical. With reauthorization of the IDEIA (Individuals with Disabilities Education and Improvement Act) in 2004 and the passage of the NCLB (No Child Left Behind Act) in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0192636512469289">2001</xref>, school leaders and the faculty, staff, and communities they serve have been encouraged to initiate and infuse tiered systems of support, such as <italic>response to intervention</italic> (RtI) in public schools. Although the term <italic>RtI</italic> does not appear in either the IDEIA or NCLB documents, its premises are based on empirical research, which is promoted in both legislative mandates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0192636512469289">Sugai, Horner, Fixsen, &amp; Blase, 2010</xref>). RtI integrates data-driven decision making into its problem-solving model to provide for ongoing student support services. The RtI tiered system provides a way to support all students as they progress toward meeting grade-level standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0192636512469289">Glover, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>RtI is defined as “the practice of providing high-quality instruction and interventions matched to student need, monitoring progress frequently to make decisions about changes in instruction or goals and applying child response data to important educational decisions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0192636512469289">National Association of State Directors of Special Education, 2005</xref>, p. 16). Many researchers and educators thus far have seen RtI as a special education issue meant only to serve students with disabilities or as a process that could ultimately lead to special education eligibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0192636512469289">Buffum &amp; Mattos, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0192636512469289">L. S. Fuchs &amp; Fuchs, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0192636512469289">McCook, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0192636512469289">U. S. Department of Education, 2001</xref>). These perceptions are propagated through the context and venues in which the RtI framework has been proffered and supported. Official documents disseminated through the National Association of State Directors of Special Education (NASDSE), IDEIA legislation, and websites sponsored by the U.S. Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0192636512469289">Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, 2002</xref>), the Council for Exceptional Children (CEC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0192636512469289"><italic>Council for Exceptional Children Policy Manual</italic>, 2008</xref>), Vanderbilt Peabody College’s IRIS Center, and the National Center on Response to Intervention (NCRTI; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rti4success.org">http://www.rti4success.org</ext-link>), to name a few, all have special education at the center of their reported research and resources.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these efforts and venues of RtI support, the RtI research expands the context beyond special education and notes that “state and local education agencies are being guided to foster effective leadership in RtI design and implement its precepts across general, remedial and special education programs” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0192636512469289">NASDSE, 2005</xref>, p. 3). RtI practices and processes provide a reasonable and purposeful approach to using assessment information to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and relevance of the implementation of evidence-based academic and behavioral practices for all students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0192636512469289">D. Fuchs, Fuchs, &amp; Stecker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0192636512469289">Sugai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0192636512469289">Vaughn &amp; Fletcher, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>As state offices of education in the United States have begun promoting the research and practices supporting RtI, school districts are being prompted to investigate and implement RtI principles. Although promotion of RtI has come through state special education departments, school administrators are recognizing that the RtI framework and its systematic implementation can move school-wide improvement efforts forward: not only in special education but more generally applied to literacy and, perhaps, to other subjects. Administrators at the school level are using their student support teams to lead and facilitate RtI infrastructure building and implementation. Research indicates that these teams can help teachers use instructional and management methods considered to be best practice in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0192636512469289">Craig, Hull, Haggart, &amp; Perez-Selles, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0192636512469289">Kovaleski, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0192636512469289">Powers, 2001</xref>). Student success teams (SSTs) can encourage the type of self-awareness and shared inquiry promoted by data-driven decision making and problem-solving methods to help ensure the academic success of all students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0192636512469289">Chalfant &amp; Pysh, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>The implications and importance of one secondary school’s RtI efforts, as facilitated within a collaborative school context, have served as the focus for this study, its qualitative data collection, and resulting discussion. Effective models of systematic intervention processes such as RtI in our secondary schools need to be researched and reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0192636512469289">Heller &amp; Greenleaf, 2007</xref>). Researchers and practitioners have spent a significant amount of time and attention on these topics at the elementary level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0192636512469289">Ehri, Nunes, Stahl, &amp; Willows, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0192636512469289">McCardle &amp; Chhabra, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0192636512469289">National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0192636512469289">Snow, Burns, &amp; Griffin, 1998</xref>). Reviews and analyses of these studies and practices have provided guidance for improving instruction and practice in elementary schools. This same type of research has developed slowly in secondary contexts, despite a critical need for instructional supports for reading and learning from more complex texts by secondary students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0192636512469289">Biancarosa &amp; Snow, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0192636512469289">Kamil, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0192636512469289">Reed &amp; Vaughn, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0192636512469289">Johnson and Smith (2008)</xref> note that “the middle school level represents a crucial point in a student’s academic career, laying the foundation for successful completion of high school” (p. 46).</p>
<p>This article reports critical processes and findings of a qualitative case study conducted at Crest Middle School (CMS; pseudonym) during its first year of RtI infrastructure building and implementation, recording its collaborative journey toward student improvement in literacy. Although secondary school administrators are recognizing the benefits of RtI practices in meeting the needs of all students, research on current RtI efforts on this level is thin, with more empirical work needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0192636512469289">Sansosti, Noltemeyer, &amp; Goss, 2010</xref>). Practitioners as well as scholars will benefit from better understanding the people and processes involved in RtI practices.</p>
<p>By reading this article, administrators will understand how the leaders at CMS and their school community have been able to work toward sustaining systematic school improvement through implementing RtI. Specifically, administrators will learn about the challenges and some creative solutions associated with assessment processes, student scheduling, teacher professional development, and parent involvement. This research was undertaken with the hope that this increased understanding will inspire secondary school principals to begin the RtI journey.</p>
<p>If the goal or vision for today’s schools is to improve student performance to (a) make a difference in students’ education experiences and (b) thus help states, districts, and schools meet the requirements of NCLB and the IDEIA, then individual school efforts need to be acknowledged and studied by researchers and practitioners who can examine and explain processes that successfully lead to closing the achievement gap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0192636512469289">O’Doherty &amp; Ovando, 2009</xref>, p. 6). This article is focused on exploring a school’s experience with the hope of contributing to the above two goals.</p>

<title>Response to Intervention Research</title>
<p>The RtI system facilitates instructional decisions based on data collected during universal screening, early intervention, tiered instruction, and progress monitoring services. Use of a problem-solving framework in making decisions based on student data is at the core of most RtI models and processes. States such as Florida, Kansas, Iowa, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Colorado have developed statewide problem-solving models that guide their state and district RtI systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0192636512469289">Kovaleski &amp; Black, 2010</xref>). The state where this study took place has not yet developed such a model. The model depicted in the Florida Department of Education Statewide RtI Implementation Plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0192636512469289">Florida Department of Education, 2008</xref>) is a state model that resembles the RtI philosophy and tenets developed and implemented at CMS.</p>
<p>The Florida model is based on a three-tier framework using a foundation of data-driven decision making and a problem-solving model for both student and educator learning. For Tier 1, schools use evidence-based practices drawn from empirically supported curricula in general classrooms with every student. Student progress within this tier is monitored with screening measures that assess education quality in terms of adequate learning expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0192636512469289">Christ &amp; Hintze, 2007</xref>). For Tier 2, a problem-solving team is formed to develop more intensive interventions to be supplemental to core instruction, implemented over a short period of time in small groups. Progress is monitored by gathering and analyzing assessment and anecdotal data weekly as recommended in the RtI research (NCRTI; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rti4success.org">http://www.rti4success.org</ext-link>). For Tier 3, longer-term interventions are individualized by the problem-solving team, possibly leading to or including special education. Progress monitoring continues at regular intervals within this tier, and educational decisions are made by problem-solving teams to determine the best course of action for each student based on the collected data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0192636512469289">Kovaleski &amp; Black, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0192636512469289">Vaughn, Wanzek, &amp; Fletcher, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Although some educational agencies in the United States use models consisting of more tiers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0192636512469289">Duffy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0192636512469289">Foorman &amp; Al Otaiba, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0192636512469289">Vaughn &amp; Fuchs, 2003</xref>), the three-tier model is the most prevalent. Systems based on variations of the described three-tier method have been implemented in many elementary settings across the United States. Many aspects of RtI, including early intervention, tiered instruction, universal screening, progress monitoring, and curriculum-based measurement, have become everyday elementary school practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0192636512469289">Vaughn &amp; Fuchs, 2003</xref>). Current research is examining these elementary school methods to discover how they can be generalized for use in secondary schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0192636512469289">King, Lemons, &amp; Hill, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>To date in the state where CMS is located, each district and individual school decides for itself how to best implement RtI. CMS chose RtI as a systematic method of reform to help all their sixth- through eighth-grade students experience a measure of success they might not have previously achieved. The RtI model, with its systematic approach to intervening and monitoring the progress of students, provided the school with a comprehensive framework to help all students improve their literacy skills—not just those who struggled, but also those who needed enrichment or varied opportunities.</p>
<p>The concept of responding to the individual needs of all students with timely intervention developed during the 1970s, and doing so systematically, came to the attention of general educators with the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0192636512469289">2001</xref> passing of the NCLB Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0192636512469289">D. Fuchs et al., 2010</xref>). The insufficiency of example and supportive literature concerning secondary RtI implementation has led to “widespread confusion as to what RtI is and whether schools should be required to use it” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0192636512469289">L. S. Fuchs &amp; Fuchs, 2007</xref>, p. 14). Questions range from how it should be used to what far-reaching effects and ramifications it might have for state and local education agencies. These questions explore whether or not RtI is feasible for older students and all subject matter, as well as what the implications might be for learning disabilities, special education, general education, English language learners, and advanced learners at the secondary level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0192636512469289">Pereles, Omdal, &amp; Baldwin, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0192636512469289">Tilly (2006)</xref> suggests that “[RtI] is more about evolution than it is about revolution” (p. 1). The CMS administrators learned that RtI implementation is more of a process than a program or model. They realized that RtI was not a fad that would be outdated once the next new practice came along. This understanding gave credibility to their collaborative efforts and moved them forward when obstacles or barriers had to be faced and overcome.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0192636512469289">Tilly (2006)</xref> identifies three general components to this RtI process, all based on ideas that have been proven educationally sound. First, it is a logical structure for allocating precious instructional resources (capital and human) efficiently and for targeting them specifically to student needs–all student needs. Second, it is a commitment to use the findings from the current and emerging knowledge base of instructional best practices; and finally, it is a commitment to use a logical decision-making framework to guide instruction (data-driven decision making and problem-solving methods). This article will describe CMS’s RtI journey in terms of these components, through the lens of a collaborative journey; discuss the research findings; and offer recommendations for those who wish to implement similar processes at their own schools.</p>

<title>Research Questions</title>
<p>To better understand RtI infrastructure building and implementation in a secondary school, this study asked the following questions:</p>
<list id="list1-0192636512469289" list-type="order"><list-item><p>Can RtI processes, which are currently found more commonly in elementary schools, transfer to a secondary school context?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Who are the key facilitators of RtI at CMS, and what are their roles in building consensus and capacity?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What RtI processes have been identified at CMS, and how are they implemented for building the school’s RtI infrastructure?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How did instructional practices evolve at CMS to better serve students within the RtI problem-solving framework?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What are the implications for future RtI research and practice both at CMS and in other secondary schools?</p></list-item></list>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0192636512469289" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The basic premise behind a valid RtI process is that it should work systematically to improve student achievement. Woven within this system is the support provided to staff and faculty through promoting adequate consensus and providing sufficient resources so that RtI infrastructure building and implementation can be effective and sustainable. At the secondary level, RtI is currently considered innovative, and the “case study [method] has proven particularly useful for studying educational innovations, for evaluating programs, and for informing policy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0192636512469289">Merriam, 1998</xref>, p. 41). Therefore, a study of how one secondary school was able to put the theory and concepts behind RtI into practice is of value to the current RtI conversation. This study explored the change efforts via RtI systems in a middle school, and its descriptive nature can inform practice as other school leaders and their teams consider a comparable system.</p>
<p>A constant comparative method of analysis was used for this study, and consequently the findings are grounded in the collected data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0192636512469289">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>). The school was selected by purposive sampling with the criteria that the school had received no professional development in regards to RtI (either formal or informal), that the school was at the secondary level, and that administrators and faculty were willing to explore and initiate RtI implementation. The researcher on this study desired a school in the Western United States that was willing to have teachers, administrators, specialists, and parents participate in the research: CMS met the criteria. Finally, key participants were limited to the assistant principal’s choices.</p>
<sec id="section4-0192636512469289">
<title>Research Context</title>
<p>The climate for RtI implementation had been established prior to the school’s 2007 decision to implement RtI. A culture of collaboration and shared responsibility for student achievement was promoted and supported through district and school-wide implementation of professional learning communities and collaborative teaming structures. A brief demographic and historical background of the district and CMS will be helpful in understanding this climate.</p>
<p>The district is located in a semirural community in a Southwest region of the United States. At the time there were 15 elementary schools, 2 middle schools, 2 high schools, and 1 alternative high school located within the district boundaries. A total of 9,200 students were served at these schools, with the average elementary student population being approximately 450 students. Approximately, 950 students were attending each of the 2 middle schools (of which CMS was one), with 1,200 students in each of the 2 high schools.</p>
<p>The students at CMS and throughout the district were predominately Caucasian, from a middle-class background. At CMS, 15% of the students were classified as minority, the majority of whom were Hispanic; 42% were considered economically disadvantaged, based on their qualification for free or reduced price lunch; and 15% had been designated as having disabilities.</p>
<p>In 2004, the district board of education that served what was then Crest Intermediate School (CIS; pseudonym) decided to realign school boundaries and change the grade-level configuration of the district’s only intermediate school. Previously, CIS had served fifth- and sixth-grade students, and only one middle school had fed into two community high schools. To accommodate an increasing student population precipitated by growth in this community, the school board decided to abandon the intermediate school concept and establish a second middle school, allowing a smoother transition from middle school to high school for district students, as the area had two high schools. In addition, two new elementary schools were being built to accommodate the growth; thus, the fifth-grade students could be moved back into the elementary schools, which the board felt would be better for students developmentally. The sixth-grade students and staff would then join the seventh- and eighth-grade populations to be served at the new CMS.</p>
<p>When CMS began its first year of service during the 2005-2006 school year, the school’s principal and assistant principal wanted to create a school climate of shared ownership. They realized they had a unique opportunity with this new school and grade-level reconfiguration to develop shared ownership in school processes and build, from the ground up, a community of learners. Administrators and members of the school leadership team recognized the importance of including parents and their school community council in this effort as well. Therefore, when systemic changes were introduced during RtI implementation, these critical stakeholders were automatically included in the consensus-building process. When interviewed at the end of the study, the assistant principal, June, who had initiated the school’s RtI implementation with support from the principal, noted,
<disp-quote>
<p>We were bringing together a diverse staff of elementary/intermediate [sixth grade] and middle school [seventh and eighth grade] teachers. Each would come to this new environment with personal expectations and beliefs about best practices, depending on their own perspectives and experiences. These beliefs and perspectives needed to evolve into a common purpose for serving our current student population.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As CMS administrators met with teachers and staff, the seeds of a student-centered school community were sown as they collaborated and built consensus. They did not realize they were also establishing a foundation and shared vision for RtI.</p>
<p>As the premises behind RtI were promoted at the district level during quarterly professional development meetings in 2006 and 2007, the CMS administrators were curious about how the model fit their current practices. Accordingly, they participated at every district-sponsored RtI training session and at state and national RtI conferences. CMS administrators brought their SST, which also served as their school leadership team, to these sessions and conferences. At a state training session held in the summer of 2007, this school team began to develop a vision of the direction they needed to go and the way they should look at RtI. In August of that year, the school’s administration and SST met and began to critically consider whether or not RtI processes would work at CMS. The general consensus, as recorded in the study’s field and meeting observation notes, was that RtI could be implemented, and doing this was the next necessary step in moving school improvement efforts forward. During the summer of 2007, the school’s administrators and SST constructed a plan of action to accomplish this task. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0192636512469289">Table 1</xref> shows the timeline that was devised and then followed during the school’s first year of RtI infrastructure building and implementation.</p>

<title>Data Collection and Sampling</title>
<p>Data for this qualitative case study were collected from the following three sources: field notes, focus groups, and individual interviews. Field notes were taken based on observations during faculty meetings, after-school professional development opportunities, and RtI debriefing sessions (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0192636512469289">Table 1</xref> for frequency and timing). Two hour-long focus groups were conducted, one at the beginning of the study and another at the end. Participants in the focus groups were the assistant principal and all members of the SST, which included the sixth-grade reading teacher, seventh-grade math teacher, eighth-grade social studies teacher and band instructor, special education department chair, ESL coordinator, school counselor, district-assigned school psychologist, and a parent from the school’s community council. Sessions were held at the school and guided by a semistructured focus group protocol to address the research questions. Finally, follow-up interviews lasting approximately 40 to 50 minutes were conducted by the researcher and research assistant at the end of the 12-month study (July 2007 to June 2008) with all individuals who participated in the focus groups. Both the focus group sessions and individual interviews were digitally recorded and then transcribed to support textual data analysis. Additionally, the researcher and research assistant assumed observer roles during the study, and each kept field notes along with archival evidence for observed RtI planning and implementation meetings held at the school.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Analysis sought to describe and explain the data based on grounded theory methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0192636512469289">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1990</xref>), employing a constant comparative method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0192636512469289">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0192636512469289">Glaser and Strauss (1967)</xref> note,
<disp-quote>
<p>Because the basic strategy of the constant comparative method is compatible with the inductive, conceptual-building orientation of all qualitative research, many researchers who are not seeking to build substantive theory have adopted the constant comparative method of data analysis. (p. 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Whereas the intent of this study was to describe one school’s efforts toward implementing an innovative program, not to build a substantive theory, the constant comparative method was a logical choice for analysis. Therefore, data collected in the field notes and initial focus group were analyzed to identify emerging categories, themes, and patterns, which were compared with data collected continuously during the course of the year-long study and revised according to new data collected.</p>
<p>After all the data had been collected, a final data analysis was made across field notes, focus groups, and interviews employing the six phases of data analysis proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0192636512469289">Marshall and Rossman (1999)</xref>: organizing data; generating categories, themes, and patterns; coding data (open, axial, selective); modeling and testing emergent understandings; searching for alternative explanations; and modeling conclusions and theories.</p>
<p>Throughout this final analytical process, the researcher used text and matrix queries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0192636512469289">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>) to identify emergent themes and patterns and thus was able to search for data-driven explanations to address the research questions regarding RtI infrastructure building and implementation. This process also supported the development of theoretical propositions to explain the feasibility in this case study of implementing RtI in a secondary school general education context.</p>
<p>In operationalizing the final analysis, etic codes were used to textualize data to participant perceptions of the following critical RtI components as defined by current theory and research: universal screening, progress monitoring, collaboration, data-driven decision making and instructional practices. Additionally, emic analysis was employed to describe and explain the accomplishments and challenges associated with the development and evolution of RtI processes in the SST and among school leadership as well as across the school over the time period of this research study.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>This study resulted in four major findings. First and foremost is that school leaders need to take time to build consensus so that understanding is shared concerning the <italic>why</italic> and <italic>how</italic> of implementation in order to prepare their school for systemic improvement. Second, leaders must identify available resources, both human and capital, to build and sustain the RtI infrastructure, and they must schedule the necessary time to collaborate and implement RtI processes to support this infrastructure. Third, the school community, including parents, must participate in data-driven decision making. Decisions concerning student intervention curriculum as well as the time and place for interventions to take place must be based on collected assessment and anecdotal data, as well as recognition of students’ talents and needs. Finally, teachers must be prepared through ongoing professional development to use best practices and differentiate instruction so that the majority of students can progress within the general education classroom setting.</p>

<title>Building Consensus and Capacity Through Shared Leadership and Collaboration</title>
<sec id="section9-0192636512469289">
<title>Consensus</title>
<p>Why do so many school improvement initiatives fail? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0192636512469289">Sharratt and Fullan (2009)</xref> contend that many school system leaders fail to understand the critical nature of building a shared vision. School leaders underestimate the power that comes from strengthening the knowledge and dispositions of individuals responsible for facilitating practices within the system so that capacity is built and school improvement can be realized. In a staff development meeting held in September of 2007, the CMS assistant principal discussed RtI with her faculty and allowed them to explore its possibilities for systematic school and individual student improvement in literacy—more specifically, reading comprehension. Most teachers agreed with the RtI framework and thought they would like the evidence of a common assessment to know whether students were able to comprehend text. Interview participants noted that RtI made sense. Teachers knew they had students who, as one teacher stated, “were falling through the cracks,” or as the assistant principal indicated, “floating in a sea of ineligibility between general education and special education.” As one seventh-grade language arts teacher noted, “RtI will give me a way to do something before our team determines whether or not a student should be evaluated for a possible disability.” Although this statement reflects the perception of RtI as a special education qualification process, it demonstrates that teachers want to intervene in a systematic and timely manner and that they appreciate support in their efforts.</p>
<p>During this initial meeting as well as throughout the first year of RtI implementation, some teachers needed to have their questions answered and concerns addressed before they could move forward in support of the needed changes in their practice. Most of them were concerned with the logistics (the <italic>how</italic>) of RtI. As was later noted during an interview, “We always had our concerns validated by June [pseudonym for the assistant principal].” Others noted, “When we experienced things that didn’t work, [they] were addressed right away and tied to the RtI research by our administrators and the SST.” The collected field notes and interview and focus group data showed that the two questions that were most important in realizing consensus were (a) whether it was important to assess all students, as teachers already “knew” how their students were doing based on in-class performance, and (b) what kind of “help” would be given. Most of the other questions asked of the school’s leadership were in one way or another embedded within these two. When interviewed, the assistant principal commented, “I knew it was because these teachers had a desire to meet the needs of every student that they wanted the answers to the <italic>how</italic> questions.”</p>
<p>School administrators at CMS recognized that they would need the combined efforts of their staff to fully implement RtI—that RtI had to become part of the school’s vision and mission, not an administrative mandate. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0192636512469289">King et al. (2012)</xref> advise “administrators [to] reexamine their school’s mission statement to see if it is still relevant or effective—and link it to the goals of their RtI model” (p. 11). CMS did this. The following mission statement, written during the school’s initial year of operation, remains today: “Our quest for knowledge will be achieved by providing a quality education that empowers all individuals to become caring, competent, responsible citizens who value learning as a lifelong process.” RtI’s central theme of helping all students through collecting data, monitoring progress regularly, and applying a systematic problem-solving approach seemed to provide the structure for helping the school community make their mission statement central to the reality of their practices.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0192636512469289">
<title>Shared leadership</title>
<p>At CMS, the SST is an integral participant in the decision-making processes that occur in support of student learning. Therefore, it was critical for school administrators to enlist this team’s service as they moved forward with the school’s RtI efforts. Student assistance teams of this type have evolved from special education as well as general education sources and contexts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0192636512469289">Chalfant and Pysh (1989)</xref> developed the teacher assistance team concept, which stresses collaborative problem solving, general education teacher ownership, and immediate classroom assistance by placing the initiative for action in the hands of the classroom teacher. This philosophy supports the concept that SSTs can serve to facilitate RtI and should be developed and encouraged within the general education context.</p>
<p>This facilitation moves problem solving beyond the administrative level and shares leadership for student-centered decisions with the team. This reflects the current trend for leaders in effective organizations to concentrate more of their efforts on building capacity for leadership within and throughout their organizations as they collectively and collaboratively work to identify and solve problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0192636512469289">DuFour &amp; Marzano, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0192636512469289">Katzenbach &amp; Kahn, 2010</xref>). When asked about the challenges that came during RtI infrastructure building and implementation, the assistant principal commented on her need to share the RtI facilitation responsibilities with the SST.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I was going to have to, along with my team, find our way with only a suggested abstract process to follow and no concrete, tried and true steps to take. . . . I needed to have a clear vision and come up with a proposed process to implement. My SST was a big help in bringing more definition to my mind as far as direction goes. They helped to fill in the blanks for me . . . in order to bring it all together.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>If the CMS administration expected to build consensus and shared ownership in RtI practices, then shared leadership and collaboration would be critical as the school moved forward with RtI implementation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0192636512469289">
<title>Collaboration and professional learning communities</title>
<p>The district where CMS is located had been promoting professional learning communities since 2002. The professional learning community is a structure for collaborative teams to work interdependently, monitoring student progress and making decisions to facilitate increased learning for both students and teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192636512469289">DuFour, DuFour, &amp; Eaker, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0192636512469289">Hargreaves, &amp; Goodson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192636512469289">Hord, 1997</xref>). As school administrators and the SST made decisions about gathering essential data on student comprehension levels, analyzing the data, and then building the structure to support RtI, they recognized that they would need to build on existing collaboration practices.</p>
<p>Once the initial data related to student literacy were collected, the SST, in consultation with school administrators, developed a schedule for grade-level teams to look at student scores. After these teams discussed the data, representatives from each level met to make decisions about the school-wide RtI tiered structure that would best meet the needs of all 877 CMS students. The specifics of these collaborative processes will be discussed later in this article. Focus at this point is on how the collaborative teaming was brought to a systems level to promote and support consensus school wide: from the administrative/SST leadership level to the combined grade-level teams and finally to the specific grade-level teams.</p>

<title>Money</title>
<p>Resources and funding in today’s economic climate can be a sensitive topic among educators. A study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0192636512469289">Wiener and Soodak (2008)</xref> found that 78% (<italic>n</italic> = 235) of the state, district, and school site administrators surveyed considered funding a significant challenge in implementing RtI. As the administrators and SST at CMS looked closely at their budgets, they had difficulty finding the necessary resources for building an RtI infrastructure and implementing the needed interventions. It was critical for them to work in tandem with key district and community personnel (e.g., special programs director, Title I director, and community council) to find available supplemental funds to support RtI.</p>
<p>District leaders found that the IDEIA 2004 legislation “permits districts to use as much as 15% of their special education monies to fund early intervention activities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0192636512469289">D. Fuchs &amp; Fuchs, 2006</xref>, p. 93). They also discovered within the NCLB legislation language that permits Title program funds to be used in support of intervention processes. Therefore, CMS was able to access these funding sources to purchase assessment protocols and provide professional development opportunities, as well as help the CMS administration begin to align human resources to better meet student needs and support classroom teachers within the RtI structure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0192636512469289">
<title>People</title>
<p>This practice of sharing resources and materials between programs was a paradigm shift for CMS, as well as the school district, but this “shift” gave school administrators the freedom to use personnel funded through specific programs across programs and across the school. Special education allocations were used to fund paraeducators who could work with any student, not just students with identified disabilities. State land trust funds, governed by the school community council, were used to train teachers, paraeducators, and office staff in RtI practices. Title I and Title II funding could be used for personnel needed to support assessment and instruction in and out of the classroom setting. When interviewed, the CMS principal, Ken (pseudonym), acknowledged the importance of this added support.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In the past a lot of what we did to help kids in study hall classes or after-school programs was done by using funds from PTA fundraisers, cutting back on supplies or just plain having teachers volunteer to help kids whenever they could. Since we’ve had a [plan] for RtI, the district people have been open to helping us find extra funds to support our interventions . . . I think they can see that there is a new sense of purpose in what we are doing.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0192636512469289">
<title>Time</title>
<p>During initial consensus-building meetings held with all the CMS teachers and staff, concerns were expressed about the amount of time necessary to assess all 877 students as well as provide the needed interventions. As will be discussed later, the comprehension portion of the Qualitative Reading Inventory–III (QRI-III) assessment was researched and then used with all students. The data collected showed that approximately 25 minutes would be required to complete the assessment with each student. CMS classroom teachers served an average of 32 students each and thus would need approximately 16 hours to complete the assessment. Substitutes were hired to cover classrooms while teachers administered the comprehension portion of the QRI-III.</p>
<p>Overall, teachers expressed concern with time loss and interruptions to their classroom instruction. They verbalized these concerns throughout the assessment process, as well as during the focus groups, individual interviews, and end-of-year RtI debriefing meetings. The following participant responses to the interview question, “What do you see as the greatest challenge(s) you have faced with the RtI process?” help illustrate this concern:
<disp-quote>
<p>[There] was a huge time commitment for assessment and communication issues with volunteers and paraeducators.</p>
<p>[There] wasn’t enough time and help sometimes to implement all I wanted to do in Tier 2.</p>
<p>I had an issue with the “real” work of scheduling trainings and preparation of materials for implementation in such a short amount of time.</p>
<p>I didn’t anticipate the time intensity for assessing students and collecting and publishing data.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Based on these expressed concerns, administrators and the SST determined that they needed to find an assessment that could be administered to a whole class instead of individually, thus reducing the time out of class for teachers as well as extra preparation for substitutes. Unaddressed, these concerns could prove to be a continuing barrier to RtI implementation at CMS.</p>

<title>Systematic RtI Implementation</title>
<sec id="section18-0192636512469289">
<title>Assessment</title>
<p>Critical to implementing RtI is the practice of systematically screening and assessing student performance so that necessary and appropriate interventions can be implemented based on individual student need. In the district that includes CMS, systematic assessment at the elementary level had been in place for more than 10 years. However, systematic universal screening and benchmark assessments at the secondary level had not been supported. So once consensus was obtained for RtI implementation, the school’s administrators and SST first undertook to identify the most critical component of literacy to address. The school’s literacy specialist and sixth-grade reading teacher, a member of the SST, along with a special education teacher who also taught reading, were tasked with conducting research to identify the most appropriate tool to assess the most critical literacy need at the middle school level.</p>
<p>These specialists’ inquiry helped them choose reading comprehension as their first literacy target, a research-supported decision. Studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0192636512469289">Yovanoff, Duesbery, Alonzo, and Tindal (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0192636512469289">Rayner, Foorman, Perfetti, Pesetsky, and Seidenberg (2001)</xref> found that the oft-cited statement that children learn to read and then read to learn is accurate when applied to reading the English language by public school students. A necessary component of this process is to develop comprehension skills, and teaching and measuring these skills are equally important in Grades 5 through 8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0192636512469289">Faggella-Luby &amp; Wardwell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0192636512469289">Yovanoff et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>With this knowledge, the SST developed a plan to universally screen and benchmark all 877 CMS students in October of 2007, as well as monitor the progress of all students twice, once in January and again in May of 2008, using the QRI-III. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0192636512469289">Leslie and Caldwell (2001)</xref>, the assessment’s developers, the QRI-III is a comprehensive inventory based on the latest research, which assesses word identification, fluency, and comprehension. It also provides suggestions for interventions for reading instructors. The QRI-III, which had been used by the CMS special education teachers since 2005, was considered appropriate by the SST. Although the RtI research promotes assessing only students who are receiving Tier 2 and Tier 3 interventions at regular intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0192636512469289">Edmonds et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0192636512469289">Reed &amp; Vaughn, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0192636512469289">Vaughn &amp; Fuchs, 2003</xref>), the SST and many on the CMS faculty wanted to know whether or not all students were progressing in comprehension.</p>
<p>As noted previously, these assessments were time intensive and proved to be a challenge during this first year of RtI implementation. After discussions during grade-level team meetings and at a year-end RtI debriefing session the last week of school, a collective decision was made to find an assessment that could be delivered to an entire class instead of individually. The SST also committed to contact the elementary literacy coaches at each of the schools feeding into CMS to discuss the possibility of obtaining the literacy scores for their outgoing fifth graders to avoiding having to assess them again at the beginning of their sixth-grade year. Although the time spent assessing was a potential barrier to RtI progress at CMS, in the end-of-school interviews, teachers recognized that assessing and intervening in behalf of all students was one their greatest successes. A teacher of students with significant disabilities noted, “Two of my students were able to improve two grade levels in reading. Previously my kids were not given the interventions because of perceived inabilities to learn. Attitudes are changing.” Although the focus of this research was on RtI implementation processes, it is important to note that teachers were seeing progress in student comprehension achievement, and this progress led to excitement about the RtI implementation efforts. One teacher commented,
<disp-quote>
<p>Finding struggling students and being able to help, I think, was the best! Many progressed significantly in Tier 2 and then were able to tell their parents about their progress during our student education and occupation planning (SEOP) meetings. They are proud of their accomplishments, and it kind of made all the “testing” worth it.</p>

<title>Student placement and achievement data</title>
<p>RtI research suggests that in effective school-wide programs, 80% to 85% of the student population should have their educational needs met in Tier 1—the general education classroom. Tier 2 should be made up of 10% to 15% of all students, and Tier 3 should include no more than 3% to 5% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0192636512469289">Glover, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0192636512469289">Kovaleski, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0192636512469289">Tilly, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0192636512469289">Torgesen, 2007</xref>). Based on the number of students placed in Tier 2 and Tier 3 interventions, the CMS staff had some work to do to bring their student numbers in line with what the research notes as effective RtI programs. As noted previously, the focus of this study was on processes. However, the study’s participants were aware of student progress and motivated to continue with their RtI efforts based on this progress.

<p>These early data indicate that through their intervention efforts, the CMS staff had been able to meet the needs of a significant number of students so the students no longer required Tier 2 services: Student needs could be met during Tier 1 instruction—more in line with the acceptable percentages associated with successfully functioning RtI processes.</p>

<p>Once the staff had identified students for Tier 2 and Tier 3 interventions, they were ready to discuss possible staff development needs in an effort to increase the number of students who could have their instructional needs met within Tier 1. They also needed to decide on the curriculum to be used in Tiers 2 and 3 and to find time within the regular school day schedule to provide needed interventions. Finally, they needed a systematic process for informing parents about the RtI processes and possible class schedule changes that might need to be made to accommodate needed interventions.</p>

<title>The RtI professional development link: Tier 1</title>
<p>To meet the needs of more students within the general education classroom (Tier 1) after-school staff development focused on curriculum differentiation. District-wide programs had already introduced the CMS staff to the concepts of differentiation. The ideas were not new to them. Differentiated instruction is based on the premise that content, process, and pace should be adapted in relation to individual student needs. Research on differentiation is clear in its premise that the skills and content students learn should be a constant regardless of differences in the ways they learn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0192636512469289">Lawrence-Brown, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0192636512469289">Subban, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0192636512469289">Tomlinson, 1999</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0192636512469289">Tomlinson and Kalbfleisch (1998)</xref>, “Differentiated classrooms are responsive to students’ varying readiness levels, varying interests, and varying learning profiles” (p. 54).</p>
<p>Several of the teachers were already employing differentiation techniques, such as reciprocal teaching, graphic organizers, and project-based learning activities—all touted by the research as being effective in fostering reading comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0192636512469289">Alfassi, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0192636512469289">Subban, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0192636512469289">Tomlinson, 1999</xref>). These teachers were called on to share these techniques with the rest of the staff in three planned after-school training sessions. A number of the teachers who participated in the end-of-year focus group connected with this study commented on how beneficial these training sessions were. One teacher remarked, “Suggestions for doable strategies were given, so I felt comfortable trying them in my classroom the next day with the curriculum that I already had planned.”</p>

<sec id="section22-0192636512469289">
<title>Systematic interventions: Tiers 2 and 3</title>
<p>Possibilities for Tier 2 and Tier 3 curriculum were discussed. The resource teachers, who had been using intervention programs that they found successful for the special education students they served, were considered by the rest of the staff to be the experts in this discussion. For Tier 2, they suggested using a curriculum published by Sopris West titled <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0192636512469289"><italic>Reading Rewards</italic> (2008)</xref>, which uses various comprehension improvement strategies appropriate for small groups. This curriculum also has a fluency component that is tied to increasing comprehension skills. Special education teachers gave students working in this tier instruction in comprehension and fluency. Paraeducators who were trained to support this instruction helped collect student progress data in these two areas. An Excel spreadsheet was created with student comprehension benchmark data. Student assessment data generated from the <italic>Reading Rewards</italic> curriculum were entered every other week. Tier 2 facilitators examined the data and then made recommendations to grade-level collaborative teams about continued student support: whether a student should remain in Tier 2, be placed back in Tier 1, or given more intense interventions in Tier 3.</p>
<p>For Tier 3, the SST decided to use the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0192636512469289"><italic>Reading Horizons</italic> (2009)</xref> computer-based curriculum, which focuses on phonemic awareness and basic decoding and fluency strategies. Using these tools, students within this tier worked in small groups (two to three students) and individually with the curriculum facilitator to improve basic reading skills. Again, paraeducators supported this instruction and collected data from the <italic>Reading Horizon’s</italic> program on an Excel spreadsheet to monitor student progress, collaborating with the Tier 3 facilitator, to recommend any changes needed in student placement within the tiers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0192636512469289">
<title>Student placement determination</title>
<p>During the end-of-year focus group and interviews, administrators and members of the SST acknowledged that questions and considerations concerning the logistics of student placement had been a difficult challenge during the processes of building infrastructure and implementing RtI. As the data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0192636512469289">Table 2</xref> indicate, 225 students (24.8%) qualified for interventions based on the October 2007 QRI-III screening and benchmark results. The SST and grade-level teams needed to find time within the regular school day to provide these needed interventions. The following points of consideration were associated with this challenge: (a) Were there some subjects from which students could be pulled more easily than others to receive needed reading interventions? (b) How long would students need to be removed from identified classes? (c) Could this process be made fluid so that students who showed significant gains before the end of any given quarter could return to their original classes and be successful? (d) Who would rework student schedules?</p>
<p>To address the first of these issues, teams prioritized subjects for releasing students according to whether or not they were required to take an end-of-level assessment in that subject. Second, they evaluated whether or not the considered subject had a significant literacy component. According to these teams, the most logical classes to replace with interventions were elective courses, such as the arts and the family and consumer science and technology courses. Some teachers voiced concerns about the need to focus on the whole child and expose students to a rich and varied curriculum. These concerns were acknowledged and discussed at length within teams as well as one-on-one with the apprehensive teachers. In the end, most teachers indicated that they would be doing students a disservice to send them on to high school, where the curriculum and standards would be more difficult, without addressing their needs in reading comprehension. The assistant principal noted the following during a December 2007 RtI planning meeting:
<disp-quote>
<p>Teachers of these courses, without exception, decided students would ultimately do better in their classes if their reading skills were improved, and they supported the final decision to place students in Tier 3 interventions during the time they would have participated in these elective courses.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>School counselors, in collaboration with the Tier 2 and Tier 3 intervention teachers, facilitated these class transfers. Decisions were based on monitored student progress within the tiered interventions and on the content and activities of the missed classes at the time of the considered transfer.</p>

<sec id="section24-0192636512469289">
<title>Parent RtI notification and involvement</title>
<p>The CMS administration, SST, and faculty recognized early in their RtI implementation efforts that it would be important to explain RtI to parents, particularly to the parents whose students were identified as needing Tier 2 or Tier 3 interventions. The CMS staff acknowledged the need for consistency in the delivered message and the importance of including parent input in their processes. As mentioned previously, a parent from the school’s community council was included on the SST. Her input on how to deliver this message was critical. She worked with the sixth-grade reading teacher to develop a script that teachers could use when notifying parents about tier placement. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0192636512469289">Figure 1</xref> is the script that all CMS staff used as they called the parents of identified students.</p>

<p>Administrators and the SST believed that those contacting parents by phone must provide parents with some ideas of how they might support RtI at home. Accordingly, the same sixth-grade reading teacher put together handouts that included suggested activities for parents to use with their students at home to help improve fluency, comprehension, and decoding skills as well as encourage increased motivation. The school principal joined in this effort by putting RtI updates in the monthly school newsletter. Moreover, he sent an RtI informational brochure to every student’s home showing his support of RtI. In an interview, the study’s parent participant, who also volunteered with assessment and participated in the intervention classroom, commented,
<disp-quote>
<p>As a parent with two kids in Tier 2 interventions, it’s comforting to know that their individual needs are being met. They’re getting help based on what we know, and the fact that I’m being informed of progress all along the way is wonderful.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>When any organization decides to embark on systems change, the process will bring to light both strengths and weaknesses in that system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0192636512469289">Fullan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0192636512469289">Sharratt &amp; Fullan, 2009</xref>). RtI, as discussed throughout this study, can serve as a model for the process of systematic improvement. Subsequently, this model can be seen by school administrators as a tool to strengthen school-wide practices and to bring together a staff with a single motivating purpose. Central to the CMS mission statement is the belief that all faculty and staff are highly devoted to the individual success of students and are prepared to dedicate their time and energy to guiding them through this stage of their academic careers. RtI provides a structure for meeting these individual needs, and this is what drew the CMS staff to its concepts. While implementing response to intervention, the staff also quickly became aware of the realities of that implementation, which challenged other beliefs and practices: two in particular.</p>
<p>The first of these recognized beliefs is the necessity of providing a rich educational experience that takes into account the whole child, who has talents and strengths beyond academics. When this systems change was focused on academics, specifically literacy, some of the staff felt that not enough attention would be given to other aspects of a student’s education, particularly the arts and technology. Pulling identified students out of their elective classes to give them more intense instruction in reading comprehension could cause these students to become discouraged with school, and this discouragement could lead to apathy. The SST felt that as long as they kept the lines of communication open among teachers, parents, counselors, and administrators, they would be able to monitor student responses to the intervention instruction from both an academic and a social perspective. The long-term effects of this pullout process and revocation of elective class attendance should be the impetus for further research.</p>
<p>The second challenge concerned the amount of time required to complete the assessment for 877 students three times a year; the time problem was the most significant barrier to CMS’s RtI infrastructure building and implementation. Even with the assistance given by the special education teachers and paraeducators for 2 weeks three times a year, teachers were not meeting with all their students and delivering curriculum. It was clear from the discussions at team and school-wide meetings that this was a concern for many teachers involved. Students were engaged in curriculum-based projects during this time, but the expedited timeline to accomplish three rounds of testing did not allow for as much thought and preparation as teachers would have liked. Thus, as discussed earlier, a more efficient testing instrument and delivery method needed to be explored.</p>
<p>Arguably, the most significant of the implications noted in this study is that the processes and procedures involved in RtI implementation at the secondary level are currently innovative. Furthermore, this innovation fosters dynamic and evolutionary practices that can at times bring schools to the edge of chaos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0192636512469289">Brown &amp; Moffett, 1999</xref>). To circumvent this chaos, administrators and leadership teams must attend to the expressed discomforts and challenges that are inherent in school reform processes like RtI. Conversely, the successes that are experienced must be acknowledged and celebrated school wide to provide the motivation for participants to continue moving forward. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0192636512469289">Mellard and Johnson (2008)</xref> offer the following: “As research continues to inform the procedural aspects of RtI implementation, commensurate energy should be directed to understanding the contextual variables that play a significant role in shaping and influencing how RtI is ultimately implemented” (p. 143).</p>
<p>There is no specific template, outline, or roadmap for secondary schools to follow as they design and carry out a process to implement RtI—only the theories and research supporting its implementation. The majority of prior research has been conducted at the elementary level, and for the most part it has centered on reading and literacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0192636512469289">King et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0192636512469289">Edmonds et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0192636512469289">Vaughn &amp; Fletcher, 2010</xref>). Educational entities that choose to embrace RtI’s premises, theories, and supporting research as the chosen structure for systems change in all areas of study and at all grade levels will at times be charting a new course and should be encouraged to add their own experiences to the recorded journeys and discoveries of others, such as CMS.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0192636512469289">
<title>Future Research Recommendations</title>
<p>Further research should continue to investigate the feasibility along with the sustainability of RtI practices in secondary schools. More empirical evidence is needed to show how schools and districts are looking at the RtI model and putting its practices in place. There should also be more investigation concerning the link between professional learning communities and RtI and other multitiered systems of support at both the district and school levels. Can these structures function together to increase student learning as well as teacher development not only in reading, but also in other subjects? And are there inherent issues in removing students from elective courses in order to implement interventions? Finally, whereas there are differences in structures and processes when serving students in urban and rural districts and schools, it would be important to contrast how the RtI model is developed and sustained in these two types of districts.</p>
