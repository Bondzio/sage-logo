<abstract>
<p>Although it may be widely accepted that the capacity for religious experience constitutes a mental state which, as with all mental states and inner experiences, has a neurological foundation, it is not so readily agreed upon as to what the psychological significance of such a state might be. That is to say, what are the affective components that pertain to that ‘more’ of religious experience that can be identified across specific religious traditions and histories? For William James, the proper study of religions must begin with the actual, felt religious experiences of human beings in specific contexts. Yet it is this focus on religious experience that appears to leave some contemporary theorists of religion uneasy, as if the exploration of the affective dimension negates or ‘softens’ the by now clear neurological basis of religious experience and beliefs. Underlying this unease, of course, is that the psychological/phenomenological approach conceals a hidden theological interest. That this is often true is more by contingency than theoretical necessity. This unease goes back at least as far as Freud’s ambivalence toward the ‘oceanic feeling,’ or what cognitive archaeologist David Lewis-Williams refers to as ‘absolute unitary being,’ which is a widely valued feature of religious experience for believers. This ambivalence should not marginalize the importance of ‘psychological significance,’ however, as it did in Freud’s writing on religion and as it continues to do in that of contemporary theorists, particularly those who turn to neuroscience as an important explanatory resource in the study of religious experience. This paper will argue that conceptual balance addressing the emotional and biological elements of religious experience is methodologically more adequate and theoretically richer than more strictly cognitive approaches, and will focus most centrally on the work of Sigmund Freud and David Lewis-Williams.</p>
<p>Si l’idée que la capacité à l’expérience religieuse constitue un état mental qui, comme tous les états mentaux ou expériences intérieures, a une fondation neurologique est très largement partagée, la signification psychologique d’un tel état ne fait pas l’objet d’un tel consensus. En d’autres termes, quels sont les éléments affectifs ayant trait à ce « plus » de l’expérience religieuse qui peuvent être identifiés à travers les traditions et histoires spécifiques des religions ? Pour William James, l’étude des religions doit commencer par l’expérience réelle et ressentie par les êtres humains dans des contextes spécifiques. Cependant, cette attention portée à l’expérience religieuse semble laisser les théoriciens contemporains mal à l’aise, comme si l’exploration de cette dimension affective niait ou minimisait la base aujourd’hui clairement neurologique de l’expérience religieuse et des croyances. Accentuant ce malaise, bien sûr, l’approche psychologique/phénoménologique dissimule un présupposé théologique caché. Si ceci est souvent vrai, ça l’est par contingence plus que par nécessité théorique. Ce malaise nous renvoie au moins jusqu’à l’ambivalence freudienne envers le « sentiment océanique », ou à ce que l’archéologue constructiviste David Lewis-Williams appelle l’ ‘être absolu et un’ qui est un trait largement valorisé de l’expérience religieuse pour les croyants. Cette ambivalence ne doit pas marginaliser l’importance de la ‘signification psychologique’, comme ce fut le cas depuis les écrits de Freud sur la religion jusque chez les théoriciens contemporains, plus particulièrement ceux qui considèrent les neurosciences comme une ressource explicative dans l’étude de l’expérience religieuse. Cet article qui portera principalement sur les travaux de Sigmund Freud and David Lewis-Williams, montrera que l’équilibre conceptuel entre les éléments émotionnels et biologiques de l’expérience religieuse est plus adéquat et, d’un point de vue théorique, plus riche que des approches strictement cognitives.</p>

There is a growing acceptance among those scholars of religion who are influenced by the cognitive and neurosciences that religious experience is both property and product of human minds. Although it may be widely accepted that the phenomenology of religious experience is explainable in terms of neurobiologically-based mental states, it is not so readily understood nor agreed upon as to what the <italic>psychological significance</italic> of such a mental state might be. While religious experience is a product of mind and thus generated in the human brain, it would be highly misleading to understand it as <italic>strictly reducible</italic> to brain function. Religious experience is about much more than neurobiology. Despite the huge advances in neuroscience in recent years, much remains to be understood about the neurobiological basis of mind activity. Many leading neuroscientists agree that there remain a number of unresolved questions concerning mind/brain isomorphism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0008429811430056">Damasio, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0008429811430056">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0008429811430056">Kandel, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0008429811430056">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0008429811430056">Panksepp, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0008429811430056">Solms and Turnbull, 2002</xref>), concluding that neuroscience needs to go beyond its disciplinary boundaries in order to have a fuller understanding of the brain/mind relation. An interesting and promising dialogue has opened up in recent years between a significant group of neuroscientists and psychoanalysts<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0008429811430056">1</xref></sup> who argue that clarification of a wide range of theoretical issues pertaining to the biological and psychological nature of the human mind must include the social sciences, psychoanalysis, and the humanities.</p>
<p>Eric Kandel, for example, is not alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0008429811430056">Schore, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0008429811430056">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0008429811430056">Gedo, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0008429811430056">Gabbard, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0008429811430056">Deri, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0008429811430056">Fonagy, 2010</xref>) in suggesting that neuroscience and psychoanalysis can inform and enrich each other in theorizing mental functions. He advocates a ‘rapprochement’ between psychoanalysis and neuroscience that ‘would allow the insights of the psychoanalytic perspective to inform the search for a deeper understanding of the biological basis of behaviour’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0008429811430056">Kandel, 1998</xref>: 459–460). Psychoanalysis, he continues, still represents the most coherent and intellectually satisfying view of the mind, and can provide a sophisticated and realistic view of human motivation. Sigmund Freud, whose early neurological researches and theories pervade ‘the whole series of [his] theoretical writings to the very end’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0008429811430056">Gay, 1989</xref>: 87), would concur. In this paper I will argue that some important findings of contemporary neuroscience confirm a number of psychoanalytic findings anticipated by Freud.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0008429811430056">2</xref></sup> It must be remembered that Freud’s theory of human motivation as originating in the ‘drives’ (<italic>Triebe</italic>), that ‘frontier’ concept of mentalization, is <italic>both</italic> biological and psychological, as well as cognitive and affective. That Freud went on to emphasize the importance of psychology over biology has more to do with the fact that many of his insights had yet to be confirmed by the discovery of neurobiological phenomena, than with his concluding that a neurobiological theory of mind was without merit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0008429811430056">Schore, 1997</xref>: 810). The growing range of cognitive theories of religious experience, belief, and practice that have gained such attention in the field of religious studies today must take account not only of the neurobiological and somatic, <italic>but also</italic> the psychological and emotional dimensions of human experience. In this way, the current turn toward neuro- and cognitive science in the study of religion will be more deeply enriched and accurate when informed by psychoanalysis, and will yield greater insight into the psychological significance of religious experience.</p>
<p>Consideration of the psychological significance of religious experience must take account of its affective components, which are <italic>both</italic> biological and emotional, and pertain to that ‘excess’ or ‘more’ of religious experience identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0008429811430056">William James (1902/2004)</xref>. For Freud, that ‘more’ of religious experience might be described in terms of deeply felt inward experiences that generate a sense of harmony and reconciliation—an ‘oceanic’ feeling—which is not far off what some contemporary theorists of religion describe as the sense of ‘Absolute Unitary Being’ (AUB) that individuals experience during intense religious states of mind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0008429811430056">d’Aquili and Newberg, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0008429811430056">Lewis-Williams and Pearce, 2005</xref>). For James, the proper study of religions begins with concrete, individual human beings in their life contexts, where universally significant affective experiences are apprehended and expressed in a wide variety of historically specific cultural forms. A more contemporary way of formulating James’s focus may be expressed in Donald Wiebe’s view that ‘it is precisely such psychological, wholly interior experiences, and the social negotiation of their meaning and value,’ that accounts for the emergence of ‘what today we call religion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0008429811430056">Wiebe, 2010</xref>: 511).</p>
<p>Yet the focus on the psychological significance of religious experience so important to James appears to leave some contemporary theorists of religion uneasy, as if the exploration of the <italic>feeling</italic>/psychological dimension is somehow at odds with what for them is a function or expression of a scientifically explainable neuro-physiological phenomenon. Perhaps compounding this unease is an underlying anxiety that a psychological/phenomenological approach conceals a theological interest, which seeks to establish that the mind is ‘designed’ to apprehend an already existing supernatural reality. This could mean either that there are psychological processes that are inherently religious, or, that there is a ‘god gene’ or special area in the brain that can access metaphysical entities, thus turning neuroscience into ‘neurotheology.’ Some scholars who study religion from this perspective seem to think that explicitly debunking belief in supernatural beings—that ‘great anachronism’—(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0008429811430056">Lewis-Williams and Pearce, 2005</xref>: 290; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0008429811430056">Dawkins, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0008429811430056">2009</xref>) is necessary to their examination of the nature of religious experience, practices and beliefs. The resulting danger is that this approach may prematurely and needlessly marginalize or dismiss serious critical consideration of the <italic>psychological significance</italic> of religious mental states. The question of whether divine beings or a transcendent reality exist in some supernatural realm is irrelevant to the study of religious experience. What matters is that gods <italic>do</italic> exist in the minds of large numbers of people, and are experienced by them; if we are to understand religious experience, <italic>that</italic> fact must be taken very seriously indeed.</p>
<p>While an inquiry into the psychological significance of religious experience is entirely compatible with neurobiological approaches, I, too, along with Kandel and others, submit that we must also involve a variety of disciplines in our theorizing. The data of neuroscience to date, while valuable, cannot be considered as definitive with respect to religion, and is open to a variety of theoretical interpretations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0008429811430056">Panksepp, 2007</xref>) that can only benefit from dialogue with other disciplines. Neurobiologist Antonio Damasio writes that<disp-quote>
<p>a simple neurobiological explanation for the rise of ethics, religion, law, and justice is hardly viable. It is reasonable to venture that neurobiology will play an important role in future explanations. But in order to comprehend these cultural phenomena satisfactorily we need to factor in ideas from anthropology, sociology, psychoanalysis, and evolutionary psychology, as well as findings from studies in the fields of ethics, law, and religion … the course most likely to yield interesting explanations is a new breed of investigations aimed at testing hypotheses based on integrated knowledge from any and all of these disciplines <italic>and</italic> neurobiology. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0008429811430056">Damasio, 2003</xref>: 159–160)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>All mental states and psychic experiences must be considered in terms of emotions and feelings as well as neurocognition. Indeed, the higher, more complex cognitive functions are not independent of the ancient, primitive emotional base or core structure of emotions, and moreover would not even exist without them, as Damasio, Panksepp and others argue:<disp-quote>
<p>Although higher forms of human consciousness … surely emerge from the cortex and higher reaches of the limbic system, they are not independent of the lower reaches of the brain, which generate our basic emotions, and other instinctual tendencies. Although our higher cerebral functions have led to the great achievements of humankind, including the construction of civilizations via cultural evolution, they have also generated the illusory half-truth that humans are rational creatures above all else … our higher brain areas are not immune to the subcortical influences we share with other creatures. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0008429811430056">Panksepp, 1998</xref>: 300–301)</p>
</disp-quote>This is especially manifest in intense emotional experiences, where the ‘upward influences of subcortical emotional circuits on the higher reaches of the brain are stronger than the top-down controls’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0008429811430056">Panksepp, 1998</xref>: 301).</p>
<p>While such emotional experiences are deeply felt, they are not always accessible to conscious awareness and intentional regulation and modification. In states of intense arousal an individual may feel ‘taken over,’ ‘controlled,’ passive and helpless in the face of internal and external forces beyond his or her understanding or ability to direct. Freud conceptualized these ‘subcortical emotional circuits’ as the Unconscious, which is <italic>both</italic> biological and psychological. One important characteristic of the Unconscious is that it can <italic>never</italic> become fully accessible to conscious awareness and cognitive control, and yet continues to exert its power on the mind. Freud’s observation that ‘What has once come to life clings tenaciously to its existence. One feels inclined to doubt sometimes whether the dragons of primaeval days are really extinct’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0008429811430056">Freud, 1937</xref>: 229) is entirely compatible with current neuroscientific thought. Psychoanalysis strives to make sense of the (neurologically based) unconscious in the service of <italic>self-regulation</italic>, which is vital to the psychological and physical survival and flourishing of the individual, as will be argued below. Religious experience, belief and actions also represent another important method of regulating, making sense of and organizing those affective forces generated from that ‘rich neural soil’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0008429811430056">Panksepp, 1998</xref>: 302) that allowed ancient human beings to survive and transform those primary-process affective states that Freud devoted his career to exploring.</p>
<sec id="section1-0008429811430056">
<title>Psychoanalytic and Neurobiological Dimensions of the Emotion-based Self</title>
<p>In his 1915 paper on drives, Freud writes that, if<disp-quote>
<p>we apply ourselves to considering mental life from a <italic>biological</italic> point of view, an ‘instinct’ appears to us as a concept on the frontier between the mental and the somatic, as the psychical representative of the stimuli originating from within the organism and reaching the mind, as a measure of the demand made upon the mind for work in consequence of its connection with the body. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0008429811430056">Freud, 1915</xref>: 121–122)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>While the source of the drive is clearly biological—that is, ‘wholly determined by their origin in a somatic source’ (123)—it achieves psychological significance when it becomes represented in the mind. A crude, bodily-based emotion is worked on by higher cognitive mechanisms to become a feeling, and in this complex mental process one’s mind gains knowledge about oneself, the external world, and one’s place in it. A self emerges in the binding of ‘fragmented representations of the world into unified, lived <italic>experiences</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0008429811430056">Solms and Turnbull, 2002</xref>: 161). This evolutionarily-based mentalizing or psychologizing process allows the individual to orient him/herself internally and externally, a process through which one comes to ‘know’ oneself as a self-in-the-world and with others. Panksepp postulates a ‘primal nature of the self,’ a ‘simple ego-type life form within the brain’ that is ‘mother to all higher forms of consciousness, that, even in the event of damage to the higher brain functions, this primal “centre of being” or subcortical “core of being” appears to remain intact’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0008429811430056">Panksepp, 1998</xref>: 306–309). The more complex, cognitive capacities of brain/mind emerge from a solid neurobiological foundation that gives rise to the possibility for ‘introspective-linguistic’ access to our subjective feelings, providing conceptual bridges linking the ‘neural circuits’ for emotions with the cognitive and folk psychological views of mind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0008429811430056">Panksepp, 1998</xref>: 304). Freud’s drive theory of the mind resonates strongly with this view, and is the bedrock of a clinical practice whose aim is to help an individual explore, develop, and strengthen those bridges between the conscious mind and the non-(Un)conscious affective drives so that s/he attains a more sophisticated capacity for mentalization and self-regulation. Interpreting and elaborating the psychological significance of human experience is critical to the goals of mentalization<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0008429811430056">3</xref></sup> and regulation.</p>
<p>‘The basic emotions,’ write Solms and Turnbull, ‘exist because they have established survival value’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0008429811430056">Solms and Turnbull, 2002</xref>: 113). Emotions and feelings not only contribute to the general regulation of the individual, they must also be regulated themselves. ‘Feelings,’ according to Damasio, ‘are revelations of the state of life within the entire organism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0008429811430056">Damasio, 2003</xref>: 8). They are critical to the homeostatic state of the human being; affect regulation is not only central to human well-being, it is in many respects the driving force or aim of existence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0008429811430056">Damasio, 2003</xref>: 30). The upper levels of the ‘homeostatic apparatus’ are constituted by the emotions proper, such as joy, sorrow, fear, pride, shame, and sympathy. At the very apex of the regulating system are feelings, which is where the psychological significance of the whole system resides, and which are crucial to the successful preservation, organization and activity of the individual. The striving toward ‘a state of positively regulated life is a deep and defining part of our existence’ that is critical to the preservation of the self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0008429811430056">Damasio, 2003</xref>: 36), whether it takes the form of thwarting danger, taking advantage of a life-enhancing opportunity, or facilitating social relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0008429811430056">Damasio, 2003</xref>: 39). If the physical and psychological conditions necessary to body and affect regulation are absent or antithetical, if a human being is subject to sustained neglect, trauma and danger, especially during his/her early development, the mind will hallucinate more positive body and emotional states through a variety of mental actions and forms of consciousness. Religions and religious experiences constitute one form not only of hallucinating a more secure, supportive and coherent world, but of regulating the self, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0008429811430056">Freud (1927)</xref> understood when he described religious longing as the need to quell unbearable feelings of anxiety and danger. Religious experiences emerge from the deepest recesses of emotional experience, and are dependent upon them. According to Damasio:<disp-quote>
<p>In the absence of normal emotions, there might have been no drive toward the creation of religion. There would have been no prophets, nor would there have been followers animated by the emotional tendency to submit with awe and admiration to a dominant figure entrusted with a leadership role, or to an entity with the power to protect and compensate for losses and the ability to explain the unexplainable. The conception of god, applied to one or many, would have been hard to come by … in the absence of social emotions and subsequent feelings … the cultural instruments we know as ethical behaviours, religious beliefs … either would not have emerged, or would have been a very different sort of intelligent construction. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0008429811430056">Damasio, 2003</xref>: 158, 159)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>It is important to remember that the neurobiological systems that support religious experience, belief and action (like their correlates, i.e. ethics, law, etc.) are dedicated not to religion but to biological and affect regulation within particular life contexts, which involve memory, creativity, decision-making, and social relationships that occur in the service of the preservation and maintenance of the self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0008429811430056">Damasio, 2003</xref>: 166–170). Successful affect regulation, which is made up of biological, emotional and psychological processes, results in an overall feeling of well-being that is the basis of joy: an ‘organism’s state of optimal functioning, subsumed by the concept of joy, results from the successful endeavor to endure and prevail’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0008429811430056">Damasio, 2003</xref>: 171). Human beings are ‘designed’ to preserve life and seek well-being, which inevitably involves the preservation and well-being of other selves. ‘The endeavor to live in a shared, peaceful agreement with others is an extension of the endeavor to preserve oneself,’ Damasio writes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0008429811430056">Damasio, 2003</xref>: 172). While there is clearly a neurobiological foundation to all the higher mental functions and the cultural systems and practices that are derived from them, human beings are not ‘slaves to their neural pathways’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0008429811430056">Lewis-Williams and Pearce, 2005</xref>: 41).</p>
<p>The mind is so ‘complex and multilayered that it operates with some degree of freedom’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0008429811430056">Damasio, 2003</xref>: 164). The secondary, cognitive-type emotions, while linked to their more ‘primitive affective substrates,’ possess such complexity that neurochemical systems may never be found that correspond to the feelings associated with higher cortical functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0008429811430056">Panksepp, 1998</xref>: 301). However, they can be interrogated on the grounds of their psychological significance, that is, the ways in which human beings can successfully and consciously make sense of, organize, interpret and regulate their internal and external experiences so that they may survive and flourish. Damasio and Freud would agree that ‘when feelings become known to the self within the organism that possesses them, feelings improve and amplify the process of managing life,’ especially those feelings associated with happiness, joy, security, successful learning and overall well-being which human beings actively seek (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0008429811430056">Damasio, 2003</xref>: 178). Religious experience is an important means (not by any stretch the only means) whereby human beings seek out and achieve experiences that provide a vivid sense of harmony and peace within themselves and with the universe, an intimation of eternity, perfection, and the joy of being alive, all of which adds up to a state of mind that is crucial to the physical, emotional and psychological homeostatis of the human being and his/her capacity for more complex and sophisticated forms of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0008429811430056">Damasio, 2003</xref>: 284).</p>

<p>William James, Sigmund Freud, and cognitive archaeologist and rock art scholar David Lewis-Williams agree that religious experiences are highly complex, neurobiologically-based mental processes that generate particular, often intense, feeling states inspired by and organized around an intuition of a supernatural reality or being. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0008429811430056">Freud (1927)</xref> is the only one of the three writers to emphasize the specifically paternal nature of the object of religious longing, where an early form of attachment either persists into adulthood or is at some point reactivated, usually as a response to some form of anxiety and need for safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0008429811430056">Hewitt, 2008</xref>). Some psychologists of religion argue that in situations of acute emotional stress, the evolutionarily-based ‘attachment system’ is reactivated in the service of affect regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0008429811430056">Kirkpatrick, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0008429811430056">2005</xref>). What Freud, James, and Lewis-Williams further seem to agree on is that religious experience involves particular mental states that evoke a sense of unity and harmony with nature and the cosmos. Freud situates this ‘oceanic’ feeling of religious experience within a larger psychoanalytic conceptualization of a very early, originary state of undifferentiated being that exists prior to ego formation in infancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0008429811430056">Freud, 1914</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0008429811430056">1930</xref>). Although Freud does not elaborate upon the nature of this primary undifferentiatedness, he at one point describes the ego as ‘a shrunken residue of a much more inclusive—indeed, an all embracing—feeling which corresponded to a more intimate bond between the ego and the world about it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0008429811430056">Freud, 1930</xref>: 68). This originary form of undifferentiated perception is similar to what Lewis-Williams refers to as a ‘primordial spirituality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0008429811430056">Lewis-Williams, 2002</xref>: 289) that is not in itself <italic>religious</italic> experience, but rather a set of psychological processes that give rise to religion through the workings of the higher mind functions involved in producing culturally mediated interpretations and conscious meanings. This is in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0008429811430056">Freud’s idea (1911)</xref> that the most ancient, primitive (subcortical/‘primary process’) dimensions of the mind remain preserved alongside the higher forms of (cognitive/‘secondary process’) conscious ego development, a concept of mind that he elaborates metaphorically in a discussion of the archaeological layers of Rome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0008429811430056">Freud, 1930</xref>: 69–71).</p>
<p>If nothing that the mind has experienced, no matter how rudimentary the form, can ‘perish,’ that is, ‘everything is somehow preserved,’ then it might be possible for some of humanity’s oldest mental experiences to ‘once more be brought to light’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0008429811430056">Freud, 1930</xref>: 69). Such experiences might well be interpreted as an ‘oceanic’ sense of unity with the cosmic surround that in some way parallels or evokes our earliest perceptual mind states prior to ego differentiation. Freud cannot be more precise than this, in part because of his own unease and ambivalence in acknowledging such a feeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0008429811430056">Freud, 1930</xref>: 65) but also, and more importantly, because he had <italic>no access</italic> to the findings of contemporary neuroscience at the time when he was conducting his own neurological studies. What Freud struggles to elucidate in terms of a stratified model, or ‘realm of the mind,’ whose oldest layers remain ‘preserved alongside of the transformed version which has arisen from it,’ may be, in the light of contemporary knowledge, [re]conceptualized in terms of the various stages or dimensions of a ‘consciousness spectrum,’ such as described by David Lewis-Williams. Whereas Freud and James were more directly interested in the psychological significance of religious experience, despite their different evaluations of it, Lewis-Williams is more interested in elaborating the ways in which religious experience is demonstrably a product of neurobiology and culture.</p>

<title>The Neurobiology of ‘Ur-religion’</title>
<p>For Lewis-Williams, belief in supernatural beings is an innate property of the human mind, ‘something that from at least Upper Paleolithic times has produced what we recognize as “religion”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0008429811430056">Lewis-Williams, 2010</xref>: 8). While space does not provide the opportunity for a detailed examination of his nuanced and complex theory of the origins of religion, his basic argument is that ‘ur-religion’ emerges out of the altered states of consciousness and/or induced trance states known to ancient specialists (shamans). They understood their auditory and visual hallucinations and dreams to be evidence of their ability to contact and to some extent influence the spiritual powers residing in a supernatural, tiered cosmos that spans the depths of the nether world up to the heavenly regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0008429811430056">Lewis-Williams, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0008429811430056">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0008429811430056">Lewis-Williams and Pearce, 2005</xref>). For Lewis-Williams, religions result from the efforts of <italic>Homo sapiens sapiens</italic> (anatomically modern humans) to organize (and regulate) the neurologically-generated contents of their minds, the meaning and significance of which had to be culturally and socially negotiated within any given community. The shaman became the intermediary between the community and the spirit world; his expertise in moving in and out of altered, (oceanic?) dissociative states of consciousness, his ‘mastery of ecstasy,’ his ability to control animals, heal the sick, change the weather and generally intervene in the spirit world on behalf of the community, would have given him social status and political power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0008429811430056">Lewis-Williams and Clottes, 2007</xref>: 32–33). Since the brains of modern humans are the same as those of the ancient peoples of the Upper Paleolithic period, Lewis-Williams maintains it is possible to theorize the existence of some universal features or elements of those religious encounters that occur in altered states of consciousness characteristic of both ancient shamanism and more modern mystical experiences. The somatic experiences of altered states, he tells us, are ‘wired’ into the human nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0008429811430056">Lewis-Williams and Clottes, 2007</xref>: 32). The members of the community would have no trouble believing in the shaman’s capacities for seeing, hearing, and dreaming alternative realities because they too, though perhaps to a less intense extent, would have experienced such neurologically embedded and generated phenomena.</p>
<p>‘The widespread occurrence of shamanism,’ Lewis-Williams writes, ‘results not from diffusionism but (in part) from universal neurological inheritance that includes the capacity of the nervous system to enter altered states and the need to make sense of the resulting experiences and hallucinations within a foraging community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0008429811430056">Lewis-Williams and Clottes, 2007</xref>: 33). Although he is primarily interested in the cognitive origins of religion, he cannot avoid touching on the question of its psychological significance and emotional power, which is especially evident in his claim that ‘all religions have an ecstatic component, and all involve altering human consciousness to some extent’ by a variety of ritualistic means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0008429811430056">Lewis-Williams and Pearce, 2005</xref>: 10). In his view, all fully modern human beings, by virtue of their universal neurological structure, are capable of believing in a ‘neurologically generated, and emotionally charged’ world that is populated by supernatural beings and forces that influence human life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0008429811430056">Lewis-Williams and Pearce, 2005</xref>: 12). This is one of the conclusions he reaches as he pursues the question as to what motivated Upper Paleolithic and Neolithic peoples to journey deep into caves and make images on their walls. He argues that when ancient human beings entered the caves, they took with them the already neurologically and culturally constituted images and visions of other worlds and realities whose power they could experience, order, and perhaps regulate more easily within the sensorily-limited atmosphere of the caves than above ground. These ancient humans saw in the caves what they already believed; the caves for them were the ‘entrails of the chthonic world’; behind their rock walls was a ‘realm inhabited by spirits and potential spirit helpers in animal form’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0008429811430056">Lewis-Williams and Clottes, 2007</xref>: 38).</p>
<p>Certainly the conditions of absolute or near-absolute darkness of the caves would facilitate and intensify the expression of the neurological products of the human mind, such as entoptic images and light flashes, so that any manner of spirits and gods could be easily hallucinated, and their power rendered more immediately accessible than in more ordinary, above-ground contexts. Cave explorer James Tabor describes how, surrounded and enveloped by the ‘medium’ of absolute or weakly illumined darkness, cavers ‘see’ false images and flashes of light, entoptic phenomena similar to those which occur when one’s eyes are tightly closed. Darkness facilitates and provokes altered states of consciousness that may include auditory and visual hallucinations, which is what Upper Paleolithic and Neolithic people may have been seeking in the caves. ‘Darkness is to caving,’ Tabor writes, ‘as water is to diving and air is to flying, [it is] a <italic>medium</italic> … that does more than any other aspect of the environment to shape your experience … Cave darkness … has weight and presence, life, a character all its own’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0008429811430056">Tabor, 2010</xref>: 54, italics added). Absolute dark induces ‘auditory and visual hallucinations, and can weaken the body’s immune system’; it can also produce anxiety and paranoia. In the darkness of deep caves, the hallucinated images, sounds and flashes of light cannot be banished by opening one’s eyes and reorienting oneself in familiar surroundings. It makes sense that caves provide a perfect context for facilitating powerful experiences of spirit worlds that aided early human efforts to regulate the strange, at times overwhelming, contents of their minds.</p>
<p>The reports of modern cave explorers support Lewis-Williams’ interpretation of the religious motivation of shamans and their followers to enter caves and perform their rituals there, the evidence of which he finds in the images of parietal cave art. The people who entered the caves in the Upper Paleolithic brought their visionary, hallucinatory capacities and beliefs with them such that they could ritually shape and manipulate their material world to the advantage of themselves and their communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0008429811430056">Lewis-Williams, 2002</xref>: 60). Equally important, they were able to organize and order their minds and regulate their affective experiences by imposing their neurological structures on ‘the stream of undifferentiated sense impressions’ that all human beings experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0008429811430056">Lewis-Williams, 2002</xref>: 68), and that Freud wondered about. Lewis-Williams utilizes empirical data derived from modern laboratory studies of hypnagogic and hypnopompic experiences and the entoptic phenomena associated with them as a means of interpreting the markings, patterns and paintings found in ancient cave sites that are similar to those modern hallucinated images that arise in altered states induced in controlled settings. In his view neuroscience provides the bridge that connects ancient and contemporary humans, drawing upon an empirically demonstrable theory of the ‘universal functioning of the human brain,’ whose products are expressed in an endless array of specific historical and cultural forms, including and especially religions. Deep in the caves of the Upper Paleolithic and Neolithic, people experiencing intense altered mental states created the patterns, markings and images they really ‘saw,’ much like those of our modern cavers. There they imposed ‘the shape of their minds on the material world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0008429811430056">Lewis-Williams, 2002</xref>: 60) in order to coax the powerful spirits through the rock membrane of the cave walls that demarcated this world from the supernatural realm.</p>
<p>Human beings do not need to venture into caves in order to experience altered states of consciousness, or to hallucinate alternate realities and supernatural entities. The universal capacity to dream, the auditory and visual hallucinations of psychosis, and even daydreams, indicate that all human beings possess some capacity for altered or dissociated states of consciousness. However, such experiences, besides being pleasurable and awe-inspiring, can also be disorienting and frightening. In both cases, they must be regulated, controlled, and interpreted if human beings are to successfully negotiate their own internal psychic equilibrium and their relationships with others. Neuroscientist Jaak Panksepp speculates that early anatomically modern human beings might well have experienced what is now known as REM sleep as their usual form of waking consciousness, in a time and place where emotionality was more important than contemporary forms of logic and instrumental reason in the activities of daily life. As social organization and technological advancement became more complex and sophisticated, this ancient form of waking consciousness would become accordingly modified, or perhaps even suppressed in order for higher brain evolution to proceed more efficiently. Whatever the case, Lewis-Williams concurs that human beings had to organize, make sense of and share the products of their minds in order to inhabit a communal, social world. This led to the formation of social and consciousness ‘contracts,’ where ‘every community has to divide up the spectrum of consciousness and to place different values on its components—that is, to make shared sense of the diverse mental states that everyone experiences … Altered consciousness is therefore always situated in a social and political matrix’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0008429811430056">Lewis-Williams and Pearce, 2005</xref>: 576). Religious experiences, beliefs and actions may be understood to constitute one of the most important and oldest means for the regulation of both the internal and external, individual and social worlds.</p>
<p>‘By confronting the spontaneous religious constructions with the results of natural science,’ writes William James, ‘philosophy can … eliminate doctrines that are now known to be scientifically absurd or incongruous’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0008429811430056">James, 1902/2004</xref>: 393). In order to be fully adequate to its object, a philosophy and ‘science of religions’ must take serious account of subjective religious experience and its psychological significance, recognizing that ‘feeling is the deeper source of religion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0008429811430056">James, 1902/2004</xref>: 372) and as such reveals important insights into the constructions and creations of the mind. Understanding the complexity of religions needs to begin with a psychological inquiry into the nature of religious experience (in its varied and diverse expressions in specific, historical cultural contexts) that includes neurobiological, emotional, evolutionary-psychological, psychoanalytic, and cognitive perspectives. A psychology of religion that is informed by diverse disciplines opens a ‘royal road’ to deeper knowledge of the complexity of the human mind, understanding that its innate need for religious and spiritual accounts of reality are part of the general evolutionary imperative for biological and affect regulation and the construction of the self.</p>
