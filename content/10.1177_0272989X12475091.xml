<p><bold>Background</bold>. It is widely recommended that health technology appraisals adopt a lifetime horizon to assess the relative costs and benefits of an intervention. However, most trials or clinical studies have relatively short follow-up periods, with the event of interest not occurring before the end of the study for many subjects. In such cases, survival analysis using parametric models can be used to extrapolate into the future. <bold>Objective</bold>. To assess the accuracy of survival analysis in projecting future events beyond the sample estimation period. <bold>Design</bold>. Using a previously published comparison of 2 alternative hip replacement prostheses based on 8 years of data as a case study, we extend the data set to include 8 years more data. Using the new data, the parametric assumptions of the previous study and its success in predicting the outcomes are assessed. <bold>Results</bold>. The extended data set casts doubt on the previous study’s findings. The failure curves of the 2 prostheses now cross, and the proportional hazards assumption no longer holds. Extrapolations from the original data set yielded very good predictions for one prosthesis for the full 16 years but were much poorer for the other, even when the proportionality assumption was relaxed. <bold>Conclusions</bold>. Care should be taken when extrapolating treatment benefits for new technologies early in their life cycle based on observational or randomized controlled trial data sources. This case study reveals that predictions of prosthesis failure based on a short follow-up period were inaccurate compared with those after a longer period of follow-up.</p>

<body>
<p>Economic evaluation is widely used to inform policy decisions regarding which new health care technologies should be adopted given the available resources.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272989X12475091">1</xref></sup> The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) provides guidance to the National Health Service (NHS) in England and Wales on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of new and already developed technologies and, within this, provides recommendations on the principles and methods of health technology appraisal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272989X12475091">2</xref></sup> In its guidance, NICE recommends that a lifetime horizon should normally be used to assess the relative costs and benefits of the intervention. However, most randomized controlled trials or clinical studies have a relatively short follow-up period, with the event of interest often not occurring before the end of the study. This article highlights the difficulty of balancing the need for imminent decisions against inadequate follow-up data to inform those decisions.</p>
<p>Survival analysis, which is concerned with the time until the occurrence of an event, is widely used in medical research to predict when an outcome of interest, such as death or failure, may occur for a given intervention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272989X12475091">1</xref></sup> and in other academic disciplines for analogous purposes, such as in economics for analyzing duration of unemployment. However, at any point in time, many patients in the data set have not had the event of interest: this is known as right censoring of the data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272989X12475091">3</xref></sup> Standard nonparametric survival analysis methods can be used to handle this, such as the Kaplan-Meier survivor function, whereas semi-parametric methods, such as the Cox proportional hazards model, can be employed to allow survival to depend on patient characteristics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272989X12475091">3</xref></sup> For descriptive purposes, these are entirely satisfactory, but they are of limited use for extrapolation and prediction because they leave the baseline hazard function unspecified.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272989X12475091">1</xref></sup> Instead, parametric models that assume a baseline hazard can be fitted to the data and then used to extrapolate into the future. There are a range of alternative parametric distributions that vary in how the baseline hazard is modeled. More recent developments in this field have added flexibility to survival models in the form of piecewise constant models,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272989X12475091">4</xref></sup> as well as flexible 3- and 4-parameter survival models,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272989X12475091">5</xref></sup> both of which seek to improve the predictive ability of survival analysis.</p>
<p>In this article we use a case study, total hip replacement (THR) surgery, to explore the potential difficulties of extrapolating survival curves over a lifetime horizon. THR provides a demanding example because there is often a long period from implantation until revision occurs, usually from around 10 years onwards.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272989X12475091">6</xref></sup> We use a previous well-known study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272989X12475091">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12475091">8</xref></sup> as an example (which in its earlier stages contributed to the NICE guidance on hip prostheses in 2000).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272989X12475091">9</xref></sup> We have extended the original data set used in that study to include 8 years more data and therefore are able to assess the accuracy of predictions that would have been made in 2000, in the light of a longer time series, up to 2007.</p>
<p>The aim of this article is to assess the accuracy of survival analysis in projecting future revision rates beyond the sample estimation period. Specifically, we consider how well extrapolations of the original estimated parametric curves predict the outcomes over the subsequent years, and if they do poorly (which is the case here), we attempt to understand the causes of the inaccurate predictions. We consider 3 possible explanations: 1) the proportionality assumption is inappropriate for modeling differences between prostheses, 2) the failure curves do not follow the Weibull distribution, and 3) the Weibull may be appropriate, but its parameters cannot be estimated accurately with so little early data.</p>
<sec id="section1-0272989X12475091" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The purpose of the study by Briggs and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272989X12475091">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12475091">8</xref></sup> was to construct a probabilistic Markov cost-effectiveness model for primary THR. An important requirement for this model is information on the transition probabilities between states of the model. Briggs and others derive these by estimating survival functions for 2 prostheses, the Charnley and Spectron. It is these estimated survival functions that are the focus of this article—we examine how well they predict the subsequent survival of the prostheses for the period 2000–2007.</p>
<p>Briggs and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12475091">8</xref></sup> model the risk of revision using the Weibull survival function, and to compare the 2 prostheses, they make the common proportionality assumption with respect to the effect of prosthesis type. That is, they assume that the survival of each prosthesis could be described by a Weibull distribution with the same gamma parameter (γ) but allowing the lambda (λ) parameter to differ between the prostheses. To aid interpretation, recall that the Weibull distribution is characterized by 2 parameters—λ (scale) and γ (shape)—with a hazard function: <italic>h</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) <italic>=</italic> γλ<italic>t</italic><sup>γ–1</sup>, where γ &gt; 1 (the slope of the hazard is increasing), γ &lt; 1 (the hazard is decreasing), and γ =1 (the hazard rate is constant), and the Weibull reduces to the exponential distribution.</p>
<p>Briggs and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12475091">8</xref></sup> make a distinction between “early” and “late” failures: early failures are identified with reasons such as primary deep infection and dislocation, whereas late failures are due to failure of the prosthesis itself (general “wear and tear”). They employ data on late failures from the Swedish National Hip Arthroplasty Register (SR) to estimate survival, and it is these estimates that they use alongside health outcomes (quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) and cost data to assess the relative cost-effectiveness of the 2 prostheses.</p>
<p>The SR contains information on prosthesis type (cemented, cementless, and hybrid), surgical procedure, patient characteristics, time to event data (prosthesis failure and revision surgery), and reasons for revision. Briggs and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12475091">8</xref></sup> employ data from SR for the period 1992–1999. For this study, we have access to 8 years of subsequent data, extending the period to 2007. As a first step, we recover from this 16-year extended data set those patients who would have appeared in the original Briggs et al. data set—that is, having had their primary surgery before 2000. We then add updated information on the fate of those original cohort patients who did not revise pre-2000—that is, whether they revised, survived, or died in the following 8 years. Note that in the database, joint failure is defined as the decision to have revision surgery (although problems with this definition are acknowledged<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272989X12475091">10</xref></sup>).</p>
<p>Using this replication data, our analysis is undertaken sequentially in 6 stages. First, we confirm that the initial 8 years (1992–1999, hereafter denoted by SHORT) of our extended data appropriately replicate the original sample by Briggs and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12475091">8</xref></sup>: in terms of patient characteristics and results (that is the failure curves and the Cox proportional hazards model). We confirm that this replication is successful: our data set includes 98% of the participants reported in Briggs and others.</p>
<p>Second, we apply the same nonparametric methods to the extended 16-year data set, 1992–2007 (hereafter denoted by LONG), which includes those same patients who appeared in the initial sample from Briggs and others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12475091">8</xref></sup> The extended data set (LONG), therefore, does not include any additional patients, just additional information regarding the outcomes for patients who received revisions post-1999. Those who had not revised post-1999 remain recorded as survivors until the date of censoring (end 2007) or their death. Using this extended data set, we examine Briggs and others’ assumption of proportionality with respect to prosthesis type.</p>
<p>The third stage turns to the parametric methods used by Briggs and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12475091">8</xref></sup> on the late failures. They fitted 6 alternative distributions (Weibull, exponential, Gompertz, log-logistic, lognormal, and γ) to the data and compared the goodness of fit using the AIC (Akaike’s information criterion) and Cox-Snell residual plots. Their preferred alternative was the Weibull distribution, and thus we fit the Weibull distribution to our extended data (LONG) and compare the estimated parameters (we also test the fit of other distributions in our extended data). This reveals considerable differences for the Weibull when estimated on the extended data set compared with the short time period; the next 2 stages explore this in more detail.</p>
<p>In the fourth stage, we drop the assumption of proportional hazards for prosthesis type and reestimate the Weibull model for each prosthesis separately for the initial period and the extended data set.</p>
<p>In the fifth stage, we assess the predictive performance of the original estimated model by Briggs and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12475091">8</xref></sup> in terms of the outcomes for 2000–2007. In principle, the extrapolations (predictions) from the model by Briggs and others should be assessed against the actual survival rates for 2000–2007, but in practice, this is infeasible given that predictions depend on the characteristics of patients and will therefore vary across patients in the sample. Our alternative approach is to compare the within-estimation period predictions for the years 9 to 16 from the Weibull equations for an illustrative patient (woman aged 70 years old without a fracture). We compare the predictions using the initial 8-year data set (SHORT) against the LONG data set in 2 alternative ways. First, we assume proportionality, as did Briggs and others. Next, we relax the proportionality assumption (i.e., use the original model specification) but estimate this separately for the Charnley and Spectron. The former assesses the predictive performance of Briggs and others’ original estimated equations, whereas the second assesses what their predictions would have been had they not assumed proportionality. We also consider the effect that these new predictions have on the resulting cost-effectiveness estimates by rerunning the Markov model with the new failure estimates.</p>
<p>In the sixth stage, we extend the analysis beyond that employed by Briggs and others,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12475091">8</xref></sup> to further assess the accuracy of both theirs and our findings. We allow for more flexibility in the model by first relaxing the assumption that the relationship between age and time until revision is linear. Second, we include operation date as an explanatory variable. Third, we consider whether there might be multiplicative relationships between the covariates and time and thus run the model with interaction covariates. We also rerun the model for alternative subperiods to further assess the robustness of the γ parameter. Finally, we extend our parametric analysis beyond the Weibull distribution, to assess whether the conclusions are accurate, by rerunning the model using the Gompertz distribution (assuming nonproportional hazards).</p>
<p>All statistical analysis was carried out using STATA SE version 11 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas) and Microsoft Excel 2007 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington) (for the cost-effectiveness model described in the Results section).</p>
<p>This study received no external funding.</p>

<title>Matching Data and Replicating Results by Briggs et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12475091">8</xref></sup></title>
<p>Although we had access to Briggs and others’ original data,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12475091">8</xref></sup> we were unable to merge in the new information on outcomes post-1999, so it was necessary to re-create their sample from the updated data set. In doing so, we were able to identify 98.3% of all patients in Briggs and others’ original data. The missing 1.7% (<italic>n</italic> = 350) appear to be due to minor coding discrepancies. In all such cases, we erred on the side of caution and omitted these patients. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0272989X12475091">Table 1</xref> presents the sample size, patient characteristics, and number of revisions as reported by Briggs et al. and for our replication data set. The descriptive statistics show that the 2 samples are virtually identical in terms of patient characteristics, age, and sex. However, there is some variation in the initial diagnoses; it would appear that the SR had some early issues with poor-quality coding of diagnoses, which have now been corrected.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272989X12475091">11</xref></sup></p>

Their headline conclusion is confirmed: the Spectron is unambiguously and significantly superior to the Charnley. Our replication of their results allows us to proceed with our subsequent analysis, in which we examine the success of extrapolations from this sample for 1992–1999 over the years that followed, 2000–2007.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0272989X12475091">Figure 2</xref> shows the KM failure curves, taking account of the extra 8 years of data for the years 2000–2007. The total observed time period is now 1992–2007, but still for the same sample of patients as used in Briggs and others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12475091">8</xref></sup> The striking contrast with the KM curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0272989X12475091">Figure 1</xref> for the initial 8-year period is that the curves for the 2 prostheses now cross after approximately 15 years. In other words, contrary to expectations from Briggs and others, the Spectron survives less well than the Charnley after 15 years. Further examination of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0272989X12475091">Figure 2</xref> reveals that the difference between prostheses widens over time up to 8 years (as in Briggs et al.), but thereafter, the gap narrows fairly rapidly, until the crossing at 15 years. The log-rank test for equality of the 2 functions still shows a significant difference between the 2 curves at the 2% level; this reflects the fact that the Spectron curve lies below that for the Charnley for most of the 16 years.</p>
<p>The impact of extending the data set on the Cox proportional hazards model is presented in the last column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0272989X12475091">Table 2</xref>. The hazard ratios for the initial time period and extended time period are almost identical for age and sex, although they differ for fracture, as mentioned above, due to the different coding system used in the new database. The hazard ratio for the Spectron is twice as large for the longer period compared with the shorter period and no longer significant, implying no significant difference between the 2 prostheses. Moreover, the test of proportional hazards is now rejected at the 1% level for the Spectron.</p>

<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0272989X12475091">Table 4</xref> reports the results of fitting a Weibull model to the extended data set and compares these with the results in the SHORT data set. As can be seen from the table, the estimates of the coefficients are generally similar for age, male, and fracture. However, the coefficient on Spectron clearly differs between the two: 0.957 (and not significant) for LONG as opposed to 0.200 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) in SHORT. This is not unexpected given the above nonparametric results from the KM curves above and Cox proportional hazards model. It suggests that it is clearly inappropriate to make the proportional hazards assumption regarding prosthesis type as did Briggs and others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12475091">8</xref></sup> In other words, in light of the new data, we cannot assume that the Spectron failure function is simply a downward shift of the Charnley function. The coefficient for γ also differs between SHORT and LONG, 0.789 and 1.402, respectively, and this is discussed in more detail below.</p>

<title>Assessing Predictions</title>
<p>Our results call into question the ability of the model by Briggs and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12475091">8</xref></sup> to predict the future failure of the 2 prostheses over the subsequent years, 2000–2007. To test this, we estimate prosthesis-specific failure rates for an illustrative patient (woman, age 70 years, nonfracture) predicted by the most appropriate specification, that is, with the extended data set (LONG) and not assuming proportionality (as presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0272989X12475091">Table 5</xref>). These within-estimation period predictions can be interpreted as a proxy for the actual values or, less speculatively, simply as “better” predictions because they are based on 16 years of data and without the inappropriate proportionality assumption. These predictions are then compared with the rates produced using SHORT, first assuming (as Briggs and others did) proportionality and then relaxing this assumption.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0272989X12475091">Figure 3</xref> show the results of the first approach (using SHORT, assuming proportionality) at assessing the predictive ability over 30 years. A projection period of 30 years was chosen as it is sufficiently long to cover the natural life expectancies of most patients and prostheses. For example, if a patient is 70 years old when she undergoes revision surgery, then one might expect that the maximum age for revision surgery would be no later than 100 years (due to overall mortality and age-related comorbidities affecting appropriateness for surgery). Note that in the present database, the oldest patient undergoing revision surgery is 99 years. Ideally, the choice of the most appropriate extrapolation period would be based on the reported failure rates for the Charnley and Spectron in the literature. However, most joint registries (Swedish and the National Joint Registry for England and Wales included) and the literature only report up to 10-year failure rates by prosthesis type.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272989X12475091">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272989X12475091">12</xref></sup></p>

<p>Estimated Weibull failure curves: SHORT, assuming proportionality (as in Briggs and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12475091">8</xref></sup>), compared with LONG without proportionality. Estimate is for late failure, woman, aged 70 years, nonfracture. Fitted values are within-period estimates for LONG up to 16 years and extrapolated for years 17 to 20, as well as within-period extrapolations for years 1 to 8 but beyond-period extrapolations for SHORT for years 9 to 20. Estimated curves up to the 8-year vertical are fitted within period for SHORT data. Estimated curves up to the 16-year vertical are fitted within period for LONG data.</p>
</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0272989X12475091-fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>These projected results are compared with LONG, which are within-period predictions estimated from the results presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0272989X12475091">Table 5</xref> without proportionality up to 16 years, whereas years 17 to 30 are predictions beyond this period. For SHORT, years 1 to 8 are within-period (derived from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0272989X12475091">Table 4</xref>, first column) and years 9 to 30 are beyond-period extrapolations as estimated from the equations. As can be seen, the Weibull for the Charnley (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0272989X12475091">Figure 3</xref>) predicts future failure fairly accurately; the difference is never more than 0.02. For the Spectron, however, a difference of nearly 0.03 has already emerged by year 8, and this then increases dramatically as we move into the extrapolation period (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0272989X12475091">Figure 3</xref>). By year 16, the SHORT model predicts failure at 0.02, compared with 0.13 when employing the revised LONG Weibull without proportionality.</p>
<p>Further simulations find that there are similar orders of magnitude in the error for alternative illustrative patients. For example, for a 60-year-old female patient, at 16 years, the SHORT model predicts failure at 0.024 for a Spectron; this compares with a predicted failure of 0.300 using the revised equation for LONG.</p>
<p>To compare predictions relaxing the proportionality assumption, we need to first reestimate the Weibull using the SHORT data without making the proportionality assumption. These results are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0272989X12475091">Table 6</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0272989X12475091">Figure 4</xref> shows the predictions from SHORT, as Briggs and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12475091">8</xref></sup> would have derived had they not assumed proportionality. The predictions are almost unchanged from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0272989X12475091">Figure 3</xref>; the Weibull continues to predict without noticeable errors for the Charnley but underpredicts substantially for the Spectron. For instance, the “error” by year 16 is approximately the same as that presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0272989X12475091">Figure 3</xref>. To assess the effect of illustrative patient choice, the same failure curves were again reproduced for a female, nonfracture patient, but this time aged 60 years. Again, the Weibull underpredicted Spectron failure by a margin of 0.272.</p>

<p>To examine the implications of this for the cost-effectiveness of the 2 prostheses, we report in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0272989X12475091">Table 7</xref> the results of rerunning Briggs and others’ probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis using the extended data. For comparison, these results are presented alongside the original results from Briggs and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12475091">8</xref></sup> (cf. Table 12, p. 50). The model is run without proportionality assumed, thus using 2 separate Weibull functions for the Charnley and Spectron. The results are completely reversed from those originally reported by Briggs and others: now the Charnley dominates for all, irrespective of age and sex. The results of the cost-effectiveness model indicate that, based on mean costs and QALYs, the Spectron is no longer cost saving in younger patients (because more revisions are experienced). This result might be explained by the extremely high and rapidly increasing revision rate for years 16 to 30 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0272989X12475091">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Such high projected failures call into question whether even 16 years of data are sufficient to accurately estimate long-term survival. Therefore, as a sensitivity test, we reran the cost-effectiveness model for years 0 to 16 only (results not presented but available on request). This analysis suggests that although the superiority of the Charnley for younger patients is reduced, it continues to dominate, even for these younger age groups.</p>

<sec id="section8-0272989X12475091">
<title>Further Analyses</title>
<p>To explore other potential reasons for the differences in the predicted risk of revision when using the LONG relative to the SHORT data set, we conducted 4 further analyses.</p>
<p>Thus far, to ensure close comparability with Briggs and others,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12475091">8</xref></sup> we have employed the same model and methods as reported in their original paper; the sole exception has been to relax the assumption of proportional hazards. In this final set of results, we extend their framework to consider whether the apparent instability of the Spectron failure function might be the result of 1) misspecification of the model, 2) an inappropriate choice of distribution, 3) the time period, or 4) the sample size. Due to space considerations, the specific details of the results summarized below are not shown but are available from the authors on request.</p>
<sec id="section9-0272989X12475091">
<title>Allowing for More Flexibility in the Functional Specification of the Model</title>
<p>The model was reestimated by allowing for nonlinearity in the age variable by including it in a quadratic form, adding the date of operation as an explanatory variable, and introducing multiplicative relationships between the covariates and time (i.e., including time and covariate interaction terms).</p>
<p>None of these extensions was found to add to the explanatory power of the model, as judged by insignificant log-likelihood ratio tests. Most important, the headline result remains for all of these experiments: the estimated Weibull γ parameter is stable between SHORT and LONG for the Charnley, but for the Spectron, it increases from 1.6 to 2.1 for SHORT to 2.52 to 2.74 for LONG (depending on which precise combination of these new variables is used).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0272989X12475091">
<title>Replacing the Weibull with the Gompertz Distribution</title>
<p>As described earlier, the Gompertz distribution displayed a marginally better fit than the Weibull (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0272989X12475091">Table 3</xref>). Therefore, to test the effect of distributional choice, we reran the original model using the Gompertz distribution, without assuming proportional hazards. Comparisons between SHORT and LONG in the estimated shape parameter (γ) produced similar unsatisfactory results as found for the Weibull. The γ estimate is insignificant when estimated on SHORT for the Spectron, and it would appear that the instability between SHORT and LONG is not just confined to the Weibull distribution.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0272989X12475091">
<title>Rerunning the Model for Different Subperiods</title>
<p>As an alternative to the methods used above to assess the predictive power of the model, we reran the equation for a series of different, successively longer subperiods within the overall period (patients receiving the implant 1992–1993, 1992–1994, 1992–1995, etc.), for Charnley and Spectron, LONG and SHORT, all without proportionality assumed. This allowed us to assess the accuracy of the γ parameter across different cohorts of patients. For the Charnley, as for the full period, the estimated γ remained stable between SHORT and LONG for each alternative subperiod. But for the Spectron, γ was always unstable between SHORT (in the range 1.6–2.0, depending on the subperiod) and LONG (in the range 2.4–2.7).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0272989X12475091">
<title>Exploring the Impact of the Different Sample Sizes for Charnley and Spectron</title>
<p>One potential explanation for the unsatisfactory results for the Spectron is that the sample of patients is much smaller (only about 10% the size of the sample) for the Charnley. Although we were unable to increase the Spectron sample, we were able to explore the impact of reducing the Charnley sample to a size similar to that of the Spectron. To do this, random 10% subsamples of the Charnley sample were taken to assess whether the estimated γ parameter for the Charnley (between LONG and SHORT) might become similarly unstable when estimated using a small sample size. These analyses confirm that the γ parameter for the Charnley persistently retains its stability between LONG and SHORT. This suggests, albeit indirectly, that the instability of the γ parameter for the Spectron is unlikely to be a sample size problem but rather may reflect some aspect of the prosthesis itself—for example, the fact that, at the time of study, it was a relatively young prosthesis. We return to this possibility in the Discussion.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="section14-0272989X12475091">
<title>Summary of Main Findings</title>
<p>Our analysis finds that, with the addition of 8 years more data, the Spectron remains superior to the Charnley in the early years, but at a declining rate, such that the failure rate of the Charnley becomes similar and then better than the Spectron after 15 years. This revised result is broadly consistent with the data recently published in the SR annual report,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272989X12475091">11</xref></sup> in which the 10-year survival rate for the Charnley is reported as 92.6% for 1992–2000 (<italic>n</italic> = 20,368). For the Spectron, the SR reports a 14-year survival rate of 97.5% for an older design, but this deteriorates to 95% at an 11-year survival for a newer design (see below for a brief discussion of the technological development of the Spectron).</p>
<p>In terms of the original methodology by Briggs and others,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12475091">8</xref></sup> we find that the assumption of proportionality by prosthesis for the Charnley and Spectron is violated and that the original estimate by Briggs and others of the key parameter, γ, is substantially revised upwards for the Spectron. Our analysis shows that, even when the proportionality assumption is relaxed, this model would still have significantly underpredicted Spectron failure rates. We find that extrapolations of the estimated Weibull curve (as given in Briggs et al.) yield very poor predictions for the failure of the Spectron in the 8 years after the original estimation period. In turn, this means that the result on relative cost-effectiveness is reversed in favor of the Charnley.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0272989X12475091">
<title>Explanation</title>
<p>The further analyses conducted above have failed to explain the instability of the Spectron failure curve; thus, we return to the 3 possible explanations set out earlier. First, it is now clear that the assumption by Briggs and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12475091">8</xref></sup> of a proportional impact of the prosthesis type proved to be inappropriate. Although modeling with proportional hazards is relatively common in survival models,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272989X12475091">4</xref></sup> our findings demonstrate that it is not necessarily justified. Despite this, we have shown that, in itself, this assumption was not the cause of the poor predictions for the Spectron because the problem remains when their model is reestimated without assuming proportionality. Nevertheless, our finding implies that such a specific assumption should probably not be employed in future comparative studies of this type, although this in itself does not invalidate the use of survival analysis.</p>
<p>Second, we consider the performance of the Weibull distribution. We find no evidence that any of the alternative distributions suggested by Briggs and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12475091">8</xref></sup> would have performed any better. Indeed, for the Charnley prosthesis, the Weibull “predicts” remarkably accurately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0272989X12475091">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0272989X12475091">4</xref>); the problem is confined to the Spectron.</p>
<p>Third is the possibility that although the Weibull distribution may be appropriate, its estimated parameters are unstable—in the sense that their magnitudes are sensitive to the addition of more data. For the Charnley, this is not the case: without assuming proportionality, the estimated γ and other coefficients appear to be fairly robust between the 8- and 16-year data: γ = 1.471 (SHORT) and γ = 1.356 (LONG) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0272989X12475091">Tables 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0272989X12475091">5</xref>, respectively). However, for the Spectron, the γ estimate rises substantially from 1.629 for SHORT to 2.521 for LONG. This appears to be the crux of the matter—such a substantial shift in the γ parameter would inevitably lead to large revisions in predicted values. This also explains why the assumption of proportionality was acceptable with only 8 years, as in Briggs and others,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12475091">8</xref></sup> but then rejected in light of 16 years of data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0272989X12475091">
<title>Implications for Practice and Policy</title>
<p>Our main purpose in using the Charnley and Spectron prostheses in this study was to assess the accuracy of survival analysis in projecting future events beyond the sample estimation period. More specifically, we were interested in whether extrapolations of original estimated parametric curves could successfully predict future outcomes.</p>
<p>For this specific case per se, our results raise some doubts about the relative longer term failure of the Spectron cementless prosthesis. The Spectron was a relatively new prosthesis at the time of the study by Briggs and others,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12475091">8</xref></sup> so it is possible that the prosthesis itself was experiencing some problems during this period and that high failure rates post-1999 reflect some unforeseen deterioration in the prosthesis itself. However, Spectron prostheses for a later cohort of patients (those receiving prostheses between 2000 and 2007)—that is, <italic>after</italic> the Briggs et al. estimation period—have shown even worse failure rates (not shown). We can only speculate as to the causes, and we stress that this has no direct bearing on the results of the present article—all of which relate to the original Briggs et al. cohort for 1992–1999. However, these results suggest that as the use of Spectron has increased, the outcomes have deteriorated. This would imply that relatively new prostheses (and, more generally, any new intervention where the event of interest occurs at a point far into the future) should be viewed more cautiously than more established prostheses (and interventions), for which both clinical learning and effectiveness may be more established. For example, it is possible that developments in technical features,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272989X12475091">13</xref></sup> such as component (head and socket) size, finish, coating, and composition of the Spectron (all of which may vary according to the patient’s anatomical requirements), may affect the failure rate. In fact, the most recent annual report for the SR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272989X12475091">11</xref></sup> reports that the “modernization” undergone by the Spectron EF during the mid-1990s actually worsened performance. The new designs of the Spectron have a narrower and shorter stem, which have subsequently been found to increase the risk of loosening.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0272989X12475091">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Generalization of these results should be qualified by emphasizing that this analysis focuses only on data from 1 country, Sweden, and only on 2 brands of prostheses, with a relatively small data set for one of them. It should also be acknowledged that, because our data set replicated the original data by Briggs and others,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12475091">8</xref></sup> it could include only those explanatory variables that were available and used in their original analysis. The inclusion of further variables to allow for differences between both patients and providers could provide a more accurate treatment of any potential confounding in the analysis. For example, since 2002, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), specifically the EQ-5D and patient satisfaction, have been collected in the SR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272989X12475091">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>More recently, researchers have started to recommend the use of external data and/or clinical validity for assessing the plausibility of the extrapolated portion of survival models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272989X12475091">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272989X12475091">5</xref></sup> We acknowledge that such further analysis would have added to the completeness of the model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272989X12475091">4</xref></sup> However, in the context of hip prostheses, external data on long-term prosthesis survival are lacking, particularly on the newer prosthesis types.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0272989X12475091">14</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0272989X12475091">
<title>Directions for Future Work</title>
<p>It is obvious that future research will require more long-term follow-up data, and the recent introduction of the National Joint Registry (NJR) in 2003–2004 to England and Wales will provide an invaluable source of data to conduct future economic evaluations of alternative prostheses. However, as we have shown, in the meantime, predicting prosthesis survival based on data from a registry of 8 or 9 years is unlikely to be sufficient to provide accurate predictions.</p>
<p>Although our analysis relates directly to extrapolation of failure rates for hip prostheses, the issue applies to all interventions for which we need to estimate lifetime effects based on short-term data. The aim of this article was to consider the original findings by Briggs and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12475091">8</xref></sup> in light of new extended data using the same parametric form (the Weibull distribution). However, future work should consider methods for assessing the sensitivity of the cost-effectiveness decision to the different parametric forms of the survival models such as that discussed by Jackson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272989X12475091">5</xref></sup> and by Gerdtham and Zethraeus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0272989X12475091">15</xref></sup> Cost-effectiveness analysis requires a long-term time horizon for the intervention of interest, and interventions with a delayed outcome of interest are clearly more complex to analyze. Extrapolation using short-term data should be as accurate as possible to avoid inconsistent estimates of the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. In the context of this article, however, even if a shorter time horizon had been adopted, the extrapolations still would have been inaccurate due to the contrast between the successful early performance of the Spectron and its subsequent deterioration in revision rates. We argue that without a long-term panel of follow-up data on the outcome of interest, such extrapolations may be highly uncertain.</p>
<p>Alternative approaches to the one favored in this article include fitting a piecewise constant hazard function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272989X12475091">4</xref></sup> and a flexible parametric approach developed by Royston,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0272989X12475091">16</xref></sup> which involves using natural cubic splines to model a baseline survival function using the Aranda-Ordaz family of link functions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272989X12475091">17</xref></sup> However, we do not believe that using either of these approaches would have helped in addressing the fundamental issue concerning this article, which is that the shape of the failure curve changed significantly outside the initial period of observation.</p>
<p>In summary, this article highlights the difficulty of balancing the need for imminent decisions on adoption of new technologies against the lack of long-term follow-up data. This is a particularly pertinent problem facing decision makers regarding the adoption of new medical devices (such as hip prostheses), where few randomized controlled trials exist due to the length of time until the event of interest takes place (in this case, failure of the prostheses). Until further long-term data become available, we recommend a conservative approach to extrapolation of survival curves, involving fitting and testing a range of survival models, which are then assessed by their internal and external validity. Latimer’s “survival model selection process” algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272989X12475091">4</xref></sup> suggests a systematic approach for such an analysis.</p>
