<p>This project investigates the mechanism underlying one’s intentions to register as organ donors and to engage in family discussion about organ donation. Based on survey data collected from 306 undergraduate students, results reveal that for the donor registration model, respondents’ utilitarian and value-expressive functions predicted intentions to register, regardless of their self-monitoring tendency. For intentions to discuss organ donation with family, self-monitoring was a significant moderator such that for low self-monitors (vs. high), the utilitarian function was a more important predictor of intentions, whereas for high self-monitors (vs. low), the value-expressive attitudes were more important. The ego-defensive function was negatively associated with intentions to register but was positively associated with intentions to discuss organ donation. Both theoretical and practical implications of the findings are provided.</p>

<body>
<p>Research in social psychology has demonstrated that what we think and want and who we are influence our communicative and health behaviors. Largely guided by the reasoned action theoretical framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0093650211424406">Ajzen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0093650211424406">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975</xref>), a number of studies have identified that attitudes, either alone or in combination with other constructs (e.g., norms), account for a substantial amount of variance in one’s behavioral intentions and behaviors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0093650211424406">Albarracín, Johnson, Fishbein, &amp; Muellerleile, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0093650211424406">Armitage &amp; Conner, 2001</xref>). Another stream of attitude research addresses the motivational bases of attitudes (i.e., attitude functions) or why people hold attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093650211424406">Katz, 1960</xref>). Research in attitude functions is important because attitude formation and change should be understood in terms of the needs they serve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093650211424406">Katz, 1960</xref>, p. 167) and different motivational processes call for different persuasion tactics. In addition, attitude functions research examines how individual or group differences can affect the influence of attitude functions on one’s behavioral intentions because certain motivations and consequences are seen as more important for certain groups of people (e.g., high vs. low self-monitors). Indeed, it has been argued that the effectiveness of communication strategies depends on whether the strategies match the needs of a particular target audience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0093650211424406">Dutta-Bergman, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Building on these two research streams, the present investigation explores the role of attitude functions and self-monitoring in shaping one’s communicative and health behaviors after controlling for norms and self-efficacy that are specified in the theory of reasoned action (TRA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0093650211424406">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975</xref>) and the integrative model of behavioral prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0093650211424406">Fishbein &amp; Cappella, 2006</xref>). More specifically, this research focuses on individuals’ willingness to register as organ donors and to discuss organ donation with their family, which is widely regarded as two important components for the success of organ donation campaigns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0093650211424406">Park &amp; Smith, 2007</xref>). As previous research revealed that general attitudes toward organ donation were high and were not predictive of organ donation intentions or behaviors, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0093650211424406">van den Berg, Manstead, van der Pligt, and Wigboldus (2005)</xref> maintain that the general attitude measure does not capture the factors underlying organ donation. It is thus essential to examine the more detailed attitudinal considerations in organ donation research. In addition, these two organ donation behaviors offer an opportunity to test the integration of the TRA and attitude functional theory and can provide a comparison of its applications to two related, yet different health behaviors.</p>

<title>The TRA and the Integrative Model of Behavioral Prediction</title>
<p>A number of social psychology theories have been proposed and used to identify factors that influence individuals’ intentions and behaviors, including the health belief model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093650211424406">Rosenstock, 1974</xref>), social cognitive theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0093650211424406">Bandura, 2009</xref>), the TRA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0093650211424406">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975</xref>), and the theory of planned behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0093650211424406">Ajzen, 1991</xref>). Largely based on the TRA and social cognitive theory, the integrative model of behavioral prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0093650211424406">Fishbein &amp; Cappella, 2006</xref>) maintains that actual performance of a behavior is preceded by intentions and that intentions in turn are predicted by attitudes (i.e., favorable or unfavorable evaluation of the behavior), subjective norms (i.e., perceived approval or pressure from family members or friends), and self-efficacy (i.e., beliefs and confidence about one’s own abilities in performing a given behavior). In the context of organ donation behaviors, a large body of research has generally confirmed that attitudes, norms, and self-efficacy (or perceived behavioral control) positively predict intentions to register as donors and to discuss organ donation with family members (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0093650211424406">Bresnahan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0093650211424406">Park &amp; Smith, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0093650211424406">Park, Smith, &amp; Yun, 2009</xref>). Although the integrative model explains a relatively large amount of variance in health intentions and behaviors, several authors have called for the use of more refined variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0093650211424406">Armitage &amp; Conner, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0093650211424406">Park &amp; Smith, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0093650211424406">van der Pligt &amp; de Vries, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>One long-standing criticism of the reasoned action theoretical framework focuses on the theory’s treatment of attitudes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0093650211424406">van der Pligt &amp; de Vries, 1998</xref>). According to the expectancy-value model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0093650211424406">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975</xref>) attitudes are modeled using the sum or the average of the product terms of beliefs and their respective evaluations. Van der Pligt and his colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0093650211424406">van der Pligt &amp; de Vries, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0093650211424406">van der Pligt &amp; Eiser, 1984</xref>) stated that attitudes are often modeled based on a large number of beliefs that individuals might not attend to; that is, the expectancy-value approach does not consider which beliefs are more relevant or important to the behavioral decisions. Thus, it is necessary to identify the attitude structure relevant to the behavior and to reduce the burden of decision making to a manageable number of behavioral consequences and alternatives for a specific target audience. Another attitude measurement uses a direct measure of attitudes based on a battery of semantic differential items because of the ease of construction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0093650211424406">Ajzen, 2002</xref>), which assesses individuals’ affective and instrumental evaluations of a behavior. However, this measurement of attitudes does not directly account for the reasons or motivations underlying the behavior or does not provide more detailed insights for health message or campaign design.</p>

<title>Attitude Functions</title>
<p>The use of attitude functional theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093650211424406">Katz, 1960</xref>) can avoid simplification or “attributing a single cause to given types of attitude” (p. 167) and, at the same time, it provides a more generalized understanding of which attitude functions predict intentions. The functional theory maintains that individuals hold attitudes to serve different psychological functions or needs, namely, utilitarian, value-expressive (or social identity), and ego-defensive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0093650211424406">Shavitt &amp; Nelson, 2002</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093650211424406">Katz, 1960</xref>). It is generally believed that most attitude objects or behaviors (e.g., attitudes toward social groups, political issues, or health behaviors) serve multiple functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0093650211424406">Shavitt &amp; Nelson, 2002</xref>). In addition, different individuals might hold same attitudes or have same behavioral intentions, whilst the underlying motivations are different. For example, some individuals support organ donation because they view organ donation as an unselfish act or a benefit to humanity (i.e., value-expressive function; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0093650211424406">Horton &amp; Horton, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0093650211424406">Morgan &amp; Miller, 2002a</xref>), whereas a small number of individuals support organ donation if the family of the deceased is provided with financial incentives or assistance (i.e., utilitarian function; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0093650211424406">Gallup Organization, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Among the three attitude functions, the utilitarian function focuses on one’s desire to maximize benefits and minimize punishments from an external world. Unlike the other two functions, the utilitarian function is more concerned with the intrinsic features and the practical benefits or costs of the attitude object (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093650211424406">Katz, 1960</xref>), such as the quality of a product or the taste of food. The value-expressive function is related to the expression of values important to one’s self-concept. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0093650211424406">Shavitt and Nelson (2002)</xref> maintain that the purpose of this function is to help establish and maintain one’s public and private identities. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0093650211424406">Eagly and Chaiken (1993)</xref>, expression of one’s attitudes can be facilitated when these values are recognized and reinforced by others; however, this function does not require individuals to publicly or verbally express their attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0093650211424406">Hullett &amp; Boster, 2001</xref>). Lastly, as individuals strive to maintain a high sense of overall self-integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0093650211424406">Steele, 1988</xref>), they attend to the ego-defensive function to protect their ego from facing their own insecurities and unacceptable behaviors. Largely, the ego-defensive function works as a defense mechanism by attributing the cause of the problem to either real or imaged threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093650211424406">Katz, 1960</xref>). For example, instead of admitting that they are not willing to help those who are in need of organs, some individuals might defend themselves by stating that doctors may declare premature death to procure organs and that organ donation helps the rich or alcoholics who damaged their livers through excessive alcohol consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093650211424406">Morgan, Harrison, Afifi, Long, &amp; Stephenson, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Although attitude functional research has mainly adopted an experimental approach to examine the effects of functionally matched messages (vs. not matched) on message persuasiveness (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093650211424406">Petty, Wheeler, &amp; Bizer, 2000</xref>), the utility of the functional research can be extended to explain the psychological process underlying one’s behavioral intentions or behaviors. Before designing functionally matched messages, it is necessary to determine the functions and motivations that an attitude object serves and whether these attitude functions are related to the target population’s behavioral intentions. This is an important first step because the relationships between attitude functions and behavioral intentions can vary across the behavior types or target populations. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0093650211424406">Wyman and Snyder (1997)</xref> found that participants’ approval of lifting the ban on gays in the U.S. military was positively associated with the value-expressive function and was negatively associated with the ego-defensive function. Based on a cross-sectional design, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0093650211424406">Lois and López-Sáez (2009)</xref> investigated the motivations behind car use and found that both instrumental (i.e., utilitarian) and symbolic (i.e., social identity) motivations were directly associated with participants’ affective attitudes toward car use and indirectly predicted their car use. That is, given the differences among the attitude objects, it is necessary to assess attitude functions for the attitude objects or target populations before designing functionally matched messages.</p>

<title>The Moderating Role of Self-Monitoring</title>
<p>Self-monitoring, a personality trait, can potentially moderate the relationships between different attitude functions and behavioral intentions. Self-monitoring refers to the tendency and ability that individuals monitor and observe the situational and social cues regarding the appropriateness of their self-presentation or expressive behaviors and adjust their behaviors accordingly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0093650211424406">Snyder, 1974</xref>). As high self-monitors (vs. low self-monitors) are more concerned about their social image and try to fit in, they are more likely to monitor the environment for the social appropriateness of their expressions and behaviors and are guided by situational cues. On the other hand, low self-monitors are less concerned about others’ perceptions or approval; instead, they are more concerned about the utilitarian values of a product or behavior and remain true to their own feelings, values, and dispositions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0093650211424406">Snyder, 1974</xref>).</p>
<p>Consistent with this theoretical reasoning, a number of studies have revealed that the social identity (value-expressive) function is more persuasive and more important for high self-monitors than for low self-monitors and that the utilitarian function is more important for low self-monitors than for high self-monitors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0093650211424406">Shavitt &amp; Nelson, 2002</xref>). For example, based on an experimental study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0093650211424406">Dutta-Bergman (2003)</xref> revealed that high self-monitors rated advertisements with social appeals (e.g., being cool) more positively than advertisements with utilitarian appeals (e.g., saving money and time), whereas low self-monitors responded more positively toward utilitarian appeals than toward social appeals. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0093650211424406">Wang (2009)</xref> found that utilitarian attitudes were a significant predictor of intentions to regularly participate in physical activity among low self-monitors, but not among high self-monitors. Although the hypothesis predicted that high self-monitors were more likely than low monitors to attend to the social identity attitudes, the results showed a nonsignificant main effect and a nonsignificant interaction between self-monitoring and the social identity function, indicating that the social identity function of physical exercise was not important for either high or low self-monitors. The author attributed the reason of the nonsignificant effects to that the conceptualization of the social identity attitudes did not measure the expression of participants’ values among their peers.</p>

<title>Organ Donation Registration and Discussion With Family</title>
<p>The present research sought to examine the role of attitude functions and self-monitoring in individuals’ intentions to register as donors and to discuss organ donation with their family, which have been identified as two important behaviors for the success of organ donation campaigns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093650211424406">Institute of Medicine of the National Academies [IOM], 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0093650211424406">Park &amp; Smith, 2007</xref>). Organ donation registration through designating one’s permission on driver’s licenses, signing a donor card, or enrolling in a state donor registry is the prerequisite for posthumous organ donation to take place in the United States. To increase the number of potential donors, it is important to examine the reasons why some individuals register as donors, whereas others do not. On the other hand, family discussion is also important because prior family discussion can increase the consent or cooperation rate for organ procurement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0093650211424406">Siminoff, Gordon, Hewlett, &amp; Arnold, 2001</xref>). Although 48 states in the United States have passed the First Person Consent law as of April 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0093650211424406">United Network for Organ Sharing, 2010</xref>), organ procurement organization staff and hospitals can face negative publicity and noncooperation if they proceed without family consent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093650211424406">Howard, Cornell, &amp; Koval, 2008</xref>). In states or countries without organ donor registries, donors can be assured that their wishes will be followed if their family members are informed of their decisions and pass the information to the transplant professionals at the time of the donors’ death. On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0093650211424406">Morgan (2008)</xref> states that “those who do not wish to donate can likewise convey this position to family members who can, in turn, refuse the requests of organ transplant coordinators” (p. 45). In addition, communication research has found that interpersonal communication can change others’ health-related attitudes and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093650211424406">Rogers, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0093650211424406">Stephenson et al., 2009</xref>). In the case of organ donation, positive family discussion can facilitate favorable attitudes toward organ donation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0093650211424406">Afifi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0093650211424406">Morgan &amp; Miller, 2002b</xref>) and encourage family members to register as donors as well.</p>
<p>Organ donation research based on the reasoned action framework revealed that those who signed donor cards (vs. those who did not) generally had more favorable attitudes and norms and had higher self-efficacy or perceived behavioral control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0093650211424406">Morgan &amp; Miller, 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0093650211424406">Park &amp; Smith, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0093650211424406">Park, Smith, et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0093650211424406">Stephenson et al., 2008</xref>). More detailed qualitative analysis of discussion between family members revealed that organ donation was related to altruism, mistrust of the medical institutions and system, the existence of a black market for organs, and the issue of deservingness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093650211424406">Morgan et al., 2008</xref>). Although attitudes, norms, and/or self-efficacy are also significant predictors of intentions to discuss with family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0093650211424406">Hyde &amp; White, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0093650211424406">Morgan &amp; Miller, 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0093650211424406">Morgan, Miller, &amp; Arasaratnam, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0093650211424406">Park &amp; Smith, 2007</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0093650211424406">Morgan (2008)</xref> states that some of the barriers to becoming a potential donor are different from those for family discussion. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0093650211424406">Afifi et al. (2006)</xref> summarized a number of more specific factors that predicted one’s willingness or intentions to communicate with family members about organ donation, for example, anticipation of defending oneself before family members and the unpleasant feelings related to talking about death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0093650211424406">Hyde &amp; White, 2009a</xref>). Furthermore, Afifi et al. found that anxiety was negatively associated to one’s efficacy to discuss and was indirectly associated to directness to talk about organ donation with family. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093650211424406">Morse et al. (2009)</xref> found that both anxiety to discuss and discussion time were direct predictors of family interaction.</p>
<p>Based on the preceding review of the donor registration and family discussion literature, both behaviors can be related to all three attitude functions, although the reasons for each attitude function can be different for the two donation-related behaviors. First, organ donors usually have little or nothing to gain for themselves; the current recommendation in the United States does not favor the option of providing any direct or indirect incentives to the donors or their family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093650211424406">IOM, 2006</xref>). However, it might cause problems for their family members by making it more difficult for them to cope with the event or delaying the funeral process. Thus, the utilitarian function behind individuals’ attitudes toward organ donation is mainly related to the potential costs or problems for family members and not for themselves. On the other hand, family discussion is related to a different set of reasons and is related to the use of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093650211424406">Morse et al., 2009</xref>) and the inconvenience to the respondents that family discussion might cause. Second, research has revealed that being a potential organ donor or discussion with family members is related to one’s identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093650211424406">Hyde &amp; White, 2009b</xref>). More specifically, a number of studies used attitudinal items related to the value-expressive function (e.g., organ donation is an unselfish/altruistic act or a benefit to humanity; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0093650211424406">Horton &amp; Horton, 1991</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0093650211424406">Park, Shin, and Yun (2009)</xref> found that individuals who held stronger (vs. weaker) beliefs that organ donation is a social responsibility were more likely to register as donors and to discuss with family. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0093650211424406">Park and Smith (2007)</xref> maintain that organ donation registration is a behavior individuals can enact by themselves, whereas family discussion requires others’ involvement. That is, being an organ donor can establish one’s private identity, whereas family discussion can help establish one’s public identity. Lastly, the ego-defensive function is related to the real or imagined threats. For example, although individuals could have a misconception about an open-casket funeral if they become a donor, they would mainly worry about how they would behave or perform during the family discussion.</p>
<p>In addition, Ajzen and Fishbein (2005) state that the importance of different reasoned action variables (i.e., attitudes, norms, and self-efficacy) can vary across behavioral types and groups. Similarly, the importance of attitude functions in predicting behavioral intentions can be different for the two organ donation behaviors. Based on the preceding literature review, it is hypothesized that self-monitoring would interact with the influence of the utilitarian function in predicting one’s intentions to register as a donor and to engage in family discussion. However, because family discussion requires others’ involvement and publicly expressing one’s values can help establish one’s social identity, whereas donor registration is a behavior that individuals can enact by themselves, this research specified a moderating effect of self-monitoring on the value-expressive (public identity) function and intentions to discuss with family, but a linear relationship between the value-expressive (private identity) function and intentions to register as donors. Finally, this research specified a negative relationship between the ego-defensive function and intentions to register and between the ego-defensive function and intentions to discuss with family. Thus, three hypotheses were specified for each behavior, after controlling for the influence of norms and self-efficacy.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>A total of 338 undergraduate students from a U.S. university participated in this research by completing an online survey outside class time in April 2009. The survey procedure and the questionnaire were approved by the University Human Subjects Review Committee. The participants were recruited from communication classes and from other classes in the university and received both extra credit for their participation and a chance to win 1 of the 20 cash awards. Participants were allowed 2 weeks to complete the survey at their own convenience. After deleting cases with missing responses, the final sample consisted of 306 cases (67.0% female). Among those, 86.3% were White, 5.0% were Black, 2.4% were Hispanic, 3.8% were Asian, and 2.1% reported as being multiracial or of other ethnicities. The average age of the sample was 21.9 (<italic>SD</italic> = 5.9). Regarding religious affiliations, 43.3% reported as Catholic, 25.9% reported as Christian (non-Catholic), 1.4% classified themselves as Jewish or Buddhists, and 29.4% classified themselves as nonpracticing. One hundred fifty-five participants were registered donors, and 177 discussed organ donation with their family members.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0093650211424406">
<title>Questionnaire</title>
<p>The first few questions asked the participants whether they were registered organ donors and whether they discussed their organ donation decisions or the topic with their family. Questions related to organ donation registration and questions for discussion with family were dispersed in the questionnaire.</p>
<p>Attitude functions were measured by a number of items adapted and selected from the literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0093650211424406">Horton &amp; Horton, 1991</xref>) and a beliefs and motivations solicitation survey conducted with a sample of 76 students in the same university. Although the attitude solicitation survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0093650211424406">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975</xref>) may not provide an exhaustive list of attitudinal items, it can provide the researcher with items that are most relevant to the target audience. After the main survey, these items were classified by two coders according to the definitions of the attitude functions/motivations proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093650211424406">Katz (1960)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0093650211424406">Shavitt (1990)</xref> and were further selected based on a series of confirmatory factor analyses. Preliminary examination revealed that the data did not meet the assumption of multivariate normality. The normalized Mardia’s coefficient was 23.7 for the donor registration model and 51.9 for the family discussion model. Thus, confirmatory factor analyses, based on the covariance matrix of the measurement items, were conducted using the robust maximum likelihood estimate in EQS 6.1. Final measurement items and factor structures are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0093650211424406">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0093650211424406">2</xref>. For attitude functions underlying donor registration, the fit statistics showed that the three-factor model fit the data well, Satorra-Bentler scaled (S-B) χ<sup>2</sup> (41, <italic>N</italic> = 306) = 55.6, <italic>p</italic> = .06, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = .03, 90% confidence interval (CI) of RMSEA [.00, .06], and comparative fit index (CFI) = .99. The three-factor model for family discussion also fit the data well: S-B χ<sup>2</sup> (24, <italic>N</italic> = 306) = 25.2, <italic>p</italic> = .39, RMSEA = .01, 90% CI of RMSEA [.00, .05], and CFI = 1.00. The use of different measurement items for the three attitude functions reflected the differences in the two behaviors (i.e., donor registration and family communication). All questions were assessed using a scale ranging from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 7 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>). For donor registration, alpha coefficients for the utilitarian, value-expressive, and ego-defensive functions were .81, .89, and .76, respectively. For family discussion, alpha coefficients for the utilitarian, value-expressive, and ego-defensive functions were .70, .93, and .94, respectively.</p>

<p>A direct measure of subjective norms for organ donation registration and family discussion was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0093650211424406">Ajzen (2002)</xref>: “It is expected of me to register as an organ donor,” “Most people whose opinions I value believe I should register as an organ donor,” and “Most people who are important to me believe I should register as an organ donor.” In addition, the following question was added to the scale: “My religious leaders favor/approve organ donation.” The same questions were used to measure subjective norms related to family discussion, except that “register as an organ donor” was changed to “talk to my family about organ donation.” Responses ranged from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 7 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>). Cronbach’s alphas for this scale were .85 and .90 for donor registration and family discussion, respectively.</p>
<p>Self-efficacy was measured with four questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0093650211424406">Park &amp; Smith, 2007</xref>). For organ donor registration, “I know how to register as an organ donor,” “I can register as a donor even if my family disagrees with my decision,” “I am confident I can register as an organ donor,” and “It is easy for me to register as an organ donor.” The same questions were used to measure self-efficacy for organ donation discussion except for some slight changes in wording. Responses ranged from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 7 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>). Reliability coefficients for donor registration and discussion were .86 and .97, respectively.</p>
<p>Intentions to register as organ donors through the Department of Motor Vehicles<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0093650211424406">1</xref></sup> were measured with three items adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0093650211424406">Conner and Sparks (1996)</xref>: “Thinking about the next time I apply for or renew my driver’s license, I would register as an organ donor,” “. . ., I expect to register as an organ donor,” and “. . ., it is likely that I register as an organ donor.” For family discussion, respondents were asked, “Thinking about the next month when I’m home with my family . . . ,” followed by the same three items except for some changes in wording to reflect family discussion. Scale values ranged from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic> or <italic>very unlikely</italic>) to 7 (<italic>strongly agree</italic> or <italic>very likely</italic>). Alpha coefficients for intentions to register and to discuss with family were .99 and .97, respectively.</p>

<p>For the donor registration model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0093650211424406">Table 5</xref>), subjective norms (<italic>B</italic> = 0.60, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and self-efficacy (<italic>B</italic> = 0.32, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) were positively related to intentions to register or renew in the future, whereas self-monitoring was not significant predictor.

<p>For the family discussion model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0093650211424406">Table 6</xref>), self-monitoring was not a significant predictor of intentions to discuss organ donation with their families. Subjective norms (<italic>B</italic> = 0.38, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and self-efficacy (<italic>B</italic> = 0.24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) were positively associated with intentions to discuss with family members. Hypothesis 2 predicted that after controlling for other variables, self-monitoring would interact with the utilitarian function in predicting intentions to discuss with family. The interaction term was statistically significant (<italic>B</italic> = 0.15, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), in addition to a significant main effect (<italic>B</italic> = −0.13, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, one-tailed). Analysis of simple regression slopes shows that the utilitarian function negatively predicted intentions to discuss with family for low self-monitors (1 <italic>SD</italic> below mean: <italic>B</italic> = −0.31, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), but not for high self-monitors (1 <italic>SD</italic> above the mean: <italic>B</italic> = 0.05, <italic>ns</italic>). Results also confirmed Hypothesis 4, which predicted that self-monitoring would moderate the relationship between the value-expressive function and intentions to discuss with family. Both the interaction term (<italic>B</italic> = 0.15, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and the main effect of the value-expressive function (<italic>B</italic> = 0.25, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) were significant. In this case, the value-expressive function was a positive predictor of intentions for high self-monitors (1 <italic>SD</italic> above the mean: <italic>B</italic> = 0.43, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), but not for low self-monitors (1 <italic>SD</italic> below the mean: <italic>B</italic> = 0.07, <italic>ns</italic>); that is, the regression coefficient for high self-monitors was larger than that for low self-monitors, indicating that the value-expressive function was more important for the former than for the latter. In addition, the ego-defensive function was a significant, positive predictor of intentions to discuss organ donation with family (<italic>B</italic> = 0.22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), contrary to what Hypothesis 6 predicted. Overall, the attitude function variables contributed 8.3% of the unique variance to the family discussion model, <italic>F</italic>(3, 299) = 12.04, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and the interaction terms added an additional 4.5% of the variance, <italic>F</italic>(2, 297) = 10.38, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Overall, this model explained 36.1% of the variance and was statistically significant, <italic>F</italic>(8, 297) = 20.97, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.</p>

<p>Some researchers would argue that because the first two blocks of variables in the donor registration model (vs. the family discussion model) explained a larger amount of variance in intentions, it was possible that, as a result, the interaction effects for the organ donation registration model would not add more variance to the model; that is, the interactions were not significant. However, additional analysis, including only the attitude function variables and the interaction terms, yielded consistent results as in the current analysis, although the magnitudes of regression coefficients for the three attitude functions were generally larger. The interaction effects in the donor registration model were not significant.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The major purposes of the study are to examine the more detailed attitudinal considerations and the moderating role of self-monitoring in predicting one’s intentions to perform two important organ donation–related behaviors. The present study offers both important theoretical and practical implications for organ donation campaigns and other health behavior research in general. Subjective norms and self-efficacy were significant predictors of intentions to register and to discuss organ donation with family members, which is generally consistent with the literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0093650211424406">Bresnahan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0093650211424406">Park, Smith, et al., 2009</xref>). However, results related to attitude functions and self-monitoring are new insights and deserve further discussion.</p>
<sec id="section11-0093650211424406">
<title>Theoretical Discussion</title>
<p>Based on the functional theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093650211424406">Katz, 1960</xref>) and a series of confirmatory factor analyses, this research first established the construct validity for three different attitude functions for the two behaviors, showing that the attitudinal component can be conceptualized and measured as separate constructs. Similar to the logic advocated by Park and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0093650211424406">Park, Klein, Smith, &amp; Martell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0093650211424406">Park &amp; Smith, 2007</xref>), the present research calls for a more detailed understanding of the attitudinal determinants of organ donation behaviors or health behaviors. As different attitude objects can serve different functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0093650211424406">Shavitt, 1990</xref>) or have different appraisal patterns, the exact reasons behind the functions can be different and should be modeled based on an extensive literature review and/or an attitude solicitation survey. For example, for the utilitarian function, the reasons for (not) being an organ donor is related to the potential inconvenience for the family of the deceased or that organ donation is not directly or indirectly compensated, whereas the motivation for not discussing with family is mainly related to the use of time and inconvenience. That is, the use of attitude functions in the TRA research avoids simplification; on the other hand, it helps classify these attitudinal components into different categories and provides a more generalized understanding of the psychological functions underlying health and communicative behaviors.</p>
<p>The present research revealed that the use of attitude functions to predict behavioral intentions yielded different patterns of results for the two organ donation behaviors, especially in conjunction with self-monitoring. Self-monitoring moderated the influence of the utilitarian function in predicting intention to engage in family discussion, whereas it was not a significant moderator in the donor registration model. For the benefits or costs of organ donation registration and discussion, the former is related to the basic, intrinsic “punishments” that might happen to oneself, whereas the latter is associated with the many costs or lack of benefits that might occur to one’s family after one’s death. Currently, it seems that the interaction may be observed only in situations where the utilitarian aspect is closely related to oneself. Previous research dealing with the utilitarian aspect of behaviors often focuses on intrinsic benefits and punishments for oneself. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0093650211424406">Wang’s (2009)</xref> research on physical activity intentions measured the utilitarian function based on items related to improving individuals’ own health and making themselves feel more energetic. Thus, the finding for the family discussion model is consistent with the research that has a self-focus. However, whether the utilitarian function–related benefits or costs for others can interact with self-monitoring should be dealt with in future research.</p>
<p>In addition, results show a significant interaction effect of self-monitoring and the value-expressive function only in the family discussion model, but not in the donor registration model. The distinction between the self and social aspects of the two behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0093650211424406">Park &amp; Smith, 2007</xref>) is a plausible explanation: As family discussion about organ donation is a behavior that one enacts with family members and helps establish one’s public, social identity and helps express one’s values, the value-expressive function is more important for high self-monitors than for low self-monitors. On the other hand, although organ donation registration is guided by one’s values and is one way for individuals to establish their private identity, it is not enacted through expressing their values to others. Thus, self-monitoring, a construct related to one’s desire and tendency to monitor others’ reactions and expressive behaviors, does not matter.</p>
<p>A counterintuitive result emerged for the relationship between the ego-defensive function and intentions to discuss organ donation with family members, showing that thinking that discussion is embarrassing or that family discussion would give the respondents a hard time explaining themselves was positively related to behavioral intentions. As a cross-sectional survey, this research cannot establish the causal link or time order between the two variables. It is possible that those who plan to discuss with family are cued to think about the potential behavioral consequences in an ego-defensive way, whereas those who do not have such plans would not encounter such thoughts.</p>

<sec id="section12-0093650211424406">
<title>Practical Implications for Health Campaign Design</title>
<p>This study holds a number of practical implications for organ donation and other health behaviors. The traditional reasoned action approach focuses on a general attitudinal measure or the beliefs that are associated with attitudes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0093650211424406">Ajzen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0093650211424406">Fishbein &amp; Cappella, 2006</xref>). The general attitudinal measure shows whether the performance or nonperformance of the behavior is good, pleasant, or enjoyable and does not address the underlying reasons that predict intentions. Thus, the general attitudinal measure provides limited insights on what to address in health messages, unless additional analysis of beliefs is performed. The use of beliefs that differentiate high and low intenders could yield a high number of belief items, and the inclusion of some or all of these belief items in health messages can be tedious. The attitude functions approach to classify the motivations can provide a more organized, parsimonious way to understand the functions behind intentions. In addition, previous research has found that if the messages address the motivations or attitude functions that one holds, the messages are more persuasive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093650211424406">Petty et al., 2000</xref>) and are considered to be of high quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0093650211424406">Hullett, 2002</xref>). This is potentially another reason why it is important to use attitude functions in formative research to guide health message design.</p>
<p>Campaigns aiming to enhance behavioral intentions for the two organ donation behaviors might need to focus on different variables. First, for family discussion about organ donation, campaign planners might need to consider the characteristics of high and low self-monitors because different approaches would be successful for them. Thus, for any given campaign to promote family discussion, it is recommended to include both utilitarian and social identity appeals and elements that would attract high and low self-monitors. Second, the present research revealed a negative relationship between the utilitarian function of donor registration and intentions to register. Although the results are consistent with the Gallup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0093650211424406">Gallup Organization, 2005</xref>) Survey that approximately one fifth of the respondents preferred financial assistance for donor’s family, it is against the IOM report’s recommendation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093650211424406">2006</xref>) which states that financial incentives should not be provided because paying for organ donation might “cause a drop in donation for altruistic reasons.” However, because the utilitarian function of donor registration is based on perceived inconvenience as well, organ procurement organization requesters now provide emotional support and help avoid delaying the funeral process in order to minimize the potential punishments.</p>
<p>Although the use of the functional approach in formative research can provide insights regarding what needs to be addressed in campaigns, it does not provide a definite answer regarding how to manipulate attitude functions in messages. Previous research and theorizing reveals that in order to facilitate one’s behavioral intentions to register as a donor and to discuss organ donation with family, it is necessary to change the values underlying the value-expressive function (e.g., altruism) by addressing altruistic values in messages or suggesting that nonregistration is incompatible with one’s values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0093650211424406">Hullett, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093650211424406">Katz, 1960</xref>). Moreover, it is important to address the ego-defensive function, which is usually expressed in a form of apathy or withdrawal. As the ego-defensive function does not respond to external rewards or punishments, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093650211424406">Katz (1960)</xref> advocated the removal of threats (e.g., relieving people of fear or misconceptions about organ donation). In addition, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0093650211424406">Steele (1988)</xref> suggests, when individuals believe that they have a high level of self-integrity, they are less prone to the ego-defensive function and are more likely to adopt the proposed behavior. Thus, it might help if the messages and interpersonal communication can enhance one’s overall self-integrity. However, how to successfully use appeals related to attitude functions is a reasonable extension and is beyond the scope of this present research.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>A number of limitations should be acknowledged. First, the relationships found in the present research may not be generalized to other populations because this research was based on a convenience sample of college students. However, it should be noted that the sample for this project is defensible from the perspectives of theory building and the internal validity of the relationships among the variables (vs. external validity). As theory building is based on a falsification procedure, a good, generalizable theory should be able to survive a test using a student sample. Theories that survive repeated falsification tests are then accepted as scientific explanation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093650211424406">Calder, Phillips, &amp; Tybout, 1981</xref>). In addition, if the purpose of the research is to examine the relationships among the variables, a homogeneous sample is preferred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0093650211424406">Shadish, Cook, &amp; Campbell, 2002</xref>). A diverse sample, on the other hand, can introduce a number of moderating variables (e.g., education) that interact with the relationship under examination. Similar to this notion, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0093650211424406">Morgan (2008)</xref> observed that campaigns directed to university communities and workplaces were more successful than those directed to the general public. Morgan stated that failing to recognize and control for audience segmentation in structural modeling analysis may be the reason for the “less than impressive results” found in the analysis of willingness to donate. Last, a number of scholars state that college students are an important target group for organ donation campaigns (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0093650211424406">Bresnahan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0093650211424406">Morgan &amp; Miller, 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0093650211424406">Park &amp; Smith, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0093650211424406">Feeley (2007)</xref> noted that college students closely fit the demographic profile of those who are likely to register as donors and that college students are better candidates for organ donation because they are young and healthy and are more likely than other age groups to encounter untimely death because of their risky behaviors. Finally, previous research revealed a similar pattern between student samples and a more diverse sample (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0093650211424406">Kopfman &amp; Smith, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0093650211424406">Morgan &amp; Miller, 2002b</xref>). Nevertheless, future organ donation research should extend the integration of attitude functions and the integrative model using a more diverse sample because other groups (e.g., working adults, African Americans) are also important groups to the success of organ donation campaigns. In addition, similar to Ajzen and Fishbein’s (2005) notion that the influence of the variables specified in the integrative model on intentions varies across different populations, different attitude functions might guide behavioral intentions for different groups of target audience. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0093650211424406">Park, Shin, and Yun (2009)</xref> found that ethnicities (White vs. Asian) moderated the relationships between social responsibilities and intentions to register and between individual right and intentions to register. It is thus important to examine whether the relationships found in the present project are generalizable to other segments of the populations, especially other ethnicities.</p>
<p>Second, this project relied on a cross-sectional survey and did not establish the cause-effect relationship. This needs to be dealt with using experimental studies or longitudinal surveys. Third, the data were collected through an online survey. Although the problem is not unique to online survey research, the use of online surveys does not have control over how participants respond to survey questions; for example, participants might engage in other activities while completing the survey. Finally, this study focuses on behavioral intentions and does not address the impact of attitude functions on the actual behavior. Future research could also consider the inclusion of a behavioral measure.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the present research has revealed different relationship patterns of attitude functions, norms, and self-efficacy on intentions to register as organ donors and to discuss organ donation with family members. As self-monitoring moderates the influence of the utilitarian and value-expressive functions on intentions in the family discussion model, future research might need to consider the distinction between behaviors that have a self or other focus and a social or private identity focus. Overall, the results exemplify the importance of addressing the more detailed attitudinal constructs and the use of self-monitoring in predicting behavioral intentions, which can also be extended to other communicative and health behaviors.</p>

<p>The present research focused on designating one’s decision on the driver’s license because it was the primary method to register in the state where the research was conducted and was most relatable to the respondents. In addition, the Gallup Survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0093650211424406">Gallup Organization, 2005</xref>) revealed that 53.2% of the respondents were registered donors, 52.1% granted permission on their driver’s licenses (although some of them signed donor cards and joined a state registry as well), and only 1.1% of the respondents granted permissions on their donor cards or through joining a state registry only.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0093650211424406">Lennox and Wolfe’s (1984)</xref> revised scale focuses on sensitivity to others’ expressive behavior (i.e., self-monitoring) and the ability to adjust one’s own behaviors (i.e., self-adaption). As the present research does not address the behavioral consequences and only examined how individuals motivate to process the environmental and social cues, it used the scale related to the sensitivity component. On the other hand, evidence shows that the ability to adjust one’s behaviors and expressions, not sensitivity, predicted overall compliance and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0093650211424406">Key, Edlund, Sagarin, &amp; Bizer, 2009</xref>).</p>
