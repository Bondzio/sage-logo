<abstract>
<p>Since 2001, the Commission of the European Union has instigated Peer Reviews to help countries preparing to accede to the European Union. Added to this has been the provision of workshops and individual expert inputs. This article recounts the experiences of the author in this process. It focuses on how a single directive has revealed major ethical challenges for nurses, their national associations and state governments as they seek to implement the changes required. In particular a sub-agenda has emerged relating to general education, access to higher education and the position of women in these countries. The ethical challenges include freedom to practice and creation of competent authorities to provide proper oversight of the health care professions. In 2011, the directive is being reviewed and this article offers arguments for its continuation, even in an unreformed state.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In 2001, the European Union (EU) consisted of Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark, Ireland, United Kingdom, Greece, Spain, Portugal, Austria, Finland and Sweden, plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, known as the European Economic Area (EEA). The European Free Trade Area (EFTA) includes the countries of the EEA and Switzerland. These countries all undertook to comply with the EU directives on nurse training agreed in 1977<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733011404587">1</xref>
</sup> and implemented from 1979 onwards. In November of 2001 I was asked to lead some of the Peer Reviews to the countries wishing to join the EU. This is a mechanism whereby, a team of experts from within the EU visit their equivalents in accession country to advise on changes required to achieve compliance with EU legislation. Until 2004, I led reviews in 10 out of the 12 applicant countries. In 2004 the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia joined the EU, while Romania and Bulgaria were delayed until 2007. At that point the EU consisted of 27 countries, with a population of 495.3<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733011404587">2</xref>
</sup> million inhabitants, and approximately four million registered nurses. The number will be addressed below.</p>
<p>In geographic terms, the EU stretches from the Northern ice-cap to the Southern Mediterranean littoral, from the west coast of Ireland, to the borders of Russia, Ukraine and the Black Sea. It extends even beyond that because of the countries aligned with EU member states; which includes Madeira in the central Atlantic and French Guyana in South America. There are also other accession countries emerging. These include Turkey, Croatia and Macedonia and will soon be joined by Montenegro, Serbia and Albania. Beyond that is what is known as the neighbourhood countries and these range from Moldova and Jordan round to Tunisia. The accession countries and the neighbourhood grouping all aspire to achieve conformity with the EU directives, which includes those relating to nursing. The picture therefore is one in which legislation agreed in 1977 with amendments since then, has become the basis of the single largest reform of nursing ever undertaken.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0969733011404587">
<title>Background</title>
<p>To understand some of the ethical and moral issues that have emerged in this process, it is important to outline the legal framework and expectations associated with the EU directives on nursing. At the point of accession to the EU, an applicant country has to have demonstrated that it has achieved compliance with over 4600 directives and associated treaties that have come into existence during the development of the EU, known as the ‘acquis communautaire’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733011404587">3</xref>
</sup> It should have passed the necessary legislation, and as English is the language used for the accession process, made the necessary translation into English and lodged it with the relevant Directorate in Brussels before accession is complete. It has therefore a number of stages to complete. Transposition is the process of ensuring the adoption in the corpus of national law of all the relevant EU legislation. The next step is implementation: making sure that this new national legislation will actually work and continue to work in practice. Finally, there is the issue of sustainability and concerns the culture change required to ensure that the legislation is lived out and not circumvented. Even the first two stages are rarely achieved in full and therefore, at the very least, the timescale and resources for its implementation must be identified, and the date by which the legislation will be fully applicable. Every one of these processes throws up its own problems and they vary from country to country. It is important to recognize that the path to compliance is disjunctive and requires support and oversight at every stage.</p>
<p>To facilitate this, the EU provides support in a number of different ways under the banner of TAIEX (Technical Assistance and Information Exchange).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733011404587">4</xref>
</sup> Its aim is institution building, and it does this by supporting workshops, study visits, and more detailed reviews and working groups, to support the development of the draft legislation and to help determine change processes through the exchange of best practice. A further instrument operated by TAIEX is Twinning,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733011404587">5</xref>
</sup> whereby, a mandated institution (i.e. an organization approved for this purpose) is funded to create a team to work in an accession country for a more extended period of time to help address a particular area of change and development.</p>
<p>All this work is captured in numerous chapters of the Accession Treaty that identifies the terms on which the country is joining the EU. It also provides the spine around which the monitoring and implementation is undertaken. Approval to join the EU comes from the Council of Ministers following the recommendation of the European Commission and approval by a vote of the European Parliament. Despite what appears to be a very well structured and supported mechanism for managing the accession process, the Commission has become concerned about the actual details of compliance in a number of fields, including nursing. Consequently, in 2010 several countries from the ‘older’ EU are responding to citations from the Commission about aspects of how they manage the process of compliance in their countries. This is the legal process by which the European Commission starts the process of bringing a country to court for failure to apply appropriately the legislation it has claimed has been transposed and implemented. Essentially this focuses on the way in which competent authorities/ regulatory bodies, also known as ‘Chambers’ undertake their work and fulfil the requirements of the directive.</p>
<p>To understand the issues around nursing, it is important to recognize that the EU directives, including those applying to nursing, have been put in place to achieve four fundamental freedoms. They concern the ability of:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>goods,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>capital,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>services,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>and people and labour,</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>to move freely. Therefore, the directives as they have evolved concerning nursing, have not been put in place to help to achieve excellence in practice, raise the quality of care, or even ensure patient safety, but are there to help achieve these four freedoms. To that end, the current directive which came into force in 2005 (2005/36/EC),<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733011404587">6</xref>
</sup> requires harmonization as the baseline for recognition at pre-qualification level in general, or adult nursing, and mutual recognition for all other areas of nursing education and practice. For the sake of clarity, it is important to say that while the Bologna Process<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733011404587">7</xref>
</sup> often raises its head during this work, it is not part of the EU legislative framework and is not a requirement of the compliance need to join the EU. It is a separate activity initiated in 1999 and by 2010 involving 47 countries in Europe. It underpins the establishment of the European Higher Education Area and the European Qualification Framework. All of this can facilitate the implementation of the directive, but are separate to it.<sup>

<title>Some ethical issues</title>
<p>It may seem difficult to believe that in a system that is so regulated, if not rigid in its application, moral issues could arise. This assumption is inherently false because in so many of the accession countries, the legal systems of previous communist states legalized a number of things of questionable morality, especially in the fields of human freedoms and rights. These included limitations on free-speech, access to information, even in the academic fields and constraints on the freedom to practice a profession. Despite that history, one could argue, that if a country applies to join the EU, it is fully aware of the legal requirements and that any problems would be essentially legal and procedural.</p>
<p>The process of Peer Review has demonstrated a second agenda that is possibly of greater importance than straightforward legal compliance. Early on in the process of undertaking these reviews, it became apparent that there were a number of conflicting agendas. A government would want to join the EU, but would be surprised that it would have to reform the training of a number of the professions that held high status in their country. Reforming the professions was perceived to be a slight on the national pride. This reform often went beyond the profession itself, as the directive requires basic minimums of general education which were often not in place in those countries. Many governments were surprised to discover that the implementation of the directive would give an individual particular rights that they could demand their government to comply with, and which had not been in the national legislation previously. What for a national government started out as a comparatively simple exercise, i.e. achieving EU compliance for the health care professions, could and did on occasions, degenerate into a political and moral nightmare in some countries. It is worth examining some of these issues in a little more detail. The question is, what makes these ethical issues?</p>
<p>Pride in the professions seems to rest on a highly developed sense of a particular nation’s way of producing people in the profession being better than anywhere else. I have been told on more than one occasion when advising a government that the mechanisms for developing a profession in that country would have to change if they wished to comply with the sectoral directive 2005/36/EC and, that I should not worry about it because, as soon as their country joins the EU, they will bring all the other countries up their particular nation’s standards. This would be farcical, if it had not happened repeatedly. Discussions with government representatives reveal that this comment arises from two sources of motivation: to re-assert the excellence of their own country’s methods of training, despite evidence to the contrary; and the political awareness of the implications of changing the systems currently in existence.</p>
<p>The counter to this is the experience of working with the national nurses associations (NNAs). Many of the NNAs have been ahead of their governments in lobbying for reforms to comply with the directive, as it was clear to them that it would benefit patients, the profession, and society as a whole. This sets up the accession process as one of potential conflict and challenge, which the TAIEX Peer Review system was designed to avoid. Such conflicts have emerged and in some instances have yet to be resolved, even in countries now in full membership with the EU.</p>
<p>The ethical issue here is comparatively straight forward. In an electronically connected world, both individuals and professionals have often come to recognize, some time ahead of their political leaders, that they have a right to better forms of care and access to skill development to facilitate the delivery of that care. National politicians, looking much more to an internal constituency, seem generally to be unaware of the degree of change in health care and are surprised that such a duty can be laid upon them by an external organization like the EU. Even more, individual citizens would have the right to sue their own government in the European courts. The reaction has almost invariably been to find solutions that minimize the degree of change attempted internally while demonstrating the required degree of compliance to the EU Commission. NNAs in many countries have taken the moral line that citizens of their countries deserve better than the level of service available at present. This has led to a number of difficult situations as politicians have been confronted by this and found that they are being lobbied not just within their country, but through international bodies and networks that they have never had to take cognisance of previously. Pressing for such change is therefore not just a professional or individual matter, but is often perceived by ruling parties as a party political issue in their country, thus revealing another layer of complexity in the negotiation process. The moral right to better care, which is the norm in western Europe is thereby transformed into a local political issue with the progenitors of the proposals being perceived to be anti-government. In countries where living with democracy is a recent phenomenon, there are marked totalitarian concerns about how this might effect both organizations and individuals and it has required enormous personal and corporate courage to continue to pursue these issues.</p>
<p>The reform of the system of general education in the accession countries, to ensure that nurses and midwives had sufficient general education to undertake modern forms of nursing and midwifery training, has been deeply contentious. In much of central Europe the system has been one in which children could expect eight years of education before a decision was taken about their future somewhere around the age of 14. At that point, they might be judged bright enough to proceed to a ‘gymnasium’ type of education, which would give them the opportunity to continue their education ultimately in university. Alternatively, it could be decided that they should now begin the practical part of their education, which would lead to entry to such applied professions as nursing and midwifery approximately aged 18. This division can be catastrophic in some countries because it prevents access into university even for further education and training later in life, i.e. no vertical progression in knowledge and skill acquisition. Universities and countries defend with pride the system they perceive to have served them well over many generations and are often mystified that other countries, and the EU in general, does not see their education system for these professions as being adequate, or indeed excellent. This division at the age of fourteen has major consequences for individuals. If they come from a family where entry to university has not occurred in the past, achieving it is not considered important. However, the approach to nursing and midwifery has changed so dramatically in most of the EU in the last thirty years that access to higher education has become an expectation based on the increased complexity of health care delivery. The NNAs know this, but not their governments, where it is rare to have adequate involvement of nurses and midwives in policy development or delivery.</p>
<p>The ethical issue here is profound. It comes as a shock to many countries that their much loved and long-existing education method is not adequate to train people entering professions as ‘humble’ as nursing and midwifery. This is in part because of the way that the roles of other professionals, especially doctors, are played out. Observing medical practice in many of these countries is a sharp reminder of how far the professions of nursing and midwifery have developed elsewhere. It is also complicated by what might be seen as major over-provision of doctors, indicating that both practice and wages bills are skewed towards medical practice. To complicate matters further, patients automatically assume that doctors will undertake certain practices and have yet to develop a level of awareness or trust that other health care professional might do this. There is often also a strong sense that what was good enough for a previous generation is good enough for this one, amounting to an attitude of ‘who do they think they are to ask for such change.’</p>
<p>With these challenges in mind, it is difficult to convey the thought that failure to provide rather more general education (10-years required by directive 2005/36/EC, or 12-years as recommended by the WHO<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733011404587">9</xref>
</sup>) has profound implications not just for the professions concerned, but also for their societies. Without data to support this, it has been pointed out time and time again that the gender of the university is predominantly male. This is therefore a question of human rights. Women seem to be signally disadvantaged by this. With that go all the assumptions about family life, the health of the family and community, and the modelling of education and professional opportunities for future generations. It is easy to conclude that this is a vicious cycle in need of being broken. For many nurses and midwives in central Europe, that is exactly what the implementation of this directive represents. It is therefore not just a way of changing the nature of the profession for the good of society. It is also a way of achieving better education and development for a disadvantaged half of the population. This is major change in what are often still, from a western European perspective, unthinkingly chauvinistic societies. It is not deliberate; it is simply unawareness and is why the negotiation of the implementation of this directive is so complex and difficult. It demands a change of attitude in a field of understanding where many people, men and women, had not previously thought about the implications of what was currently going on.</p>
<p>The directive also gives the ‘right of establishment’ to individuals in countries where such rights have often never been considered. The implications of this right are profound and go well beyond simply having the right to set up a business utilising one’s professional qualifications and status. Most importantly, it places individuals in a position where they no longer work solely in a delegated manner, that is, they are not dependent on someone else telling them what to do, or giving them permission or instructions to do it. In health care settings where this has been the norm, to assert that nurses or midwives have the right to work according to their own judgements is a profound challenge. This is why the establishments of ‘Chambers’ or regulatory bodies/competent authorities, is a key issue. Individuals can work independently if there are structures to hold them accountable if they are endangering individuals or working outside the framework of the agreed professional codes. The non-existence of such bodies and their associated codes of practice and conduct has to be remedied if compliance with this directive is to be achieved. Doing so often presents the greatest challenge to the implementation of the directive in the accession countries</p>
<p>The ethical issue here is that this change clarifies what is often very woolly thinking about public safety in health care and the mechanisms currently in place in a country to hold members of professions accountable. While nurses and midwives may have concerns about the safety of their own practice, in many countries there existed only a limited mechanism of supervision and enforcement. In other countries, where mechanisms to hold health care professionals accountable did exist, they were mostly unreliable and non-transparent.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969733011404587">10</xref>
</sup> This, in part, accounts for why the number of registered nurses, or indeed other health care professionals in the EU, remains an approximation. This is compounded by the lack of national workforce strategies and freedom for training institutions to recruit the numbers they consider appropriate for themselves rather than in response to the stated requirements of the state.</p>
<p>The social expectation has not been one in which individuals have been held personally accountable, especially when, until so recently, many of these countries were non-democratic and not open to such individual exposure of wrong doing. The awarding of such rights and duties is a major social shift, as well as being a public assertion of the rights of patients when receiving health care. The relationship between enhanced patient rights and the enhanced rights of health care staff is one that requires time to permeate the public consciousness, and that is on-going.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This article is a case study that underlines the truth of the old axiom that every decision has a moral consequence. What was at first perceived to be principally a major administrative headache (i.e. how to achieve peer reviews across all the accession countries) has turned into a powerful process of change in which human rights, such as dignity and safety, have come to the fore. It has acted to illuminate both democratic deficits and cultural differences that had the potential to cause strife and deep hurt. What is exciting about the process is the way in which the professions of nursing and midwifery across Europe have grown closer as they tried to comprehend and then support each other in the work of transposition. The EU Commission’s decisions in 2010 to cite a number of western European countries for breaches in the application of directive 2005/36/EC underlines the shared problems engendered by this directive for all EU countries. It is an ambitious piece of legislation, and one that challenges every nation to develop ways of harmonizing its professional training programmes and establishing systems of mutual recognition.</p>
<p>Not addressed in these terms, but embedded in this process, is the implicit nature of the beliefs that underpin the EU and its actions. While the European Commission focuses on the four freedoms, the way in which they are addressed and implemented carry a number of significant assumptions. At one level, the assumptions can be described as quasi-universal in so much as the existence and implementation of directives suggests that they are better than the alternatives. The emphasis on community suggests that what the majority are doing is the best way to do things. Equally, there is an argument about individual rights and justice which has challenged accession countries as their history of social control is thrown into complete reverse by the granting of legal positions to individuals that the state has not previously tolerated. In this scenario it is difficult to confirm what norms may be prevalent as the NNAs have often struggled long before the democratic reforms were effected in these countries, to establish standards of care reflected in statements from the International Council of Nurses and the World Health Organisation. The knowledge of norms external to the individual country has often been the driver to pursue reform by health care professionals. This form of universalism has been set against the political, local constituency pressure of politicians, even when the politicians were themselves health care professionals and were aware of what standards were considered normative in the wider world. This in reality has been the ethical battleground for many health care professionals and the directive has often been the field on which it has been fought out.</p>
<p>In 2010, the European Commission launched its review of the directive, with decisions to be reached before the end of 2012 about any changes needed to its content or structure and indeed about its very continuance. In a limited number of western European countries there is a wish to see changes to achieve modernization of the content of training and greater alignment with the processes of the Bologna Declaration. Questions are also being raised about how the directive and the European Qualification Framework<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733011404587">11</xref>
</sup> can be made to mesh more closely. In much of central Europe, the directive is not seen to be in need of amendment, but in need of implementation. Even in its current state, it has the potential to achieve radical reform of health services and professional practice. The final ethical reflection is on the tension between those two positions, giving rise to the question, ‘how can reforms be achieved that will satisfy the wishes of all parties?’ This directive is such a powerful tool for the reform of nursing and midwifery in countries that have not enjoyed the status or development of some western European countries, it is imperative that reformers tread very carefully, or their colleagues elsewhere may come to rue the demands for change, which have the potential to put even the moderate requirements of the current directive outside the reach of many colleagues in central Europe.</p>
