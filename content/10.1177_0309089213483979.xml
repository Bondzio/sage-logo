<p>When the Tetragrammaton began to be read as <italic>Adonai</italic> is the subject of significant debate. While κύριoς in the Old Greek may be important evidence for this euphemism, many continue to doubt whether κύριoς is original to the Old Greek. In this article, the unique value of the double title ‭הוהי‬ ‭ינדא‬ is established in tracing the euphemism in question, and the replacement of ‭הוהי‬ ‭ינדא‬ of 2 Samuel with ‭םיהלא‬ ‭הוהי‬ in Chronicles is presented as early evidence of the euphemism. Thus the reading <italic>Adonai</italic> for the Tetragrammaton appears to have begun considerably earlier than is commonly thought.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>When did Jews begin to read the Tetragrammaton as <italic>Adonai?</italic> Scholars have long debated when this particular euphemism for the ineffable name of God began.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0309089213483979">1</xref></sup> The most notable evidence for the <italic>Adonai</italic> euphemism is probably κύριoς, a Greek rendition of the Tetragrammaton found in most Old Greek manuscripts, which might date this euphemism as far back as the third century <sc>bce</sc>. However, it is heavily debated whether κύριoς in fact was original to the Old Greek. In this article, instead, the Chronicler's replacement of Samuel's ‭הוהי‬ ‭ינדא‬ with ‭םיהלא‬ ‭הוהי‬ is presented as early evidence of the use of <italic>Adonai</italic> as a surrogate for the Tetragrammaton.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0309089213483979">
<title>2. Review of Evidence</title>
<p>Let me begin my discussion by briefly reviewing known evidence of the euphemism. In Jewish sources, the official prohibition against pronouncing the name ‭הוהי‬ is found in the Babylonian Talmud, thus no earlier than the sixth century CE: ‘Not as I am written am I pronounced. I am written <italic>yod he vav he</italic>, and I am pronounced <italic>alef dalet’</italic> (<italic>b. Kid</italic>. 71a; <italic>b. Pes</italic>. 50a). But this of course does not mean that the name ‭הוהי‬ was freely pronounced before this. The Mishnah informs us that the practice goes back to the second century <sc>bce</sc>. Kohler summarizes:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>From Sifre to Num. vi. 27, Mishnah Tamid, vii. 2, and Soṭah, vii. 6 it appears that the priests were allowed to pronounce the Name at the benediction only in the Temple; elsewhere they were obliged to use the appellative name <italic>(kinnuy)</italic> ‘Adonai’… Pronunciation of the Name by the Temple priests also gradually fell into disuse. Tosef., Soṭah, xiii. 8, quoted Menaḥot, 109<italic>b</italic>, and Yoma, 39b, relates that ‘from the time Simon the Just died, the priests refrained from blessing the people with the Name’… Subsequently also the solemn utterance of the Name by the high priest on the Day of Atonement, that ought to have been heard by the priests and the people, according to the Mishnah Yoma, vi. 2, became inaudible or indistinct.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0309089213483979">2</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Evidence from Qumran appears to back up this general tendency for the reverence given to the solemn name. The Tetragrammaton was frequently replaced by a more generic divine title<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0309089213483979">3</xref></sup> or received special treatment. A piece of evidence directly related to the <italic>Adonai</italic> euphemism is found in the great Isaiah scroll (1QIsa<sup>a</sup>), dated from the first century <sc>bce</sc>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0309089213483979">4</xref></sup> There, one finds a phenomenon that appears to reveal scribal confusion between ‭ינדא‬ and ‭הוהי‬.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0309089213483979">5</xref></sup> Where the <sc>mt</sc> reads either ‭ינדא‬ or ‭הוהי‬, this scroll frequently deviates from the <sc>mt</sc>, causing numerous subsequent corrections.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0309089213483979">6</xref></sup> The confusion between ‭ינדא‬ and ‭הוהי‬ is further illustrated by two notable cases in which the scribe, initially having written a yod, indicative of ‭הוהי‬, then wrote over it with ‭ינדא‬ (6.1; 7.20).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0309089213483979">7</xref></sup> Had the scribes not read the Tetragrammaton as <italic>Adonai</italic>, such confusion is hardly explicable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0309089213483979">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Above all, κύριoς, the Greek translation of the Tetragrammaton, if proven as the Old Greek translation of ‭ינדא‬, ‘my Lord’, is potentially the most important and earliest evidence for the <italic>Adonai</italic> euphemism. Scholars have debated, however, whether κύριoς is original to the Old Greek. Text critics as early as Origen<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0309089213483979">9</xref></sup> have taken notice of the fact that some early Greek manuscripts do not employ κύριoς. The first use of κύριoς, according to Tov's list, occurs only with P. Baden 56b, dated to the second century CE.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0309089213483979">10</xref></sup> Instead, most early Greek manuscripts employ some other special renditions of the Tetragrammaton.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0309089213483979">11</xref></sup> Famous examples include the Tetragrammaton in Hebrew square script by the second hand (P. Fouad 266b<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0309089213483979">12</xref></sup>), the Tetragrammaton written in paleo-Hebrew script found in the Minor Prophets scroll of Nahal Hever (8HevXIIgr<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0309089213483979">13</xref></sup>), IAΩ, the Greek transliteration of ‭הוהי‬ (4QLXXLev<sup>b</sup><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0309089213483979">14</xref></sup>), and the blank space (P. Fouad 266b<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0309089213483979">15</xref></sup>) or four dots (1QIsa<sup>a</sup><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0309089213483979">16</xref></sup>) written in place of the sacred name. With the sensational display of these special treatments, coupled with the startling lack of evidence of the use of κύριoς in early Greek manuscripts, specialists now tend to see κύριoς as the result of later standardization rather than as the original translation of the Old Greek.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0309089213483979">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recently, however, Pietersma has challenged this view and argued afresh for the originality of κύριoς.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0309089213483979">18</xref></sup> His argument is that the Tetragrammaton in paleo-Hebrew was a later development, influenced by an archaizing and Hebraizing tendency during the second century <sc>bce</sc>. He first examines the evidence for special treatment and concludes that most of the evidence cited is recensional and has little right to represent the Old Greek.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0309089213483979">19</xref></sup> Then he surveys the Greek Pentateuch and cites two cases in which ‭הוהי‬ ‭ינדא‬ was translated δέσπoτα κύρι∊ (Gen 15.2, 8). This is significant for Pietersma because the translator hardly needs to employ the unusual δέσπoτα for ‭ינדא‬ which is usually rendered as κύριoς.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0309089213483979">20</xref></sup> This makes sense only if ‭הוהי‬ were already translated as κύριoς/κύρι∊, which would render this double title redundant. To be sure, Pietersma made an impressive case for the originality of κύριoς, but his claim must be taken with reservation insofar as only the Pentateuch is surveyed. Not surprisingly, a few years later John Wevers wrote a response and demonstrated that Pietersma's observation regarding the Greek Pentateuch is not matched in the Greek Psalter.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0309089213483979">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Citing Wevers, De Troyer also rejected Pietersma's contention and instead argued that θ∊ός was the original Old Greek rendering of the Tetragrammaton and that κύριoς became standard only after <italic>Adonai</italic> was used more extensively.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0309089213483979">22</xref></sup> De Troyer's argument is based on evidence from actual manuscripts, and her main case rests on P. Fouad 266a and 266c, dated to the first century <sc>bce</sc>, which boast the use of θ∊ός as the rendition of the Tetragrammaton. This is important since there is no earlier Greek manuscript that preserves κύριoς.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0309089213483979">23</xref></sup> Therefore, De Troyer seems justified in claiming that these are ‘maybe a trail of an older tradition’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0309089213483979">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recently in this journal, Rösel defended the originality of κύριoς by means of an exegetical observation in the Greek Pentateuch.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0309089213483979">25</xref></sup> He demonstrated that the Greek translators made a careful choice between κύριoς and θ∊ός out of theological considerations, and the carefully refined manner in which they chose the appropriate translation undermines the claim that κύριoς is a product of a mechanical redaction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0309089213483979">26</xref></sup> Yet he had to leave the enigmatic use of IAΩ in 4QLXXLev<sup>b</sup> a ‘mystery’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0309089213483979">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>The foregoing survey demonstrates that the use of κύριoς itself cannot provide definitive ground for the <italic>Adonai</italic> euphemism. While some circumstantial evidence suggests the originality of κύριoς (such as δέσπoτα κύρι∊ cited by Pietersma), early Greek manuscripts point in another direction. At the same time, the lack of evidence from earlier witnesses does not categorically disprove the possibility of an original κύριoς, because all the extant witnesses are anyhow much later than the supposed date of the Old Greek. Thus, responsible text critics must acknowledge the tentative nature of the present state of information available to us.</p>
<p>Above all, most of these arguments are based, albeit implicitly, on an unstated assumption that there was <italic>one</italic> original Greek rendition of the Tetragrammaton. In my judgment, it is equally plausible and more practical to posit that there were multiple, competing renditions—of course including κύριoς, θ∊ός, and other special forms—among which κύριoς later happened to emerge as a dominant rendition.</p>
<p>Rather than trying to prove the elusive originality of κύριoς, I here present a piece of evidence that has not been included in the current debate, a case from Chronicles that would predate the κύριoς of the Old Greek. With this, what I claim is, again, not an ultimate vindication for the originality of κύριoς. I intend simply to add one more piece of evidence to the already complex picture and to suggest that the <italic>Adonai</italic> euphemism, regardless of the originality of κύριoς to the Old Greek, might have a long history.</p>

<title>3. The Case of ‭הוהי‬ ‭ינדא‬</title>
<p>The double title ‭הוהי‬ ‭ינדא‬ affords a unique opportunity in the tracing of the practice of replacing ‭הוהי‬ with <italic>Adonai</italic>. As soon as ‭הוהי‬ is read as <italic>Adonai</italic>, this double title causes an awkward reading: <italic>Adonai Adonai</italic>. Ways of avoiding the redundancy have been devised, and the one that eventually became part of the Masoretic tradition, the perpetual Qere, was to read it as <italic>Adonai Elohim</italic>, which is evinced in the Qere vowel pointing ‭הִוהֱייָנידֲא‬ in the <sc>mt</sc>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0309089213483979">28</xref></sup> True, this Qere belongs to the Masoretic tradition and is thereby quite late in itself, but one cannot neglect the possibility that this preserves an ancient practice that is much older than the Masoretes; in fact, this article is an attempt to prove that. Now, one can theorize that when the Tetragrammaton was still pronounced, ‭הוהי‬ ‭ינדא‬ would have caused no problem in its transmission, whereas when the solemn name began to be read as <italic>Adonai</italic>, the transmission of this double title would have become a problem. If so, the <italic>Adonai</italic> euphemism can be traced by examining how ‭הוהי‬ ‭ינדא‬ is rendered in textual transmission—that is, whether it is faithfully retained or altered to a form that reflects an attempt to avoid the putative redundancy. ‭הוהי‬ ‭ינדא‬, ‘my Lord Y<sc>HWH</sc>’, is a straightforward title. Were it not for the redundancy, this title in itself presents no need for any modification in its oral and written transmission.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0309089213483979">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>What we need in order to prove a practice of the <italic>Adonai</italic> euphemism are, then, traces of such in early Hebrew manuscripts or translations. Indeed, one need not search long to find such evidence in ancient witnesses. In the Septuagint translation of Ezekiel<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0309089213483979">30</xref></sup>—as represented in Codex Vaticanus, one of the best representations of the Old Greek—‭הוהי‬ ‭ינדא‬ of the <sc>mt</sc> is rendered in intriguing fashion: as either κύριoς,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0309089213483979">31</xref></sup> κύριoς κύριoς,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0309089213483979">32</xref></sup> or κύριoς ὁ θ∊ός.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0309089213483979">33</xref></sup> While the peculiar way in which these three titles are distributed in Codex Vaticanus invites text critics into a serious debate,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0309089213483979">34</xref></sup> what matters most to us is κύριoς (ὁ) θ∊ός, an apparent reflection of the perpetual Qere of ‭הוהי‬ ‭ינדא‬, <italic>Adonai Elohim</italic>. Since the practice of the perpetual Qere is caused by, and dependent upon, the euphemism for the Tetragrammaton, some of the translators of the Septuagint were probably under the influence of the euphemism.</p>
<p>1QIsa<sup>a</sup> also shows a similar sign of scribal uncertainty in rendering ‭הוהי‬ ‭ינדא‬ of the <sc>mt</sc>. While this scroll usually follows the double name of the <sc>mt</sc>, it often deviates to renditions that are quite similar to what we witnessed above in the Greek Ezekiel text. First, 1QIsa<sup>a</sup> has the single ‭הוהי‬ in place of ‭הוהי‬ ‭ינדא‬ of the <sc>mt</sc>; this appears six times, three of which are emended later by what appears to be a correction toward the <sc>mt</sc>. (The correction is made in the form of a superscript in between the line: ‭הוהי‬<sup>‭ינודא‬</sup>.)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0309089213483979">35</xref></sup> Second, and more importantly, an apparent trace of the perpetual Qere of ‭הוהי‬ ‭ינדא‬ is observed—namely, ‭םיהולא‬ ‭ינודא‬ in 50.5 and ‭םיהולא‬ ‭הוהי‬ in 61.11. Both of these unequivocally represent the Qere, <italic>Adonai Elohim</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0309089213483979">36</xref></sup> ‭םיהולא‬ ‭ינודא‬ is a literal representation of the aural value of the Qere, whereas ‭םיהולא‬ ‭הוהי‬ reflects a more developed scribal custom in which the scribes habitually substitute the phonetic value of <italic>Adonai</italic> with the written form, ‭הוהי‬.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0309089213483979">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>The above discussion demonstrates the value of ‭הוהי‬ ‭ינדא‬ in tracing the <italic>Adonai</italic> euphemism. 1QIsa<sup>a</sup> and the Old Greek text of Ezekiel provide hints of an early euphemistic practice. While the availability of even earlier witnesses is limited, the <sc>mt</sc> itself provides some, to which I will now turn.</p>

<title>4. ‭םיהולא‬ ‭הוהי‬ in Chronicles, a Written Variant of ‭הוהי‬ ‭ינדא‬</title>
<p>The consonantal text of Chronicles shows a similar phenomenon when it renders the ‭הוהי‬ ‭ינדא‬ of Samuel-Kings. In Samuel-Kings, ‭הוהי‬ ‭ינדא‬ appears nine times—seven of them in David's Prayer in 2 Samuel 7, which has its parallel in 1 Chronicles 17. The following chart demonstrates how these seven occurrences of ‭הוהי‬ ‭ינדא‬ are rendered in Chronicles.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>As we see, ‭הוהי‬ ‭ינדא‬ in Samuel is <italic>never</italic> retained in Chronicles. It is either replaced with the single title ‭הוהי‬/‭םיהולא‬ or rendered in the double title ‭םיהולא‬ ‭הוהי‬. Here, one cannot miss the conspicuous parallel with the aforementioned cases of the Greek Ezekiel and 1QIsa<sup>a</sup> in that the title ‭הוהי‬ ‭ינדא‬ is either shortened or replaced by a form that reflects its perpetual Qere. Concerning the shortened forms, why and how exactly the double title is shortened shall continue to be debated, but one is hard pressed to deny that ‭םיהלא‬ ‭הוהי‬, whether it belongs to the Chronicler or his <italic>Vorlage</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0309089213483979">38</xref></sup> reflects the perpetual Qere. It is most logical to think that behind all three of these lies a common problem—namely, the supposed redundancy of reading the double title ‭הוהי‬ ‭ינדא‬. Indeed, several scholars have already hinted at this possibility.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0309089213483979">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, there is no other way to account for this unusual replacement. Some have proposed that ‭םיהלא‬ ‭הוהי‬ was the Chronicler's preferred title, over ‭הוהי‬ ‭ינדא‬, in the setting of invoking the deity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0309089213483979">40</xref></sup> But this is hardly justifiable. If one title were to replace another, one would expect some kind of connection, either semantic or functional, between the two. Yet ‭הוהי‬ ‭ינדא‬ and ‭םיהלא‬ ‭הוהי‬ are completely different titles in nature and function. While ‭הוהי‬ ‭ינדא‬ is the title that is commonly used for invoking God,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0309089213483979">41</xref></sup> that function is hardly attested for ‭םיהלא‬ ‭הוהי‬ outside Chronicles. ‭םיהלא‬ ‭הוהי‬ is a rare title whose meaning has little to do with invocation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0309089213483979">42</xref></sup> Utterly contrasting is the fact that in Chronicles every single instance of ‭םיהלא‬ ‭הוהי‬ is employed in the setting of prayer as a means of invoking the deity. This applies either to those used as a variant of ‭הוהי‬ ‭ינדא‬ of 2 Samuel (1 Chron. 17.16, 17) or those used independently without the parallel (2 Chron. 1.9; 6.41, 42). The only way to account for this unusual use of ‭םיהלא‬ ‭הוהי‬ in Chronicles is to posit that, for Chronicles, ‭םיהלא‬ ‭הוהי‬ became a written variant of ‭הוהי‬ ‭ינדא‬, influenced by the practice of the perpetual Qere.</p>
<p>Interestingly, as time passed and the practice of the <italic>Adonai</italic> euphemism was firmly established, using ‭םיהלא‬ ‭הוהי‬ as a written variant of ‭הוהי‬ ‭ינדא‬ became a rather usual scribal practice. In Targum Onkelos and Pseudo-Jonathan, for instance, ‭הוהי‬ ‭ינדא‬ of the <sc>mt</sc> was completely replaced with ‭םיהלא‬ ‭הוהי‬. Even the single title ‭ינדא‬ was replaced by ‭הוהי‬. The result is the complete loss of the distinction between ‭הוהי‬ ‭ינדא‬ and ‭םיהלא‬ ‭הוהי‬ in the Targumim. Also, when making quotations from biblical texts, Jewish medieval commentators employed ‭םיהלא‬ ‭הוהי‬ more frequently than ‭הוהי‬ ‭ינדא‬.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0309089213483979">43</xref></sup> Given that the written language is subject to the influence of the spoken language, this change perhaps was inescapable when the Tetragrammaton was always read as <italic>Adonai</italic>. If so, this means that what we saw in the text of Chronicles is nothing but the first instance of what later became an ordinary scribal custom. Using ‭םיהלא‬ ‭הוהי‬ as a written variant for ‭הוהי‬ ‭ינדא‬, whether by the scribe of Targumim or by the Chronicler, probably happened because they used <italic>Adonai</italic> as a surrogate for the solemn name.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0309089213483979" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>5. Conclusion</title>
<p>The use of ‭םיהלא‬ ‭הוהי‬ in Chronicles as a written variant for ‭הוהי‬ ‭ינדא‬ in 2 Samuel serves as one of the early attestations of the <italic>Adonai</italic> euphemism, that is, the use of <italic>Adonai</italic> as a surrogate for the Tetragrammaton. Of course, this does not mean that the pronunciation of the name was officially prohibited by that time or that such practice was well established. I simply suggest that the <italic>Adonai</italic> euphemism may have a longer life than commonly thought. This does not definitively prove the originality of κύριoς in the Old Greek translation, but it raises that probability. There is therefore no reason to consider all the usages of κύριoς late. When the issue of the euphemism for the Tetragrammaton is dealt with, ‭םיהלא‬ ‭הוהי‬ in Chronicles should be treated as early biblical evidence of this distinct Jewish treatment of the ineffable name of God.</p>

That a great deal of ‭הוהי‬ in Samuel-Kings are read ‭םיהולא‬ in Chronicles might support the case that <italic>Elohim</italic> (or θ∊ός) was used as a replacement of the Tetragrammaton. The thesis of early use of θ∊ός is attractive because it goes with the Greek rendition of the double reading ‭הוהי‬ ‭ינדא‬ with κύριoς (ὁ) θ∊ός. Note ‭הוהי‬ is read (ὁ) κύριoς, most notably in P967 (dated to the second century <sc>ce</sc>).

This type of change may occur primarily when text is dictated to another scribe, but one may not rule out a direct copying. When copying directly from a written text, the words are read and temporally stored in the mind, often with an aural value, rather than as graphic images. In such cases, it is not uncommon that the aural value introduces errors into the graphic form that is recorded on the page. Such errors are similar to those scribal errors frequently experienced through phonetic similarity. For the latter, see Emanuel Tov, <italic>Textual Criticism of the Hebrew Bible</italic> (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2001), pp. 251–52.</p></fn>

To illustrate, suppose we are in a Biblical Hebrew class and are taking a dictation test. The instructor is reading sentences, and she has just read <italic>Adonai</italic>. An inexperienced student would at first write it at face value, ‭ינדא‬. But after a while, students will figure out that it is better to write ‭הוהי‬ because of the Qere. Suppose the instructor reads <italic>Adonai Elohim</italic>. For this, logically speaking, there are a number of different possibilities. Some would write ‭םיהלא‬ ‭ינדא‬, at its face value. But many others would go with ‭םיהלא‬ ‭הוהי‬ because they just learned how to deal with the Qere of ‭הוהי‬. But if there were students well informed of the Masoretic tradition, they would recall the perpetual Qere and proudly write ‭הוהי‬ ‭ינדא‬.</p></fn>

Sara Japhet has suggested that ‭םיהלא‬ ‭הוהי‬ came to replace ‭הוהי‬ ‭ינדא‬ under the influence of ‘the pronunciation tradition’ (p. 39). But Japhet mistakenly surmises the very factor that caused these changes was reluctance of writing ‭ינדא‬, not ‭הוהי‬, insisting that the written form ‭ינדא‬ was deliberately expunged by the Chronicler out of reluctance to write the spoken form of the Tetragrammaton. If it was forbidden to write ‭ינדא‬, as a spoken form of the Tetragrammaton, it is difficult to understand the scribes feeling no qualms writing the Tetragrammaton itself.</p></fn>
