<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>A 29-year-old male presented to the unit having sustained a deep laceration on the volar aspect of the distal part of the right forearm. Surgical exploration revealed a complex injury consisting of zone 5 division of all digital flexor tendons, palmaris longus, and flexor carpi radialis in addition to a transection of the median nerve. He had also sustained a 50% division of the ulnar artery and a 20% partial laceration of the flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU). Repair of all structures except the FCU and palmaris longus was performed.</p> <p>Despite good initial progress, he developed worsening neuropathic pain with features of neurostenalgia. Puckering of the volar wrist skin was seen during active digital flexion and he lacked full finger roll-up when attempting to make a fist. There was a strong Tinel sign at the site of nerve repair, and the patient experienced acute lancinating pain during wrist motion. Despite using pregabalin for pain control, his symptoms remained a significant problem.</p> <p>Flexor tenolysis and neurolysis were undertaken 10 months after the initial injury. At surgery, the unrepaired ends of palmaris longus were found to be stuck down to the scar neuroma at the site of the median nerve repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193413475569">Figure 1</xref>). On flexion and extension of the wrist, the palmaris longus tendon caused traction on the neuroma. The tendon was not dissected free of the neuroma to avoid further trauma to the previous area of injury. Instead, segments of 2–3 cm of the tendon were excised so that the free ends came to lie without the previous zone of injury.</p>

</fig>
<p>After release of the nerve from the tethering tissues, his dysaesthetic symptoms resolved and his hypoaesthesia improved, although incompletely. With full wrist extension he was also able to fully extend the fingers without pain. Although tethering of the superficial radial nerve has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193413475569">Calfee et al., 2008</xref>), the finding of an unrepaired tendon tethering to a neuroma that subsequently caused neuropathic symptoms has not, to our knowledge, been reported.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to repair a lacerated palmaris longus in the setting of a spaghetti wrist; however, in light of this experience, our unit would advocate that the surgeon perform repair in order to protect the median nerve from the overlying skin and reduce the risk of tendon tethering to a healing nerve.</p>
