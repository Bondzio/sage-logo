<abstract>
<p>This paper explores the determinants of perceptions of the honesty of most people across 48 US states and three periods. The results show support for the detrimental effects of income inequality but no or little support for a set of popular alternative theories from the related literature on social trust. The decline in honesty perceptions in recent decades is found to have been a consequence of increasing social polarization and the natural decline of the most trusting age cohorts. Residual honesty has increased since the 1970s, giving rise to markedly different policy implications than those forwarded in most studies in the trust literature.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Social trust and norms of honesty have been high on the agenda in the social sciences ever since Robert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1043463112453546">Putnam’s (1993)</xref> seminal work on regional government in Italy. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1043463112453546">Putnam (1993</xref>: 167) relied on James <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1043463112453546">Coleman’s (1988)</xref> concept of social capital and therefore pooled diverse elements of social organization of “trust, norms, and networks” into one notion, more recent work has stressed that these features must be separated and most of the beneficial effects of this concept are in fact outcomes of trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043463112453546">Bjørnskov, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1043463112453546">Knack, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1043463112453546">Paxton, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1043463112453546">Uslaner, 2002</xref>). The literature on the consequences of trust has exploded in recent years, showing that trust is a major factor in explaining large-<italic>N</italic> cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1043463112453546">Sønderskov, 2011a</xref>). Among the considerably positive outcomes following from social trust are, for example, economic growth, institutional quality, and subjective wellbeing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043463112453546">Bjørnskov, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043463112453546">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043463112453546">Heinemann and Tanz, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043463112453546">Helliwell and Huang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1043463112453546">Knack, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1043463112453546">La Porta et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1043463112453546">Uslaner, 2002</xref>). A parallel literature on the determinants of social trust has therefore arisen to explore what are the sources of social trust and individuals’ assessments of honesty. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1043463112453546">Uslaner (2000</xref>: 570) concisely puts it, “if trust is important and it is in short supply, it would be wonderful to find a way to restore faith in others”. To do so, it is necessary to know of the determinants of social trust and related norms of honesty. Yet, recent studies have uncovered preciously few robust ways of increasing trust and honesty.</p>
<p>The empirical literature on determinants of trust has for obvious reasons relied heavily on cross-country comparisons, suggesting a number of potential determinants of social trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043463112453546">Berggren and Jordahl, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043463112453546">Bjørnskov, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043463112453546">2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043463112453546">Delhey and Newton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1043463112453546">Knack and Zak, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1043463112453546">Leigh, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1043463112453546">Stolle et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1043463112453546">Uslaner, 2002</xref>). However, the cross-country literature suffers, as do all cross-sectional studies, from the possibilities of reverse causality and that confounding variables may drive what appear to be causal findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1043463112453546">Nannestad, 2008</xref>). Although not solving all problems, having a panel dataset with substantial variation would potentially bring the literature further.</p>
<p>With respect to perceptions of trust and honesty, the United States is in some ways different from most other nations, which is rather fortunate for research in such characteristics – although not necessarily for the citizens of the country. For example, while social trust seems to be a stable feature of most countries across the world (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043463112453546">Bjørnskov, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1043463112453546">Tabellini, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1043463112453546">Volken, 2002</xref>), US trust scores have been on the decline nationwide since the late 1960s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1043463112453546">Paxton, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1043463112453546">Putnam, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1043463112453546">Uslaner, 2000</xref>). Yet, whereas the much-published decline of American social trust is one of Putnam’s main claims, he makes little of the additional fact that it has not been uniform across states. Neither has a number of developments that various authors have associated with the creation and destruction of trust or potential changes in risk acceptance.</p>
<p>As such, a panel dataset across the American states may provide a valuable supplement to cross-country studies on the potential determinants of social trust and norms of honesty. This paper is one of the first to do so by making use of both the cross-state variation and variation over time in Americans’ perceptions of honesty in order to estimate a broad set of potential determinants of honesty and its companion concept social trust.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1043463112453546">1</xref></sup> The findings indicate support for a limited number of previous suggestions from the trust literature, as income inequality, differences across age cohorts, and the share of Black Americans in the population are the only significant determinants of honesty perceptions across the 48 states. Contrary to popular claims, the residual characteristic – the perceived honesty variation <italic>not</italic> explained by these factors – appears to have increased between the 1970s and the late 1990s when controlling for the relevant factors. As such, the potential policy implications arising from these findings may differ markedly from those of most of the existing literature.</p>
<p>The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The next section provides a brief survey of theories of trust creation in the social sciences and the third and fourth sections describe the data and give an overview of honesty perceptions across time and states in the US. The fifth section tests the theories and the final section discusses the findings and concludes.</p>

<title>Theories of honesty and trust creation – a short overview</title>
<p>Even though the literature on the determinants of social trust is substantially smaller than that on its consequences, a number of theories already exist. The theoretical and empirical literature on the associated concept of honesty perceptions is in its very infancy. Although honesty perception is arguably a broader, antecedent concept, I therefore rely on literature on the parallel concept of trust in order to form a broad theoretical framework.</p>
<p>Drawn from existing theoretical frameworks within economics, political science, sociology, and psychology, the theories cannot readily be categorized in either of the standard fields of the social sciences. Even though they overlap, I instead divide them into three separate “families” for the purpose of exposition: (1) fractionalization, (2) historical factors, and (3) socialization, values, and politics. Virtually all results surveyed here are achieved using the World Values Survey trust question, i.e. I implicitly assume that roughly similar theoretical mechanisms apply to both trust and honesty perceptions for now.</p>
<sec id="section3-1043463112453546">
<title>Fractionalization</title>
<p>Social fractionalization can occur in many forms and shapes such as income differences, ethnic conflict, religious prejudice, and political diversity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1043463112453546">2</xref></sup> Probably the most robust determinant of trust found in the empirical literature is fractionalization in the form of income inequality. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1043463112453546">Jordahl (2009)</xref> outlines the arguments as belonging to three families: (1) having shared social ties, values and norms; in other words, belonging to a “moral community”, which furthers trust; (2) inequality leading to or being a result of conflicts over resources, which will magnify the incentives for deceitful and dishonest behavior and is thus rationally detrimental to trust; and (3) a positive effect of high opportunity costs of time, coming about since “working and trusting is more attractive than spending time verifying that others are trustworthy”, which becomes more likely as an aggregate behavioral feature when the incomes for the relatively poorest are raised. Indeed, results in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043463112453546">Bjørnskov (2007)</xref> suggest that increasing income inequality by one standard deviation lowers social trust by approximately one third of a standard deviation. As such, income fractionalization seems one of the strongest factors in cross-country research even though it may not hold universally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043463112453546">Bjørnskov, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043463112453546">Brown and Uslaner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1043463112453546">Leigh, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Other forms of fractionalization could in principle matter in the same way as income inequality. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1043463112453546">Knack and Keefer (1997)</xref>, for example, find that ethnic diversity is negatively associated with trust and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1043463112453546">Putnam (2000)</xref> finds it to be a negative factor behind his broader concept of social capital. On the other hand, this factor is never significant in the much larger country samples used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043463112453546">Bjørnskov (2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043463112453546">2008a</xref>). Exploring the variation across both countries and US states, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1043463112453546">Uslaner (2006)</xref> also rejects a direct influence of ethnic diversity on social trust. Instead, racial inequality seems to be more robustly negatively associated with trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043463112453546">Alesina and la Ferrara, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1043463112453546">Stolle et al., 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1043463112453546">Uslaner (2000</xref>: 580), for example, notes that from 1972 to 1996, 46 percent of the white American population stated that most people can be trusted whereas only 17 percent of African Americans agreed with the statement. As he notes, “you can’t build trust when some feel left out and believe that others control the resources”, but continues to stress that “building trust among people who have long had reasons to distrust will be difficult”. As such, some ethnic groups may be locked in a low-trust / weak perceptions trap since history has taught them that they are powerless and controlled unfairly by other groups in society. The distrust and weak expectations of trustworthy behavior created by history may also lead these groups to opt out of general society, thereby reinforcing and perpetuating their negative perceptions of honesty, although they are not necessarily grounded in actual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1043463112453546">Simpson et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>A plethora of other types of fractionalization could occur. In a specifically American context, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1043463112453546">Uslaner (2000</xref>: 586) stresses the growth of Christian fundamentalism as a potential source of distrust that “has increasingly polarized Americans as more people identify as fundamentalists (who are more likely to put faith only in their own kind) and the simultaneous growth of the ‘unchurched’”. While religiosity seems to create more in-group trust as members of particular churches tend to trust each other more – they have similar world views, tend to come from similar backgrounds and may even have their faith in religious fellows upheld by the church as a third party – their trust in the rest of society tends to decrease (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043463112453546">Berggren and Bjørnskov, 2011</xref>). Through this effect, religious groups in contemporary American society constitute examples of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043463112453546">Banfield’s (1958)</xref> “amoral familism” although the relevant notion of “family” is necessarily much broader by extending to most other members of their church.</p>
<p>In addition, even less tangible forms of fractionalization may matter too through similar mechanisms. Differences in <italic>weltanschauung</italic> constitute an intangible form of social fractionalization as noted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043463112453546">Bjørnskov (2008a)</xref> in which the diversity of self-reported political placement exerts a strong negative effect on social trust across a large sample of countries. This finding thus indicates the possibility that inequalities <italic>per se</italic> may not matter, only individuals’ perceptions of those inequalities and their fairness. If, for example, existing income differences are perceived to be fair, they need not have a fractionalizing effect.</p>

<title>History and path dependence</title>
<p>Such factors vary over time and should thereby lead to changes in trust and social perceptions. On the other hand, psychologists often argue that attitudes such as trust are transmitted from parents to children, which makes trust and distrust persistent over time. The classical contribution by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043463112453546">Katz and Rotter (1969)</xref> showed that 75% of the variation in youngsters’ trust levels could be explained by their parents’ propensity to trust most other people. Recent work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1043463112453546">Dohmen et al. (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1043463112453546">Sturgis et al. (2007)</xref> point to the same conclusion, as does <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1043463112453546">Uslaner’s (2008)</xref> finding that Americans’ propensity to trust is highly correlated with the current level of social trust in the country from which their ancestors came (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043463112453546">Berggren and Bjørnskov, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1043463112453546">Tabellini, 2008</xref>). Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1043463112453546">Fisman and Miguel’s (2007)</xref> study of parking ticket violations of UN diplomats in New York shows that their moral behavior (paying tickets) varies systematically with corruption levels in their home countries even though they live in an entirely different culture.</p>
<p>In particular, a number of studies have found that the exceptionally high levels of basic moral norms and perceptions in the Nordic countries today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043463112453546">Bjørnskov, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043463112453546">2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043463112453546">Delhey and Newton, 2005</xref>) are replicated in the US data although the immigration waves from Scandinavia took place in the mid to late 19<sup>th</sup> century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1043463112453546">Uslaner, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1043463112453546">2008</xref>). Since this finding holds irrespective of where in the US the relevant citizens live, social trust must logically form part of the cultural heritage passed down from parents to children for this effect to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043463112453546">Katz and Rotter, 1969</xref>). This factor also leads to generational effects consistent with claims that part of the American trust decline is an effect of trusting age cohorts leaving the population by natural causes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1043463112453546">Putnam, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1043463112453546">Rahn and Transue, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1043463112453546">Robinson and Jackson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1043463112453546">Uslaner, 2000</xref>). If older generations have not been able to instill the same trust towards strangers in their children as they themselves have had, the path dependence of trust is not perfect, although still strong.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1043463112453546">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another example of historical influences is the widespread discrimination of minority groups in the US, and in particular its black population whose suffering is all too well known. While reasons remain that US minorities may not trust individuals from the majority and other minorities to the same extent as people from their own ethnic group, a large part of the existing distrust may be inherited from the very rational distrust that, for example, the grandparents of today’s Black Americans had in most other people, a problem that may date back to the slave trade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1043463112453546">Nunn and Wantchekon, 2011</xref>). The persistence due to the influence of parents’ trust can thus lead to pathological social learning, which is detrimental to American trust levels today even though most discriminatory practices have long ceased.</p>

<title>Socialization, values, and politics</title>
<p>As the third area, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1043463112453546">Putnam (1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1043463112453546">2000)</xref> emphasizes the adverse effects of the decline in American sociability. Stating that “those more engaged in community life are both more trusting and more trustworthy […] the causal arrows among civil involvement, reciprocity, honesty, and social trust are as tangled as well-tossed spaghetti”, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1043463112453546">Putnam (2000</xref>: 137) argues that participation in virtually any social activity generates trust and stronger norms of honesty, on the assumption that the particularized trust generated in such face-to-face interactions is transitory in the sense that it also generates social trust. As such, the decline in organizational membership and participation would be responsible for part of the decline of social trust (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043463112453546">Brehm and Rahn, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1043463112453546">Putnam, 1995</xref>). Yet, even while this notion may seem eminently intuitive, it fares poorly in empirical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043463112453546">Bjørnskov, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1043463112453546">Sønderskov, 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1043463112453546">Uslaner, 2002</xref>: chs 4, 5 and 7). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1043463112453546">Uslaner (2000</xref>: 570–571) finds almost no links between civic engagement and social trust, stressing that “you don’t have to be a truster, or an especially nice person, to join a bowling league. There is little evidence and a shaky theoretical foundation for assuming that either formal or informal social connections can produce trust in people we don’t know, especially when they are likely to be different from ourselves and our friends”. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043463112453546">Claibourn and Martin (2000)</xref>, exploring a unique individual-level panel data set, corroborate the finding by showing the associations between social activity and social trust are weak and statistically fragile. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1043463112453546">Stolle (1998)</xref> nevertheless makes the argument that the fragile association is due to different effects of different types of associations. Her argument that some associations create weak ties and are therefore more beneficial to trust creation than closed associations creating strong ties implies that one has to distinguish between different types of networking.</p>
<p>Likewise, the role of education in furthering sociability and specific norms, thought to be important in earlier studies, has been strongly questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043463112453546">Bjørnskov, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1043463112453546">Knack and Zak, 2002</xref>). Yet, a related factor may hold more explanatory power. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1043463112453546">Rahn and Transue (1998)</xref>, in one of the few studies connecting broader sets of values to the development of social trust, suggest that a decline in values of work and duty have been instrumental in the deterioration of American trust levels. If trust and honesty belong to a set of “traditional” values, changing values across time and generations could thereby be of key importance even though other types of socialization are not.</p>
<p>With an argument in the same vein as his specific socialization theory, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1043463112453546">Putnam (2000)</xref> also claims that people watching more television, including newscasts, gain the impression that the world is a violent and brutal place, and that TV consumption takes place at the expense of trust-generating social activities. TV may thereby have a double negative effect by leading to biased learning of the surroundings but also less learning of one’s immediate social surroundings when time now spent on watching TV would otherwise be spent socializing. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1043463112453546">Uslaner (2000)</xref> again reports contrary evidence when dealing more explicitly with the causality issue.</p>
<p>Other studies argue that politics can beneficially affect trust and values as politicians allegedly provide role models for ordinary citizens who will tend to increase their trust radii whenever politicians appear to be trustworthy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043463112453546">Brehm and Rahn, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1043463112453546">Rothstein, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1043463112453546">Yamagishi and Yamagishi, 1994</xref>). This information is provided by the media, which then come to play a key role. Central to this strand of theories is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1043463112453546">Rothstein (2003)</xref> who asserts that social trust and perceptions of honesty are determined by political or institutional trust – the confidence citizens have in their political system – and in particular individuals’ trust in politicians, stating that “the fish rots from the head down”. In a similar theoretical study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1043463112453546">Herreros (2008)</xref> argues that state efficacy is a precondition for creating trust. A number of studies have noted a correlation between social and political trust, although careful causality analysis in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1043463112453546">Keele (2007)</xref> suggests that social trust precedes political trust, and a similar analysis in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043463112453546">Bergh and Bjørnskov (2011)</xref> indicates that extensive welfare states in general rest on pre-existing stocks of trust and honesty norms. Speaking against Rothstein’s otherwise popular hypothesis is its requirement that most people generalize from instances in which they observe behavior of specific, identifiable individuals to other people in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043463112453546">Bjørnskov, 2007</xref>). As noted above, this transitory characteristic of trust has not fared well in empirical studies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1043463112453546">Oskarsson (2010)</xref> finds social trust to be a mediating variable in explaining political trust and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1043463112453546">Sturgis et al. (2007)</xref> find no support for Rothstein’s effect of welfare institutions. Furthermore, results in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1043463112453546">Robbins (2012)</xref> document that the effect from social trust to political trust is robust while the opposite causality disappears once one controls for a specific Nordic trust excellence (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043463112453546">Bjørnskov, 2008a</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1043463112453546">Uslaner (2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1043463112453546">2002)</xref> views optimism as a key factor in creating social trust, arguing that increasing worries about the future, probably rooted in growing inequality and averse media coverage, have led Americans to be more wary of trusting each other. As such, to the extent that citizens gain the impression from media, politics, and the way they “read” through their own situation in society that the future looks bleak, they will tend to hedge their social risks by not placing confidence in strangers and being less sociable, instead relying more on people whom they either know personally or who are similar to themselves.</p>

<sec id="section6-1043463112453546">
<title>Data</title>
<p>As such, there are a number of competing theories of trust creation also applicable to the similar concept of honesty perceptions that are often not consistent with each other. In the next section, I therefore describe the data used in the following to separate these theories and test them on American levels of honesty perceptions. In order to form the data used in this paper, I rely on the DDB Needham Lifestyles Survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043463112453546">DDB Needham, 2006</xref>), which since 1975 has asked Americans to rate the degree to which they agree with the statement that “Most people are honest” on an increasing scale from 1 to 6. Even while this is not directly intended to capture the trust people have in each other, the concept of honesty perceptions arguably measures an approximately antecedent construct since the World Values Survey (WVS) trust question has been shown to be closely related to actual honest behavior.</p>
<p>Asking whether people are in general honest or whether they trust each other to be honest should be two ways of measuring the same underlying factor, yet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1043463112453546">Stolle and Uslaner (2003</xref>: 12) note that a substantial group of respondents stating that most people are honest are not ready to trust strangers. Although one can remain agnostic with respect to what the present data exactly measure, an explanation consistent with this apparent problem is that the perception that most people are honest may be a necessary but not sufficient condition for extending actual trust towards strangers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1043463112453546">Reeskens and Hooghe (2008)</xref> make a similar point when finding that Americans declaring that most people try to be fair are also likely to state that most people can be trusted. Yet, only very few respondents in the US General Social Survey who say that people can be trusted believe that most fellow citizens “would try to take advantage of you if they got a chance”. Results in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1043463112453546">Reeskens and Hooghe (2008)</xref> with both US surveys and the European Social Survey are consistent with honesty and fairness perceptions being necessary but not sufficient conditions for trust. As such, one may think of honesty perceptions as an antecedent concept to social trust.</p>
<p>In order to ensure that these data are as comparable as possible with similar data from the General Social Survey and the World Values Survey, and thus partially alleviate a potential problem, I code the trust data as the percentage of respondents that either agree in general or in full (scores 5 and 6); all scores are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1043463112453546">Table 6</xref>. A further advantage of using this particular type of aggregation instead of, for example, using the average score, is that it is less sensitive to potential response style bias. Using the average of multi-category questions entails the risk of bias due to, for example, cultural aversion to answering outside what is perceived as a ‘normal’ range. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043463112453546">Bjørnskov (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1043463112453546">Uslaner (2011)</xref> note that this is a specific concern in trust research and argue for using the present type of aggregation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1043463112453546">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>This yields a correlation between the two measures of .72 in the 1990s state social trust data reported in the General Social Survey. The state-level data on honesty perceptions vary considerably between a minimum of 20.8% (Georgia in the 1990s) and 52% (Idaho in the 1970s). However, given the limited sample size it should be stressed that for some of the smaller states and in particular for the early period, the data can be somewhat thin. The pooled sets from Idaho in the 1970s make one of the smallest samples, comprising slightly below 100 respondents. Due to this problem, using decadal averages is probably the lowest level of aggregation that is practicable with these data. As such, honesty perceptions and other factors drawn from the DDB Needham data are measured with considerable noise in the smallest states, which must be kept in mind when interpreting results in the following.</p>
<p>As outlined previously, the literature on social trust gives rise to testing a number of different hypotheses more carefully. I do so using a simple baseline specification consisting of income inequality, the share of the state population in each of five age cohorts, and the share in the two largest ethnic minorities. Income inequality is captured as is standard by household gross income Gini coefficients at the beginning of each decade, taken from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043463112453546">BEA, 2007</xref>). Cohort effects are captured as the share of respondents in each state who are born in one of five cohorts: before 1916, between 1916 and 1930, 1931 and 1945, 1946 and 1960, and after 1960; the latter serves as the comparison group. The ethnic minority groups are Black and Hispanic Americans (from the decennial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1043463112453546">US Census, 2007</xref>), making the white majority population and small minority groups the comparison. Finally, by including dummies for the 1970s and 1980s, with the 1990s the comparison, the specification allows for unexplained changes over time common to all states such as broad, popular theories of a decline of American civilization.</p>
<p>A related variable mentioned in the cross-country literature is the degree of ethnic or ethno-linguistic homogeneity. I therefore include a variable termed “ethnic homogeneity”, which is the Herfindahl index of origins in one of six ethnic categories: White, Black, Hispanic, American Indian, Eskimo and Aleut, Asian and Pacific Islander, and others. Given that the ethnic composition of the population varies considerably across the states, which could obscure historically determined differences, I include dummies for the states that formed the Confederacy (i.e. slave or “Southern states”), and the states that remained out of the Civil War, the “border states”. As a test of the potentially civilizing or destructive effects of economic development, which could capture broad changes in norms and values, I also include the logarithm to the state average income (log Gross State Product, GSP) from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043463112453546">BEA (2007)</xref>.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, a large literature has proposed many other factors. Foremost in this literature are a number of attitudinal and moral values factors, all of which are taken from the DDB Needham dataset in this paper. Putnam’s claim of a decline in social activity and engagement is tested by applying principal components analysis to form not one but two variables termed “passive social activity” and “active social activity”. Following the approach in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043463112453546">Bjørnskov (2008b)</xref>, these variables are formed by analyzing all available variables associated with some form of social activity; the dataset includes 20 such variables for which there are full individual-level data across all periods. As such, the variables are distributed around zero at the individual level but not perfectly so at the state level; <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1043463112453546">Appendix 1</xref> provides more details on the construction of these data. While the solution of two orthogonal components may not fit prevalent social capital theories, and in particular those following Putnam, splitting social activity into two components is strongly suggested by the data. In addition, by allowing the structure of the data on values and social activities to decide the dimensionality of measures, it solves the problem raised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1043463112453546">Stolle (1998)</xref> that only certain separable types of networks may generate trust and honesty.</p>
<p>The passive social activity index varies from -.35 (Nevada in the 1970s) to .48 (South Dakota in the 1970s) while the active index varies between –.45 (Mississippi in the 1990s) and .48 (Arizona in the 1970s). The same approach is taken to form an index of support for conservative or “traditional” values, stretching from -.61 (New Hampshire in the 1990s) to .85 (Mississippi in the 1970s); the appendix again provides further details. The average scores on the statement “television is my primary form of entertainment” capture similar elements in Putnam’s socialization-based theory of trust creation.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1043463112453546">Rothstein and Uslaner’s (2005)</xref> argument that confidence in politicians and the political system generates social trust is included in the average score on the statement “an honest man cannot get elected to high office” measuring distrust in politicians. Socialization theories specific to the education system are captured by including the share of state populations with a high school degree (“high school”) from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1043463112453546">US Census (2007)</xref>. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1043463112453546">Uslaner’s (2002)</xref> finding that optimism breeds trust is tested in two different ways, as psychologists often argue that positive and negative affect are separate concepts (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1043463112453546">Lucas et al., 1996</xref>). To test for both possibilities, I include the average scores on the variables “Five years from now our family income will probably be a lot higher than it is now” to capture positive affect and “I dread the future” to capture negative affect.</p>
<p>All variables are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1043463112453546">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1043463112453546">Table 2</xref> outlines the connection between specific theories and variables. While not all variables may provide the perfect proxies for factors suggested by theories, the choice is dictated by what is included in the DDB Needham surveys and the availability of data from other sources with full state-level information. This implies that proxies for media influences and historical factors in particular are relatively simple. However, the table allows readers to judge for themselves whether some variables are relatively better or worse proxies.</p>

<p>In the following, these variables are averaged over each state in three time periods, 1975–1980, 1980–1989, and 1990–1998, thereby forming a panel of 3×48 observations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1043463112453546">5</xref></sup> All results are obtained by pooled cross-section estimates using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1043463112453546">Beck and Katz’s (1995)</xref> panel corrected standard errors.

<p>In a number of cases, trust creation theories either argue for the reverse causality or an entirely endogenous relation. All of these theories apply equally well to honesty perceptions. I therefore report the particular point estimate of the relevant variables using instrumental variables (IV) to control causality in a lower panel.

<title>A first look at honesty perceptions in the US over time</title>
<p>The raw data on honesty perceptions can provide an initial impression of the well-known structure and richness of American data on social perceptions. First of all, it is beyond doubt that American honesty levels have declined over time, as is obvious in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1043463112453546">Figure 1</xref>. The figure also provides some circumstantial evidence for three popular explanations for the decline: (1) that honesty perceptions have weakened because Americans’ social activities, in which such perceptions are formed according to socialization theories, have in general decreased; (2) that honesty has declined because American traditional values have in general deteriorated; and (3) that honesty perceptions have weakened as the American income distribution has become more skewed. As is rather obvious in the figure, all four variables – honesty perceptions, active and passive social activities, and the adherence to traditional values – have decreased since the mid-1970s, and income inequality (the columns) has increased in the same period.</p>

</fig>
<p>However, when the richness of the DDB Needham data is properly considered, further points need to be taken into account. First, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1043463112453546">Putnam (2000)</xref> and others discuss the decline in Americans’ social trust over time, yet the related data on honesty perceptions actually do not support the standard assertion that this is necessarily a <italic>nationwide</italic> phenomenon. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1043463112453546">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the heterogeneous development of honesty over time in the US by five examples: Arkansas, California, Massachusetts, Mississippi, and Texas. The figure makes it clear that honesty perceptions in Mississippi have remained fairly constant over the three time periods employed in this paper while honesty perceptions in Massachusetts saw a small decrease in the 1980s but more or less returned to their 1970s level. On the other hand, Texas is a representative example of Putnam’s main finding that trust and honesty perceptions have decreased since the 1970s and the developments of California and Arkansas, two of the states that have seen the largest relative decreases in honesty in the period, illustrate the general US trend. In these states, the declines were much larger from the 1970s to the 1980s than in the later period, which is true for most states. Nationwide, the loss of belief in the honesty of other people from the 70s to the 80s was approximately seven percentage points while the loss between the later periods was four percentage points. Statewise, the unweighted average decline from the 70s to the 80s was a loss of ten percentage points whereas the average loss from the 80s to the 90s was only two points. The decline in US honesty perceptions has therefore not been monotonous over time and has varied markedly across states.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1043463112453546">Figure 2</xref> exemplifies the inherent problems in Putnam’s interpretation of the data if the loss of traditional values and sociability is broadly similar across states. Moreover, as Putnam rightly assesses, part of the decline in social perceptions may arguably be an effect of very trusting and honest cohorts of Americans slowly leaving the population by natural causes, which might also be an explanation of other developments as, for example, the deterioration of sociability and traditionally held values. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1043463112453546">Figure 3</xref>, which shows cohort-specific perceptions averages in all three periods, illustrates that this must necessarily be an important part of any explanation of differences in the US across states and time. The oldest Americans, defined here as those born before 1916, have on average been the most trusting with a level around 50 percent. Since then, average honesty perceptions have declined almost monotonously with each cohort. The picture in the figure therefore does not conform to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1043463112453546">Putnam’s (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1043463112453546">Uslaner’s (2000</xref>: 585) notion that the baby-boomers born from the mid-1940s “heralded a new age of mistrust” as the generation born in the 1930s and during World War II also appears to have weaker perceptions of honesty than the previous generation.</p>

<p>However, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1043463112453546">Figure 3</xref> in addition shows that while there has been a trust decline <italic>within</italic> cohorts – i.e. not all perceptions of honesty are historically predetermined – this decline is not comparable <italic>across</italic> cohorts. The oldest cohorts, defined as those born before 1930, have seen declines between all three periods, yet the younger cohorts have in general not experienced any decline of average honesty perceptions from the 1980s to the 1990s and may even have experienced slightly more positive perceptions between the later periods. Again, splitting the data properly reveals a much richer picture than the simple decline of American civilization painted by most commentators.</p>
<p>The raw data would suggest that a number of factors mentioned in the literature could be associated with the decline in honesty perceptions. From the 1970s to the 1990s, income inequality measured by Gini coefficients increased by .037 and ethnic homogeneity decreased by .09 points. The decline of traditional values from the 1970s to the 1990s was on average –.57, TV consumption captured by the index here increased by .19, distrust in politicians increased by 1.09 points, and reflecting this development, Americans’ interest in politics decreased by .12 points. On the face of it, Americans also became less sociable, as the passive social activity index decreased by .17 and the active social activity index decreased by .29 points. Consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1043463112453546">Uslaner’s (2002)</xref> claim that Americans became less optimistic, the dread for the future index increased by .25 points and the belief that income will be higher in the future decreased by .14 points. Virtually the only potentially positive development in the data is that high school attendance increased by 7.5 percentage points as younger generations received increasingly longer educations.</p>
<p>However, at the same time, the share of the two oldest cohorts decreased by 25 percentage points, and even while a number of these developments have taken place in all of the country, the strength of them has varied greatly across the states. Treating both spatial and temporal issues at the same time is therefore likely to provide further insights into what affects norms of honesty and thus whether there is a need for concern for the social shape of America. To simultaneously explore the dynamics across cohorts and states, the following section presents a set of panel data estimates.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>Column 1 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1043463112453546">Table 3</xref> includes a fairly simple baseline specification consisting of income inequality, period dummies, the shares of African-Americans termed “Black population”, the share of Americans of Hispanic origins in the state populations, and the shares of each age cohort in the state populations. The results first of all show that income inequality is not only strongly associated with state-level average honesty perceptions across the US. Calculating the effect of a one standard deviation shock to income inequality in column 1 yields a change of about one third of a standard deviation of honesty perceptions, which corresponds very closely to the association found in cross-country studies of social trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043463112453546">Bjørnskov, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043463112453546">Delhey and Newton, 2005</xref>). Testing for the potential influence of reverse causality in the lower panel of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1043463112453546">Table 3</xref>, using the log to GSP per capita, dummies for Southern and border states, and the share of democratic voters in presidential elections as instrumental variables, reveals that income inequality exerts a causal influence on social perceptions, although the IV estimate is slightly smaller.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1043463112453546">6</xref></sup></p>

<p>Controlling for the two large population groups that are potentially discriminated against reveals that only the Black population, for which discrimination was probably much worse and went on for substantially longer, seems to contribute negatively to the state-level honesty scores. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1043463112453546">Simpson et al. (2007)</xref> nevertheless warns against seeing this as evidence of actual honesty differences by providing evidence suggesting that the bulk of the difference between trust levels of different ethnicities in the US is due to different interpretations of the trust question, not different actual levels of trust. However, for this to apply to perceptions of honesty, the very same interpretative differences must apply to the honesty question.</p>
<p>Having a large share of Hispanics in the state population, on the other hand, is not associated with weaker average perceptions of honesty. Hence, popular notions in the US that part of the decline in social perceptions is associated with increased immigration from Latin America do not fit the data, potentially because such immigration has primarily gone to southern states with already low honesty levels. Finally, the inclusion of cohort effects also proves important. If not included in the baseline specification (not shown), honesty perceptions in the 1970s were on average ten percentage points higher than in subsequent periods. However, when cohort effects are added as in column 1, the mystery decline becomes nothing but a mystery dip in the 1980s consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1043463112453546">Rahn and Transue, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1043463112453546">Robinson and Jackson, 2001</xref>), and an insignificantly <italic>lower</italic> level in the 1970s relative to that of the 1990s.</p>
<p>Subsequent columns in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1043463112453546">Table 3</xref> test the additional hypotheses associated with historical influences outlined previously. Column 2 includes a simple test of such influences by adding dummies for the Southern states that formed the Confederation and its border states that remained more or less neutral in the American Civil War; neither of these is significant. Column 3 includes the log to GSP per capita to test <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1043463112453546">Tönnies’ ([1957] 2001)</xref> classical theory of a drift from <italic>Gemeinschaft</italic> towards <italic>Gesellschaft</italic> in which modern economic development undermines the former. As in previous trust studies, the data reject this theory (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043463112453546">Bjørnskov, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043463112453546">Delhey and Newton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1043463112453546">Uslaner, 2002</xref>). Column 4 instead tests the potential effects of ethnic (racial) homogeneity. Although the size of the Black population becomes insignificant, this is an effect of variance inflation since the homogeneity index is constructed from the shares of different subpopulations. Even when excluding the shares of Blacks and Hispanics from the specification, homogeneity remains of the expected sign but insignificant, as is the case in both cross-country and cross-state studies on social trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043463112453546">Bjørnskov, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043463112453546">Berggren and Bjørnskov, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1043463112453546">Uslaner, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Column 5 finally provides a test of whether the baseline findings reflect spurious influences from neighboring states, which would be more important here than in cross-country studies since Americans are substantially more geographically mobile than most other populations in the world. The estimate is significant at <italic>p</italic>&lt;.05, but indicates that the effect may be relatively minor as it does not affect the baseline estimates and shows that a one point increase in average honesty perceptions in <italic>all</italic> neighboring states only yields a .2 point increase within the state in question.</p>
<p>Moving on, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1043463112453546">Table 4</xref> tests the influence of various factors of political interest, confidence, and optimism, but results show little evidence of causal effects. Before testing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1043463112453546">Rothstein’s (2003)</xref> hypothesis directly, column 1 shows no indirect evidence for the conjecture that a loss of faith in politicians or politics has affected Americans’ trust, as the share of votes going to presidential candidates outside the two major parties (“protest vote”) is not significantly associated with trust. In column 2, however, individuals’ average distrust in politicians as measured by the statement that “an honest man cannot get elected to high office” is highly negatively associated with social trust with a rather large coefficient. Yet, as indicated by the substantially smaller and insignificantly positive IV estimate in the lower panel of the table, this association is likely to only reflect that an overall loss of social trust also <italic>leads</italic> to a loss of trust in politicians (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1043463112453546">Keele, 2007</xref>).</p>

<p>The table therefore provides no robust evidence for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1043463112453546">Rothstein and Uslaner’s (2005)</xref> hypothesis that “the fish rots from the head down”, consistent with the skepticism in other recent studies using the trust question (Bjørnskov and Svendsen, 2011; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1043463112453546">Oskarsson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1043463112453546">Robbins, 2012</xref>). The last columns also question <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1043463112453546">Uslaner’s (2002)</xref> notion that optimism leads to stronger average honesty perceptions and pessimism to weaker perceptions, as neither measures of negative affect (dread future) nor of positive affect (better income in future) are significantly associated with such perceptions across the US. While other studies find trust and positive norms to affect happiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043463112453546">Bjørnskov, 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043463112453546">Helliwell and Wang, 2011</xref>), the IV estimate in the lower panel indicates that an effect from positive life evaluations to honesty perceptions is unlikely to be the case.

First, column 1 reports tests of whether the decline of traditionally held values associated with “golden age America” has influenced the formation of honesty perceptions across the US. Although <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1043463112453546">Figure 1</xref> provides what a priori looks like evidence for such an association, when adding the relevant control variables the correlation in the figure proves to be spurious. The sign of the coefficient even becomes negative but insignificant, indicating that the slip towards more postmodern values has not been associated with honesty.

The IV estimate in the lower panel of the table furthermore indicates that the insignificance is not an effect of endogeneity bias, not least since the first-stage statistics reported in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-1043463112453546">Appendix 2</xref> preclude problems of underidentification.</p>

<p>Column 2 instead tests the popular notion that trust and norms of honesty can be created through education, i.e. that better educated people are more trusting because they have been socialized to be able to trust other people, and can better overcome the risks of trusting by being more able to assess those risks and thereby form or update honesty perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1043463112453546">Knack and Zak, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1043463112453546">Putnam, 2000</xref>). Again, the results do not support this notion as both the simple and the IV estimates are far from significant and even of the wrong sign. As such, the lack of significance is consistent with studies finding that trust and honesty more likely contribute to education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1043463112453546">Coleman, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043463112453546">Dearmon and Grier, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1043463112453546">Papagapitos and Riley, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Column 3 provides a test of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1043463112453546">Putnam’s (2000)</xref> hypothesis that perceptions of how honest most people are, are created through participating in social activities. Again, neither the simple estimates nor the IV results provide any support for Putnam’s assertion that there is a causal link from social activities to honesty perceptions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1043463112453546">7</xref></sup> It might arguably be the case that the decrease of the types of social activities has been relatively uniform across the US states, in which case it would be entirely picked up by the period dummies. Yet, there are considerable differences in the size of the period-to-period differences in the indices across states, which make this possibility unlikely. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1043463112453546">Stolle’s (1998)</xref> claim that only specific types of associations create trust and honesty cannot account for the insignificance, as the actual structure of individual social activities across 20 types, not a theoretical division, determines the choice of two dimensions of social activity included in the analysis (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1043463112453546">Appendix 1</xref>). The same non-result holds for TV consumption that apparently, judging from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1043463112453546">Figure 1</xref>, is associated with honesty perceptions. As with other variables, it could also be expected that the estimates are biased by endogeneity, in particular if Putnam’s “spaghetti bowl” view of causality is true. Yet, when controlling for endogeneity none of the IV estimates are near significance.</p>
<p>The last columns of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1043463112453546">Table 5</xref> provide estimates obtained by employing a Prais–Winsten estimator allowing for an estimated degree of first-order autocorrelation (column 4) and the baseline specification without state observations based on less than 400 respondents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1043463112453546">8</xref></sup> However, both these exercises yield qualitatively identical results as in previous tables. The only difference is the reduced effect of income inequality when excluding the arguably least precise observations.</p>
<p>Overall, a set of careful estimates employing both the cross-state and cross-time variation provides little evidence for most theories of the creation of social trust and positive honesty perceptions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1043463112453546">Uslaner (2000</xref>: 589), for example, assesses that “rising economic inequality and growing pessimism account for the generational changes in trust in the United States”, yet the data do not support the latter notion. If so, the estimates including Gini coefficients and the “dread of future” variable should have led to smaller and less significant point estimates of the age cohorts. Instead, if anything, differences across age cohorts are stronger when including pessimism. The estimates neither provide support for Rothstein’s notion but more likely indicate that weaker perceptions of honesty among ordinary people lead to losses of confidence in politicians. After all, politicians may not be that different from “ordinary” people. Finally, Putnam’s hypothesis that social activities create trust and norms of honesty fairs equally poorly as other simple theories of trust creation.</p>
<p>As such, the results show support for only a few central determinants of honesty perceptions across the US states. They thus follow the trend in cross-country trust studies that tend to reject most suggestions from the early social capital literature, as well as most factors that can easily be influenced by standard policy (cf., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043463112453546">Bjørnskov, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1043463112453546">Nannestad, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1043463112453546">Robbins, 2012</xref>). Further robustness results (not shown) demonstrate that these results are insensitive to excluding potential outlier observations, excluding the smallest states for which data are thin or single Census regions that might be driving results, excluding all Black respondents to flesh out the effects of large Black population shares, correcting for potential serial correlation, and excluding the Southern states.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1043463112453546">9</xref></sup> Furthermore, they appear not to be the result of honesty perceptions converging across the US. The only real difference is that the dummy for the 1970s occasionally becomes significant, potentially indicating that cohort and inequality effects apart, the fundamental social perceptions may have been higher in the 1990s than in the two preceding decades. As the core results are therefore robust, the final section discusses their implications.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The Russian poet and playwright Chekhov once had Helena, one of the characters in his play <italic>Uncle Vanya</italic>, say that “you must trust people, or life becomes impossible” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043463112453546">Chekhov, 1897</xref>, Act II). Yet since the 1960s, Americans’ sense of social trust and the honesty of their fellow citizens have declined, leaving all Americans potentially worse off in more than one way. In recent years, cross-country studies have for example shown that trust is positively associated with institutional quality and economic growth, and both cross-country and cross-state analyses on US data provide strong evidence for a positive effect of trust and honesty perceptions on subjective wellbeing. Understanding the determinants of social trust and why Americans have seemingly lost faith in the honesty of their fellow citizens is therefore tantamount to being able to counteract any further decline.</p>
<p>This paper is one of the first to <italic>simultaneously</italic> employ the variation over time and across the 48 contiguous states (i.e. excluding Hawaii and Alaska) in order to estimate the determinants of honesty perceptions – a companion and probably antecedent concept of social trust. The honesty measure used in this paper is the share of respondents fully or partially agreeing to the statement that “most people are honest”. As indications in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1043463112453546">Stolle and Uslaner (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1043463112453546">Reeskens and Hooghe (2008)</xref> suggest, this may arguably be a precondition for trusting, i.e., the results in this paper could potentially capture the determinant of an antecedent concept – the belief that most people are honest – to the standard trust measure employed in most studies. Although it may seem intuitive that a belief that most people are honest can lead to trusting behavior, given individuals’ degree of risk aversion, this difference must be kept in mind when interpreting the findings vis-à-vis the existing literature.</p>
<p>Despite this conceptual difference, the results from employing this panel dataset reaffirm the most prevalent findings from the cross-country literature on social trust while rejecting a number of previous arguments as to why Americans’ trust and belief in the honesty of their fellow citizens have suffered in recent decades. Income inequality arises as a main negative determinant of state-level honesty perceptions along with the share of the population with African-American ancestry. While it seems probable that the findings reflect the social effects of decades of economic and political discrimination of this particular minority, it must also be stressed that part of the negative association between the size of the Black population and the state trust level could be due to negative reactions of the honesty perceptions among the non-Black population. It could also to some extent be a consequence of an ethnically specific interpretation of the honesty question, as argued for by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1043463112453546">Simpson et al. (2007)</xref> in the context of the standard trust question.</p>
<p>The findings also show support for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1043463112453546">Putnam’s (2000)</xref> argument that the fundamental propensity to trust strangers varies across age cohorts with generations born later being less inclined than the oldest Americans to believe that most fellow citizens are honest. The generations born after 1960 share the weakest perceptions of honesty while the generation born in the interwar years and during World War II is the second-least trusting. The estimates show that these factors fully capture the quite obvious decline in American social perceptions over time, and even reverse the residual trend. What is left is a minor decline in honesty perceptions in the 1980s followed by a return to the level of the late 1970s, a development that also tracks the American development in average happiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1043463112453546">Yang, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, the findings show no support for a number of other explanations of differences in trust and honesty norms brought forward by the voluminous social capital literature. In particular, the development of a number of institutional and social factors that seem associated with state-level average honesty perceptions over time in simple plots are never significant. While failing to include period dummies in the specification (not shown) has the effect that those variables that contain the “right” profile over time – rising TV consumption, increasing dread of the future and a decline of traditional values – come to be seemingly important determinants of honesty perceptions, when period dummies allow for a contemporaneous but non-causal development over time, such factors fail to matter. The decline in honesty and the rise of TV and media consumption that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1043463112453546">Figure 1</xref> seem so compellingly clearly related may therefore only be <italic>contemporaneous but entirely spuriously correlated</italic> developments. The same is the case of the extent to which Americans engage in social activities, at least those traditionally captured in survey evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1043463112453546">Paxton, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1043463112453546">Sønderskov, 2011b</xref>) and for Americans’ optimism for the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1043463112453546">Uslaner, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The findings in this paper thus fail to support a number of previous results from early studies of the US development and cross-country differences as, for example, ethnic heterogeneity and education are unrelated to social trust and norms of honesty. They are nevertheless more consistent with more recent studies that tend to reject a large part of early social capital theory. Finally, including a formal test of causality yields one more casualty: contrary to the claims by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1043463112453546">Rothstein and Uslaner (2005)</xref>, IV estimates indicate that the causality more likely runs from honesty perceptions to confidence in politicians rather than the other way around. Given that these results are replicated in other studies, they must necessarily be taken into account both when considering the theoretical explanations of how trust and perceptions of honesty are created and when drawing any policy implications.</p>
<p>With respect to purely theoretical aspects, the findings in this paper indicate that social perceptions of honesty is a factor apart from social activities and values, at least when conceptualized by average beliefs of general honesty as in this paper, thus rejecting Putnam’s unitary view of the social capital concept while supporting the stress on social trust as a factor of its own (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043463112453546">Bjørnskov, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043463112453546">Fischer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1043463112453546">Naef and Schupp, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1043463112453546">Uslaner, 2002</xref>). It therefore <italic>a priori</italic> seems more fruitful to delve further into how social distance and exclusion of specific groups may translate into more or less trust in fellow citizens, and perhaps also how fair such distances are perceived to be.</p>
<p>At a more practical level, an issue in the public debate in the US, the United Kingdom, Australia and several European countries in recent years has been how to prevent declines in social capital, social trust, and the “glue” that binds society together. The issue was an underlying current in much of the presidential campaign of Barack Obama in 2008, and remains a political issue in several European countries, for example in Germany where similar issues such the concept of “Sozialer Kälte” (the social cold) dominate much political debate. Such debates are important but judging from comparisons across the US, the chances that the simplistic public policy advice forwarded by many commentators can affect citizens’ faith in the honesty of each other seem rather slim. Yet, the topic is far from trivial as recent research on, for example, governance and economic growth suggests that such factors have strong societal effects.</p>

<title>Constructing the social activity and traditional values factors</title>
<p>To construct the two social activity indices, I employed the individual-level data on how frequently within the last 12 months an individual has participated in one of 20 different activities consistently included in the annual DDB Needham survey. Following the similar approach in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043463112453546">Bjørnskov (2008b)</xref>, these activities included: bowling, camping, playing cards, attending church or other place of worship, going to a classical concert, going to a pop or rock concert, going clothes shopping, going to a club meeting, working on a community project, giving or attending a dinner party, going out to dinner at a restaurant, entertaining people in one’s own home, sending a greeting card, attending a lecture, going to the movies, going on a picnic, attending a sporting event, going swimming, playing tennis, and visiting an art gallery or museum.</p>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1043463112453546">Putnam’s (2000)</xref> findings and his theoretical notion of social capital, one would expect that they all loaded onto a single component in the principal components analysis used here to construct the indices. Instead following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1043463112453546">Stolle (1998)</xref>, one would expect that the activities split into those creating weak and strong ties, respectively. Yet, as <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1043463112453546">Table 7</xref> shows, the data on social activities form two distinct dimensions that follow neither theoretical perspective. Five principal components have eigenvalues above one, but a standard scree plot shows a clear elbow at two components, which is the solution chosen in this paper.</p>

<p>Likewise, the “traditional values” factor is constructed by principal components analysis, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1043463112453546">Table 8</xref>. Four traditional characteristics of American society – at least seen from the outside – combine to form one factor: (1) the support for a male head of the family, reflecting traditional gender roles; (2) economic patriotism as reflected in the statement that Americans ought to buy American products; (3) strong skepticism towards communism; and (4) support for private gun ownership, reflecting the right to self-defense. While these variables might be questioned as appropriate measures of traditional values, it is clear that the resulting index varies quite considerably over time as well as across the 48 states considered here.</p>

<p>The choice of instruments relies on common sense and known associations across the US. In all but one case, I use dummies for the Southern and “border” states as they tend to be poorer, ideologically different, and poorer in terms of social capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1043463112453546">Poole and Rosenthal, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1043463112453546">Putnam, 2000</xref>). For income inequality, I use the log to GSP per capita, as skill-biased technological development has contributed to inequality in recent decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1043463112453546">Lemieux, 2006</xref>), dummies for Southern and “border states” that historically have tended to have more inequality, and the share of inhabitants who voted for the Democratic candidate in presidential elections. Both state dummies and voting patterns proxy for political effects on the income distribution. The instruments for distrust in politicians are the dummy for “border states” and the protest vote share, i.e. the share of voters who in presidential elections voted for non-establishment third candidates such as Ross Perot or Ralph Nader.</p>
<p>The instruments for optimism (“better income in the future”) are the actual state income, a dummy for the perhaps more cosmopolitan coastal states, and interest in politics, which proxies for a broader interest in society known to be associated with optimism (pessimists tend to withdraw). These are supplemented by the protest vote, which proxies for an overall skeptical evaluation of the prospects of the country. Instruments for traditional values are straightforward, as they also tend to be associated with postmodernism, and thus economic development, and traditional ideological positions: the log to GSP per capita, dummies for Southern and “border” states, and the Democratic vote share.</p>
<p>The same variables, except the border state dummy, serve as instruments for the share of the state population with a high school degree. However, while state income is obviously positively associated with education, the Democratic vote share is negatively associated with high school graduates, given state incomes. Finally, the active social activity index is instrumented by four variables: state income, the Southern and border state dummies, and the protest vote share. Income is negatively associated with these activities that tend to crowd out work hours (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1043463112453546">Tönnies, [1957] 2001</xref>) while the state dummies proxy for parts of the US in which outdoor activities may be too hot for part of the year or too dangerous, as well as historical circumstance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1043463112453546">Putnam, 2000</xref>). The final instrument is the protest vote, which again proxies for the share of individuals that in general do not share the overall world view of most Americans, and therefore apparently socialize less.</p>

<p>Several papers have explored time series data aggregated at the US level (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1043463112453546">Keele, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1043463112453546">Paxton, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1043463112453546">Putnam, 2000</xref>). However, to the best of my knowledge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043463112453546">Brown and Uslaner (2005)</xref> is the only study to apply a panel data approach to this issue.</p></fn>

<p>Throughout the paper, I refer to the concept of fractionalization, as this is what virtually all trust studies deal with. However, Gini coefficients, Herfindal indices and most other fractionalization measures do not include features such as the skewness of the underlying distribution or its spatial characteristics, even though it may be important. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1043463112453546">Montalvo and Reynal-Querol (2005)</xref> carefully outline this set of problems and the data requirements to solve them.</p></fn>

Early research in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043463112453546">Glaeser et al. (2000)</xref> seemed to indicate that trust questions were not associated with trusting behavior in trust experiments. More recent experiments suggest that the simple trust question as well as questions capturing honesty perceptions are good predictors of actual behavior in experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043463112453546">Cox et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1043463112453546">Naef and Schupp, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1043463112453546">Thöni et al., 2009</xref>). A possible exception is when the stakes in the game are not of “economic significance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1043463112453546">Sapienza et al., 2007</xref>). The early confusion instead seems to be due to Glaeser et al. failing to anonymize their experiments. Finally, with respect to the choice of using the share of respondents answering in the two top categories, this choice solves a problem besides response style bias. A set of tests using the share of respondents answering in the bottom two categories, i.e. using a measure of distrust, showed that these scores were determined by entirely different determinants. These results are available upon request.</p></fn>

<p>The choice of aggregating annual data into three decadal scores is dictated by two concerns. First, the sample size in all but the largest states is too small to make annual scores credible. Even with decadal averages, some of the smallest states still have only about 100 observations. Second, averaging across several years arguably alleviates the potential problem of having specific questions only included in some years in the questionnaire that occur before the honesty question. Having the honesty question placed after other questions that respondents answer particularly positively or negatively tends to bias the responses in the same direction of preceding questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1043463112453546">Naef and Schupp, 2009</xref>).</p></fn>

<p>It must be noted that I do not provide an IV estimate for passive social activities, as I found no set of variables that explained a sufficient amount of the variation of this type to satisfy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1043463112453546">Staiger and Stock’s (1997)</xref> rule of thumb. However, the “best” IV estimate with a first stage <italic>F</italic> statistic of eight was insignificant and of the opposite sign as the simple estimate in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1043463112453546">Table 4</xref>.</p></fn>

<p>Employing either a feasible generalized least squares estimator with random effects or simple ordinary least squares yields very similar results, as does a fixed effects estimator. As such, the choice of estimator seems inconsequential as neither type will change the results. The only difference is that the latter is less efficient and therefore yields an estimated effect of income inequality that is not significantly different from those reported in the tables but only weakly significant.</p></fn>
