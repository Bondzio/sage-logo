<abstract>
<p>Economic factors play an increasingly important role in the management of medical conditions. This study evaluated the economic impact of seizures in children in the United States using a large national data set known as the Kids’ Inpatient Database (KID). The aim of this study was to characterize hospitalizations including total costs, length of stay, and variations in care. There were 63 719 pediatric seizure discharges in the 2003 and 2006 Kids’ Inpatient Database. The mean hospital cost was $4105 in 2003 and $4553 in 2006. Patients with government insurance as the primary payer had a significantly longer length of stay compared with private insurance or self-pay patients (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001); however, there was no significant difference in the total costs of hospitalization between the different payer groups. This analysis highlights multiple disparities of health care utilization in pediatric seizure management. In a stressful economic climate, all health care entities must focus on cost management of pediatric seizure.</p>

<body>
<p>Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders worldwide, affecting more than 50 million persons.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811436325">1</xref>
</sup> This disorder affects an estimated 2.1 to 2.7 million persons in the United States, making it second only to migraine.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811436325">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811436325">3</xref>
</sup> The estimate of the total indirect and direct cost of epilepsy in the United States was reported at $12.5 billion in 1995.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811436325">4</xref>
</sup> When this reported cost is converted to a 2004 dollar value using Bureau of Labor Statistics data, one of the most recent estimates of the cost of epilepsy is $15.5 billion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811436325">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Although there is considerable literature on epilepsy and associated costs, there is a paucity of information regarding the cost burden of inpatient seizure management, including first and recurrent seizure, in children in the United States. Population-based studies of the incidence of first unprovoked seizures suggest that there are between 25 000 and 40 000 children per year in the United States who experience a first unprovoked seizure.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811436325">6</xref>

</sup> The recurrence risk of seizure and therefore epilepsy varies depending on the cause of seizure. The recurrence rate for children after the first seizure is between 30% and 50% by 2 years in those who develop idiopathic or cryptogenic epilepsy, whereas the rate is generally more than 50% in patients with remote symptomatic epilepsy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811436325">10</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073811436325"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811436325">12</xref>
</sup> Because there is a large proportion of children who may not develop epilepsy, it is important to expand our knowledge of the costs associated with seizure management rather than just focus on epilepsy. This study evaluates the scope of the annual cost burden and hospital outcomes of pediatric seizure.</p>
<p>As we face decreased allocated health care funds, there is increasing importance in understanding health care utilization in different pediatric health problems. Many pediatric health issues including asthma, traumatic brain injuries, vaso-occlusive crises in sickle cell disease, cerebral palsy, and stroke have been studied.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073811436325">13</xref>

</sup> It is important to understand how hospital factors affect outcomes such as length of stay and total costs. Hospital characteristics such as profit status and teaching status have been shown to affect these outcomes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883073811436325">18</xref>
</sup> Currently, data regarding health care utilization for pediatric seizure are limited. Our objective was to examine hospital discharge data provided by the Kids’ Inpatient Database (KID) in the United States from 2003 and from 2006. Our analysis focused on differences in hospitalization outcomes including hospital-related charges and costs and length of stay in children discharged with seizure. We also examined the data for significant demographic and clinical variation that contribute to the overall cost and duration of hospitalization.</p>
<sec id="section1-0883073811436325" sec-type="methods">
<title>Patients and Methods</title>
<p>We used an administrative discharge database known as the Kids’ Inpatient Database from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883073811436325">19</xref>
</sup> The Kids’ Inpatient Database is a large all-payer, inpatient care database in the United States that tracks inpatient hospital use in children ages 0 to 20 years for both common and uncommon childhood illnesses. The Kids’ Inpatient Database is drawn from 36 (2003) and 38 (2006) states and contains de-identified patient-level clinical information from inpatient hospitalizations from more than 3438 (2003) and 3739 (2006) hospitals, including nonfederal, short-term, nonrehabilitation, community, and specialty hospitals. The Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project developed survey weights to apply to the 1 692 189 discharge records in 2003 and 1 731 418 in 2006 with inpatient parameters to obtain national representative estimates of hospitals that agreed to participate. To comply with the requirements of the Kids’ Inpatient Database, if there were fewer than 11 discharges before statistical weighting for a given variable, that variable was excluded from further analysis to avoid biased statistical weighting. Systematic random sampling was used to select 10% of pediatric cases from each hospital. National estimates were obtained by the use of discharge weights that were developed by using the American Hospital Association universe as the standard. Additional information on the Kid’s Inpatient Database is available at the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Web site http://hcup-us.ahrq.gov.</p>
<p>The <italic>International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification</italic> (ICD-9-CM) code 780.39 (other convulsions: convulsive disorder not otherwise specified, fit not otherwise specified, recurrent convulsions not otherwise specified, and seizure not otherwise specified) was used to establish the population for analyses. The description of the discharge data regarding the ICD-9-CM 780.39 from this point forward will be referred to as <italic>seizure.</italic> The Kids’ Inpatient Database contains up to 15 diagnostic ICD-9-CM codes per discharge. We limited the analyses to the primary discharge position in an effort to increase the likelihood that the patient was admitted and treated for a seizure rather than a different diagnosis that was not seizure related, such as cerebral palsy. When all 15 discharge positions were searched for seizure in both 2003 and 2006, seizure was in the primary discharge position 52% of the time. Our population was compared with all other children without seizures as the primary diagnosis excluding all hospital births. We also searched the database using the ICD-9-CM code 345.xx (epilepsy) for comparison as well as for coding data. This enabled us to look at a symptom (seizure) as well as a disease (epilepsy) approach to coding.</p>
<p>Both patient- and hospital-level variables were evaluated for significant associations. Patient-level variables included sex, race/ethnicity, age, median household income for patient’s zip code, and insurance payer. Hospital level variables included ownership/control, teaching status, rural/urban location, United States region, total charges, and length of stay. The Kids’ Inpatient Database 2003 and 2006 data sets were used because these years contained inpatient cost-to-charge ratios for almost every hospital in the data set and therefore the costs could be estimated. When the cost-to-charge ratio was unavailable for a specific hospital, the Kids’ Inpatient Database provided a weighted average cost-to-charge for hospitals in a given group. The costs were calculated by multiplying the cost-to-charge ratio by the charges for the hospital services. Discharge weights for charge/cost data were further modified by multiplying the discharge weight by the ratio of the total sum of the discharge weights to the sum of the discharge weights for records with nonmissing total charges, as recommended in the <italic>Cost-to-Charge Ratio User’s Guide</italic>.</p>
<p>Descriptive statistics were generated at the patient and hospital level among children admitted for seizures and compared with all other admissions using SAS (Version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina). All analyses of the data parameters were performed using the weighting structures provided by Kids’ Inpatient Database and are considered to be representative of the US population. These weights make the national estimates of the hospitalization rates comparable between years even when there are varying numbers of states and hospitals participating in the Kids’ Inpatient Database. The SAS procedures that were used to derive weighted percentages, weighted means, and <italic>P</italic> values for group differences were Surveyfreq, Surveymeans, and Surveyreg. The distributions of outcomes of length of stay, cost, and charge were skewed; therefore, additional analyses using log transformation were conducted. There was no overall difference in results compared with the original (untransformed) regression analysis. Because we were interested in subjects who were 1 month or older, all domain analyses (required because of the weighted structure of the data) included a dichotomous variable that defined whether the subject was at least 1 month old at the time of discharge. This was required so that the resulting variance estimates, and subsequent confidence intervals, used the sampling weights correctly. The Institutional Review Board waived the approval process for this study.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>There were 19 723 actual hospital discharges for children with the ICD-9-CM code 780.39 in 2003 and 18 536 discharges in 2006 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883073811436325">Table 1</xref>). After we excluded neonatal and delivery-related ICD-9-CM codes such as V300.0 (single live-born in hospital), code 780.39 was the eighth and the ninth most common discharge diagnoses, respectively, in 2003 and 2006. Using the weighting parameters, this generated an estimated 33 110 and 30 609 discharges in 2003 and 2006, respectively. The description of the discharge data from this point forward refers to the numbers after statistical weighting that are representative of national hospitalization of children with seizure. Further analysis of the discharge diagnoses, using different combinations of seizure (780.39) and epilepsy, not otherwise specified (345.xx), were performed for 2003 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073811436325">Figure 1</xref>). Fewer than 400 discharges contained both seizure and epilepsy simultaneously.</p>

<p>In both 2003 and 2006, there were slightly more males than females discharged with seizure (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0883073811436325">Table 2</xref>). Children in the age group 1 month to 4 years of age had the highest proportion of discharges (2003, 35%; 2006, 34%) followed by children age 15 to 20 years (2003, 26%; 2006, 28%). The majority of children discharged with a seizure diagnosis were from lower income households in both 2003 (53%) and 2006 (53%). Private insurance covered the largest proportion of children (2003, 50%; 2006, 47%) followed closely by governmental insurance (2003, 42%; 2006, 44%). The most common hospital of discharge was a nonprofit private hospital. Most patients were discharged from urban teaching hospitals (2003, 71%; 2006, 75%). Although all regions of the United States had similar numbers of seizure discharges, the Northeast had slightly more (2003, 28%; 2006, 30%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0883073811436325">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>The mean length of stay for children discharged with seizure was 2.4 days for both 2003 and 2006 compared with 3.7 and 3.9 days in 2003 and 2006 for non–seizure-related discharges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0883073811436325">Figure 2A</xref>). Comparing both 2003 and 2006, Hispanics and Asian/Pacific islanders stayed slightly longer than people of other ethnicities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0883073811436325">Table 4</xref>). Not only did age groups 1 month to 4 years and 15 years to 20 years have the highest proportion of seizure discharges, these groups also had slightly longer hospitalizations (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). In 2006, patients in the highest income households had a significantly shorter length of stay (2.2 days) compared with other income groups (<italic>P</italic> = .001). Patients who had government insurance as the primary payer had a significantly longer length of stay on average compared with patients with private insurance or self-pay (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). Other variables significantly associated with length of stay were hospital ownership and hospital location and teaching status (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0883073811436325">Table 4</xref>).</p>

<p>The total cost and charge of a seizure hospitalization for 2003 averaged $4102 and $10 106 and for 2006 $4553 and $12 546, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0883073811436325">Table 5</xref>). A regression analysis demonstrated a statistically significant positive slope between length of stay and both cost and charge (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). The costs rose by $1616 per day in 2003 and similarly in 2006. The mean cost and charge per hospitalization for children discharged with seizure were lower compared with children discharged with a nonseizure diagnosis for both 2003 and 2006 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0883073811436325">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0883073811436325">2C</xref>). Hispanics and Asian/Pacific Islanders were among the ethnicities with the more expensive seizure discharges in 2003 and 2006. Comparing 2003 and 2006, the total costs for the top 50% of income earners did not significantly change; however, there was a significant increase in the total costs in the lower 50% of earners. In 2003, the cost of hospitalizations was approximately 22% more in the private hospitals compared with governmental hospitals (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). In 2003, there was no significant difference in total costs of hospitalization between the different payer groups including governmental insurance, private insurance, and self-pay. Although there was an overall significant difference in total costs in the payer groups in 2006, further pairwise analyses such as Medicare versus Medicaid did not show individual significant differences (<italic>P</italic> = .06). There was no statistically significant payer effect in 2003 regarding the hospitalization charges. However, in 2006, there was an overall payer effect (<italic>P</italic> = .009). Further analyses showed a significant difference in the hospitalization charges between private insurance and the self-pay group ($12 802 and $11 293, respectively, <italic>P</italic> = .01).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To our knowledge this is the first attempt to evaluate hospital outcomes including total costs and charges and length of stay of pediatric seizure using a national data set. Seizure-related discharges account for an estimated 1% of the $13 billion in 2003 and $19 billion in 2006 of the total cost of pediatric health care in the United States. During 2003 and 2006, there were 63 719 hospital discharges for children with seizure, accounting for approximately 152 926 hospital days and $250 445 078 in total costs and $710 727 285 in total charges.</p>
<p>Although seizures and epilepsy transcend all economic levels, our data show multiple disparities in health care utilization among the socioeconomic groups. We found that the majority of children discharged with seizure were from lower income households; however, children from the higher income households had costlier hospitalizations. We could not verify the total number of children who were treated in the emergency departments for seizures and discharged rather than admitted; however, it is possible that lower income families are using the emergency department more often than higher income families. This could lead to a disparity of admissions for seizures among socioeconomic groups. Other studies using nationwide data sets have shown similar associations between lower income patients and a higher proportion of hospital discharges.<sup>

</sup> Stern et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0883073811436325">21</xref>
</sup> showed within adult literature that poor patients used the emergency department more and were admitted with a higher frequency than moderate or high income patients. Concerning seizures, Benn et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0883073811436325">22</xref>
</sup> showed that lower income patients, including children, from the Manhattan, New York, area had the highest proportion of first unprovoked seizures. Within the epilepsy literature, there are studies, mainly of adults, that show a higher risk of epilepsy in people who have a lower socioeconomic status.<sup>

</sup>
</p>
<p>We also found an association between length of stay and socioeconomic status. In 2006, patients in the higher socioeconomic status had a significantly shorter length of stay compared with other socioeconomic groups. Another pediatric study on children with perforated appendicitis showed that the length of hospitalization was shortest in high-income patients. That study also showed that with equal access to care, the disparities in medical management decreased.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0883073811436325">25</xref>
</sup> Similarly, other studies found the length of stay to be significantly longer in poor patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0883073811436325">26</xref>
</sup> Although we cannot confirm based on the nature of the database, we hypothesize that patients in the lower socioeconomic groups may have more complex social situations or require more resources that may lead to significantly longer hospitalizations.</p>
<p>We showed a statistically longer hospitalization in patients with government insurance as the primary payer compared with patients with private insurance or who were self-pay. This has been similarly found in other studies using nationwide data sets.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883073811436325">20</xref>
</sup> Likewise, we hypothesize that there may be different motivating factors for some physicians, such as incentives to reduce health care utilization, that may translate to shorter hospitalizations. The motivation for a shorter hospitalization for a self-pay patient is obvious. However, given the nature of the database, we could not test these hypotheses. In the climate of cost-efficient medicine, evaluating this finding in the seizure population is an important future direction. It would be important to assess whether outcomes were different between these payer groups.</p>
<p>The data from the Kids’ Inpatient Database demonstrated that the oldest and the youngest children with seizure experience longer and costlier hospitalizations compared with the children in the 2 middle age groups. We performed domain regression analyses on the characteristics of the children to evaluate for significant associations between these age groups and the hospital outcomes. Our results showed a statistically significant relationship in both these age groups between a higher number of discharge diagnoses and a longer length of stay (2003, age group 4 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001; 2006, age group 1 <italic>P</italic> = .0070 and age group 4 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). Similarly, there was significance between the higher number of procedures and the length of stay (2003, age group 1 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001; 2006, age group 1 <italic>P</italic> = .0008 and age group 4 <italic>P</italic> = .002). An interesting question that we cannot answer because the information is not included in the Kids’ Inpatient Database concerns what types of procedures are being more frequently provided in these age groups compared with the others. This would be an interesting area of study to evaluate and compare the procedures used in different regions of the country in the workup of pediatric seizure.</p>
<p>Our study showed that there was no significant difference in the cost of hospitalization between the different payer groups. Although there is a notable difference among the payer groups and the cost of the hospitalization in 2006, when pairs were analyzed individually the costs did not reach statistical significance (<italic>P</italic> = .06). This finding is interesting considering that patients with government insurance have significantly longer hospitalizations. At this level, it might appear that there is no financial benefit for hospitals to treat privately insured patients rather than government-insured patients. In 2006, the charge of the hospitalization was significantly lower in the self-pay group compared with the private insurance. This lower charge may reflect the hospitals’ effort to be more charitable and decrease the financial burden on the self-pay patients. An important area for future research, particularly with the upcoming changes in health care, would be to evaluate for differences in costs, charges, and reimbursement amounts among the different payers in the seizure population.</p>
<p>Because there is variation in coding and billing practices among physicians, billers, and institutions, we further analyzed discharge diagnoses using different combinations of seizure (780.39) and epilepsy, not otherwise specified (345.xx) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073811436325">Figure 1</xref>). Fewer than 400 discharges contained both seizure and epilepsy simultaneously in both 2003 and 2006. The number of discharges with seizure in the primary diagnostic position and without epilepsy in the other positions (32 968 in 2003 and 30 546 in 2006) is well within the range of the 25 000 to 40 000 estimated annual first-time seizures.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073811436325">9</xref>
</sup> However, we suspect that some of these seizures may represent admission of patients who have epilepsy with seizure breakthroughs, making the smaller population (142 in 2003 and 63 in 2006) larger. Although a patient could be admitted for multiple reasons not pertaining to a seizure breakthrough, we suspect that the number of patients with epilepsy in the primary diagnostic position but without seizure in the other positions (229 in 2003 and 153 in 2006) is also higher.</p>
<p>The cost of medical delivery is very complex. There are frequent changes in coding and billing that require physicians to continuously be educated in an effort to be up-to-date. There has been a significant amount of discussion surrounding coding, billing, and reimbursements in the headache literature. The American Headache Society has a dedicated ongoing discussion on this topic to better educate neurologists regarding tips to be successful in this ever-changing and challenging domain.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0883073811436325">27</xref>
</sup> Stuart Black, author of the Headache Coding Corner, points out differences between the use of symptom (headache) versus disease (migraine) in coding.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0883073811436325">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0883073811436325">28</xref>
</sup> We believe that this study offers a step in the direction of understanding coding of a symptom (seizure) versus a disease (epilepsy). In general, hospitals are reimbursed by the type of service provided. Outpatient and inpatient services are reimbursed at a percentage of billed charges for nongovernmental payers. Governmental payers reimburse outpatient services using a fee schedule and reimburse inpatient services using a diagnosis-related group. Diagnosis-related groups consist of unique codes that classify hospital cases into 1 of approximately 500 groups. The diagnosis related groups are assigned by a “grouper” program based on ICD-9-CM diagnoses, procedures, age, sex, and the presence of complications. Hospitals are paid a set fee for treating patients in a single diagnosis-related group category, regardless of the actual cost of care for the individual patient. If charges reach a certain threshold, additional payments will be made using an outlier method. The diagnosis codes 780.39 (seizure) and 345.xx (epilepsy, not otherwise specified) compute to the same diagnosis-related group. Therefore, a possible difference in reimbursement between these 2 ICD-9-CM codes would largely be dependent on reaching a certain threshold.</p>
<p>The current <italic>Procedural Terminology Code</italic> associated with a visit is for the professional services provided. Professional services are reimbursed based on the contractual amount agreed upon by the provider and the payer. The current <italic>Procedural Terminology Code</italic> is a set of codes, descriptions, and guidelines intended to describe procedures and services performed by physicians and other health care providers. The nature of physician’s work varies by type of service, place of service, and the patient’s status. The history, examination, and medical decision making are the key components in selecting a level of evaluation/management service. Documentation must support the level of service billed. Use of symptom diagnoses should not be used when a definitive diagnosis has been established. Documenting the diagnosis with as much specificity as possible will become increasingly important with the implementation of <italic>International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification</italic> in 2013, which has more than 70 000 diagnostic codes, compared with the ICD-9-CM coding system, which includes approximately 14 000 diagnosis codes. As the amount of reimbursement continues to become contractually smaller, it is of utmost importance that neurologists be more scrupulous regarding their documentation practice. An important direction for future research is to evaluate the difference in average reimbursements depending on the specific diagnosis (ie, seizure versus epilepsy) in the diagnosis-related groups and the different levels of service.</p>
<p>There are limitations to this study that need to be considered when interpreting the results. First, without identifiers in the database it is impossible to validate the discharge diagnostic code for each patient. Diagnostic coding can vary between physicians, institutions, and states. It is possible that some patients with a first epileptic seizure did not receive the ICD-9-CM 780.39 or alternatively that some patients did not truly have an epileptic seizure. Literature shows that even experts in epilepsy may have difficulty diagnosing a seizure in up to 25% of cases.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073811436325">11</xref>
</sup> Either of these possibilities could lead to an over- or underestimation of the frequency of seizure discharges in this national data set. Second, studies have shown that some seizures are unrecognized by the child or family or the family may not seek medical attention.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0883073811436325">29</xref>
</sup> This could decrease the number of seizure discharges as well as the expected associated costs. A third limitation of the study is attributable to the type of information that is not included in the Kid’s Inpatient Database. The Kids’ Inpatient Database contains only inpatient hospital-related data and does not include the health care utilization associated with urgent care, emergent care, or an outpatient clinic visit. This would lead to an underestimate of the total direct costs. The Kids’ Inpatient Database also does not contain the indirect or intangible costs associated with seizure management; therefore, our results reflect only an estimate of the entire portion of the total costs associated with seizure management. However, despite these limitations, the Kids’ Inpatient Database provides an important insight into the hospital care and the health care utilization in a common pediatric condition such as seizure.</p>
<p>As the need for more efficient medicine becomes a focal point in our health care system, this study provides a baseline for future comparative studies to evaluate trends in our health care utilization in pediatric seizure. This study showed that pediatric seizure discharges were significantly more expensive in urban teaching hospitals and that there were no differences in total hospitalization cost among the insurance payer groups. As the landscape in health care seems to constantly change, it is imperative that all entities search for effective intervention strategies to decrease the economic burden of managing a common pediatric illness such as the pediatric seizure.</p>
