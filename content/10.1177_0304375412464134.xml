<abstract>
<p>Marx and Engels warned that class struggle would result “either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.” This essay argues that through the effect of neoliberal networked economy, we have had <italic>both</italic> a “revolutionary reconstitution of society” and the “common ruin” of both bourgeois and proletarian classes. Their “common ruin” is expressed through their lack of viability as the basis for their respective democratic projects—liberalism and socialism. The revolution in information technologies and the rise of the neoliberal network society has transformed the nature of political power that had been founded upon traditional industrial forms of production and social–political organization. The essay develops a theory of technological change and a subsequent transformation in our relationship with time. By emphasizing the dialectic of technological–temporal change in the nature and quality of political power, we see that the very basis of both power and politics has become transformed in ways that negatively affect the potential of democratic forms of power, liberal, or socialist. The essay ends with a call for a new political approach to time, a “temporal sovereignty” to revive and renew the basis of democracy within a networked society.</p>

<title>The Age of Multipolar Power?</title>
<p>Across the world, the analysis of the nature of political power in the post–Cold War age continues to generate debate. It is a disciplinary discussion that tends to occur in the specialized realms of political science, which then feeds the higher reaches of political policy formation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0304375412464134">1</xref>
</sup> However, there is also a “mainstream” view that shapes debate and <italic>zeitgeist</italic> at a more intangible level. This finds expression in “serious” newspapers and newsweeklies and in wider media forums such as radio and TV debates and documentaries. Fareed Zakaria, an elite insider and popularizer of political theory is such one influential analyst. Zakaria argues that political power has become more diffuse and dispersed. His is a “multipolar” view of power that states that with the rise of globalization and the economic and cultural force of a range of countries commonly known as the Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC), the power concentration that was a central feature of the Cold War and its powerordering has dissolved. This “diffusion of power” spreads not only among a larger array of nation-states but also through multilateral organizations such as the World Trade Organization, nongovernmental organizations and—importantly for our purposes—the global corporation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0304375412464134">2</xref>
</sup> In similar vein, political theorist A. Wess Mitchell has called the current phase the “multipolar moment.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0304375412464134">3</xref>
</sup> This is a time, so the argument goes, when globalization has brought multipolarity to the global scale for the first time in history. As Mitchell goes on, “The closest parallel we have to it is late 19th century Europe, with its narrow power differentials and multiple actors jostling for influence in the finely tuned regional balance of power.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0304375412464134">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Such analogizing implies that we live in a similar political and economic world to <italic>La Belle Époque</italic>. But we are very far from it. Multipolarity does not capture what we are now experiencing in what might be more properly termed the generation-long “neoliberal moment” where the balance of power is not between competing state actors but primarily between rising corporations and diminishing political institutions—and occurs in the context of an utterly transformed technological basis for the functioning of capitalism. So what does the apparent decline of state-centered power and political institutions actually signify?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0304375412464134">
<title>Political Power in the Neoliberal Disorder</title>
<p>While acceptance of the idea of the shift to a multipolar world is fairly widespread, the concept misses the point of what has been happening since the 1970s. What I want to do is to show that the world made possible by the tectonic grinding of technological and economic forces of neoliberal globalization has created a profound crisis for our conceptions of power and democracy—and of the class bases from which these have been formed. This stems from the argument I will make which states that economic globalization and the concomitant revolution in information and communication technologies (ICTs) have resulted in the global triumph of capitalism. Importantly, however, it does not follow that this has been a triumph of the bourgeoisie and the state-based world order that they created since the eighteenth century. Still less, clearly, has this been a triumph for the proletariat, the working classes of the world.</p>
<p>The central point is that the combined dynamics of the information technology revolution and neoliberal economics is making bourgeois and socialist democracy <italic>obsolete</italic> in both theory and practice. This is because the thought world that holds democratic institutions together, that is to say, the ideas and traditions and habits that come to us from the age of Enlightenment—from Paine and Jefferson as well as Marx and Engels—are unable to function effectively in a world that is becoming dominated by new relationships with information (knowledge) and with temporality (time space). Through an analysis of the political effects of the information technologies and temporality, we will see that the neoliberal globalization it has created has caused the nature of power to change and the practice of democracy to become unstuck. Consideration of these dynamics is therefore fundamental if we are to recognize the crisis of democracy and to provide a conceptual basis for an understanding of what may be done about it.</p>
<p>The failure to think systematically about how democracy is being transformed by ICTs and neoliberal globalization means that we deny ourselves the capacity to see what is actually at stake. In the <italic>Communist Manifesto</italic>, Marx and Engels gave a hint of what the cost of the failure of communism and the failure of liberal democracy would entail: for them it spelled the “common ruin of the contending classes.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0304375412464134">5</xref>
</sup> With the advent of what I shall term neoliberal power we will see that what has emerged is not only the utter implausibility (now) of the socialist project but also the impracticality of the historical possibilities set out in the bourgeois project of liberal democracy. This is so because neoliberalism and the ICT revolution have, together, created an expression of what Marx and Engels also foresaw as “ . . . such a gigantic means of production and of exchange [which] like the sorcerer . . . is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world . . . called up by his spells.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0304375412464134">6</xref>
</sup> In our own time, a network society <italic>postmodernity</italic> is rapidly evolving wherein the logic of “common ruin” begins to take hold. Let us look at this more closely and then consider the consequences of Marx and Engels’ phrase, one that, as Terry Eagleton observed has been “well-nigh universally overlooked” since it was written in 1848.<sup>

<title>Flows of Capital and Flows of Power</title>
<p>Part of the problem of an all-encompassing globalization, a social, economic, political and cultural process that colonizes every nook and cranny of life is that its very complexity means that disciplinary thinking alone will not capture its essence. Probably nothing fully and accurately can. Nonetheless, an incapacitating kind of silo thinking still tends to dominate in political theory, in sociology, in politics—and in the novice discipline of media theory as well. I borrow from all these disciplines, and more, to arrive at the perspectives I put forward here. These are held together with the core elements of my work in the social theorization of time.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0304375412464134">8</xref>
</sup> The temporalized perspective is necessarily a transdisciplinary mode of inquiry, because time pervades every realm of life and its inclusion as a factor can act to energize and illuminate what might otherwise appear to be unprofitable intellectual inquiry. The economic historian and Noble Prize winner Douglass North understood this. Taking aim at political science in particular, he wrote that “I will be blunt: Without a deep understanding of time, you will be lousy political scientists, because time is the dimension in which ideas and institutions and beliefs evolve.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0304375412464134">9</xref>
</sup> In a globalized economy that is marked by speed, acceleration, and “time–space compression,”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0304375412464134">10</xref>
</sup> a greater understanding of what a new relationship with information and time means for our institutions and habits of mind we call democracy and social class are more urgent than ever.</p>
<p>At the turn of the century Perry Anderson pointed out that
<disp-quote>
<p>Ideologically, the novelty of the present situation stands out in historical view. It can be put like this. For the first time since the Reformation, there are no longer any significant oppositions—that is, systematic rival outlooks—within the thought-world of the West.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0304375412464134">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>His statement is obvious but consistently overlooked. Anderson is only partly correct, however. His point needs to be opened out—and the actual “novelty” revealed. We begin with power. Through a neoliberal globalization that is motivated and shaped by information technologies, power has become increasingly corporate and manifests in the flows of neoliberal capital. This process has two dimensions: first, global power increasingly resides within <italic>networks of production</italic> and second, power has become increasingly informational—based upon <italic>networks of computers</italic>.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0304375412464134">12</xref>
</sup> In other words, power no longer concentrates so much as it once did in parliaments and in congresses and in the institutions of nation-states. As Lash puts it, in the information age, “power is elsewhere.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0304375412464134">13</xref>
</sup> This has meant that power (political and corporate) is now highly contingent. It ebbs and flows with the vagaries of market forces, creating a <italic>nonpolarity</italic> (“no significant oppositions,” to employ Anderson’s phase) where power cannot consolidate for long before it feels the challenge and pressure of global competition. Nonpolarity might be the dream of the capitalist, a world where capital moves freely and like quicksilver; but for state-bound political institutions that are trapped within this globalizing logic, power that is elsewhere and is uncertain means that the project of democracy is deeply compromised.</p>
<p>Crucial to understanding the political importance of this shift is that neoliberalism takes itself to be a political theory as well as an economic one. A universal application of the “natural” forces of market competition melded closely with the universal liberal democratic concept of the sovereignty of the people. This is the Hayekian position that political freedom must be based upon an economic autonomy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0304375412464134">14</xref>
</sup> This is a kind of freedom where people fundamentally act as both economic agents and material consumers who respond to economic signals, and where democracy (and state power) would be minimal and would look after themselves in a plan-free (and largely localized) capitalism.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0304375412464134">15</xref>
</sup> However, as economies globalized, political power globalized with them through the novelty of computer networks. Beginning with Margaret Thatcher’s revolution in the United Kingdom and followed closely by Ronald Reagan’s transformation of the U.S. economy, power was deliberately ceded to the market by individual states (in the name of economic liberalism) and had the effect of siphoning off the basis of democracy to these same circuits of capital and production. As David Harvey notes of this process:
<disp-quote>
<p>The “success” of a particular state (national or local) is [now] often measured by the degree to which it captures flows of capital, builds the conditions favorable to further capital accumulation within its borders and achieves a high quality of daily life for its inhabitants.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0304375412464134">16</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>With their power leaching to global flows of capital, nation-states become vulnerable to these mercurial currents and to the social, cultural, and economic exigencies that a “favorable” investment climate demands. As the well-being of its people is a primary concern of the liberal democratic state, attracting capital is the guiding aegis under which the neoliberal state must now fulfill its “democratic” responsibilities. The metaphor of the “flow” of capital is a key one. Manuel Castells, in his Information Society<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0304375412464134">17</xref>
</sup> takes it to the level of the network, and his connecting of capital (as digital information) to the virtual spaces of representation allows insight into the nature of power and of politics in what is now a global networked society. More recently Castells has argued that the logic of the neoliberal network sets “compatible goals” between “political representation and [the] reproduction of capital.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0304375412464134">18</xref>
</sup> Global capital, in other words, must be seen to fit with an idea of global democracy. And in the age of the neoliberal hegemony of the network, the compatibility is one whose parameters are set largely by the imperatives of capital and the warranting of its free-flow through the network to the greatest extent possible.</p>

<title>Social Acceleration and the Project of Liberal Democracy</title>
<p>Tightly connected to its informational turn, neoliberal capitalism has affected a crisis of representation in the realms of culture, society, and politics—and does so in ways that have barely begun to register. For example, Harvey sees the central effect of the “resolution” of the crises of capitalism as one of time–space compression, whereby we “are forced to alter, sometimes in quite radical ways, how we represent the world to ourselves.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0304375412464134">19</xref>
</sup> Seeking to develop this idea along a more empirically grounded basis, Hartmut Rosa has made a major contribution toward a sociological perspective on the speed up in life due to the technological and economic trajectories of modernity. Surveying the trackline from classical to late modernity, Rosa identifies evidence of the rhythms of social interaction increasing in tempo, and the intensity of social interaction becoming correspondingly compacted within a given time frame. He writes:
<disp-quote>
<p> . . . the ideal-typical family structure in agrarian society tended to remain stable over the centuries, with generational turnover leaving the basic structure intact. In classical modernity, this structure was built to last for just a generation: it was organized around a couple and tended to disperse with the death of the couple. In late modernity, there is a growing tendency for family life-cycles to last less than an individual life-span: increasing rates of divorce and remarriage are the most obvious evidence for this. Similarly, in the world of work, in premodern societies the fathers occupation was inherited by the son—again, potentially over many generations. In classical modernity, occupational structures tended to change with generations: sons (and daughters) we free to choose their own profession, but they generally chose only once, i.e. for a lifetime. In late modernity, occupations no longer extend over the whole of a work-life; jobs change at a higher rate than generations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0304375412464134">20</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>
The emergence of neoliberalism corresponds with Rosa’s “late modernity.” Social life accelerates at a much faster rate because more is packed into the life span of the individual. It is important to recognize that this occurs because of changes in the technological base of capitalist economy. Of course, major technological change has always had the effect of transforming the temporal rhythms of economy and society. From the inception of the industrial revolution, clock time was imported into its logic to regularize and make plannable, capitalist production. Capitalist competition, in turn, ensured that these processes also <italic>accelerated</italic>.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0304375412464134">21</xref>
</sup> The time of the clock, however, is stable and unchanging, and gave a regularized rhythm to the base of economy and society. The advent of the network society, however, has created what has been termed “network time,” a computer-driven and open-ended rate of acceleration within which people as network users become deeply implicated.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0304375412464134">22</xref>
</sup> The effect is that in our own time, stability (such as it was) has become much less tenable in social life; a center that would hold (more or less) as a fulcrum around which social life could be narrated as a project begins to shake free of its moorings; and a society (and state) that saw planning and regulation and the projection of a political future for its citizens as its central <italic>raison d’être</italic> begins to turn toward market forces for meaning and inspiration. This broad social transition to a network time that displaces the dominant logic of the clock was described by Zygmunt Bauman as a “liquid modernity,” a simmering and bubbling cauldron of activity where the “long effort to accelerate the speed of movement has . . . reached its ‘natural limit’” in the age of computing.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0304375412464134">23</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>A generalized social acceleration has meant a breaching of the natural limit of the speed of democracy too. Modern politics has its own temporality, its own rhythms and sequences that evolved in the context of the culture and society within which it came into being in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0304375412464134">24</xref>
</sup> This was shaped (at least in its classically derived form) through face-to-face communication and through political debate and dialogue—and like the rest of industrializing society, was given predictability and regularity by the clock. These rhythms developed at a pace and at a speed that people and institutions could more or less cope with and could more or less function effectively in. It was a temporal process that laid the basis for the speed of democracy and the speed of modernity. As Sheldon Wolin phrased it
<disp-quote>
<p>Political time . . . requires an element of leisure, not in the sense of a leisure class . . . but in the sense of a leisurely pace. This is owing to the needs of political action to be preceded by deliberation and deliberation . . . takes time because it occurs in a setting of competing or conflicting but legitimate considerations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0304375412464134">25</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>
Jean Chesneaux has warned about the desynchronization between the political process and information networks, arguing that there exists now an “uneasy dialogue between speed and democracy” in a neoliberal context where acceleration has become one of the “paramount values” of our age.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0304375412464134">26</xref>
</sup> However, such writings have been scattered and their effect on a better understanding of the role of time in society and in its political processes—as Douglass North acutely recognized—has been limited.</p>
<p>In more systematic mode, William Scheuerman analyzes the effects of acceleration upon the political process in his book <italic>Liberal Democracy and the Social Acceleration of Time</italic>. He argues that classical liberal democracy was born in the eighteenth century with an innately <italic>modern</italic> temporality. In the United States he observes, through the “separation of powers” into judiciary, executive, and legislature, liberal democracy was directed simultaneously toward the three timeorientations of past, present and future. What this means in practice is that in its focus on precedent for the justification of their actions, the judiciary is past focused; through its ability to act quickly, the executive is oriented toward the present; and in its function as the planner and forecaster of social needs the legislature is oriented, primarily, toward the future.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0304375412464134">27</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>This deep-seated embedding of temporality within a modern teleology was augmented through liberal democracy’s entrenchment in the enlightenment communication networks of the eighteenth century and beyond—in the print-based <italic>communication networks</italic> that Robert Darnton called the “great epistolary exchange” that created the “republic of letters.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0304375412464134">28</xref>
</sup> This network of information exchange—communication networks that, as Regis Debray observed, “enable thought to have social existence”—fueled liberal democracy with its ideas as well as its communicative rhythmicities.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0304375412464134">29</xref>
</sup> Most important of all, through the powerful symbioses between liberal democracy and a rising capitalist industrialism, this teleology and these rhythms were given a structural coherence and coordinative logic though the clock that served to mathematically entime early modern societies, creating what E. P. Thompson famously described as the “new universe of disciplined time”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0304375412464134">30</xref>
</sup> and what Paul Glennie and Nigel Thrift saw as a modern “mode of time consciousness.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0304375412464134">31</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>All this amounted to an unprecedentedly powerful temporal drive. What was in effect a systematic “machine time” allowed liberal democracy to conquer all before it in terms of its functioning as the political annex of modernity and capital. Indeed, as Scheuerman puts it, over the eighteenth and ninetienth centuries: “The modern [liberal democratic] nation-state triumphed over an array of competing modes of political organization (empires, loose networks of city-states) in part because of its superior manipulation of speed.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0304375412464134">32</xref>
</sup> Scheuerman’s book is a valuable one, but its systematicity on the subject of time falls short of a theory of time that would explain <italic>why</italic> there was an “acceleration” of social and political time. In an earlier essay, as in his book, Scheuerman chooses safe political science ground, and so we get a straight historical narrative that takes us up to the stage of 1980s globalization when, “Ours [becomes] an increasingly high-speed society.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0304375412464134">33</xref>
</sup> But there is no attempt to make sense of why this might be happening. Shortly, I will give insight into the “why” question—as well as supply a solid theoretical basis to underpin a very important effect to which Scheuerman points.</p>
<p>It was observed earlier that contemporary social acceleration might be explained by locating the process in the changes in the technological and political bases of capitalism and achieves this through the interaction of computing and neoliberalism especially. We need to develop this point some more. The <italic>networking of capitalism</italic> (the flow of capital and of power) has transformed it as a mode of production. Until the late 1960s at least, the post war Fordist and dirigist structuring of society brought rising living standards to millions of western workers and took liberal (social) democracy to new heights of power and legitimacy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0304375412464134">34</xref>
</sup> Across the west, a rational and plannable mode of production fused with welfarist-interventionist and bureaucratically minded political institutions to create what has been described as a “total way of life,” with the nation-state a primary actor.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0304375412464134">35</xref>
</sup> But growing affluence and complacency masked a mode of production that was increasingly beset by crises. At the global level, corporate profits began to stagnate or fall by the early 1970s, and the “managed economy” approach by governments, organized labor, and big business was not working as well as it did in an earlier context of easy profitability.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0304375412464134">36</xref>
</sup> Businesses were increasingly feeling—real or imagined—the suffocation of worker power and government restriction. However, in the context of growing economic crisis, ideas began to emerge (or reemerge) that would stress the need for capital to be free to move to wherever necessary in order to seek acceptable returns. In her book <italic>The Shock Doctrine</italic>, Naomi Klein captures well the ideological determination through which Hayekian philosophy and Chicago School economics combined to create the neoliberal force that was oriented to resuscitate the “flame of a pure version of capitalism” which burns with such damaging phosphorescence today.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0304375412464134">37</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>As we also saw, information technology was central to making neoliberal globalization possible. As competition became more fierce in the context of the 1970s crisis, speed, efficiency and the elimination of the human factor (through automation) were powerful incentives for the adoption by capitalists of computer-based “solutions” across almost every industry and every sector—a “revolution” that began in the Anglophone economies, but spread over the 1980s and 90s to become the politicoeconomic hegemon that approaches a total way of life today. The network society and the speeding up of social life have been the unintended consequences of the restructuring of Fordism. Digital networks have become the new base structuring of economy, society and, now, polity. It is a base, however, that is inherently unstable and inherently oriented toward the open-ended acceleration of its flows, with the limit constrained only by technological capability. Economic competition ensures that in the guise of innovation, network flows and the new power that they convey are unable to concentrate and consolidate—they must move ever faster.</p>
<p>The <italic>political process</italic> is the largely unrecognized casualty of this unintended consequence. Bourgeois and socialist democracy is temporal and is inherently limited in how much its processes may be accelerated. Modern democracy, nevertheless, was a “vital mode of [the] experience of space and time.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0304375412464134">38</xref>
</sup> The communicative networks that gave expression to the foundational ideas of bourgeois and socialist democracy were borne through the culture of print. The human element of face-to-face debating in parliaments in chambers in committees and in the enacting of real-world political effect, joined with the fixity of print in time and space to give a forward momentum and broad rhythmicity and stability to the processes of bourgeois and socialist democracy, and for these to act upon the world and help build the structures and institutions of modernity. Of course, these real-world and real-body processes still occur in the political process; and print culture and clock time still contribute to the temporality of modern democracy. But in this “slow-lane” politics, the languishing realm of local politics, legislative assemblies, and regional and state governances, the power to shape society through democratic means is increasingly atrophied and weakened by speed through networks. This is where Scheuerman makes his most important point on the functioning of the liberal democratic process:
<disp-quote>
<p> . . . high-speed society places a premium on high-speed political institutions: the widely endorsed conception of the unitary executive as an “energetic” entity best capable of acting with dispatch means that social acceleration promotes executive-centered government and the proliferation of executive discretion, while weakening broad-based representative legislatures as well as traditional models of constitutionalism and the rule of law.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0304375412464134">39</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>Power concentrates—tenuously vis-à-vis the logic of the market—within cabinet rooms and among a few select political insiders. However, as Scheuerman reiterated in his 2004 book, this concentration of power can even be justified by the elites themselves in the neoliberal moment because “[the executive’s] capacity for dispatch and efficiency offer the only serious alternative to further political or economic decay.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0304375412464134">40</xref>
</sup> But this is a relative and diminishing power that is oriented toward connecting with the needs of globalizing capital, and it justifies its undemocratic nature as a kind of Nietzschean <italic>amor fati</italic>, or the necessity to “love your fate” because there is no choice.</p>
<p>Millions across the world may not love their fate, but millions feel unable to do much about it, especially when their elected officials seem without capacity to shape lives and events in ways that involve people and empower people. Paralleling this pessimism is a general and more positive acceptance of the “need for speed” through technology and through computing, especially. The irony is that social acceleration and the information overload and distraction that it brings in its wake is, according to Nicholas Carr, “chipping away [at our] capacity for concentration and contemplation” making the recognition that speed might be the problem, that much more difficult.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0304375412464134">41</xref>
</sup> And so, to quote Jean Chesneaux once more
<disp-quote>
<p>As the [clock] time continuum is hastily and happily deconstructed, democracy dwindles to the shadow of itself, desiccated, shortsighted both upstream and downstream, reduced to purely functional and functionalist objectives and references. And speed enters the picture; it is expected to provide society with a new, introverted field of activism, as a substitute for the now obsolete horizons of the future as well as for the rich, successive layers deposited by the past.<sup>

<title>Networked Neoliberalism and the End of History</title>
<p>I began this essay with the observation that the powerful combinatory forces of neoliberal economic/political theory and the revolution in information technologies, have transformed our world in the space of a generation. In respect of the projects of liberal democracy and of socialism, the political teleologies that were the basis of our modernity and the idea of historical change that came with it, these have become nullified and rendered obsolete (or at least seriously hamstrung) due momentous shifts in the nature and locus of power. The dominant motive force for change in the age of neoliberalism is market forces and technological change, both of which are abstract forces that are not under any meaningful democratic control anywhere in the world. This impasse, though deeply portentous for the functioning of an effective and evolving democracy, is not readily recognizable due to our habit of not thinking and analyzing through a temporal prism.</p>
<p>If we accept this argument, we need to draw some rather drastic conclusions from it. First we need to think more deeply about how we perceive the making and understanding of history and politics. Francis Fukuyama forwarded his widely discussed idea that history itself was at an end. The political dynamic that created history had run its teleological course, he argued, with liberal democracy the last ideology standing. As Fukuyama phrased it, liberal democracy constituted the “end point of mankind’s ideological evolution” and now rests resplendent as the “final form of human government.” Indeed, the “<italic>ideal</italic> of liberal democracy,” he insisted, “could not be improved on.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0304375412464134">43</xref>
</sup> However, neoliberalism and the rise of the network society (Fukuyama saw ICTs as being “value neutral”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0304375412464134">44</xref>
</sup>) have seriously eroded any prospect of liberal democracy’s ideals becoming realized. History may indeed have come to a halt, but liberal democracy as a viable political project, with its viable political temporal rhythms, has also reached a terminus. The shell of a more ancient liberal democracy lives in the networks of high-speed information flows, and we may see this as a new kind of democracy, one suited to the age—a “network democracy.” This is a politics conducted through the language of democracy, but it is a politics of the present, where the past seems nonconsequential to the continuous novelty of the now, and the future is no longer makeable or at least anticipatable because of the exigencies of the constant present.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0304375412464134">45</xref>
</sup> Moreover, there is no history-making ideological antagonism of the sort that Chantal Mouffe argues to be the basis for the positive evolution of liberal democracy across the world.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0304375412464134">46</xref>
</sup> Crucially, network democracy does not challenge (nor pose a challenge) to the neoliberalized network society; and the logics of market, information technology and acceleration are largely unquestioned by both.</p>
<p>A social theory of time approach argues that without a full perception of the experience of the temporalities, of past and future, as well as present, there can be no real perception of history. “The horizons of future and past,” argues David Carr, “are not empty forms.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0304375412464134">47</xref>
</sup> We create them as social forms and to do so we, individually and collectively, need to engage with them. The growing social acceleration through networked neoliberalism forces us increasingly to live in the present, where the time to engage with future and past exists less and less as a resource that we can use in ways that are not market oriented. As Carr goes on to argue, “without a past and future there can be no present and thus no [temporal] experience at all.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0304375412464134">48</xref>
</sup> This is perhaps too much to say about our present-centered temporal life; we do experience time, but too often as a scarce commodity and not as something that is embodied and immanent in the individual and in society. Our experience of time today is a highly mediated experience, a relentless commodification of time that renders the temporal realms, if not “empty,” then reduces them to a Baudrillardian hyperreality that tends to be the opposite of that which it supposedly signifies. And so our democracy is virtualized and characterized by the absence of power; and history becomes manifest as a kind of history channel representation where we play the part of spectators upon a pale copy of a certain viewpoint—a history where we can never be participants in it nor products of it. In a sense, then, Fukuyama was onto something when he argued that history had come to a close. But the dynamic of bourgeois and socialist democracy has stopped evolving, too; it daily dematerializes into a fast flowing cyberspace to become an atrophied shadow of its material form.</p>
<p>So what of the “common ruin of the contending classes,” the almost throw away line that Marx and Engels attached to a future scenario they were sure would never come? Well, others have picked up the phrase recently. Barry Smart, for one, sees rampant neoliberalism as providing the basis for our “common ruin.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0304375412464134">49</xref>
</sup> However, whereas the term originally designated a political and historical destruction, for Smart it connotes an environmental devastation that will have consequences for all of us. To avert this particular future, Smart, unfortunately, offers only the alliterative platitudes of what he calls “de-growth” by means of “re-evaluation, reconceptualization, restructuring, re-distribution, re-location, reduction, re-use and recycling.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0304375412464134">50</xref>
</sup> While environmentally generated ruin is an obvious and present danger, his use of the Marx-Engels quote takes out its most potent insight—the politics. “De-growth” and its list of remedies are vital, but there is no way to engage with this as a politics of progress without a political will that comes from millions across the world and expressed through their political representatives who are moved to see the logic and necessity of “de-growth.”</p>
<p>“Common ruin” in its 1848 sense is now with us in the formless logic of networked globalization. This is a global rule through a new paradigm for capital, where resistance to it is minimal and scattered. For example, institutional neoliberal politics could do nothing other than try to desperately jump start the pulse of the financial system after the economic collapse of 2008. Those few politicians with real power could think only of saving capitalism, because they know of no other remedy. Common ruin is with us too in the dearth and distortion of the ideas that gave modern politics its world-changing verve. The enlightenment reintroduced humanity to the tools of logic and reason with which to, as Voltaire has phrased it “assault” the world and its problems with “sustained thinking.” However, reason and logic have become increasingly instrumental, and the major problems to be solved (those requiring the fullest attention of the best minds) tend to be those of profitability, of competitiveness, and of efficiency.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0304375412464134">51</xref>
</sup> And the common ruin of the contending classes has become a reality in that class solidarity, or even class identification, has become weakened and drained of agency through the individualization and political passivity that capitalism injects into the bloodstream of civil society through consumerism and commodification.</p>
<p>Smart himself expresses the process well, describing
<disp-quote>
<p> . . .  a powerfully seductive culture that promotes individual acquisitiveness and routinely places emphasis on the immediate and/or short term, on individual self-interest and material well being, to the detriment of medium and longer term communal and/or collective interests.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0304375412464134">52</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>
It is significant that Smart’s “progressive and radical alternatives”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0304375412464134">53</xref>
</sup> in the realms of environmentalism and the need to limit (or re-organize) consumption are in fact temporal—though he does not seem to recognize them to be so. The idea of de-growth, for example, is to effectively <italic>slow down</italic> accelerating capitalism and accelerating society. His list of remedies, too, are nothing if not demands to <italic>stop and reflect</italic>, with the prefix “re” indicating a going back to reassess and redo with a view to learning from the past. Smart inscribes temporality into his critique of consumer culture as well, observing that it is present centered, with at best only a short-term temporal horizon in which the circuits of commodification, production, and consumption function in the neoliberal moment.</p>
<p>More than anything else the objective of this essay is to make salient temporality as mode of analysis and conceptual insight. Smart, like so many others, has temporality deep within the analysis but fails to bring it out and use it as a mode through which to identify “alternatives” that are both “progressive and radical.” What is needed in our networked society is an exploration of new ways to insert politics into social time to create what Barbara Adam has termed a “politics of temporalized democracy.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0304375412464134">54</xref>
</sup> To conclude this essay, I want here to draw the very broad and tentative outlines of such a project.</p>
<sec id="section6-0304375412464134">
<title>The Sovereignty of the Temporal</title>
<p>We can begin with the premise that any alternative to a damaged or ruined political project must itself be grounded in the political. So damaged and ruined are the institutions of liberal democracy (socialism’s moment will just have to wait), that we need to look deep into its logic to extract those elements that may be politicized (or re-politicized) in order for the body of the institution to be once more energized. The logic of temporal perspective outlined here suggests that we need to begin by considering the experience of time and temporal relationships themselves as being inherently political.</p>
<p>The idea of temporality as having sovereign qualities, it seems to me, constitutes the beginnings of a revival of democratic processes that emerge from the material and physical lives of individuals and institutions in ways that reflect rhythms that express the <italic>capacities </italic>of people and political processes. In short, if democracy has become too slow for the world in which it now finds itself, and if technology has colonized and abstracted it into a global flow of networked information that is subsidiary to the power of accelerating capital flows, then it must be re-rooted into the lives of people.</p>
<p>So what is meant here by what I call “temporal sovereignty”? I have argued that time is individually experienced and socially produced—and that technologies such as the clock and the network have had the effect of commoditizing and abstracting the experience of time. As Heidegger phrased it (succinctly for once) “there is no time without man.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0304375412464134">55</xref>
</sup> We experience and create time in differing ways through differing contexts, but technology gives these contexts the patterns and rhythms upon which specific forms of society can be erected. Time, then, at its deepest level is in us; we do not exist in time, but technology abstracts, orders, and organizes it toward specific social and political ends.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0304375412464134">56</xref>
</sup> If time is within us then it follows that it “belongs” to us in some sense. This is the idea that needs to be developed if we are to temporalize politics and temporalize democracy.</p>
<p>In terms of accepting the concept of the sovereignty of time, we are halfway there already. We see it in our ready acceptance of the sovereignty of <italic>space,</italic> which in the modern period at least, has its origins in the Treaty of Westphalia of 1648. Here space (or political territory) was codified as space that was considered sovereign in the sense that a given space inhered to itself an ultimate authority that extended over that space (and through time). We see this concept too in the idea of “personal space” where the body is judged sovereign and rendered by human rights law as inviolable. However, this easily understood idea of sovereignty does not translate so well to the temporal; this is due in no small measure to our alienation (for the reasons already outlined) from time by technologies of clock and capitalism and computer network. But space and time are coextensive; one cannot exist without the other and both are individually experienced and socially produced.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0304375412464134">57</xref>
</sup> And so the recognition of time as sovereign in the individual could be a political step of momentous consequence. The time that is sequestered by the capitalist mode of production as “value,” where it is treated first and only a economic resource, could be seen to be, as Michael Flaherty sees it, a human essence and as a form of human <italic>agency</italic>. Agency connotes power and power is the human web of politics (biopower).</p>
<p>To consider time as sovereign takes primarily a leap of the imagination and a conscious shaking off of the habits of mind regarding the nature of time that have suffused societies since the industrial revolution. My time, your time, the temporality of societies, may then be seen as a resource that can be deployed in many different ways and in many different contexts. This resource and this agency may also, building upon ideas of Armatya Sen act as a potent <italic>capability</italic>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0304375412464134">58</xref>
</sup>. For Sen, the acquiring of “capabilities” constitutes a basic progressive platform in development economics—and it was later expanded into a grounded political theory in collaboration with Martha Nussbaum.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0304375412464134">59</xref>
</sup> In brief, capabilities may be defined as a freedom, a positive liberty through which the individual can fulfill his or her potentialities. For Sen, economic poverty, for example, would clearly constitute a negative liberty and therefore represent a deficit in the capabilities of the individual. And so by the same reasoning, what sociologists Bittman and Wajcman call “time poverty.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0304375412464134">60</xref>
</sup> Similarly negatively affects the temporal capability and thus act as a restriction on the realizing of individual and social potential. Sen sees a <italic>human rights</italic> approach to the question as providing the foundation for what he calls “entitlements to capabilities.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0304375412464134">61</xref>
</sup> Here the idea becomes explicitly political and can act as the basis upon which temporal sovereignty as a human right can become a part of the suite of “entitlements” that are afforded the status of universalist natural law.</p>
<p>With some flexible thinking, we can see that it is entirely logical and coherent and necessary to consider time (its experience and its production) as a deeply human characteristic. It would follow that in the social world time is fundamentally political too. As part of a political process, time therefore conjoins with space to constitute the social dimensions of freedom and choice and possibility, all of which are made contingent on the extent of our <italic>time–space capabilities</italic>. This is what we must recognize as part of the human rights agenda and struggle for accordingly.</p>
<p>The core motive force of bourgeois and socialist democracy is temporal. As “progressive” politics, the temporal logic is oriented toward the future; the marshalling of the energies of people and material toward specific outcomes in the realization of what Habermas called the <italic>project of modernity</italic>. The paradox is that time–space compression has shrunk the scope of our “project” to the almost immediate. Yet bourgeois and socialist democracy is supposed to be impervious to temporal change, with their values of justice and freedom being “timeless.” In the networked economy temporality is subordinated to be a marker of efficiency and flexibility. The temporality of democracy has been lost in our downgrading of time to a mere technology and technological problem, when in fact it is neither.</p>
<p>Just as the processes of neoliberal globalization were getting underway, Charles Sherover argued that what he termed “the temporality of the common good” was what we must identify and nurture if our “capacity for freedom” is to be fully realized.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0304375412464134">62</xref>
</sup> His essay was prescient, but its insights sank into the abstruse silo of pure philosophical inquiry. It has been the fate of other such arguments for far too long now. Our habit of overlooking the importance of time has allowed events in the economy, in culture, in society, and in politics to be only partially understood. An effect has been the exhaustive and essentially pointless debates on “multipolarity.”</p>
<p>I have sought to show a way of contextualizing neoliberal globalization and its effects through an emphasis on the interrelatedness of time and computer-based technologies. We need to consider the most egregious pathologies of this interaction and begin to think and to work toward advocating a “deceleration” of those processes (such as politics) that have spun out of rational–temporal control. The “common ruin of the contending classes,” with the “contending classes” being the basis of our democracy—bourgeois or socialist—has reached a point of realization that Marx and Engels could never have dreamed of. What Paul Virilio<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0304375412464134">63</xref>
</sup> termed the “dictatorship of speed,” in the form of the abstract processes of neoliberal capitalism now holds contingent power over economy, culture, society, and polity. Ruins may be rebuilt. However, unless we come to recognize the function of time and technology and the interrelated function of time and democracy, then the incipient common ruin of the present is in danger of becoming the <italic>common death</italic> of a form of politics that has constituted the basis for our modernity and for the potential of social revolutionary change where people and not technology are at the forefront.</p>
