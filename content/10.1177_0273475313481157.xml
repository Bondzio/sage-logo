<abstract>
<p>The <italic>Journal of Marketing Education</italic> is publishing a special issue on Sales Education and Training in August 2014. In this article, we review the sales education literature from four primary journals and the business literature at large. The four primary journals are the <italic>Journal of Marketing Education, Marketing Education Review, Journal of Education in Business</italic>, and the <italic>Journal of Personal Selling &amp; Sales Management</italic>. Of the 107 identified articles, experiential learning, assessment, and career development were the three most prominent topics. Future research opportunities in sales education, including those for the special issue, are offered across nine topical areas.</p>

<body>
<p>Few marketing educators would be surprised to learn that “sales” is the most common career entry point for marketing graduates. In fact, the seminal study by Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce (2010) titled “What’s It Worth: The Economic Value of College Majors,” showed that the greatest portion of marketing majors pursue a sales career after graduation. What might be more surprising is that sales as a first career was ranked second for business students majoring in general business, economics, international business, and management. Sales ranked third for students majoring in finance, operations management, human resources, and management information systems. Across campus, sales as a first career choice was ranked second or third for students majoring in the social sciences, natural sciences, physical sciences, liberal arts, communication, and journalism. Although sales as a career choice has broad reach across campus, the fact remains that there is an ongoing and widespread talent shortage of salespeople in the United States and around the world. As evidence, ManpowerGroup’s Annual Survey for 2006-2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0273475313481157">2012</xref>) shows that sales has been a top five shortage area in each of the past 7 years. Moreover, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0273475313481157">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2012)</xref> projects considerable yearly job growth for sales positions through 2020 in diverse areas such as insurance, business to business, and technical sales.</p>
<p>Universities across the United States have been quick to respond to the demand–supply gap for well-trained sales professionals. According to DePaul’s biannual Universities and Colleges Sales Education Landscape Survey, sales education curricula grew from 44 U.S. universities and colleges in 2007, to 67 in 2009, and to 101 in 2011. For 2011, 32 of these institutions offered a major, minor, or degree concentration; the remaining 69 offered sales courses without a specific transcript designation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0273475313481157">DePaul University Center for Sales Leadership, 2011-2012</xref>). Coinciding with this growth in sales curricula is the increase in the number of universities establishing sales centers and institutes. Launched in 2002, the University Sales Center Alliance (USCA) was formed to “increase the professionalism of the sales field, improve the status of sales as an academic discipline, and assist other universities in this mission” (USCA, 2012, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.universitysalescenteralliance.org/">http://www.universitysalescenteralliance.org/</ext-link>). Since 2002, the USCA has grown from 9 to 33 universities across the United States.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that college graduates have long entered into sales careers and the number of universities offering sales curricula, sales programs, and sales centers has grown dramatically, the marketing education literature has been relatively slow in responding to the needs of students and employers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0273475313481157">Deeter-Schmelz &amp; Kennedy, 2011</xref>). Specific to the <italic>Journal of Marketing Education</italic>, of the more than 800 articles published since its inception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0273475313481157">Gray, Peltier, &amp; Schibrowsky, 2012</xref>), only 27 have focused “primarily” on sales education, a dearth that has been noted across the marketing education literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0273475313481157">Anderson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0273475313481157">McIntyre &amp; Tanner, 2004</xref>). In response, the <italic>Journal of Marketing Education</italic> will be publishing a Special Issue on Sales Education and Training in August, 2014 (see Call for Papers elsewhere in this journal issue). This special issue is in partnership with the USCA, which is offering a $1,000 <italic>Best Paper Award</italic>.</p>
<p>The purpose of the current article is to provide a review of the sales education literature. To accomplish this objective, we first present the method used to classify the sales education literature. We then summarize findings from the sales education literature and offer recommendations for future research directions. Given the importance of effective sales training for those entering the workforce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0273475313481157">Lassk, Ingra, Kraus, &amp; DiMascio, 2012</xref>), we encourage readers to consider submitting a manuscript for the August, 2014 Special Issue on Sales Education and Training.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section2-0273475313481157">
<title>Journal Selection</title>
<p>Four primary journals were searched for articles relating to sales education. The <italic>Journal of Marketing Education</italic> and <italic>Marketing Education Review</italic> were selected given their prominent status in the marketing education literature. The <italic>Journal of Education for Business</italic> was chosen based on its cross-disciplinary focus on business education. The <italic>Journal of Personal Selling &amp; Sales Management</italic> was selected because of its position as the most prominent sales journal and its previous publication of education articles. All articles from the inception to the present edition of each journal were considered. Articles deemed relevant to sales education were saved to a data file. The final count from these four journals was 90 articles. Last, an expanded literature review was conducted using “sales education” as the key search term, which yielded 17 additional qualified articles from 12 journals. In total, 107 articles were captured spanning 33 years of publication. Software reviews, introductions to special issues, editor notes, and book reviews were excluded from the analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0273475313481157">
<title>Categorization and Coding</title>
<p>Our first challenge was to develop a rubric for categorizing the identified sales articles. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0273475313481157">Gray et al. (2012)</xref>, a data file was prepared that included each article, journal, volume, issue, author(s), title, abstract, and data source. Each article was coded for the primary, secondary, and tertiary topics. At this point, the topic codes were reviewed and discussed by two authors. The initial codes provided a starting point for identifying content patterns across the articles. Several rounds of discussions resulted in replication of the nine categories developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0273475313481157">Gray et al. (2012)</xref> in a review of the broader marketing literature. These categories were found to represent the variety of initial topic codes and allowed for a comparison of sales education literature and the broader marketing education literature over the same time period. As a final check, each article was recoded into one of the final nine categories without the aid of the initial topic codes. Limited discussion occurred to resolve categorization conflicts (e.g., an article discussing a role-play useful in preparing students for interviews could be viewed as either experiential learning or career development). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0273475313481157">Table 1</xref> presents the final categories along with a description of each. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0273475313481157">Table 2</xref> classifies subcategories and provides exemplars.</p>

<p>As would be expected, the two primary marketing education journals have published the greatest number of sales education articles (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0273475313481157">Table 3</xref>). Although <italic>Marketing Education Review</italic> was launched in 1992 versus 1979 for the <italic>Journal of Marketing Education, Marketing Education Review</italic> has published 39 sales education articles compared with 27 for <italic>Journal of Marketing Education.</italic> The <italic>Journal of Personal Selling &amp; Sales Management</italic> has published 17 sales education articles, followed by only 7 for the <italic>Journal of Education for Business</italic>.

<title>Research Needs</title>
<p>As sales curricula continue to evolve and expand, more empirical research on the effectiveness of sales courses and specialized programs is needed. Researchers can investigate the relative contributions to student learning that classroom pedagogical techniques and sponsored extracurricular activities provide. With limited resources, should administrators focus on the development of traditional sales courses or partnerships where students learn sales skills outside the classroom? Researchers with field experience could elucidate answers for designing sales courses both within traditional marketing and sales-specific programs. There remains too little pedagogical research on critical aspects of selling such as relationship development, nonverbal communications, networking, ethics, and the integration of sales technology. Research that provides a better understanding of undergraduate and graduate training is also warranted. Perhaps the greatest area for improvement in the assessment of sales education lies in our understanding of sales educators. Although numerous studies detail courses, curricula, and students, we know little about the individuals who lead sales courses.</p>

<title>Preparation</title>
<p>This group of articles encompassed a variety of studies that detailed the knowledge and skills that students require on entering sales careers or how to improve or develop these capabilities through education.

The factors considered included race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0273475313481157">DelVecchio &amp; Honeycutt, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0273475313481157">2002</xref>), culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0273475313481157">Pettijohn &amp; Pettijohn, 2011</xref>), autonomy and salary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0273475313481157">DelVecchio &amp; Honeycutt, 2000</xref>), and prestige (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0273475313481157">Swan &amp; Adkins, 1980</xref>).

<title>Research Needs</title>
<p>There is a dearth of research that addresses the career development of sales educators with regard to preparation or perception. With the growth of specialized sales curricula, it is important to understand the background and career plans of sales center faculty. Surveys of sales faculty can elucidate not only their educational training and professional preparation for teaching selling courses but also their perception of sales programs, students, and their own career opportunities within the field. In addition, there is a focus within the literature on measuring student attitudes toward sales rather than practical approaches to introducing students to selling earlier in the marketing curriculum. Despite research showing that educational exposure to sales improves perceptions of sales careers and intent to peruse sales professions, it is unknown if students are first encountering sales early or late in their educational careers. Additionally, the field could benefit from research that identifies the best interactive methods or courses for introducing selling. Finally, although variety within sales jobs expands, there is no pedagogical guidance or study of how students choose among various types of sales career paths.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0273475313481157">Caballero, Dickinson, and Townsend (1984)</xref> were among the first contributors in this area. They offered a unique perspective on the challenges of sales drawing on the writing of Aristotle on the topic of persuasion. They asserted that understanding the key to successful selling requires a comprehensive understanding of the human nature of both the buyer and seller. A number of studies used the Personal Selling Ethics (PSE) scale as a measure of ethical decision making. Key findings included that female students viewed specific sales practices as less ethical and less acceptable than did male students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0273475313481157">Stevenson &amp; Bodkin, 1996</xref>) and that students with relationship-oriented values were less tolerant of questionable sales behaviors than were achievement-oriented students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0273475313481157">Donoho, Herche, &amp; Swenson, 2003</xref>).

<p>The articles on ethics present a patchwork of studies with the goal of improving students’ ethical understanding. Future research should include large enough populations to have the statistical power to investigate the effects of additional demographic variables beyond gender, such as age, major (especially nonbusiness majors), employment, and internship experiences. Although challenging for this age group, studies with longitudinal measures should be encouraged, particularly after students move into the workforce. Research should address how much and how often ethical training should be conducted to be effective. Additionally, expanding studies to include a more multicountry sample should improve understanding and appreciation of cultural differences and similarities that exist in sales situations. The recent development of ethical dilemma classroom exercises may provide a promising alternative for assessing ethical development. Finally, research should also examine the sales instructor’s impact on the ethical learning process.</p>

<p>Critical thinking, which representing only 4.7% of the identified articles, is an important and challenging learning goal for sales educators in part because it is difficult to teach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0273475313481157">Peltier, Hay, &amp; Drago, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0273475313481157">2006</xref>). In the domain of critical thinking, issues such as development and measurement, salesperson knowledge structures, integrated experience, feedback loops, and decoding sales communications have been explored in the sales literature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0273475313481157">Clabaugh, Forbes, and Clabaugh (1995)</xref> designed a sales course that developed and measured higher level critical thinking skills. The authors outlined a professional selling course that built progressively higher critical thinking skills with inputs drawing on Bloom’s taxonomy and Gronlund’s Learning Objectives. An advertising model (elaboration likelihood model) was brought into the sales domain by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0273475313481157">Weilbaker and West (1992)</xref> to determine who and what it takes to produce successful salespeople. Their article provided a framework for teaching sales students and made a contribution to sales theory by further developing an understanding of the decoding process in sales communications.</p>

<title>Research Needs</title>
<p>Authors will continue to find an audience for discoveries and insights into how sales educators can help develop their students’ higher level reasoning and abstract thinking abilities. As analytics and financial constructs are increasingly applied in sales, sales educators will respond with methods that give students these high-order reasoning skills. The challenge will be more than creating pedagogy that teaches mathphobic sales students how to calculate ratios. Higher level thinking will require students to discover and report the deeper meaning behind the data.</p>

<title>Technology, International, and Marketing Mix</title>
<p>Articles that primarily focused on <italic>technology</italic> (six), <italic>international</italic> (three) and <italic>marketing mix</italic> (one) represented 9.3% of the publications in our database. Surprisingly, of the <italic>technology</italic> articles only two of six were published after 2000 (2010 and 2003). Given the rising importance of technology in marketing education research as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0273475313481157">Gray et al. (2012)</xref>, sales education has been slow to respond concerning how to teach and use information technologies. Especially needed is research that investigates learning pedagogy to encourage emerging salespeople to use information technologies and enterprise resource planning platforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0273475313481157">Mallin, Jones, &amp; Cordell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0273475313481157">Shoemaker, 2003</xref>). It is anticipated that salespeople will continue to increase their use of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tools and other sales technology. Best practices for teaching information technology usage by sales people is a fertile area for future research.</p>
<p>Virtual sales teams, which is an important area of inquiry in marketing and management literature, has been virtually ignored in business education journals. Although some cross-cultural articles exist within our set of nine categories, there is no educational research that focuses on pedagogy and best practices from an <italic>international</italic> perspective. The limited articles in this area have examined interest in pursuing a sales career (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0273475313481157">Honeycutt &amp; Thelen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0273475313481157">Karakaya, Quigley, &amp; Bingham, 2011</xref>). The differential perceptions of sales around the globe, culturally based buying and selling customs, and operational factors across cultures, are all issues of interest to sales educators. Importantly, a better integration of a global focus is warranted in assessment, experiential learning, career development and virtually all of the other categories previously discussed.</p>
<p>Last, only one article focused primarily on how sales curricula can be integrated into other courses in the <italic>marketing mix</italic>. Given that the number of sales programs and courses are growing rapidly, a better understanding is much needed concerning how to integrate sales topics into courses such as principles of marketing, customer relationship management, integrated marketing communications, marketing research, and internet marketing.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Demand for graduates seeking a sales career has never been higher. Universities have responded by expanding their sales curricula, offering majors and minors in professional selling, and creating sales centers and institutes. Historically from a pedagogical perspective, marketing and business researchers have been relatively silent. The good news is that the number of sales education articles is trending upward. In our data set, there were 9 sales articles prior to 1980, 31 for the years 1990-1999, 43 during the decade of 2000-2009, and 21 since 2010. The <italic>Journal of Marketing Education</italic> is taking an active role in this continued ascendance through a Special Issue in Sales Education and Training scheduled for August, 2014.</p>
<p>Although we offered a set of research needs for each of our nine categories, the truth is that the sales education literature is relatively underdeveloped. We thus encourage research across wide-ranging topics, including the launch and management of sales centers, the design of sales courses and programs, how to best access program success, faculty and student performance, effective experiential learning exercises and especially those that provide both practical and critical thinking, how to best prepare students for a career in sales, best practices for sales competitions, international competencies, integration of sales coverage into other marketing courses, ethical consequences of selling behaviors, virtual and interpersonal teams/groups, and the use of technology by salespeople and managers. Last, as noted by Bacon in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0273475313481157">Gray et al. (2012)</xref>, “While manuscripts describing novel ideas for improving the effectiveness of marketing faculty and pedagogy are always welcome at <italic>JME</italic>, we are particularly excited by manuscripts that include direct measures of learning” (p. 233).</p>
