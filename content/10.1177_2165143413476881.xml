<abstract>
<p>Transition policy and programs have primarily focused on preparing students with disabilities for employment. Public policy over the last three decades has gradually broadened to include increasing emphasis on transition to postsecondary education. To date, the literature has primarily addressed matters related to demographics, legislation and policy, and the differences in expectations between secondary and postsecondary education. The authors call upon the field to set a transition research agenda resulting in evidence-based practices that will support the postsecondary educational goals of all students with disabilities.</p>

<p>The policy of full inclusion has taken many forms, from Regular Education Initiative to Least Restrictive Environment (LRE) to access to the general education curriculum. It has resulted in large numbers of secondary students with disabilities participating in college preparation courses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-2165143413476881">Wagner, Newman, &amp; Cameto, 2004</xref>). Full inclusion was followed by students meeting traditional academic standards, graduating with a regular diploma, and participating in postsecondary education, as did the Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) of 2004 mandating that postsecondary education be considered as a goal for all students. As part of their state performance plans, state education agencies must now report the percentage of students with disabilities who are enrolled in postsecondary education 1 year after high school graduation/completion. These requirements have encouraged secondary school personnel, parents, and students to carefully consider postsecondary education as a realistic goal for students with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2165143413476881">Shaw, Madaus, &amp; Dukes, 2010</xref>). Simultaneously, higher education policies and regulations have fostered a more accessible environment in postsecondary education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2165143413476881">Americans With Disabilities Act Amendments Act [ADAAA], 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2165143413476881">Association on Higher Education and Disability [AHEAD], 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Section 504 of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2165143413476881">Rehabilitation Act of 1973</xref> stipulates people with disabilities can participate in and benefit from any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. In addition, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2165143413476881">Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990</xref> requires persons with disabilities who are “otherwise qualified” be provided an equal educational opportunity. Moreover, the ADA’s greatest impact in higher education has been improved awareness of people with disabilities and the specification that individuals with disabilities should not only have equal access to programs and services but also receive auxiliary aids and supports intended to level the playing field in higher education environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2165143413476881">Keenan &amp; Shaw, 2011</xref>). Under the revised version of the legislation, known as the Americans With Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA), which became effective January 1, 2009, there is now a broader definition regarding who qualifies for coverage under the law as an individual with a disability and which conditions impose a substantial limitation of a major life activity. Because learning, reading, concentrating, and thinking are now specifically set forth as major life activities and postsecondary disability documentation requirements are less onerous under the ADAAA, students with disabilities are, arguably, more likely to be able to make the transition to postsecondary education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2165143413476881">Shaw, Keenan, Madaus, &amp; Banerjee, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Extremely high rates of both underemployment and unemployment have beset adults with disabilities for decades. The U.S. Census Bureau reported that fewer than half (45.6%) of individuals with disabilities between the ages of 21 and 64 were employed in 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2165143413476881">Brault, 2008</xref>). Adults with a high school degree or less are unemployed at nearly twice the rate of those with a bachelor’s degree or higher. Individuals with a bachelor’s degree earn an average of US$2.1 million dollars over a lifetime, which is almost twice that of workers with only a high school education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-2165143413476881">U.S. Department of Education, 2006</xref>). Completion of postsecondary education, including vocational-technical training, significantly improves the chances of securing gainful and satisfying employment as well as achieving financial independence. Students with and without disabilities who earn Bachelor of Arts degrees are nearly on par in terms of attainment of subsequent employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2165143413476881">College Board, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2165143413476881">Madaus, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Given this reality, it is not surprising that postsecondary education is now a primary goal for 80% of secondary students with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2165143413476881">Newman, Wagner, Cameto, &amp; Knokey, 2009</xref>). These college ambitions have resulted in greater numbers of students with disabilities taking academically challenging courses of study and, as a result, being more competitive in the college admissions process. Eleven percent of college freshman report having a disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2165143413476881">Cominole, Riccobono, Siegel, Caves, &amp; Rosen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-2165143413476881">U.S. Government Accountability Office, 2009</xref>), a figure that has more than tripled since 1978, and nearly 44% of students with disabilities enroll in postsecondary education after leaving high school, up from 26% in 1990 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-2165143413476881">Wagner, Newman, Cameto, Levine, &amp; Marder, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Even though students with disabilities are increasingly accessing postsecondary education, whether transition efforts have been productive in fostering success in postsecondary education remains unclear. For example, findings from the National Longitudinal Transition Study–2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2165143413476881">Sanford et al., 2011</xref>) indicate the postsecondary completion rate of young adults with disabilities was lower (38%) than that of their peers in the general population (51%). Work still needs to be done identifying effective transition practices and programs to promote not only access to postsecondary education but also success for students with disabilities.</p>

<title>Literature on the Transition to Postsecondary Education</title>
<p>There is a rapidly growing body of literature on the transition to postsecondary education. This literature has overwhelmingly focused on issues related to demographics, federal policy, and differences between secondary and postsecondary expectations.</p>
<sec id="section2-2165143413476881">
<title>Demographics</title>
<p>Researchers have been able to identify which students are making the transition to postsecondary education. The assertion that postsecondary education, and particularly college, was a realistic transition goal for many students with disabilities needed validation over the last several decades. Numerous researchers have documented the progression of postsecondary attendance by students with disabilities. Those with physical and sensory disabilities were followed into college settings by students with learning disabilities, emotional disabilities, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorders, and, most recently, students with intellectual disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2165143413476881">Grigal &amp; Hart, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2165143413476881">Harbour, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2165143413476881">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2165143413476881">Henderson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2165143413476881">Madaus, 2006</xref>). Of particular note, two iterations of the National Longitudinal Transition Study–2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-2165143413476881">Wagner et al., 2007</xref>) have identified the characteristics, experiences, and outcomes of a nationally representative sample of youth with disabilities.</p>

<title>Federal Policy</title>
<p>The focus on federal transition policy has dealt with the implementation of various mandates of IDEA including the transition plan, participation in the Individualized Education Program (IEP) meeting, and the Summary of Performance (SOP). Researchers have focused on the importance of various elements of the transition plan such as the specificity of postsecondary transition goals, student involvement, and the transferability of accommodations and supports from secondary to postsecondary education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-2165143413476881">Shaw, 2009</xref>). The SOP, specified in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2165143413476881">IDEA 2004</xref>, has received particular attention because of its potential utility in the transition process. The literature of the last decade is replete with specification of model SOP processes, proposals for effective implementation of the SOP, and reviews of SOP implementation in states and school districts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2165143413476881">Dukes, Shaw, &amp; Madaus, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2165143413476881">Madaus, Shaw, Miller, Banerjee, &amp; Vitello, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2165143413476881">Richter &amp; Mazzotti, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-2165143413476881">Shaw, Dukes, &amp; Madaus, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>A major barrier to successful transition to postsecondary education is the significant contrast between the prescriptive mandates of IDEA, as applied in preschool through Grade 12 settings, and the more generic equal access provisions of Section 504 and the ADA, which apply primarily to postsecondary education. Within the literature, scholars have identified barriers; explored the perceptions of these barriers by students, parents, secondary, and postsecondary educators; and offered recommendations to address the subsequent challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2165143413476881">deBettencourt, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2165143413476881">Kincaid, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2165143413476881">Madaus &amp; Shaw, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Differences Between Secondary and Postsecondary Education</title>
<p>The change in status and the requisite expectations for students with disabilities moving from secondary to postsecondary education is significant. The professional literature reflects examination of the “documentation divide” between secondary and postsecondary institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2165143413476881">Keenan &amp; Shaw, 2011</xref>). Students with disabilities and their families are consistently surprised to learn that the IEP and related diagnostic data mandated by the IDEA or a Section 504 plan may not serve as sufficient documentation for accommodations and related services in college settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2165143413476881">Madaus &amp; Shaw, 2004</xref>). In addition, IDEA no longer requires school districts to complete a full reevaluation for students every 3 years or an exit evaluation but instead encourages the use of Response to Intervention (RTI) and curriculum-based assessment for disability determination. Postsecondary institutions, however, still typically require a comprehensive psychoeducational evaluation to establish the presence of a specific disability and to document a student’s current need for reasonable accommodations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2165143413476881">Getzel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2165143413476881">Madaus, Banerjee, &amp; Hamblet, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2165143413476881">Madaus &amp; Shaw, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Other differences between secondary and postsecondary education that have been extensively examined include the importance of self-determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2165143413476881">Field, Sarver, &amp; Shaw, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2165143413476881">Martin, Portley, &amp; Graham, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-2165143413476881">Thoma &amp; Wehmeyer, 2005</xref>), the changing role of parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2165143413476881">Kochhar-Bryant, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2165143413476881">Morningstar, Wehmeyer, &amp; Dove, 2008</xref>), challenges created by the increasing use of technology in postsecondary settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2165143413476881">Banerjee, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2165143413476881">Parker &amp; Banerjee, 2007</xref>), and differences in supports, services, and accommodations used in high school and postsecondary education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2165143413476881">Brinckerhoff, McGuire, &amp; Shaw, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2165143413476881">Gordon, Lewandowski, Murphy, &amp; Dempsey, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-2165143413476881">Thurlow, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>There is little doubt that access to postsecondary education has been a topic of major importance with regard to transition planning and policy in recent decades. The number of students with disabilities accessing higher education has increased threefold, and students with disabilities regardless of disability status and severity are participating in these new opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2165143413476881">Grigal &amp; Hart, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2165143413476881">Shaw, Madaus, et al., 2010</xref>). However, we have not fulfilled the promise of successful postsecondary outcomes for adults with disabilities. The field should now turn its collective attention to the identification of evidence-based transition practices in this area. Our goal must be to move beyond access and focus on the improvement of postsecondary education outcomes for <italic>all</italic> students with disabilities.</p>

<title>Developing Evidence-Based Practices in Transition to Postsecondary Education</title>
<sec id="section6-2165143413476881">
<title>A Call for Research</title>
<p>The National Secondary Transition Technical Assistance Center (NSTTAC) conducted a systematic literature review to identify in-school predictors of postschool success in the areas of employment, education, and independent living for secondary-level students with disabilities. To be included, reports and documents had to (a) be included secondary education for students with and/or without disabilities, students at risk, and/or students with mental health issues and (b) provide information or data on secondary in-school program variables as predictors of in-school and postschool success supported by research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2165143413476881">NSTTAC, 2010</xref>). Thus far, 33 factors have been identified, with few directly related to transition to postsecondary education. In addition, NSTTAC has identified 16 evidence-based predictors of postschool employment, education, and independent living success from correlational research. Unfortunately, those pertaining to postsecondary education such as inclusive education, interagency collaboration, and social skills are too generic to directly impact what secondary personnel do for students with disabilities. NSTTAC also notes there continues to be a need for research to identify additional secondary transition evidence-based practices and outcome predictors. Although NSTTAC encourages rigorous research across transition domains and outcomes, there are necessary areas of research particularly critical to enhance transition outcomes to postsecondary education.</p>

<title>Role of Special Educators and Special Education</title>
<p>Although inclusion in general education is an evidence-based predictor for quality postsecondary outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-2165143413476881">Test et al., 2009</xref>), data are needed on how to most effectively support inclusion efforts in secondary schools. What kinds of programs and supports are necessary to help students who lack the academic or social skills necessary for both high school success and preparation for postsecondary education? For example, the role of special education and related services personnel in inclusive efforts has been an issue for more than 40 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2165143413476881">McKenzie et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2165143413476881">Prouty &amp; Prillaman, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-2165143413476881">Simonsen et al., 2010</xref>). The role of special educators in inclusion may be as coteachers or as consultants to general education teachers. Too often, however, they are put in less productive roles where they function like paraprofessionals or disciplinarians in general education classrooms. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2165143413476881">Faggella-Luby, Flannery, and Simonsen (2010)</xref> have proposed roles for special education and related services personnel in the implementation of a School-Wide Positive Behavior Support (SWPBS) model in secondary schools. Specific questions meriting study include the following:</p>
<list id="list1-2165143413476881" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>What role or roles are most effective for special educators when supporting the success of students with disabilities in the general education classroom and beyond to graduation with a regular academic diploma?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What role for special education personnel in Tiers 1, 2, or 3 interventions is most effective to help secondary-level students with disabilities prepare for postsecondary education?</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-2165143413476881">
<title>Secondary Curriculum</title>
<p>In response to the demand for improvements in the academic proficiency of high school graduates, states have established minimum standards for graduation and also required successful completion of high school exit exams. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2165143413476881">Kober and Rentner (2011)</xref> reviewed state standards and found that approximately 75% of the 44 states reviewed were having problems effectively implementing standards because of limited funding. There are continuing questions regarding what effect these well-intentioned policies have had and will have on students with disabilities. Arguably, more critical is what schools have done to provide supports, interventions, and accommodations to prevent discrimination against students with disabilities and to assure authentic individualized educational programs. To this end, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2165143413476881">Kochhar-Bryant and Bassett (2002)</xref> have recommended “opportunity standards” that include individualized instruction, a responsive curriculum, and adequate time for learning as well as valid assessments. Although these are important policy issues that need analysis, we also need to answer these practical questions:</p>
<list id="list2-2165143413476881" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>What supports and interventions for students with disabilities who are completing a standards-based education have been effective in fostering high school graduation, as well as subsequent access to, and successful completion of a postsecondary education?</p></list-item>

<sec id="section9-2165143413476881">
<title>Interagency Collaboration</title>
<p>The differential expectations and provisions of IDEA in secondary educational settings and Section 504/ADA in postsecondary education create transition barriers. Thus, an ongoing challenge is whether secondary and postsecondary systems can establish bridges between institutions in spite of the sometimes conflicting federal statutes. For example, in Connecticut and Virginia, there have been long-term collaborative efforts to have representatives of college disability services and high school special education personnel work together to create college transition guides and develop joint documentation guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2165143413476881">Getzel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2165143413476881">Reilly &amp; Wilkerson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-2165143413476881">Shaw, 2009</xref>). More recently, formal programs between secondary schools and colleges have provided relatively seamless transitions for students with intellectual disability seeking additional educational opportunities. Although these efforts appear to be promising, we need to consider the following questions:</p>
<list id="list3-2165143413476881" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Have these efforts overcome discontinuities between high school and colleges and made a difference in the percentage of students able to transition to and succeed in postsecondary education?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Do students with intellectual disability who have participated in these collaborative transition efforts and experienced postsecondary education have improved adult and employment outcomes?</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-2165143413476881">
<title>Interventions</title>
<p>Which instructional approaches and programs can be implemented in secondary schools to best prepare students for the challenge of postsecondary education? There are numerous interventions including SWPBS, universal design, coaching, counseling, and various technology approaches with preliminary or qualitative success with students in secondary and/or postsecondary settings. Emerging research supports SWPBS as a productive means of organizing school resources and delivering instruction to all students in both academic and social domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2165143413476881">Faggella-Luby et al., 2010</xref>). Although SWPBS is an evidence-based practice in the primary grades, its utility in secondary schools, and particularly its utility as a means to prepare students with disabilities for postsecondary education, merits further study.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, universal design, a specific set of principles used to systematically incorporate accessible features into a design instead of retrofitting changes or accommodations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2165143413476881">McGuire, Scott, &amp; Shaw, 2006</xref>), is encouraged by federal legislation and is increasingly being applied in college settings. The notion that secondary schools that implement universal design might enhance success in the general education classroom and thus foster improved access to postsecondary education needs support from the research literature. Use of instructional and learning technologies, often a component of the implementation of universal design, is growing exponentially as each new platform (e.g., laptop, smart-phone, tablet, online instructional tool) is incorporated into the classroom. Although assistive technology continues to be of tremendous benefit, it is not yet clear whether the growth in instructional technologies will be another area of deficit or, instead, an opportunity to level the playing field for students with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2165143413476881">Parker &amp; Banerjee, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Coaching, counseling, and mentoring interventions have been promoted as worthy elements of transition planning for many students with disabilities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2165143413476881">Field, Parker, Sawilowsky, and Rolands (2010)</xref>, for example, found that coaching was effective in improving executive functioning and learning and study skills but did not impact college performance for students with ADHD. Although counseling and mentoring efforts have an intuitive appeal, we do not have sufficient data to determine what types of programs or program elements are critical and whether they might have a positive impact on the transition to postsecondary education. One question we need to ask about all relevant interventions and programs is</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>There is little doubt the last several decades of research literature has had an impact on students, families, and professionals, especially with regard to the awareness that postsecondary education is a realistic transition goal. More importantly, research has promoted access to postsecondary education for students with a range of disabilities. Experience in postsecondary education is now a minimum qualification for the vast majority of jobs paying a reasonable wage. Moreover, data spell out significant differences in employment rates and salaries of workers who possess only a high school diploma versus those who hold at least one college degree. Thus, it stands to reason that increased emphasis on postsecondary opportunities is assured. This reality means it is imperative we establish evidence-based transition practices that school personnel can rely upon to foster postsecondary success. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2165143413476881">NSTTAC (2010)</xref> has established parameters for evidence-based research based on the efforts of the Council for Exceptional Children and the Institute of Education Sciences. These specifications must be applied by transition researchers, journal editorial boards, universities preparing professors, and school administrators if we are to ensure transition efforts shift from access to postsecondary education to success in postsecondary education, including graduation, subsequent employment, and ultimately, productive adult lives.</p>
