<p>This essay studies the Outfit, the traditional organized crime group in the city of Chicago. The alien conspiracy theory argues that organized crime in Chicago and other American cities descended from the Sicilian Mafia. This article challenges the alien conspiracy theory arguing that the Chicago Outfit is better understood by the ethnic succession argument, which holds that organized crime is explained by Merton’s strain theory. Additionally, it is argued that while Merton’s theory is sufficient to explain the emergence of traditional organized crime, its continuation can only be explained by the existence of racket subcultures in American society.</p>

<p>The “Outfit” is the city of Chicago’s traditional organized crime group. The term “traditional” organized crime is used here to refer to the alliance between criminal groups and corrupt government officials that has existed in large American cities since the second half of the 19th century. The dominant belief is that organized crime in Chicago and other American cities is descendent of the Sicilian Mafia. In fact, the alien conspiracy theory argues that organized crime evolved in a linear fashion beginning with the Mafia in Sicily, emerging in the form of the Black Hand in America’s immigrant colonies and culminating in the development of the <italic>Cosa Nostra</italic> in America’s urban centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1043986213485657">Kefauver, 1951</xref>). This article challenges the alien conspiracy theory and argues that the development of organized crime in Chicago was not related to the emergence of the Sicilian Mafia, but was rooted in the social structure of American society.</p>
<p>Specifically, the argument presented here ties organized crime to strain theory and the emergence of machine politics in Chicago. From 19th-century vice syndicates to the modern-day Outfit, organized crime in Chicago could not have existed without the official blessing of those who controlled municipal, county, and state government. Organized crime was not imported from Sicily but was bred in the socially disorganized slums of Chicago where elected officials routinely franchised vice and crime in exchange for money and votes.</p>
<p>While strain theory may be sufficient to explain the emergence of the Chicago Outfit, it is not sufficient to explain its continuation. By the 1950s, gangsters in Chicago were not raised in the slums of the city but in working-class neighborhoods. A familiar theme running through the sociology literature suggests that there is a relationship between community areas and organized crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1043986213485657">Spergel, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1043986213485657">Tricarico, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1043986213485657">Whyte, 1943</xref>). This argument is grounded in social disorganization theory and has been frequently expressed in the delinquency literature. Commonly described as delinquency areas, racket subcultures, and defended neighborhoods, select community areas have been found to be centers of underworld activities and recruiting grounds for traditional organized crime participation. These differentially organized community areas are fundamental to organized crime recruitment and to the evolution of organized crime in the city of Chicago.</p>
<p>This article begins by reviewing both the alien conspiracy and ethnic succession theories. It continues with a review of research that has challenged the idea that the Sicilian Mafia was the source of organized crime in American society. Research is also reviewed that challenges the idea that the Black Hand was an interim stage between the development of the Mafia in Sicily and the <italic>Cosa Nostra</italic> in American society. After reviewing these arguments, evidence is presented supporting the ethnic succession argument and that Democratic machine politicians began organized crime in Chicago during the late 1800s. Evidence is also presented that organized crime existed in Chicago’s Black community during this same period independent of Mafia, Black Hand, or <italic>Cosa Nostra</italic> involvement, further challenging the alien conspiracy argument. The significance of Prohibition and the emergence of the Torrio–Capone Syndicate are also reviewed as well as the emergence of the Chicago Outfit itself. Finally, evidence is presented that Chicago gangsters did not initially come from Italy but from the socially disorganized neighborhoods of Chicago and later from Chicago’s five racket subculture communities.</p>
<sec id="section1-1043986213485657">
<title>Alien Conspiracy or Ethnic Succession?</title>
<p>The alien conspiracy theory argues that organized crime originated outside of American society. It is viewed as a sinister foreign force that perverts the American system of government. It did not emerge out of American culture but was thrust on the United States by alien newcomers. Its roots lie in values contrary to the American way of life. These values are tied to the cultures of specific ethnic groups who brought organized crime with them when they immigrated to the United States. Following this line of reasoning, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), argues that thousands of Italian organized crime figures, mostly “Sicilian Mafiosi,” have come illegally to this country since the 1900s and that many who fled here in the early 1920s helped establish what is known today as the <italic>Cosa Nostra</italic> or the American Mafia and also that the American Mafia has evolved over the years into the Black Hand gangs of the 1900s and Al Capone’s Syndicate in Chicago in the 1920s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043986213485657">FBI, n.d.</xref>).</p>
<p>The alien conspiracy argument is based on cultural deviance theory. Cultural deviance argues that every person is identified with a social group that has developed its own norms of conduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1043986213485657">Sellin, 1938</xref>). In cultural deviance theory, norms are never violated. Criminals are well-socialized members of the groups to whose cultural codes they invariably conform. What appears to be deviance is simply a label applied by outsiders to the conforming behavior endorsed by one’s own group. People act, for the most part, in accordance with the rules of the group to which they belong. If these rules are in conflict with those of other cultural groups, who have the power to incorporate their values into law, crime occurs. The cause of crime is culture conflict, that is, variation in cultural values defining crime.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1043986213485657">Francis Ianni (1974)</xref> provides an example of cultural deviance theory as an explanation for traditional organized crime. Studying one of New York’s five “crime families,” Ianni argues that Italian American gangsters share a “common culture” and that many of the attitudes and values that supported the entry of Italian immigrants into organized crime were brought with them from their mother country where Mafia practices have existed since the mid-1800s.</p>
<p>In spite of the popularity of the alien conspiracy argument, further support for the alien conspiracy/cultural deviance explanation for organized crime in America is sparse. There is, however, a body of research that focuses on the Sicilian Mafia as a cultural form and a de facto method of social control in the absence of effective state government and not a criminal organization in the American sense of the word (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1043986213485657">Arlacchi, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043986213485657">Blok, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043986213485657">Catanzaro, 1992</xref>; Hess, 1970; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1043986213485657">Lupo &amp; Shugar, 2009</xref>). In particular, these authors argue that the historical Mafia was a phenomenon associated with the large agricultural estates of Western Sicily and their relationship to the commercial markets in Palermo, the island’s capital. The managers of these estates, the <italic>gabellotti</italic>, established a system of control in their own agricultural districts that facilitated cattle rustling, smuggling, and the monopolization of the citrus market, which ultimately extended to the <italic>Conca d’Oro</italic>, the agricultural region that surrounded Palermo. These activities, though illegal, hardly provided the necessary basis for the organization of gambling, prostitution, and labor racketeering in American society.</p>
<p>Modern research has also challenged the alien conspiracy explanation for the Black Hand. There is a consensus about the major characteristics of Black Hand crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1043986213485657">Park &amp; Miller, 1921/1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1043986213485657">Servadio, 1976</xref>). The common belief is that the Black Hand was a criminal organization descendant of the Sicilian Mafia; that only Southern Italians and Sicilians committed Black Hand crime; that only Southern Italians and Sicilians were Black Hand victims; and that those who failed to pay Black Hand demands were killed. Together these characteristics compose a narrative that has become the public perception of Black Hand crime.</p>
<p>Like the alien conspiracy theory, this view of the origin and activities of the Black Hand has its detractors. A number of historians and contemporary observers have pointed out that the Black Hand was not a criminal organization, but simply a method of extortion carried out by individuals or small groups of offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1043986213485657">Landesco, 1929/1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1043986213485657">Nelli, 1976</xref>). In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1043986213485657">Diego Gambetta (1993)</xref> concluded that although Americans historically used the name Black Hand to represent an Italian criminal organization, it was unknown in Italy then (at the turn of the last century) and now. Italian community leader <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043986213485657">Gaetano D’Amato (1908)</xref> went a step further charging that the alleged association between the Mafia, Camorra, and the Black Hand was a “myth.”</p>
<p>Research in the social constructionist traditions has gone so far as to argue that the response to Black Hand activity in the United States, during the early years of the 20th century, was a media construction and constituted a moral panic in the city of Chicago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1043986213485657">Lombardo, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1043986213485657">Sacco, 2003</xref>). Labeling Black Hand activity as the work of a foreign criminal group provided a rallying point for society to organize against the social upheaval created by large-scale Italian immigration. Additionally, the institutional legacy of society’s response to Black Hand extortion transformed Chicago’s normative structure effectively labeling all Italian immigrants as suspect members of the Black Hand. The stereotypical traces left behind by the Black Hand scare also contributed to the development of the alien conspiracy theory forever equating Italian Americans with organized crime.</p>
<p>These findings alone challenge the validity of the alien conspiracy theory. Yet further support for the argument that organized crime is not a foreign import is provided by ethnic succession theory. This theory argues that organized crime is the direct result of conditions within American society. Ethnic succession theory posits that criminal groups have played an important part in the social differentiation of American society and that the urban rackets have allowed successive waves of immigrants—Irish, Jews, Italians, Black, Hispanics—who are on the bottom rungs of society, a means of economic and social mobility that transcends the involvement of any particular ethnic group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043986213485657">Bell, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1043986213485657">O’Kane, 1992</xref>). Although sociologists favor the ethnic succession argument, the alien conspiracy theory dominates the literature and is the generally accepted explanation for the emergence of traditional organized crime. This can be explained by the popularity of media portrayals of the Mafia paradigm and the fact that there has never been a comprehensive theoretical explanation for the emergence and continuation of traditional organized crime in American society.</p>
<p>The ethnic succession argument is grounded in strain theory. Strain theory explains organized crime as a mechanism by which those living in socially disorganized conditions obtain wealth and power through “innovative” or illegal means. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1043986213485657">Robert Merton (1957)</xref> wrote that gangster Al Capone represented the triumph of amoral intelligence over morally prescribed failure when the channels of vertical mobility were closed or narrowed in a society that places a high premium on economic affluence and social ascent for all its members.</p>
<p>It is because of such normal goals as independence through a business of one’s own, and such moral aspirations as the desire for social advancement and prestige that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043986213485657">Daniel Bell (1960)</xref> argues that in the complex and ever-shifting structure of urban society the rackets are one of the crooked ladders of social mobility in American life. Strain, like cultural deviance theory, assumes that people are religiously devoted to following the dictates of their culture. In cultural deviance theory, crime is normative. In strain theory, crime is the result of exposure to a cultural ideology in which failure to orient oneself upward is regarded as a moral defect and failure to become mobile is proof of it.</p>

<sec id="section2-1043986213485657">
<title>Machine Politics</title>
<p>The roots of the ethnic succession argument lie in the history of machine politics in urban areas. Organized crime began in the neighborhood saloons and gambling halls of the cities of the Northeast and Midwest and is the outcome of an evolutionary process extending nearly a century. The creation of modern-day organized crime is the result of a critical juncture in history in which established interdependencies between machine politicians, vice entrepreneurs, and criminal gangs found new meaning in the provision of illegal alcohol during Prohibition.</p>
<p>In Chicago, organized crime began in the 1870s with the activities of Michael Cassius McDonald. McDonald owned a tavern at Clark and Monroe streets known as the “Store,” which reportedly was the largest liquor and gambling house in downtown Chicago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1043986213485657">“Who Is Mike McDonald,” 1892</xref>). McDonald was also active in politics. He headed what was commonly referred to as the “gamblers trust.” In an effort to overcome the reform activities of Mayor Joseph Medill, McDonald organized Chicago’s saloon and gambling interests. “Mike McDonald’s Democrats,” as they were called, elected their own candidate, Harvey Colvin, mayor of Chicago. The year was 1873. With Colvin in office, McDonald organized the first criminal syndicate in Chicago composed of both gamblers and compliant politicians.</p>
<p>McDonald, more than any one person, played a key role in organizing Chicago’s criminals and laid the foundation of Chicago’s Democratic Party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043986213485657">“A King Who Had Us in His Pocket,” 1888</xref>). At the height of his power, “King Mike” boasted that he “ran the town” and that the police were “under his thumb.” He controlled political offices, while his faro banks, “skin,” and “brace” games fleeced unsuspecting gamblers. Noted evangelist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1043986213485657">William Stead (1894)</xref> commented that the peculiar thing about the Chicago plan of dealing with illegal gambling was not that the houses were allowed to run, but the way in which gaming was used as an engine of party finance. “Chicago taught the world how to make the dice box, wheel of fortune, and pack of cards a resource of partisan finance.”</p>
<p>Mike McDonald remained in politics until his death in 1907 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1043986213485657">“Mike McDonald at Death’s Door,” 1907</xref>). After McDonald’s death, control of gambling in Chicago passed on to a number of different people, the most prominent of which were James “Big Jim” O’Leary, Mont Tennes, and First Ward Aldermen John Coughlin and Michael Kenna (Each Chicago Ward had two Aldermen at that time). Coughlin and Kenna retained control of gambling in downtown Chicago while the gambling activity that existed in the Southwest Side, around the Union Stockyards, went to “Big Jim” O’Leary, son of Mrs. Catherine O’Leary whose cow had allegedly started the great Chicago fire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1043986213485657">Griffin, 1976</xref>). Jacob “Mont” Tennes inherited McDonald’s activities in the North Side of the city.</p>
<p>The most important of the new vice lords were John Coughlin and Michael Kenna. Together they formed an organization selling protection to gambling house and brothel operators working in the First Ward and, in particular, the Levee vice district (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043986213485657">Harrison, 1935</xref>). Before 1890, the Levee occupied the blocks between Harrison and Polk Streets, from Dearborn to Clark. The Levee encompassed the Nineteenth Precinct of the First Ward. Within the area, there were 46 saloons, 37 houses of ill fame, and 11 pawnbrokers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1043986213485657">Stead, 1894</xref>). The saloons facilitated the prostitution trade as their proprietors opened upstairs vice resorts for the convenience of the free spending men who had come to Chicago with carloads of cattle and hogs and shiploads of grain. The area was also referred to as the “Custom’s House Levee” because of its proximity to Chicago’s first federal building at 500 South Dearborn. The area was the basis of Mayor Carter Harrison’s political power. Its precincts provided the votes Harrison needed to hold office. In fact, Harrison owned six lots in the district along Clark Street in the heart of the Levee district, which he purchased on moving to Chicago from Kentucky in 1885 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1043986213485657">“Harrison’s Headquarters,” 1883</xref>).</p>
<p>After 1890, because of the growth of Chicago’s downtown business district, Mayor Harrison forced the relocation of the Levee to the area between Nineteenth and Twenty-second Streets, from State to Clark. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043986213485657">Harrison (1935)</xref> wrote in his autobiography that he had forced the Custom’s House Levee to move to protect the passengers on streetcars headed downtown from the Englewood and Stockyards districts. The activities of the red-light district exposed women and children riders to embarrassing behavior. Additionally, 40,000 to 50,000 people a day passed through the Levee. Two of Chicago’s most important railroad depots, the Wisconsin Central and Northern Pacific terminal and the Polk Street station were located in the heart of the vice district.</p>
<p>The social center of the New Levee was Freiberg’s dance hall. Freiberg’s was Located on Twenty-second Street between State and Wabash (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043986213485657">“Death Claims Ike Bloom,” 1930</xref>). It provided dancing and a number of back rooms for activities with the “ladies.” Freiberg’s was also the command post of the Levee. Aldermen Coughlin and Kenna made their headquarters there while conducting important Levee business. Its owner, Isaac Gitelson, better known to Levee regulars as Ike Bloom, took a leading part in Democratic politics, always delivering his precinct by pluralities of two to three hundred votes, seldom allowing the opposition to rack up any significant tallies.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that vice flourished in the Levee district was police captain Michael Ryan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1043986213485657">“Inside Story of Vice’s Grip,” 1914</xref>). Ryan was in charge of the Twenty-second Street police station. He was the “chief of police” of the First Ward and reported directly to Coughlin and Kenna. Even the commissioner of police could not transfer Captain Ryan without their blessing. In fact, Ryan was the hub of Chicago’s “vice ring.” His plain clothes policemen, or “confidential men,” were the spokes, and the sections of the rim were three dive owners and keepers who controlled strings of saloons and bordellos. The first of these rings, and the biggest, was run by James “Big Jim” Colosimo. Julius and Charlie Maibaum headed another, and Joe Marshall and his brothers led the third. This was a different group than the one that headed the Custom’s House Levee.</p>
<p>Colosimo rose to prominence in the Levee by becoming a precinct captain in the Democratic Party after organizing fellow street sweepers into a voting bloc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1043986213485657">“Who Killed Big Jim,” 1954</xref>). He also controlled the vote in the Italian settlement centered at Polk and Clark streets within the First Ward. Although Colosimo has been referred to as Chicago’s “First Vice Lord” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043986213485657">Bilek, 2008</xref>) and the founder of organized crime, he steadfastly refused to engage in bootlegging and was content to remain a pimp and a panderer casting doubt on his pedigree as the father of Chicago’s crime syndicate.</p>
<p>While other gangs were dividing sections of Chicago into liquor distribution territories, Colosimo was content to remain with what he had. He not only controlled vice in the Levee district and the suburb of Burnham, where he had established “roadhouses,” but he also ruled the Street Laborer’s Union and the City Street Repairs Union. This was not acceptable to his protégé John “Johnny” Torrio, who recognized the potential of bootlegging. On May 11, 1920, while waiting for two truckloads of liquor from Big Jim O’Leary, Colosimo was murdered. He was found shot in the head. The suspect in the killing was Frankie Yale (Uale), of the New York Five Points Gang, at the behest of Johnny Torrio.</p>
<p>Although the era of the gangster in Chicago is often attributed to Prohibition, as this review has shown, the genesis of organized crime can be traced back long before the enactment of the Volstead Act. From the beginning of Chicago’s history, the underworld was inextricably interwoven into the social and political structure of the city. Beginning with gambling king Mike McDonald, Chicago’s criminal underworld had, for many years, constituted a powerful political force within the city. The vice lords, saloon keepers, and common criminals who had achieved an alliance with politicians and police provided services that the law prohibited, but which, nevertheless, human appetites craved.</p>

<sec id="section3-1043986213485657">
<title>The Black Mafia</title>
<p>The term “Black Mafia” was coined in 1974 by Francis Ianni to describe the eventual participation of African Americans, and in some cases Puerto Ricans, in organized crime. Ianni’s argument was rooted in ethnic succession theory. While the term was originally intended to describe the replacement of Italians by minority Americans, it is used here to describe African American participation in traditional organized crime in Chicago. Ethnic succession theory, coupled with the almost complete absence of any published account of African American criminal groups, has led to the popular belief that black Americans did not participate in what came to be known as organized crime in America’s urban centers. In reality, African American vice syndicates existed in the South Side of Chicago during the first half of the 20th century, just as Irish and Italian vice syndicates flourished in other areas of the city. Although they did not participate in bootlegging, African American criminal syndicates ran speakeasies and after-hour nightclubs, and participated in illegal casino and policy gambling for almost 50 years. The reason for the lack of a common understanding of African American organized crime can best be attributed to the segregated nature of Chicago’s Black community during this period in history. Chicago’s South Side was a “Black metropolis” that had its own elected officials, business community, and underworld that had little interaction with “White” Chicago.</p>
<p>Chicago also boasted a greater degree of Black participation in politics than any other city in the nation. In the early days of machine politics, the reward for supporting a successful candidate was jobs and graft. The historical record shows that this applied to the African American community, just as it applied to any other ethnic group. Early Chicago Blacks were incorporated into both the First Ward political machine of “Bathhouse” John Coughlin and “Hinky Dink” Mike Kenna and the Second Ward organization of Republican Alderman William Hale “Big Bill” Thompson. The expanding African American community in Chicago’s South Side developed into an independent political force whose endorsement was sought by Republicans and Democrats alike. Chicago Blacks learned early that the political life of the community was powerfully allied with the world of the saloon and the gambling house. And just as in other ethnic communities, an African American underworld developed in Chicago’s Black community to regulate vice activity.</p>
<p>The Black community’s first important vice lord was John “Mushmouth” Johnson. Born in Saint Louis, Johnson migrated to Chicago in 1875 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1043986213485657">“Mushmouth Gets Better,” 1907</xref>). Johnson owned a saloon and gambling hall in the heart of downtown Chicago. His gambling place was said to be unique because the players did not gamble against the house. In 1906, Johnson opened yet another gambling hall, the Frotenac, near Chicago’s infamous Levee red light district. Described as the “Negro Gambling King of Chicago,” Johnson never gambled himself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1043986213485657">“Mushmouth Johnson,” 1907</xref>). He believed that “a man who gambled had no business with money.”</p>
<p>Through the usual formula of payoffs and delivering votes, Johnson rose to the position of “Negro political boss” in the First Ward organization of Hinky Dink and the Bath, thus ensuring immunity for his gambling operations. Johnson was not only the patron of black gamblers, but also held the distinction of being the “man to see” in Chicago’s Chinese quarter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043986213485657">Gosnell, 1967</xref>, p. 127). Representing Coughlin and Kenna, he sold protection to over 20 Chinatown opium dens and gambling halls where <italic>Fan Tan</italic> and <italic>Bung Loo</italic> card games were played (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1043986213485657">“May Segregate Vice,” 1903</xref>).</p>
<p>Another saloonkeeper involved in politics in the Black community was Henry “Teenan” Jones. Jones was involved with Black Second Ward Alderman Oscar De Priest. In 1916, De Priest organized a “colored voters club” that demanded contributions from local gamblers to support upcoming elections. “King Oscar,” as the <italic>Chicago Daily Tribune</italic> referred to De Priest, ran what was described as his “Tammany Club” from a real estate office at Thirty-fifth and State (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1043986213485657">“Healy Admits Bribes,” 1917</xref>). In 1917, De Priest was charged with conspiracy to permit gambling in the Second Ward by Cook County State’s Attorney Maclay Hoyne (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043986213485657">“Capt. Healy and De Priest,” 1917</xref>). (Chicago is one of the 130 towns in Cook County, Illinois.) Under pressure from the state’s attorney, Jones became one of the chief witnesses against De Priest in his corruption trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1043986213485657">“Teenan Jones to Turn Against,” 1917</xref>).</p>
<p>Jones told investigators that De Priest received a monthly tribute of thousands of dollars from the gambling houses in the “Black Belt” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1043986213485657">“Teenan Jones Bares,” 1917</xref>). Jones also testified that he had personally paid US$2,800 in bribes to De Priest during a 4-month period to protect his gambling clubs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1043986213485657">“De Priest Names Harding,” 1917</xref>). Represented by none other than the famous attorney Clarence Darrow, De Priest responded that the money he had received from Jones represented campaign contributions and not graft. The trial of city councilman De Priest clearly demonstrated that an African American vice syndicate existed in Chicago and that payoffs from vice entrepreneurs to public officials were just as common in the Black community as they were in other parts of Chicago. Black officials followed the pattern established by their White counterparts of collecting money from illegal vice operations to fund their political activities.</p>
<p>By 1921, Chicago’s South Side Black community was struggling with an epidemic of gambling and commercialized vice now under the direction of Daniel McKee Jackson. Jackson had become the most powerful African American vice king that the Black community in Chicago has ever known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1043986213485657">“Syndicate Crosses 2D Ward,” 1921</xref>). Jackson’s vice syndicate collected an estimated US$500,000 a year from gamblers and booze sellers in the Second Ward alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043986213485657">“$10,000 Graft Paid Politicians,” 1921</xref>). Graft from the neighboring Third Ward and the adjoining districts was placed at an additional US$200,000. Carter Hayes, Jackson’s secretary, collected the protection money, which was reportedly 40% of the net proceeds of each illicit game. In addition, many poolrooms, saloons, and South Side cabarets were operating craps games, poker games, and blackjack tables, while selling illegal whiskey and gin, and all were expected to contribute to Jackson’s syndicate.</p>
<p>One of the major reasons for the success of Chicago Blacks in controlling vice and gambling in their community was their political connection to William Hale Thompson, Republican mayor of Chicago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043986213485657">Bukowski, 1998</xref>). Thompson had a long history of involvement with the Black community. Thompson’s first political office was that of Alderman of the Second Ward. He was elected to this position in 1900. The Second Ward, located directly south of Chicago’s central business district, contained the largest concentration of Blacks in the city. By 1919, the Second Ward was over 70% Black, 72% of whom were eligible to vote. Citywide, Thompson received 78% of the African American vote in the 1919 mayoral election (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043986213485657">Allswang, 1971</xref>).</p>
<p>As this section has shown, African Americans have always been part of organized crime in Chicago. They controlled gambling in Black areas and formed vice syndicates that helped to organize the vote for a period of 50 years. African Americans in Chicago participated in organized crime just like any other ethnic group. If we ignore the alien conspiracy argument that organized crime was brought to America by Southern Italian and Sicilian immigrants and concentrate on the historical record, we find that Chicago at the beginning of the 20th century contained a number of ethnically based organized crime groups made up of local gamblers, brothel keepers, and crooked politicians.</p>
<p>The activities of Dan Jackson and his supporters in the Second Ward were no different than the activities of Big Jim Colosimo and Johnny Torrio and their Italian gangsters in the First Ward, or Dion O’Banion and his Irish mobsters in the Forty-second. They all participated in the “Big Fix” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1043986213485657">Merriam, 1929</xref>) in which tribute was collected by the ruling political party from crime and vice in exchange for money and immunity from the enforcement actions of the police. Once viewed from this perspective, it becomes clear that Black Americans in Chicago were once among the most powerful criminal groups ever to exist in America. These findings also have important implications for the alien conspiracy theory. Sophisticated organized crime existed in Chicago’s African American South Side without the presence of the Mafia or Sicilian gangsters.</p>

<sec id="section4-1043986213485657">
<title>The Syndicate</title>
<p>After Colosimo’s death, Johnny Torrio assumed control of the Colosimo brothels and their associated gambling houses. Torrio is widely believed to have been a no nonsense businessman who excelled as a master strategist and quickly built an empire that far exceeded Colosimo’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1043986213485657">Nelli, 1970</xref>). With the advent of Prohibition came a demand for illegal alcohol, which the Torrio vice syndicate and other similar groups around the city were in a position to supply. They were well organized and had the political connections to prevent interference from the police. All the concealed agreements made with local politicians over the years, as well as the experience gained by years of struggle against reform elements, were brought into service in organizing the production and distribution of beer and whiskey.</p>
<p>Torrio’s syndicate was an organization of professional criminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1043986213485657">Landesco, 1929/1968</xref>). It differed from other criminal gangs such as the Chicago’s notorious Valley Gang in that it was not an outgrowth of a neighborhood play group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1043986213485657">Thrasher, 1927</xref>). The gang was formed by adult criminals for the administration of vice, gambling, and illicit liquor. Many of Torrio’s henchmen were seasoned veterans recruited from the various segments of the criminal community. For example, Torrio gangster Marcus Looney, an arsonist and labor slugger, had been a member of the Gilhooley Gang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043986213485657">“Gilhooley Gang All Free,” 1909</xref>). Anthony “Tough Tony” Capezio and Claude Maddox were recruited from the Circus Cafe Gang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1043986213485657">“Questioned,” 1945</xref>). James “Fur” Sammons was a former member of the Klondike O’Donnell Gang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1043986213485657">Murchie, 1936</xref>).</p>
<p>Outside the area of the First Ward and the Torrio organization, there were a number of other gangs working in collusion with local politicians and police to support vice activities and violate Prohibition laws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1043986213485657">Lyle, 1960</xref>). Dion O’Banion and his followers controlled Chicago’s Near North Side. Klondike O’Donnell and his brothers controlled the Near Northwest Side. Roger Toughy, who claimed only to be a bootlegger and not involved in vice, controlled the Far Northwest Side. The “Terrible” Genna brothers controlled the Near West Side Taylor Street area. Terry Druggan and Frankie Lake and their Valley Gang controlled the Far West Side. On the Southwest Side, the Irish O’Donnell brothers, the Ralph Sheldon Gang, and the Saltis-McErland Gang were all active in bootlegging.</p>
<p>These gangs were largely centered in immigrant areas where the gangster often served as the right arm of corrupt politicians at election time. In exchange for delivering the vote, gang members were allowed to continue in their criminal activities, the proceeds of which often went to support local political organizations. Take the example of the Ragen Colts. The Colts were members of the Ragen Athletic Club, which fulfilled the multiple functions of running football and baseball teams, training boxers and wrestlers, and operating as the local center for the Democratic Party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043986213485657">Gregston, 1924</xref>). The club was sponsored by Frank Ragen, a member of the Cook County Board of Commissioners. Ragen provided these important community services in an effort to influence the young men of his district to support the Democratic ticket. As well intended as Frank Regan may have been, his club also supplied the manpower for Ralph Sheldon’s bootlegging gang.</p>
<p>Realizing that there was enough money to be made by all, Torrio approached the leaders of Chicago’s other top gangs and suggested that they give up burglary, robbery, and crimes of violence in favor of bootlegging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1043986213485657">Lyle, 1960</xref>). The return from these traditional practices, he contended, did not justify the risks taken when compared to the profits to be made from smuggling alcohol. The key to success during Prohibition was territorial sovereignty. Each gang would control liquor distribution in their own areas and not encroach on the territory of the others. Many gang leaders agreed to Torrio’s plan and things functioned well—for a while.</p>
<p>On January 24, 1925 Torrio was shot by members of the rival O’Banion gang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1043986213485657">“Torrio is Shot,” 1925</xref>). A short time later, he entered the Lake County jail to serve out a 9-month sentence stemming from a raid on the Sieben’s brewery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1043986213485657">McPhaul, 1970</xref>). On his release, Torrio retired to New York where he once again became involved in bootlegging and worked as a bail bondsman. When Torrio left Chicago, he transferred everything to his second in command, Al Capone. Capone was now the lord of the Levee and much of Chicago’s underworld. With the disintegration of the Torrio coalition, however, Capone faced a war with many of Chicago’s criminal gangs. The intense competition that resulted led to Chicago’s infamous “Beer Wars” of the late 1920s. The gangs mainly aligned themselves according to ethnic ties. The Irish, Polish, and Jewish gangsters, such as the West Side O’Donnells and the Saltis-McErlane gang, joined behind O’Banion’s successor, Hymie Weiss. The Sicilians, notably the Gennas, stuck with Capone. So did Terry Druggan and Frankie Lake whose Valley Gang was headquartered in the Near West Side Maxwell Street area adjacent to the Taylor Street Italian stronghold.</p>
<p>The war came to an end on February 14, 1929 in the S.M.C. Cartage garage at 2122 North Clark Street when the remaining members of the O’Banion gang and their allies were murdered by forces loyal to Capone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043986213485657">Chicago Police Department, 1929</xref>). Seven men were machine-gunned to death in what has become known as the Saint Valentine’s Day Massacre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1043986213485657">“Murder of Seven Men,” 1929</xref>). No one has ever been convicted of the murders though Vincenzo de Mora, alias “Machine Gun” Jack McGurn, and Capone gangster Joseph Lolordo, were arrested. Also arrested were Capone gunmen, Albert Anselmi and John Scalise. The car used in the murders was found in a garage at 1723 North Wood Street, around the corner from the Circus Cafe, headquarters of the Circus Cafe Gang an affiliate of the Capone mob. Capone is believed to have ordered the killings.</p>
<p>By 1930, Al Capone, then only 31 years of age, had become the supreme overlord of vice in Chicago. The <italic>Chicago Daily Tribune</italic> estimated that he controlled 6,000 speakeasies and 2,000 handbooks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043986213485657">Bennet, 1929)</xref>. The combined revenue from these activities plus prostitution and racketeering was estimated to be US$6,260,000 a week. During the 4-year beer war (1922-1926), 315 gangsters had murdered one another and Chicago police killed another 160 gangland members in running gun battles. Colonel Robert Isham Randolph, president of the Chicago Chamber of Commerce, reported that the crime syndicate operated with impudence as Capone’s men expanded into payroll robberies, jewelry holdups, labor racketeering, and the protection racket. All because of the money paid to law enforcement to protect the beer racket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043986213485657">“Beer Sold Here in Week,” 1931</xref>).</p>
<p>Chicago was a wide-open town. Police and judicial corruption were so widespread that the Better Government Association petitioned the U.S. Congress to intervene in the internal affairs of the city arguing that its leaders were in league with gangsters and that the city was overrun with protected vice (Hoffman, 1929). The alliance between corrupt government and organized crime was made clear by Big Bill Thompson’s return to city government. Promising that “he was as wet as the Atlantic Ocean,” Thompson was returned to the mayor’s office with strong support from Chicago’s criminal element. A number of Capone gangsters actually worked in Thompson’s campaign headquarters. The Chicago Crime Commission reported that Capone donated US$260,000 to Thompson’s reelection fund. The money was used to purchase the right to run houses of prostitution, gambling dens, slot machines, and control the sale of outlawed beer and alcohol. The money was reportedly paid out to Thompson’s workers from a bathtub in the Sherman Hotel that was filled with packages of five-dollar bills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043986213485657">“Charges Capone Put Up $260,000,” 1931</xref>).</p>
<p>The alliance between the Thompson administration and the Capone Syndicate was an important milestone in the development of organized crime in Chicago. The Syndicate was now the official mediator between the underworld and Chicago’s political structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1043986213485657">Petersen, 1956</xref>). Independent gamblers could no longer seek out their own deals with local politicians. The alliance between gangsters and politicians was so powerful that a 1930 police raid found Capone henchmen Paul Ricca, Ralph Pierce, Murray Humphreys, and Frank Rio meeting with Illinois State Representatives Albert Prigano and Roland Libonati, and Saul Tennanbaum of the city attorney’s office. Several firearms were also uncovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043986213485657">“Big Gamblers Not Worried,” 1931</xref>).</p>
<p>Realizing that there was a total breakdown in municipal government, Chicago Crime Commission director Frank Loesch traveled, with a group of prominent businessmen, to Washington D.C., to meet with President Herbert Hoover regarding crime conditions in Chicago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1043986213485657">Hoffman, 1989</xref>, p. 21). As a result of this meeting, the president ordered a full-scale attack on the Capone Syndicate by the Treasury Department’s Prohibition Bureau and the Internal Revenue Service. Under the supervision of 28-year-old Elliot Ness, Prohibition agents battered down the doors of 19 Capone distilleries and six breweries and seized or destroyed more than US$1,000,000 worth of whiskey, beer, delivery trucks, and other equipment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1043986213485657">Lyle, 1960</xref>). While the “Untouchables,” as Ness’ men became known, were busy dismantling Capone’s bootlegging empire, agents of the Internal Revenue Service were also busy assembling tax cases against Capone and many of his leading hoodlums.</p>
<p>When Prohibition ended in 1933, Al Capone was in jail for tax and Prohibition violations. The organization that he had helped to create now turned its attention to the control of gambling, prostitution, and other illegal activities. Because bootlegging had provided immense resources in terms of money and organization, an unprecedented consolidation and centralization of underworld power had occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043986213485657">“Gangs to Fight,” 1933</xref>). During the years that followed Prohibition, it became increasingly clear that the Capone Syndicate dominated organized crime in Chicago. The Capone organization had emerged as the most vicious fighters in the war to control the distribution of illegal alcohol in Chicago. There is no evidence, as is commonly believed, that Capone’s men were members of the Sicilian Mafia. Capone, himself, was not Sicilian, but Neapolitan. In fact, most of the members of the Capone Syndicate were not even Italian.</p>
<p>A list of the members of the Capone Syndicate published in 1936 by the <italic>Chicago Daily Tribune</italic> reported that the organization had 181 members during its heyday in the years between 1925 and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1043986213485657">1931</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1043986213485657">Murchie, 1936</xref>). Of those 181 members, only 75 (41%) had Italian surnames. The <italic>Tribune</italic> organized the Capone Syndicate into four departments: the Board of Directors, the Income Department, the Protection Department, and the Gunmen. Only the Protection Department was dominated by Italian members. The involvement of Capone, Torrio, Nitti, and the Gennas had fixed the image of the Mafia forever in the minds of Chicagoans, but as this review has shown, organized crime was firmly in place in Chicago when the first Sicilian immigrant set foot on the shores of Lake Michigan.</p>
<p>By 1931, most Chicagoans had lost their faith in Mayor Thompson. Many Chicago communities had become rampant with prostitution, gambling, murder, and flagrant lawlessness because of the mayor’s acceptance of protected vice. As a result, Thompson lost the mayor’s office to Anton Cermak. Cermak, however, was no reformer. While anti-Capone, Cermak was not antivice. Recognizing the financial importance of gambling to the political structure in Chicago, he moved to rationalize the city’s gambling enterprises under his own control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1043986213485657">Gottfried, 1962</xref>). He recognized the importance of gambling for the Democratic political machine. Cermak attempted to reorganize gambling under the supervision of his own political followers including gamblers Ted Newberry and Martin Guilfoyle.</p>
<p>On February 15, 1933 Cermak was shot and killed while speaking with then president-elect Franklin Delano Roosevelt in Miami, Florida. He was soon succeeded by former undertaker and sanitary district engineer Edward J. Kelly. Kelly was the choice of Cook County Democratic Party chairman Pat Nash. Kelly served as mayor of Chicago from 1933 to 1947. Kelly was an advocate of the “liberal-town policy,” a more refined version of the “wide-open town” policy advocated by Mayor Thompson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1043986213485657">Peterson, 1948</xref>). While official pronouncements informed the public that the Capone Syndicate did not exist, the streets of Chicago were lined with handbooks and policy gambling flourished in Chicago’s South Side. The Kelly–Nash combination had turned to the Syndicate for revenue to fund their political organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043986213485657">Biles, 1984</xref>). Tribute paid to the Democratic Party by the vice lords was a vital source of political funding. The supervision of gambling revenue was entrusted to each ward committeeman. A portion of the money collected went to Democratic offices downtown, while the rest stayed in the ward to defray campaign expenses.</p>
<p>The Kelly–Nash machine had a more ruthless and efficient alliance with the underworld than any previous Chicago administration. Under it, 7,500 protected gambling establishments were said to operate openly. Financial records obtained by the <italic>Chicago Daily Tribune</italic> in 1943 showed that the Syndicate was paying US$300,000 a year to politicians, police, and public officials in Cook County and its country towns. The records also showed that Syndicate profits from slot machines and gambling houses in Cook County outside of Chicago were approximately US$2,666,000 a year. The <italic>Tribune</italic> obtained the records after gangster Jake Guzik left them in the oven of his room when he moved out of a fashionable North Side hotel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043986213485657">“Courtney Only Rival,” 1943</xref>).</p>
<p>Although frequently overlooked, Kelly’s contribution to organized crime in Chicago rivaled that of Big Bill Thompson. A 1946 investigation of the police department by the Chicago Crime Commission found that the Chicago Police Department was ruled by Kelly’s city hall machine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1043986213485657">“Chicagoans Pay for a Safe City,” 1946</xref>). Gambling was controlled in each police district by the “captain’s men,” plain clothes officers who worked directly for the district captain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043986213485657">“Cliques in Their Jobs,” 1946</xref>). Their job was to collect tribute from gamblers, bawdy houses, and cheating night clubs and taverns. Other officers were not allowed to interfere. Any officer brash enough to set out against these activities was quickly disciplined and transferred to some undesirable assignment. Even if a case did make it to court, they were often “fixed” by Kelly’s Democratic precinct captains who were employed as court clerks. Judge Edward Casey, a Republican, even alleged that the city’s newly created Rackets Court was established by the Kelly–Nash machine to ensure that no bookmaker could be convicted of a crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1043986213485657">“Police Reveal,” 1938</xref>).</p>
<p>After 14 years as mayor, Edward Kelly was asked to step down in 1946. The Kelly administration’s ties to organized crime had alienated many voters. When Kelly left office, <italic>Chicago Tribune</italic> reporter Clayton Kirkpatrick wrote that while “It is agreed that Prohibition thoroughly corrupted the police department. The corrupting influence was prolonged by tolerance of horse race gambling during the 14 years that the late Edward J. Kelly was mayor.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043986213485657">“Chicago’s Cops More Honest,” 1953</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section5-1043986213485657">
<title>The Outfit Emerges</title>
<p>The 1950s brought new leadership to the Capone Syndicate. Things were changing. The old timers who had known Al Capone were dead, in prison, or living in lavish suburban homes and a new group of younger men were taking their place. These new gangsters weren’t born in Sicily, nor did they grow up running beer during Prohibition. They were former delinquents who had terrorized the streets of Chicago. Among them were many members of the Forty-two Gang. The entrance of the Forty-two Gang marked a turning point in organized crime in Chicago. Until this time, the crime syndicate was controlled by Levee gangsters. With the advent of the Forty-two Gang, control of organized crime moved to the West Side of Chicago. Former Forty-two Gang members such as Sam “Teets” Battaglia, Marshal “Joe Rosso” Caifano, William “Potatoes” Daddano, “Mad” Sam De Stefano, Charles “Chuckie” English, and Albert “Obie” Frabotta all attained positions of prominence in the Outfit during the 1950s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1043986213485657">Leonard &amp; Smith, October 25, 1959</xref>). In 1958, Sam “Mooney” Giancana, another Forty-two Gang member, rose through the ranks to head organized crime in Chicago.</p>
<p>The 1950s also brought the accelerated use of the term the “Outfit.” A former gangster told this author that the word Outfit was a casual name used by gang members when they were talking among themselves and about their group. They would say,
<disp-quote>
<p>I joined the Outfit two years ago. It was supposed to be a secret—the Outfit. Nobody was supposed to know what it meant except the guys involved, but it eventually grew out of hand and became the name of the group. (Outfit Member, personal communication, 1993)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The Outfit also differed from the Capone Syndicate in another significant way—the ethnicity of its members. Most of Capone’s gangsters were not Italian. Most of the members of the Outfit were. By the 1950s, 78% of the members of the Outfit had Italian surnames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1043986213485657">U.S. Congress, 1953</xref>). This trend continues today. As late as 2003, 77% of the members of the Chicago Outfit had Italian names (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1043986213485657">Laborers International, 2003</xref>). The decision to limit membership to those of Italian descent is attributed to Paul “The Waiter” Ricca, who allegedly decreed during his reign as the Outfit’s leader that only Italians would be permitted to hold top positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1043986213485657">“Mob Menace in Chicago,” 1954</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the things that helped bring members of the Forty-two Gang to power in the Chicago Outfit was the takeover of policy gambling engineered by Sam Giancana. Policy was an illegal lottery controlled by the Black community. As the successor to the Capone Syndicate, the Outfit worked tirelessly after Prohibition to control all vice activities in Chicago. By 1950, the one remaining racket was policy gambling. In spite of the economic and political importance of policy gambling to Chicago’s African American community, Blacks would lose control of the policy racket. Although Mayor Ed Kelly was on good terms with Chicago Blacks, the Kelly–Nash machine that ran Chicago had acquiesced control of all gambling to the crime syndicate. The reason for the complicity of the Chicago Democratic Party was the estimated US$12 million collected annually from illegal gambling and vice activities. This association between the Kelly–Nash Machine and organized crime had set the stage for the Outfit’s attack on policy gambling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1043986213485657">“The Gambling Swag,” 1934</xref>).</p>
<p>The takeover of policy gambling was not the Syndicate’s first intrusion into the Black community. The <italic>Chicago Defender</italic> newspaper reported in 1952 that early, Black drug peddlers in Chicago were ex-bootleggers who had turned to narcotics after the end of Prohibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1043986213485657">“Negroes on Outside Say Police,” 1967</xref>). The reason for this was twofold. It was no longer possible to make money in bathtub gin and Black bootleggers already had the essential contacts with the Capone mob to acquire drugs. Although Chicago’s African American community produced a number of prominent drug traffickers in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, it was always an accepted fact that the “big wheels” in the drug trade in the Black community were Italian gangsters. Blacks obtained heroin from the Chicago mob and in turn passed them on to the peddlers and pushers who sold drugs at the street level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1043986213485657">U.S. Congress, 1964</xref>).</p>
<p>The 1950s also brought new efforts to gain control of labor unions, particularly the Teamsters Union (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1043986213485657">“Mob Menace in Chicago,” 1954</xref>). Gangsters had extorted labor unions since the days of Prohibition. Controlling Chicago’s Teamsters would give tremendous power to the Outfit. Striking truck drivers could strangle the city with labor unrest and stop deliveries of food and other materials. On September 16, 1950, three Syndicate gangsters accosted William Lee, president of Teamsters Local 734 stating, “We want in.” Lee was also the reigning president of the Chicago Federation of Labor. Lee’s assault was followed by a campaign of violence in which two union officials were murdered, one shot, and 10 homes and offices bombed.</p>
<p>In May 1950, U.S. Senator Estes Kefauver began a series of investigative hearings into organized crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1043986213485657">“Senator Kefauver,” 1950</xref>). In Chicago, Kefauver subpoenaed a number of Capone era gangsters and highlighted the connection between the underworld and Democratic politicians. Testimony was obtained that certain members of the Illinois legislature freely associated with gangsters and voted against legislation designed to curb gangster activity as well as legislation sponsored by the Chicago Crime Commission. Known as the West Side Bloc, the group was a bipartisan coalition of elected officials, tied to the Chicago Outfit, who supported every corrupt politician who came into office (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1043986213485657">“What Can Angry People Do?” 1952</xref>). Originally referred to as the Capone Bloc, the West Side Bloc included a coterie of corrupt Chicago Aldermen, Illinois State legislators, and U.S. Congressmen who attempted to thwart every worthwhile piece of anticrime legislation brought to vote in the General Assembly in Springfield, Illinois and in the U.S. Congress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043986213485657">Chicago Crime Commission, 1967</xref>). It included the First, Twenty-seventh, and Twenty-eighth Wards and the legislative districts that encompassed these areas.</p>
<p>The name West Side Bloc came from the fact that most of its members were from the West Side of Chicago and voted as a bloc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043986213485657">Gavin &amp; Egelhof, 1964</xref>). Their point of origin was the inner-city wards along the Chicago River where the crime syndicate had a strong voice in politics, gambling, and vice. These wards often contained skid row areas—South State Street, West Madison Street, and North Clark Street—each lined with cheap saloons, flophouses, and burlesques shows. Each was a descendant of an older tenderloin district developed under the protection of a political boss. The reason for the enduring affinity between politicians and skid-row derelicts was that politicians needed their votes on election day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1043986213485657">“Skid Row Bums,” 1955</xref>).</p>
<p>Local law enforcement was helpless largely because of the political power of the mob. The Outfit sold narcotics, muscled labor unions, and forced saloon keepers and restaurant owners to install their juke boxes and pinball machines. They also ran handbooks, dice games, gambling casinos, and brothels. The <italic>Chicago Daily Tribune</italic> estimated in 1959 that the Outfit controlled 1,000 places in Chicago and suburban Cook County where a person could gamble in one form or another. All made possible by a powerful alliance between elected officials and underworld gangsters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1043986213485657">Leonard &amp; Smith, October 18, 1959</xref>, December, 27 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1043986213485657">1959</xref>). The Outfit was so powerful that virtually every organized illegal activity came under their control. When they heard of an independent gambling operation or a tavern where “strippers” and “bar girls” solicited drinks, the Outfit demanded a percentage of the profit to ensure police protection and peace with the Outfit.</p>
<p>While the Outfit remained quietly in power for the next 30 years, things began to change after the 1981 election of Ronald Reagan. Reagan appointed a national commission to develop new remedies to cripple America’s crime syndicates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1043986213485657">Reagan, 1983</xref>). Reagan had firsthand experience with organized crime when as a member of the Screen Actors Guild, he watched as the Chicago Outfit tried to muscle in on the motion picture industry. His commission recommended that an aggressive effort be launched to root out organized crime concluding that previous efforts have been disorganized and largely ineffective. The commission also recommended that steps be taken to rid labor unions of mob influence through the extended use of electronic surveillance, aggressive enforcement of federal antiracketeering laws, and the decertification of unions that were found to be mob-controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1043986213485657">Kozil, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Although there had been a number of significant organized crime prosecutions in Chicago, it was 20 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1043986213485657">2005</xref>) before the Justice Department announced that it had indicted the Chicago Outfit as a “criminal enterprise.” Dubbed “Operation Family Secrets,” 14 gangsters were arrested on charges stemming from murder to bookmaking and tax fraud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1043986213485657"><italic>U.S. v. Nicholas Calabrese et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Described by U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald, as a “hit on the mob,” the case was a milestone event in the battle against organized crime. What made this case particularly important was that it charged the defendants with committing 17 murders in furtherance of crime syndicate activities. The murders occurred between 1970 and 1986 and read like a history of organized crime in Chicago. One man, Frank Calabrese was charged with participating in 13 of the alleged killings. Organized crime’s grip on the city of Chicago had ended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1043986213485657">Huffstutter, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Racket Subcultures</title>
<p>After Prohibition, the Capone Syndicate had established itself throughout the Chicago area setting up cells in each of Chicago’s major Southern Italian colonies. These cells eventually became the source of fresh recruits and the “street crews” of the Chicago Outfit. Street crews are organizational grouping in which the Outfit’s activities are carried out. As the Syndicate grew in territory, its leaders looked for people who they could trust to govern their newly expanded activities. In that the Syndicate was dominated by men of Italian descent, it was only natural for them to look among their own kind for recruits. All organized criminals whether Italian Cosa Nostra groups, Jamaican Posses, or Chinese Triads depend on trust and loyalty to operate and survive. The basis for such trust is usually found in the primary blood culture. Thus kinship patterns, ethnicity, and place of family origin and birth all become important factors in the selection of personnel.</p>
<p>The Chicago Police Department named the street crews of the Chicago Outfit after the five neighborhoods in which they emerged: Taylor Street, Grand Avenue, Twenty-sixth Street, the North Side, and the suburb of Chicago Heights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043986213485657">Chicago Police Department, 1987</xref>). In addition to these areas, there are also a number of other Chicago communities that have had a reputation of being associated with organized crime. They include the suburbs of Cicero, Elmwood Park, and Melrose Park. These communities differ, however, in that they were not the locations of the original indigenous organized crime street crews. The groups that have been present in each of these other Chicago areas began because gangsters from the five original street crew neighborhoods relocated there. For example, in the 1960s many gangsters left the Taylor Street neighborhood and moved to Melrose Park just as they later moved to the suburb of Elmwood Park. As a result, these towns received an infusion of people associated with organized crime.</p>
<p>The early development and formation of organized crime in each of Chicago’s street crew neighborhoods generally followed the familiar pattern set in the Levee district. This is especially true in the Taylor Street, North Side, and Chicago Heights areas. Both the Taylor Street and the North Side communities were dominated by corrupt political organizations. Each had their own equivalent of boodlers Bathhouse John Coughlin and Hinky Dink Mike Kenna. Alderman and saloonkeeper John Powers controlled the vote in the Near West Side Taylor Street area and was an avid supporter of gambling king Mike McDonald. Alderman “Hot Stove” Jimmy Quinn, also a saloon operator, was in political control of the Near North Side and promoted gambling boss Mont Tennes.</p>
<p>Although there is strong support for strain theory as the foundation of the ethnic succession argument, strain alone cannot explain the continuation of organized crime. While ethnic succession explains the entrance of poverty-stricken newcomers into vice and crime at the turn of the last century, it cannot explain the continued dominance of organized crime by Italian Americans. This article argues that Italians continued to dominate organized crime after rising out of poverty because of the presence of racket subcultures within American society. These racket subcultures manifested themselves in Chicago in the form of the Outfit’s five street crews.</p>
<p>Although conducted before the establishment of the street crews, John Landesco researched organized crime in Chicago as part of the 1929 Illinois Crime Survey. The main theme of Landesco’s book was that organized crime had its roots in the culture and social structure of the neighborhoods in which the gangster was raised. He found that gangsters came from neighborhoods where “the gang tradition is old” and where the residents could absorb the attitudes and skills necessary to enter into the world of crime. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1043986213485657">Landesco (1929/1968)</xref> argued that</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The gangster is a product of his surroundings in much the same way that the good citizen is a product of his. The good citizen grows up in an atmosphere of obedience to law and of respect for it. The gangster has lived his life in a region of ‘law breaking, graft, and fixing.’” (p. 221)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The importance of Landesco’s work is that it clearly pointed out that gangsters did not come from Sicily or the south of Italy but that they came from the slums of American cities.</p>
<p>In a subsequent study of street gangs in Chicago’s Near West Side Taylor Street community, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1043986213485657">Landesco (1932)</xref> found that the only role models available to the children were the successful gangster and the politician. They were the big-shot liquor and beer bosses and elected officials who “fixed” cases for the criminal underworld. Together with their gangster followings, the big-shot politicians ruled the civic life of the neighborhood. Landesco’s work not only described the operations of the adult racketeer but also revealed the neighborhood environment and social philosophy that started many young boys on careers of crime and made it possible for them to obtain political power and immunity from punishment through organized criminal activity.</p>
<p>Evidence of Chicago communities providing support for recruitment into organized crime can also be found in the works of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1043986213485657">Solomon Kobrin (1951)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1043986213485657">Gerald Suttles (1972)</xref>. Studying the same Taylor Street neighborhood, Kobrin found that neighborhood gangsters were not only involved in managing illicit enterprises but also frequently maintained membership in local churches, mutual benefit societies, and political parties. Within this framework the influence of each value system was reciprocal. As a result, gangsters and racketeers became part of the local community power structure, each supporting the other. Their position in the community also allowed them to identify those who excelled as delinquents as possible candidates for membership in organized crime.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1043986213485657">Suttles (1972)</xref> also studied Taylor Street, which he called the Addams area. He described Taylor Street as a “defended neighborhood.” The defended neighborhood is a residential group that seals itself off through the efforts of delinquent gangs, restrictive covenants, sharp boundaries, and a forbidding reputation. In these neighborhoods, the conventional and criminal value systems are highly integrated allowing residents to share collective representations and moral sentiments, which allow some to recognize the pursuit of a career in the underworld as a legitimate way of life. The most subtle structural feature of the defended neighborhood is its shared knowledge of what might be called the communities “under life.” The possession of these bits and pieces of knowledge contribute to the collective identity of the neighborhood and act to further separate insiders from outsiders. Those who share this residential identity have a special right to such knowledge, which according to Suttles lead some to aberrant or provincial ways of behaving including participation in organized crime.</p>
<p>The existence of racket subcultures in Chicago and other American cities raises the question of the importance of Mafia traditions to the continued existence of organized crime. Does the fact that post-Prohibition organized crime was often centered in Italian communities lend support to the alien conspiracy theory? Certainly one would think so, but there is an alternative explanation. The ethnic succession argument is grounded in social disorganization and strain theory. Residents of socially disorganized slum neighborhoods have traditionally used crime and organized crime, in particular, as a mechanism of social advancement. Following the social disorganization tradition, this essay argues that these so-called racket subcultures exhibited a “differential” social organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1043986213485657">Sutherland, 1955</xref>). This differential social order integrated the presence of adult criminality into the social structure of community life, a life that was dominated not by Mafia culture, but by corrupt machine politics. From 19th-century vice syndicates to the modern-day Outfit, organized crime in Chicago could not have existed without the official blessing of those who controlled municipal, county, and state government. Organized crime was not imported from Sicily, but was bred in the socially disorganized slums of America where elected officials routinely franchised vice and crime in exchange for money and votes and it was these differentially organized community areas that provided recruits and allowed Italian-dominated organized crime to continue after Italian Americans achieved middle-class status.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article has sought to challenge the alien conspiracy explanation for the emergence of the Chicago Outfit, the traditional organized crime group in Chicago. The data presented here demonstrate that the Sicilian Mafia was not responsible for organized crime in Chicago; that the Black Hand was a newspaper construction; and that most of Al Capone’s gangsters weren’t even Italian. In fact, the Chicago Outfit did not restrict membership to Italians until 1950, nearly 20 years after Prohibition. Chicago gangsters did not come from Sicily and the South of Italy, but from the slums and the street crew neighborhoods of Chicago. Organized crime in Chicago was the direct result of machine politics. As an old-time bookie for the North Side Street Crew told this author, “There is no such thing as organized crime; it is called the Democratic Party” (Chicago bookmaker, personal communication, 1972). His statement is an obvious referral to the fact that the Outfit in Chicago was for many years intimately tied to the established political structure.</p>
