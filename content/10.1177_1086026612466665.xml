<abstract>
<p>A failed proposal to substitute wind energy for mountaintop removal coal mining provides a valuable case study illustrating the weakness of theoretical approaches that neglect class relations and the analytical strength of Marxist ecology for understanding the processes of environmental degradation. The latter’s strength is shown in its illumination of the ways in which class relations in the coalfields are tied to capitalism’s metabolic rift and how this rift shapes political struggle and developmental path dependencies. Using Marx’s approach of successive abstractions, the interrelated drivers and consequences of mountaintop removal mining in the Coal River Valley are analyzed from three vantage points: the perspective of ecology, of capital, and of human development. The destructiveness involved in this type of coal production reveals the ways in which capitalism depends on an <italic>après moi le déluge</italic> regime, discounting the future, and thus barring sustainable human development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Coal River Mountain (CRM) is located in Raleigh County, West Virginia. It is one of the last standing peaks in the Coal River Valley. The other missing peaks are among the more than 500 mountains in the Appalachian region blasted apart and dumped into the nearby valleys through the process of mountaintop removal (MTR) coal mining. CRM has been at the center of a conflict over two ways to produce electrical power from the mountain. One is to use MTR techniques to blast away the ridgeline and mine the coal seams beneath for burning in power plants. The other is for construction of a “farm” of wind turbines across the ridge. An economic study commissioned by a local community group and environmentalists found that the local benefits of the wind farm exceeded the surface mines’ at every stage when including measures for so-called “externalities” of negative health and environmental effects on the surrounding community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1086026612466665">E. Hansen, Collins, Hendryx, Boettner, &amp; Hereford, 2008</xref>). The advantage of the wind farm for sustainable human development in the long term seems clear. The MTR mines would complete their energy and economic contributions after less than 20 years whereas the wind farm could operate indefinitely. The ecological costs of the MTR mines, including the loss of the mountain’s wind power potential, would continue long after mining ends. The Federal and the West Virginia State governments have declined to intervene and mining preparation has begun on part of the ridge.</p>
<p>The apparent irrationality of the MTR mines appears even greater when considering coal’s central place in larger ecological crises, particularly climate change. NASA climatologist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1086026612466665">James Hansen (2009)</xref> wrote,
<disp-quote>
<p>[CRM] is the site of an absurdity. . . . The issue . . . is whether the top of the mountain will be blown up, so that coal can be dredged out of it, or whether the mountain will be allowed to stand. It has been shown that more energy can be obtained from a proposed wind farm, if [CRM] continues to stand. More jobs . . . More tax revenue . . . . would continue indefinitely. Clean water and the environment would be preserved. But if planned mountaintop removal proceeds, the mountain loses its potential. . . . Someone needs to tell President Obama: [CRM] is a symbol of the promise and the hope and the possibilities for a brighter future.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This situation presents a conundrum for ecological modernization theories that focus on technological innovation and fuller accounting of ecological costs (or “natural capital”) by placing front and center contradictory class interests. I examine the logic behind the “absurdity” on CRM using critical political economy’s insights into capitalist rationality, the larger region’s history of underdevelopment, and the economic and political power leveraged by the coal industry.</p>
<p>The forces thwarting what Hansen calls the “the hope and the possibilities for a brighter future,” can be found deeply embedded in the structure and history of capitalist development. Marx’s <italic>Weltanschauung</italic> included not only a class-economic critique of capitalist political economy but also a critique of capitalist robbery of the environment, that is, the theory of metabolic rift. For Marx (developing on Liebig) industrial capitalism removed food and fiber from the soil and transported it hundreds and sometimes thousands of miles to the city, preventing its recirculation to the soil, and resulting in urban pollution. This notion of a metabolic rift—or as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1086026612466665">Marx (1990)</xref> put it—an “irreparable rift in the social metabolism,” has been seen by sociologists as the key to Marx’s conception of ecological sustainability. Moreover, there is a direct connection here to class analysis—since the metabolic relation to nature is for Marx the labor and production process itself, which is alienated under capitalist society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1086026612466665">Foster, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1086026612466665">2000</xref>). Weber raised similar concerns in his analysis of the system of <italic>Raubbau</italic> associated with industrial capitalism—a concept derived from Liebig and Marx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1086026612466665">Foster &amp; Holleman, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1086026612466665">Austin and Clark (2011)</xref> have demonstrated the utility of Marx’s concept of metabolic rift in relation to MTR in Appalachia. This work responds to their call, echoed from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1086026612466665">McMichael (2010)</xref>, to tackle the epistemic consequences of capitalism’s metabolic rifts by employing multiple vantage points of analysis to problematize the different spatial and temporal boundaries involved.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1086026612466665" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>How should social scientists go about abstracting the process of MTR for analysis in such a way as to both present a broader critique of the system that produces it and inform political action?</p>
<p>Marx’s method employs an ontology of “internal relations” that takes <italic>relations</italic>, and the <italic>processes</italic> they imply as the units of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1086026612466665">Ollman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1086026612466665">Paolucci, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1086026612466665">Levins and Lewontin (1985)</xref> argue “What makes materialist science is that the process of abstraction is explicit and recognized as historically contingent within the science” (p. 149).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1086026612466665">1</xref></sup> When engaging in relational analysis, a <italic>vantage point</italic> or perspective must be established. From there, the horizontal extension (or spatial scale) of the <italic>relation</italic> under analysis, as well as the temporal extension within which to trace its moments, is crafted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1086026612466665">Lewontin &amp; Levins, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1086026612466665">Paolucci, 2009</xref>). This brings certain dynamics into relief while abstracting out others that are, for the moment, treated as “constants.” This multilevel conception of systems and causality emphasizes that the constraints of “broader” levels—of human societies in general for instance—shape but do not determine in mechanistic fashion the operation of systems at narrower levels of generality, for example, that of class societies or capitalism. The potential also arises for chance occurrences at one level of causation forming path dependencies, that is, structural constraints, at other levels. Therefore, an iterative process moving across levels of generality and between vantage points is required to elaborate the relation between the “whole” and its “parts.” Such a dialectical approach has shown itself invaluable both in understanding natural history and human history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1086026612466665">Clark &amp; York, 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1086026612466665">Gould, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1086026612466665">Haila &amp; Levins, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1086026612466665">York &amp; Clark, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1086026612466665">York &amp; Mancus, 2009</xref>). Marx’s method offers an encompassing perspective with which to integrate ecology and sociology while respecting the different forms in which social and material–ecological relations shape history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1086026612466665">Foster &amp; Clark, 2008</xref>). Such conceptualization is vital for understanding the effects of contemporary environmental problems, such as habitat destruction, on longer, broader issues like biodiversity and ecosystem resilience in the face of rapid climatic change.</p>
<p>Because capitalist development is inherently uneven in space and time, how we abstract these processes critically affects our understanding of their meaning for human societies and the natural world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1086026612466665">Bunker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1086026612466665">Harvey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1086026612466665">Hornborg, McNeill, &amp; Martinez-Alier, 2007</xref>). CRM today is at the base of an energy commodity chain not only central to the U.S. economy but also global in scope. West Virginia exports 79% of the coal it produces beyond its borders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1086026612466665">Energy Information Administration, 2010</xref>). The social choices made regarding CRM can be situated generally within the political economy of modern capitalism, but the particulars are determined by the history of the region as an <italic>extractive periphery</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1086026612466665">Bunker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1086026612466665">Dunaway, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1086026612466665">Walls, 1978</xref>).</p>
<p>The threats to the local landscape and ecosystems in the lifetime of current residents and their children are simultaneously part of metabolic rifts that threaten the stability of the biosphere as a whole across a span of <italic>geologic</italic> time. I maintain that to understand the problem of MTR on CRM at least three vantage points must be employed in rotation: the perspective of ecology, of capital accumulation (political economy), and of human development (human “social” ecology); each at multiple levels of abstraction (e.g., of the community, the state/region, the nation, and the globe). A full analysis is beyond what can be attempted in this space. Instead, I will provide an overview, and then proceed with some examples in more detail.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1086026612466665">
<title>The Social Metabolism of Mountaintop Removal and Its Metabolic Rifts</title>
<p>The ecological disasters emanating from MTR are the result of the “social metabolism” of capitalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1086026612466665">Austin &amp; Clark, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1086026612466665">Mészáros, 1995</xref>). The rational regulation of society’s metabolic relationship to nature (the flow and exchange of materials and energy) is inhibited wherever it threatens the reproductive needs of capital’s particular social metabolism (the flow and accumulation of surplus value). Capital typically responds to rifts in its social metabolism by shifting them elsewhere where they only reassert themselves at a vaster scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1086026612466665">Foster, Clark, &amp; York, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1086026612466665">Harvey, 1981</xref>).</p>
<p>It is often claimed that simple substitution of green energy technologies will be sufficient to avert ecological disaster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1086026612466665">Friedman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1086026612466665">Mol, Sonnenfeld, &amp; Spaargaren, 2009</xref>). Yet on CRM such alternative technological possibilities are being destroyed along with the mountain itself, contrary to the expectations of ecological modernization theorists. However, that such an agenda is being pursued cannot be attributed to mere ignorance, or shortsightedness on the part of the capitalists. Indeed, it is a reflection of the formal rationality (substantive irrationality) depicted by Weber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1086026612466665">Foster &amp; Holleman, 2012</xref>). The failure to substitute a wind farm for MTR mines at CRM is a product of capitalist modernity in extractive peripheries: high levels of absentee ownership, governmental capture by extractive capital, and the narrow time horizon of modern economic decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1086026612466665">Austin &amp; Clark, 2011</xref>). CRM is a <italic>specific concrete</italic> case that reflects many <italic>essential relations</italic> of the crisis of our social and ecological systems in <italic>general</italic>.</p>
<p>What is irrational from a perspective of human development is rational from the profit-maximizing standpoint of capital. Capital’s shortsightedness and indifference to quality of life was remarked upon by Marx from its earliest days:
<disp-quote>
<p>In every stock-jobbing swindle every one knows that some time or other the crash must come, but every one hopes that it may fall on the head of his neighbour, after he himself has caught the shower of gold . . . <italic>Après moi le déluge</italic> [After me, the flood!] is the watchword of every capitalist and of every capitalist nation. Capital therefore takes no account of the health and length of life of the worker, unless society forces it to do so. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1086026612466665">Marx, 1990</xref>, p. 381)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Marx’s argument equally applies to ecological conditions as they relate to reproduction of the labor force and its quality of life. As Marx was aware, the phrase “Après nous le d<bold>é</bold>luge” was used by German botanist Matthias Schieden to describe the threat of regional climate change brought on by capitalist society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1086026612466665">Foster, 2011</xref>). Principal to Marx’s analysis is the conclusion that capitalist production is a process of exploitation of both the soil (earth) and the worker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1086026612466665">Foster, 2000</xref>). We should, therefore, not be surprised by reckless disregard for both the health of the worker and the health of the land, which are viewed as either “free gifts” or disposable commodities—factors of production to be exploited to their fullest.</p>
<p>From these general contradictions presented by the system, I proceed to the more specific historical contradictions of CRM—an analysis rooted in the metabolism of the region. The vantage point of capital brings into focus only those narrower aspects of the problem that impinge on the accumulation process. As an internal periphery, Appalachia’s people and resources have always been viewed by capital as expendable, and capital has never hesitated to liquidate them should it perceive doing so to be in its interests and power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1086026612466665">Dunaway, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1086026612466665">Walls, 1978</xref>). In contrast, the vantage point of ecology provides the basis for a broader materialist critique. After examining the ecological relations and capital’s system of metabolic regulation, the challenges facing real human development for the people of Coal River can be soberly considered.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1086026612466665">
<title>The Vantage of Point Ecology</title>
<p>MTR coal mining in Central Appalachia is an instructive vantage point from which to elaborate the relationship of global crises to the localized operation of our political economic system. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1086026612466665">Austin and Clark (2011)</xref> posit, “The ecological degradation linked to [MTR] is simply a microcosm of the unsustainable dynamics of an economic system, driven by the ceaseless accumulation of capital that is creating an ecological rift in the planetary boundaries” (p. 16). MTR is connected at multiple points to at least six of the “planetary boundaries” of the biosphere identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1086026612466665">Rockström et al. (2009)</xref>, whereby natural systems are approaching or experiencing catastrophic failure: climate change, ocean acidification, biodiversity loss, freshwater depletion, the nitrogen cycle, and massive changes in land use.</p>
<p>The life cycle of coal is full of quantitative (e.g., the amount of carbon in the atmosphere and oceans) and qualitative (e.g., toxic processing chemicals, species loss) problems suited to dialectical, metabolic analysis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1086026612466665">Clark and York (2005a)</xref> have analyzed climate change as the result of a metabolic rift in the earth’s carbon cycle. The following analysis reiterates that the climate crisis is part of a larger and still differentiating metabolic rift between capitalist society and natural systems that threatens their resilience. For a detailed description of Marx’s theory of metabolic rift and its application to MTR see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1086026612466665">Austin and Clark (2011)</xref>.</p>
<sec id="section5-1086026612466665">
<title>Air</title>
<p>The proposed MTR mines on CRM would eliminate the potential for future wind development in the area. The steep contours and elevation of the mountains are partially responsible for the potential to generate power at a viable rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1086026612466665">E. Hansen et al., 2008</xref>). It is also doubtful that the new ridgeline constructed from the “reclaimed” rubble leftover from mining would be stable enough to anchor wind turbines.</p>
<p>Weekly, a Hiroshima bomb’s equivalent of explosives is used in Appalachian MTR operations. This blasting, compounded by coal processing and transportation, spreads fine-grained particles of pulverized minerals and chemical residue. These are linked to respiratory problems in humans and presumably could be affecting wildlife as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1086026612466665">Aneja, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1086026612466665">Epstein et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The mining itself is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change and ocean acidification. The mining process, including the disruption of the soil and forest as well as fuel for extraction and transport, adds an estimated additional 7 to 17% to the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of the coal’s actual consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1086026612466665">J. F. Fox &amp; Campbell, 2010</xref>). Methane, a greenhouse gas with a shorter life span but 25 times higher potency than CO<sub>2</sub>, is also released during the mining process.</p>
<p>Finally, the combustion of coal itself creates, in addition to more CO<sub>2</sub>, nitrogen oxides (NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>) that contribute to corrosive ground-level ozone. Ozone and particulates from coal plants are major contributors to respiratory disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1086026612466665">Epstein et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1086026612466665">
<title>Water</title>
<p>Changing the shape and surface of the mountains can alter rainfall patterns and the clearing of forest and filling of streams with debris is associated with increased flooding that can damage farms, homes, and businesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1086026612466665">Palmer et al., 2010</xref>). Given the disruptions of the hydraulic metabolism wrought by the coal industry in the Coal River Valley, the watchword of capital there has <italic>quite literally</italic> become “Après moi le déluge!” Beyond the quantitative flows of water, the quality of water bodies is negatively affected by changes in temperature, dissolved oxygen, sediment load, chemical composition, and pH. Over one tenth of the surface areas of numerous watersheds in West Virginia have been disturbed by MTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1086026612466665">Palmer et al., 2010</xref>). Blasting can change water tables, damaging or drying up wells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1086026612466665">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [U.S. EPA], 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1086026612466665">Palmer et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Chemicals that were previously stabilized in geologic formations are exposed to air and water, becoming toxic pollution that affects aquatic life and human residents’ drinking water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1086026612466665">U.S. EPA, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1086026612466665">Palmer et al., 2010</xref>). The processing of coal after mining to remove certain chemicals and impurities to enhance its price has produced hundreds of billions of gallons of toxic coal slurry across the region that is stored in earthen dams or injected underground. The former pose the risk of failure and flooding in addition to water contamination, while the latter has been associated with residents’ well water contamination and health impacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1086026612466665">Burns, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1086026612466665">Epstein et al., 2011</xref>). West Virginia alone has 126 slurry impoundments with more than 110 billion gallons of coal-processing waste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1086026612466665">Epstein et al., 2011</xref>). This presale processing of coal is one example of modern “clean coal technology” whereby harmful environmental effects of the coal life cycle are diverted from the burning stage to extractive communities.</p>
<p>The effluent from mine sites is usually channelized into retention ponds requiring perpetual treatment to limit the outflow of the toxic heavy metals and acid drainage. The pollution containment efforts are widely ineffective and contaminants from surface mining in the Appalachian headwaters have been detected throughout the waters they feed, thus exacerbating the larger freshwater supply problem. The spread of water contamination will continue from many of these sites and raises question of who will pay for continued monitoring and treatment. Significant water degradation has been detected downstream two decades after MTR sites have been “reclaimed” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1086026612466665">Lindberg et al., 2011</xref>). A wider temporal extension of the problem brings into focus climate change–induced weather patterns as the range of precipitation levels exceeds that under which mine site reclamation has been engineered for “acceptable” risk levels. A trend toward greater high precipitation events has already been detected and many communities in the area have experienced flooding off of mountains with MTR and clear-cut operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1086026612466665">Burns, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1086026612466665">Epstein et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1086026612466665">Palmer et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Further down the coal consumption process, coal plants produce large amounts of toxic coal ash that threaten water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1086026612466665">Ruhl, Vengosh, Dwyer, Hsu-Kim, &amp; Deonarine, 2010</xref>).

<title>Land Use, Habitat, and Biodiversity</title>
<p>Capitalism’s metabolic rifts affect energy and nutrient cycles linking many species across multiple ecosystems in complex ways that make analysis challenging. While the three MTR mines permitted on CRM will disturb around 6,450 acres (10 square miles) and bury 9 miles of streams, their effects will reach further, undermining the already damaged resiliency of the species endemic to the mixed mesophytic forests of the region. As species population sizes and habitat ranges shrink their risk of extinction over time increases.</p>
<p>During mining, the area being blasted and or buried under rubble is, of course, no longer suitable for its previous inhabitants. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, mining in the Central Appalachian region has been associated with 65% of all changes in land cover between 1973 and 2000, with 4.4% of the region’s surface area transformed from forest to mining. During that period, the surface area consumed by mining at any given time accelerated twofold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1086026612466665">Sayler, 2008</xref>). In that latter decade, approximately 1,200 miles of streams were damaged, more than 700 miles buried completely, and at least another 535 miles were permitted to be damaged with 66% of those to be buried (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1086026612466665">EPA, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1086026612466665">Ward, 2008</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1086026612466665">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Current Federal policy regarding species conservation in the mining region is that by implementing surface mining permitting laws, regulatory agencies automatically meet their obligations under the Endangered Species Act, without the necessity of actually surveying for any endangered species in mining areas. This makes data on species relatively scarce, but from what is known of Appalachian forest and stream ecology there are likely a significant number of endemic species as yet unidentified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1086026612466665">Epstein et al., 2011</xref>). In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1086026612466665">2010</xref>, the Center for Biological Diversity filed a petition for federal listing as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act 30 aquatic, riparian, or wetland species that “are specifically threatened by [MTR]” (p. 19). Selenium levels are decimating fish populations downstream from MTR mines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1086026612466665">Lindberg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1086026612466665">Palmer et al., 2010</xref>). The mountains of Central Appalachia are not only the source of waters for the larger region but also habitat for species that traverse the continent. For example, the migration of bird species that make their home in the Appalachians in the spring to reproduce is disrupted by MTR. Detrivore insects consume leaf litter washed into headwater streams, cycling nutrients both into useable forms for aquatic organisms downstream and, later, during their adult stage, back into terrestrial forest ecosystems (e.g., as a food source for migratory birds; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1086026612466665">McQuaid, 2009</xref>). When headwater streams are mined through or buried this cycle is disrupted.</p>
<p>Biodiversity is thus negatively impacted by both outright habitat destruction and long-term degradation that extends beyond the immediate mine site via the disruption of wider food webs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1086026612466665">Palmer et al., 2010</xref>). The loss of biodiversity weakens the resilience of the ecosystem over the medium to long term and makes it more vulnerable to catastrophic reorganization, for example, under pressure from climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1086026612466665">Gunderson &amp; Holling, 2002</xref>). The ecological rifts at the long-term global scale could easily reinforce and exacerbate the local effects of MTR on CRM—again illustrating the importance of iterative multiple levels of analysis.</p>
<p>Events unfolding on CRM reveal that, paralleling the global ecological crisis, there is a tendency by the government toward reductionist or simplistic framing of the problem and biological issues involved. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1086026612466665">Palmer et al.

<title>The Vantage Point of Capital</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The exchange of commodities is the process in which the social metabolism, in other words the exchange of particular products of private individuals, simultaneously gives rise to definite social relations of production, into which individuals enter in the course of this metabolism.

</disp-quote></p>
<p>Exchange value is the lifeblood of capital’s social metabolism. But unlike economies of simple commodity production [C-M-C or commodity–money–commodity], simple circulation is insufficient for capital’s metabolism—its circulatory system requires a constantly increasing supply of its lifeblood. Productivity and efficiency are defined in terms of the creation and appropriation of surplus value.</p>
<p>Most of the metabolic rift created by MTR is invisible from the vantage point of capital because it is external to its considerations and interests except where imposed by material necessity or struggle:
<disp-quote>
<p>[A] basic contradiction of the capitalist system of control is that it cannot separate “advance” from <italic>destruction</italic>, nor “progress” from <italic>waste—</italic>however catastrophic the results.

Fox, 1999</xref>). Researchers have tried to calculate the ecological and human costs accruing outside markets in price terms as “externalities.” “Externalities” in general, and the case of MTR and CRM in particular, reflect the conflict between the human metabolism with nature for use-values that must characterize <italic>production in general</italic> with the historically specific, and self-undermining, domination of production for exchange-value in the <italic>capitalist mode of production</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1086026612466665">Foster et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1086026612466665">Paolucci, 2009</xref>).

<p>The bold attempt by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1086026612466665">E. Hansen et al. (2008)</xref> at a cost–benefit analysis of coal versus wind on CRM to sway policy makers presents an opportunity to examine how thoroughly ecological and human considerations do not factor into the logic of capital but rather are actively “externalized”. On the benefit side of the ledger, E. Hansen et al. include increased jobs, earnings, and economic output. On the cost side, they quantified externalities arising from wind or MTR development in terms of “excess deaths and illness, and environmental damage” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1086026612466665">E. Hansen et al., 2008</xref>, p. vi). Because the mining operation would last only 17 years, cumulative benefits diverge more sharply over time. They find that under conservative estimates about the extent of local manufacture for wind operations, cumulative earnings from wind will surpass surface mining after approximately 100 years. Cumulative county jobs from wind take about 80 years to rise above and neither wind’s cumulative energy output or contribution to economic growth approach that of the surface mines scenario in the study period. The strength of the study’s argument for wind, absent future investment in local wind manufacturing, rests largely on the inclusion of externalities whereby the MTR scenario generates large <italic>negative</italic> earnings for the county over its life of operation. Also, the time horizon for all capitalists is constrained, earnings are valued less the further into the future they are. After applying a standard “discount rate,” the landowners receive a net present value of $63 million in revenue from MTR and only $19 million from wind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1086026612466665">E. Hansen et al., 2008</xref>, p. 42).</p>
<p>The study was never meant to convince landowners, however, who had already sold the coal rights. Cost–benefit analysis, by its premises, obscures the unequal class (and often gendered and racial) division of who bears costs and who reaps benefits as well as the incommensurability of money, nature, and human life. Yet it is the hegemonic form of discourse for the current government in questions of private property use and the public interest. Movement actors, therefore, face the difficult choice of employing, and perhaps unintentionally lending legitimacy to that form of political economic discourse that <italic>reflects capital’s vantage point</italic>, in order to object to destructive development. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1086026612466665">Foster et al.

<p>The unevenness of capital’s social metabolism, its unequal flows of use-values and exchange-value, has been keenly felt in Appalachia. Communities suffer from the degradation of their own ecosystems while gaining little of the use-values and exchange-value resulting from coal production and consumption. Regional economic “development,” from the vantage point of capital, is concerned with capital accumulation and circulation in the form of wages and investments. For the absentee capital which dominates in mining, the concern is future profitability in general and with respect to their asset holdings specifically. The “sunk” nature of extractive investment makes political defense of these assets a higher priority than in other types of industry where companies can liquidate assets more easily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1086026612466665">Barham &amp; Coomes, 2005</xref>). The dominance of the coal industry is a case typical of extractive peripheries where the dominant industry retards the growth of others and contributes to underdevelopment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1086026612466665">Bunker, 1984</xref>). While opportunities for continued accumulation for the owners of surface-mined lands may be conceived in theory, only 6% of mine sites across the region, 4% in West Virginia have seen post mining business (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1086026612466665">Geredien, 2009</xref>). Several projects such as a prison and big box stores that have been undertaken have seen their construction costs vastly increased due to the instability of the reclaimed land. Therefore, many MTR sites fail the permitting requirement of leaving the terrain flattened for “higher and better use,” even by capitalist standards.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1086026612466665">Bunker (1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1086026612466665">2007)</xref> has argued, capitalist extractive activity is inherently self-undermining as resources are depleted. For capital, all sources of value are equivalent—so such depletion is little issue, it can simply move on. For extractive <italic>communities</italic> with ties to place and particular forms of real wealth found in their environment this points to an inevitable decline—a source of suffering, resistance, and efforts for transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1086026612466665">Montrie, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1086026612466665">Pfleger, Pfleger, Wishart, &amp; Cooper, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1086026612466665">Puckett, Fine, Hufford, Kingsolver, &amp; Taylor, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Without transcending the system, victories by social movements are still possible but the underlying ecological contradictions central to capitalism are not resolved away but simply shifted and displaced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1086026612466665">Foster et al., 2010</xref>). These shifts occur both within and between capital’s labor and ecological contradictions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1086026612466665">J. Fox (1999)</xref> notes how regulatory attempts to reduce acid rain pollution from coal power plants (a market-based procedure celebrated by ecological modernization theorists) contributed to increased surface mining and ecological destruction in West Virginia, rendering it an “environmental sacrifice zone.” Through decades of bitter struggle, coal miners won improved wages and safety, putting upward pressure on labor costs. Mining capital’s response, as in most industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1086026612466665">Schnaiberg, 1980</xref>), has been to harness more powerful technologies to increase productivity. More powerful cutting and loading equipment used underground increased dust and health problems for miners even as they reduced the labor force and increased the power of management over the labor process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1086026612466665">Couto, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1086026612466665">Podobnik, 2006</xref>).

The most incredible of these new productive strategies are surface mining in general and MTR in particular.</p>
<p>Political investments in the form of political donations and propaganda are factored against returns in the form of subsidies, taxes, and regulation. The institutions of the state and local governments may have longer term interests in conflict with capital, but the time horizon of most elected officials is still quite short and the power structure is dominated by coal and other absentee capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1086026612466665">Bell &amp; York, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1086026612466665">J. Fox, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1086026612466665">Veblen, 1997</xref>).

There is evidence to suggest that the coal industry is actually a net drain on the state budgets of Central Appalachian states, highlighting the relationship of the state and monopoly capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1086026612466665">Boettner &amp; McIlmoil, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1086026612466665">Konty &amp; Baily, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1086026612466665">McIlmoil, Hansen, &amp; Boettner, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1086026612466665">McIlmoil, Hansen, Boettner, &amp; Miller, 2010</xref>). Surface mining not only allows profitable extraction of thinner seams uneconomical for deep mining but also, importantly, allows for the fuller, more profitable, extraction of thicker seams that could be deep mined. Industry representatives claim: “The facts are that the disturbance is limited, and the type of mining is controlled by the geology” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1086026612466665">McQuaid, 2009</xref>, p. 5). The profitability of mining hinges on the price of coal versus costs of regulatory compliance, labor costs, the tax/subsidy balance, alternative uses of the land for timber, development, tourism, securitization and speculation, and so on. These social factors interact with geology to determine not only how coal is mined but also whether it is mined at all. As the depletion of higher quality coal reserves continues, the importance of regulatory neglect and state subsidy to maintain profits grows.</p>
<p>Returning to the case of CRM shows the <italic>Après moi le déluge</italic> reign unfolding. Rowland Land Company, the major absentee owner of CRM, began speculating on coal and timber lands in the late-19th century and remains one of the county’s largest propertied interests. The coal company awarded the permits to mine CRM, Massey Energy, became the largest coal company in West Virginia under the fiercely antiunion leadership of Don Blankenship. At Massey there was reportedly a saying “A man is like a tool. If it’s bent or broke, get rid of it, and get you a new one” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1086026612466665">Shnayerson, 2008</xref>, p. 29). A federal investigation into an explosion at one of Massey’s mines that killed 29 workers confirmed this sentiment finding the “root cause” was “a pervasive culture that valued production over safety” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1086026612466665">Mine Saftey and Health Administration, 2010</xref>, p. 157). The company also became the most aggressive in applying MTR in the region:
<disp-quote>
<p>Once, every mine in the Coal River Valley was a union operation. Now, thanks to Blankenship, hardly a union mine remains . . . with more mountaintop mines than any other . . .

<p>Surface mining employs fewer workers and uses skills with earthmoving equipment that often are less specialized and regulated than those of underground miners making “replacement workers” easier to come by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1086026612466665">Bell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1086026612466665">Burns, 2007</xref>).

Massey Energy accumulated 60,000 days of violations of the Clean Water Act over a period of 6 years without any action from State regulators. When Federal authorities finally intervened in 2008, Massey paid less than 1% of an estimated $2.4 billion in penalties.

<title>The Vantage Point of Sustainable Human Development</title>
<p>“Human development” has been fostered by social scientists as a concept distinguished from mere economic growth by focusing on quality-of-life relations such as freedom from poverty, and high levels of health, education, measures of “social capital,” and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1086026612466665">Bagchi, 2008</xref>). In this sense, it is more closely related to the vantage point of ecology, taking into account externalized social costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1086026612466665">Kapp, 1978</xref>), than the vantage point of capital. Social problems such as poverty or lack of education are only problems for capital to the extent that they limit effective demand, threaten reproduction of the labor force, or raise the cost of labor power by a shortage of workers with the minimum skills required. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1086026612466665">Burkett (2005)</xref> has argued that Marx had his own concept of sustainable human development that shares common features with modern conceptions. It saw the labor process itself, defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1086026612466665">Marx (1990)</xref> as the metabolic relation between human beings and nature, as structured to encourage the growth of human health, abilities, and self-expression—in accord with the rational regulation of the human–nature metabolism. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1086026612466665">Lebowitz (2010)</xref> proposes that the question of productivity for a socialist society must be concerned with the production of human beings—all commodities, productive processes, and so on, must be optimized to that end. This is consistent with a fundamentally ecological point of view.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1086026612466665">Paul Baran (1962)</xref> presciently noted in his work on economic growth and underdevelopment, the “optimum” output of a rational and humane society is a matter of meeting finite human needs through appropriate ends—it is a qualitative and quantitative view of production:
<disp-quote>
<p>The meaning and contents of the “optimum” involved are essentially different from those attached to this notion in bourgeois economics. They do not reflect a configuration of production and consumption determined by profit considerations of individual firms, by the income distribution, tastes, and social pressures of a capitalist order; they represent a considered judgment of a socialist community guided by reason and science. . . . a scientific policy of conservation of human and natural resources, and the like.</p>
<p>Nor does this “optimum” presuppose the maximization of output . . . It may well be associated with . . . a voluntarily shortened labor day, of an increase in the amount of time devoted to education, or of conscious discarding of certain noxious types of production (coal mining for example).(pp. 42-43)</p>

<p>Such “noxious types of production” have effects on the land that cannot be separated from their effects on the people.

There is also evidence that educational progress in children is stunted in mining communities by some combination of social or ecological harms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1086026612466665">Cain &amp; Hendryx, 2010</xref>). The basic reproduction and healthy development of future generations is a foundational, rather than external, question from the vantage point of human development.</p>
<p>What constitutes “efficient” use of CRM is tied up in the <italic>question: Efficient to what end</italic>? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1086026612466665">E. Hansen et al. (2008)</xref> note that on average wind energy has a higher energy return on energy invested of 18 to 1, than coal with 8 to 1. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1086026612466665">Daly’s (1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1086026612466665">2007)</xref> concept of use-value oriented efficiency offers a four-part model that considers efficient use of both human artifacts and ecosystem stocks. This model, more useful from the vantage point of human development, considers both sustainability and equitability of the distribution of use-values. Piercing the veil of money, the choice of MTR over wind would constitute a gross inefficiency of both ecosystem maintenance efficiency and ecosystem service efficiency. Human development must take into account substantial ecological considerations and, given its open-ended historical development, may come to include a very broad cultural need/relation to nature depending on the path of history. We should not lose sight of the cultural ties to the land and life existing on it that many residents of the region have mourned as being lost to the process of MTR.</p>
<p>For Marx, and some ecological economists, human needs are historically developed. Therefore, we cannot definitively say today what future generations may decide their needs are. Yet the economy on Coal River is geared to liquidating use-values in nature and the depopulation and scattering of communities. Whether or not the natural degradation of MTR has subverted local accumulation definitively, when MTR is coupled with an intentional depopulation of communities in the Coal River Valley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1086026612466665">Bell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1086026612466665">Burns, 2007</xref>), the possibility of human development there is lost with its people. It is an economy that supports an ever-smaller numbers of workers.</p>
<p>Because there is a contradiction between the value of money as the highest expression of exchange-value and natural forms of use-value, sustainable human development requires the application of reason and planning outside of markets. Planning is also required to account for proper valuation of forms of labor that are not involved in commodity production (e.g., reproductive or subsistence labor). Such “meta-industrial” labors form a crucial basis for the conditions of production and yet are commonly also treated as “external” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1086026612466665">Salleh, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Sustainable human development requires a process of production where the diverse use-values of the different parts of nature are accounted for and considered (e.g., energy return on investment) and decided on collectively rather than remaining the narrow prerogative of the owning class who consider only their projected, <italic>and discounted for the future</italic>, profits. Indeed, such discounting raises fundamental problems of equity for future generations, exposing how deeply embedded capital’s <italic>après moi le deluge</italic> maxim is.</p>
<p>Ultimately, human development in Appalachia does not seem suitable to the same intensity of systematic analysis as the other two vantage points because it is fundamentally dependent on communities as subjects of their own history. What can be shown is that capitalist development places structural constraints on the choices available to communities and must be superseded for sustainable human development. Analysis from the vantage point of human development raises the necessity of social control over the metabolic regulation of society’s relation to nature.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>While there are many campaigns to halt MTR, an essential aspect of the struggle over CRM is that it is not simply a fight to end king coal’s reign but also to heal the rifts it has wrought and put forth in its place a sustainable human alternative. The alienated social metabolism of capital accumulation is fundamentally antagonistic to the requirements of a healthy and sustainable ecological metabolism. Although the wind proposal for CRM represents the promise of sustainable human development, the looming triumph of MTR within the current system—if not directly challenged on a thoroughgoing class-ecological basis—constitutes a concrete manifestation of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1086026612466665">Mészáros (2008)</xref> calls the “destructive uncontrollability” of capitalist relations of production. It is a stark reminder that it is these very social relations that must be confronted to heal the metabolic rift. “Après moi le déluge!” continues to be the watchword of the capitalist system—as shown by MTR and the destructive uncontrollability of fossil-fuel capitalism. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1086026612466665">Marx (1990</xref>, p. 959), in contrast, defined socialism as a society in which “the associated producers govern the human metabolism of nature in a rational way . . . accomplishing it with the least expenditure of energy and in conditions most worthy and appropriate for their human nature.” Above all, the concern should be one of maintaining the earth for “the chain of human generations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1086026612466665">Marx, 1990</xref>, p. 754). From this material vantage point, MTR stands as a symbol of the ultimate destructiveness of capitalism, and of the dire need for a sustainable human alternative.</p>
