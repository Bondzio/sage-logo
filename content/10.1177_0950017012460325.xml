<abstract>
<p>There has been considerable debate about the impact of different national institutional environments on work organization. The Nordic countries, with their strong trade unions and well developed systems of social partnership around collective bargaining and vocational education and training, are found to be particularly advanced when it comes to developing more autonomous job roles. While institutions are said to play a key role, some commentators point to the existence of national employment ‘logics’ which may have a more far-reaching influence. Drawing upon qualitative research, the article compares the job of fitness instructor in Norway and the UK. The study finds little evidence of a clear country-level difference in job design, suggesting that if there is a national employment ‘logic’ it has been overwhelmed by specific industry dynamics.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There has been considerable debate about the durability of different national institutional environments and their impact on employment, work organization and job quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0950017012460325">Gallie, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0950017012460325">Hall and Soskice, 2001</xref>). Analyses of the European Working Conditions Surveys suggest that Scandinavian countries have gone furthest when it comes to developing forms of work organization which combine higher levels of autonomy and learning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0950017012460325">Gallie (2007</xref>: 99), for example, reports that the Scandinavian countries have ‘exceptionally high levels of individual task discretion, job variety and opportunities for self-development in the job’. By contrast, the UK is found to have proportionally fewer jobs that provide ‘discretionary learning’ and more jobs that are described as ‘simple’ or ‘Taylorist’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0950017012460325">Holm et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>A small number of comparative case studies has also shown that there are country-based differences in the skills and autonomy of those working in intermediate and lower-level jobs (for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0950017012460325">Doellgast, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0950017012460325">Gautié and Schmitt, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0950017012460325">Prais and Wagner, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017012460325">Quack et al., 1995</xref>). Typically, skill levels and task discretion are found to be lower in the UK and the USA, when compared to France, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark. However, this pattern is not always consistent; for example the work organization of hotel room cleaners varies little whether it is performed in Denmark or the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0950017012460325">Vanselow et al., 2010</xref>). Explanations for higher levels of skill and autonomy have rested, in some cases, on product and service quality, but more often on a range of national and sectoral regulatory and institutional factors.</p>
<p>While much of the theoretical framing (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0950017012460325">Hall and Soskice, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0950017012460325">Maurice et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0950017012460325">Streeck, 1992</xref>) that links national institutions and work organization was developed from research in a narrow range of manufacturing industries, attention is increasingly focusing on the experience of ‘new service sectors’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0950017012460325">Batt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0950017012460325">Bosch and Lehndorff, 2005</xref>). In many emerging areas of service provision, those features of the German and Scandinavian systems which are said to be central to shaping more autonomous forms of work organization, such as union presence, industry-wide collective bargaining and a strong system of vocational education and training (VET), are either limited or absent. In such a context, jobs might be expected to resemble more closely their equivalents in neo-liberal economies, such as the UK. Nevertheless, some commentators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0950017012460325">Dobbin and Boychuk, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0950017012460325">Hollingsworth and Streeck, 1994</xref>) have argued that, irrespective of industry factors, there is evidence of a national employment system or ‘logic’ that permeates the whole of an economy. This article considers the notion of different national employment logics and whether they can influence skills and work organization in sectors that lack the aforementioned institutional structures.</p>
<p>The research compares a relatively new service-sector job in Norway and the UK, two countries with among the most contrasting national patterns of work organization. Norway, classified as a ‘coordinated market economy’ (CME) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0950017012460325">Hall and Soskice, 2001</xref>) or Scandinavian ‘welfare state’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0950017012460325">Esping-Andersen, 1999</xref>), is among those countries which cluster at the top of surveys of ‘better’ forms of work organization. The UK is a variant of a neo-liberal economy and tends to be at the lower end in terms of skill levels and discretion. The fitness industry has emerged and expanded rapidly in both countries over the last 20 years, becoming a significant player in leisure activities. Fitness instructors provide a useful comparative case in that the job is relatively open to variation in the level and breadth of skills demanded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0950017012460325">Lloyd, 2005</xref>). In Norway, the fitness industry lacks the ‘typical’ institutional features that are associated with the national model, such as strong trade unions, sector collective agreements and social partnership-based VET. Despite such absence, is there evidence of a Norwegian national employment logic which shapes or encourages employers to develop higher skilled and more autonomous fitness instructor roles than those found in the UK? If there are distinct logics, through which mechanisms do they primarily operate?</p>
<p>The article begins by exploring the literature on comparative institutional analysis and what it can tell us about variations in work organization across countries. The second section explains the approach and methodology adopted in this study. Using evidence from the research, the third section identifies the key industry dynamics in the two countries and the institutional arrangements that have emerged. The fourth section draws upon empirical data at workplace level to compare the work organization of fitness instructors in the two countries. The conclusion explores the evidence for distinct employment logics and the potential for better forms of work organization in both countries.</p>

<title>Why do institutions matter for work organization?</title>
<p>From the early 1980s, commentators have sought to explore the impact of national societal and institutional factors on work organization. The ‘societal effects approach’, associated with the LEST-group in France, argued that there was an ‘institutional logic that is particular to a society’ which brings about ‘nationally different shapes of organization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0950017012460325">Maurice et al., 1980</xref>: 59). They showed how the same manufacturing products could be produced with contrasting country-based occupational hierarchy, division of labour and work organization. The central factors explaining these differences were considered to be long-standing national systems of education and training and industrial relations, which were closely linked to the status and power of actors in the wider society.</p>
<p>More recently, the ‘varieties of capitalism’ literature, particularly the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0950017012460325">Hall and Soskice (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0950017012460325">Estevez-Abe et al. (2001)</xref>, has emphasized the role played by ‘complementary’ institutional structures in shaping firms’ competitive strategies. CMEs offer institutional configurations that are said to offer advantages to firms pursuing high value-added product market strategies, which rely upon a ‘high skilled labour force given substantial work autonomy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0950017012460325">Hall and Soskice, 2001</xref>: 24). Strong links between the training and industrial relations systems provide employment security and discourage the ‘poaching’ of skilled workers, while cooperative inter-firm networks and long-term bank finance support technology transfer and encourage firms to compete through ‘incremental innovation’. In contrast, liberal market economies, with their short-term financial markets and limited labour market regulation, offer advantages to firms pursuing either radical innovative or cost-based approaches. In the latter case, most workers need only low-level skills to deliver mass market products. In these accounts, there is little focus on work organization per se, beyond the assumption that higher value-added product market strategies require worker commitment and expanded levels of autonomy to sustain ‘continuous improvement in production processes and product lines’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0950017012460325">Hall and Soskice, 2001</xref>: 24).</p>
<p>Other writers have emphasized the political and class-based struggles, in particular the part played by powerful labour movements, in creating and sustaining the institutional foundations of German and Nordic forms of capitalism (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0950017012460325">Hollingsworth and Streeck, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0950017012460325">Streeck and Thelen, 2005</xref>). Work organization is shaped by factors that may operate in the absence of a high value-added strategy, such as the supply of high-skilled workers, the inability to rapidly hire and fire, legally backed mechanisms for collective worker voice and the existence of more ‘trust’-based relations.</p>
<p>The literature in this area points to a number of potential mechanisms through which institutions shape work organization. National institutional configurations, such as long-term finance, a strong VET system and higher wages, can push firms to pursue strategies based on higher-quality products and services. These complex offerings are more likely to require higher-skilled workers, while short differentiated production runs encourage the use of a less detailed division of labour and higher levels of discretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0950017012460325">Hall and Soskice, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0950017012460325">Streeck, 1992</xref>). Strong trade unions and/or works councils can help to limit the monitoring of workers as well as encourage forms of job design that require broader skills. These effects have been found to operate even where other institutional supports are lacking and firms adopt more cost-based strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0950017012460325">Doellgast, 2010</xref>). Worker representatives are likely to be assisted in these activities by the existence of national legal rights that support organizational capacity and co-determination.</p>
<p>Legislation on employment security could be another mechanism affecting work organization. Strong constraints on the ability to ‘hire and fire’ may encourage employers to train more and removes the option of deskilling through redundancy and relocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0950017012460325">Lloyd, 1999</xref>). Welfare systems which provide a high ‘reservation wage’ require employers to pay more for labour. This may encourage them to use workers’ skills more productively and to consider issues of job quality as part of their recruitment strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0950017012460325">Gautié and Schmitt, 2010</xref>). The design of work can also be influenced by the supply of particular forms of skilled labour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0950017012460325">Regini, 1995</xref>). The German ‘dual apprenticeship’ system is said to develop a strong sense of ‘practical professionality’ among workers and managers who have followed the same vocational path (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0950017012460325">Maurice et al., 1980</xref>: 81). This shared identity, coupled with the quality of skills that workers possess, influences relationships at work; not only are there fewer managers but relationships are also less hierarchical with workers enjoying higher levels of discretion and autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0950017012460325">Streeck, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>These key institutional and regulatory mechanisms are often seen to be mutually reinforcing, although their impact on work organization is rarely developed in any detail. While some critics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0950017012460325">Berribi-Hoffman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0950017012460325">Crouch et al., 2009</xref>) focus on the un-evenness of these institutions or their hollowing out in the face of international competitive pressures, other commentators insist on the existence of some form of national employment effect or ‘logic’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0950017012460325">Gallie (2003)</xref> argues that while institutions are important, there ‘may be significant societal effects’ taking place in the Scandinavia countries, where ‘cultural values and policies’ orientate the interests of government and the social partners towards improving the quality of working life. Higher levels of autonomy and influence are put down to a strong trade union movement which is able to ensure that gains are more evenly distributed across sectors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0950017012460325">Hollingsworth and Streeck (1994</xref>: 272–3) identify ways in which the national context ‘makes itself felt’ and is able to ‘modify the impact of sectoral contingencies’. In relation to work organization, this context can include national laws on job security which affect all workers regardless of sector, the national system of education and training and the dominant role played by the social partners within society, which may engender a level of trust and socially imposed obligations on all actors (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0950017012460325">Gustavsen, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>This type of analysis suggests that national effects on work organization are not just transmitted through dominant institutions but may also permeate the thinking of employers and managers as well as the expectations of workers, regardless of sector specifics. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0950017012460325">Dobbin and Boychuk (1999</xref>: 282) go further, arguing that the national employment logic has become entrenched through systems of management, training, bargaining and welfare that affect ‘how actors conceive of problems and solutions’. The results are a ‘rule-oriented’ approach in North America which is considered to be ‘natural’ and ‘to be self-evidently the optimal way of organizing work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0950017012460325">1999</xref>: 262). By contrast, the Nordic countries are oriented to ‘skill-governed’ work, with management systems that are dependent on worker discretion across a ‘wide range of jobs’.</p>
<p>The existence of national employment logics and their potential impact on work organization has rarely been explored. Much of the research that links institutions and job design has been drawn from a number of manufacturing sectors, typically in Germany, with well established and strong institutional structures. Examining workplaces that operate in sectors which lack these structures, such as the fitness industry, allows us to test if and how a national employment logic can permeate through to the workplace and impact on work organization.</p>

<title>Research methodology</title>
<p>To chart the main industry dynamics and the experience of work as a fitness instructor, research was conducted at the sectoral level and at individual workplaces in Norway and the UK. At the sectoral level in the UK, interviews were undertaken with representatives of the sector skills council and the qualification regulator, and with two providers of fitness training. These interviews have been supplemented by a variety of industry documents that include surveys of instructors, reports from the sector skills council and industry analysis. In Norway, interviews were conducted with representatives of a major employers’ association, the two main providers of fitness training in Norway and an industry expert.</p>
<p>In order to examine the actual work practices and management of instructors, case studies were undertaken of individual gyms (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0950017012460325">Table 1</xref>). Day visits were made to four gyms in the UK, two from private sector chains (UKgym1, UKgym2) and two in the public sector (UK-LA1, UK-LA2). In Norway, research was conducted in three gyms: one of the large chains (Ngym1), two sites from a smaller chain (Ngym2) and a not-for-profit gym (Ngym3). In each gym, semi-structured interviews were conducted with the gym manager, fitness instructors and, where they existed, gym supervisor and personal trainers. The fieldwork took place between February 2009 and January 2010. In total, 48 people were interviewed, including 22 instructors and personal trainers.</p>

<p>The next section of the article presents a background to the fitness sector in the two countries through an analysis of the major similarities and differences in the structure and competitiveness of the industry. It then explores the nature of sectoral organizations – particularly in relation to collective organization of employers and unions – and relevant institutions of VET.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0950017012460325">
<title>The UK and Norwegian fitness industries</title>
<p>The fitness industries in the UK and Norway share four main features in common. First, there is limited international competition. Gyms are located close to their clientele and companies have found it relatively difficult to expand successfully beyond their home country or close neighbours. Second, both countries have a similar level of membership (around 12% of the population), although the UK industry expanded rapidly in the 1980s, whereas in Norway it did not take off until the 1990s. Over the last 10 years, the industry in both countries has experienced a major slow down, accompanied by a process of mergers and acquisitions. Pressure on membership prices has intensified: in the UK as new low-cost gyms have entered the market; and in Norway due to the high level of competition with other sporting activity run primarily on a volunteer basis. Recent UK industry reports indicate that since the financial crisis of 2008, few new sites have opened, with organizations increasingly focused on maximizing revenue from existing clubs and members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0950017012460325">Mintel, 2009</xref>). In Norway private-sector growth is sluggish, resulting in ‘aggressive competition and excess capacity in the sector’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0950017012460325">SATS, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, gyms need to provide an environment in which customers do not harm themselves through undertaking inappropriate activity. There has, therefore, been a recognition that employees need to have some competence when providing advice and guidance to gym users. The final similarity is that workplaces are fairly small and opening hours are often unsocial and long. In both countries, there are low levels of union membership, patchy collective bargaining coverage and low pay for instructors, who tend to be young, with a fairly even split between men and women.</p>
<p>The contrasts between the two countries are much more limited and relate predominantly to differences in industry structure. The UK fitness industry is estimated to comprise 5795 gyms and 7.3 million members; it employs 26,000 instructors with a turnover of around £3.8b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0950017012460325">IHRSA, 2010</xref>). The main providers are large private fitness industry chains (eight companies have over 50 gyms), such as Fitness First and David Lloyds. They operate alongside substantial local authority provision (around 40% of members) in leisure centres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0950017012460325">SkillsActive, 2009</xref>). Norway, with a population of less than one-tenth of the UK, has around 475 for-profit clubs with about 560,000 members and a turnover of £320m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0950017012460325">IHRSA, 2010</xref>). Unlike in the UK, however, there is no public-sector provision of gym facilities; instead local sporting activities have tended to be provided by voluntary organizations funded through the state. While there remain some volunteer-run gyms, they represent only around 10 per cent of total gym membership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0950017012460325">Steen-Johnsen and Kirkegaard, 2010</xref>). The sector is dominated by two large private fitness chains (SATS and Elixia). A further difference is that the UK fitness industry is more closely aligned with the ‘public health agenda’ around obesity and sedentary life styles, largely due to the role of the public sector. In Norway, gyms focus predominantly on those who are already active.</p>
<p>What kind of institutions have developed in the two countries to support the sector? Employers in this sector in the UK are relatively well organized and have played a key role in developing occupational standards and minimum qualification levels. The employers’ organization, the Fitness Industry Association (FIA), and leading training providers introduced a voluntary Register of Exercise Professionals (REPs) in 2002, with the aim of raising the status of fitness instructors and overcoming the confusing morass of qualifications which is typical of the UK VET system. This rather unusual response arose out of rising press complaints and public concerns about negligence related to poorly trained staff and was also encouraged by the public policy agenda around health, which had led to the introduction of an ‘exercise referral scheme’ in 2001 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0950017012460325">Lloyd, 2005</xref>). Under this scheme, medical practitioners could refer patients to gyms for guided physical activity, but needed to be reassured that instructors would be competent to deal with ‘higher-risk’ groups.</p>
<p>The minimum qualification standards for a fitness instructor were set at level 2 (equivalent to five GCSEs<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0950017012460325">1</xref></sup> graded A*–C), with higher levels for personal trainers and those undertaking exercise referrals. REPs has been relatively successful in terms of attracting members, with around 28,000 instructors and personnel trainers registered. However, concerns have been raised that entry standards are not high enough and that many instructors are undertaking tasks for which they are insufficiently qualified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0950017012460325">SkillsActive/REPS/FIA, 2008</xref>: 10). Nevertheless, there is a substantial oversupply of individuals with qualifications in this field, as many colleges and universities have expanded their provision in sports and fitness, while private providers offer numerous short courses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0950017012460325">Lloyd, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In terms of its broader role, the FIA acts as a lobby group for the industry although, as is typical of the UK, there is no sectoral collective bargaining. Union membership is rare among instructors, although in the public sector pay is determined through collective bargaining. While pay is low across the industry, it tends to be higher in local authority gyms compared with private providers – the latter often paying close to the national minimum wage (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0950017012460325">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Norway has a well developed vocational training system, centred on apprenticeships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0950017012460325">Payne, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0950017012460325">Skule et al., 2002</xref>), yet there is no apprenticeship for the fitness sector. There are also no regulations governing the qualification requirements of those working in the fitness industry. Over recent years, two bodies – one a university and the other a private training organization – have developed short qualifications (60 to 150 contact hours) for the sector. These are generally supported by the two main fitness chains but they are not mandatory nor can they be described as required norms. Alongside individuals with these qualifications, many of those working as instructors are students undertaking academic studies in sports science, medicine or physiotherapy. The job is primarily seen as a short-term position filled by students or young people who do not tend to regard it as a future career.</p>
<p>While Norway is frequently referred to as a ‘coordinated market economy’, with relatively strong employer and union organization, these core features of the national model are not present in the fitness industry. The development of an employers’ body has been considerably slower than in the UK. Only very recently did the two ‘big players’, SATS and Elixia, join together with the existing association (of which neither was a member) to form <italic>Treningsforbunde</italic>, partly to act as an industry lobby but also to raise professional standards. In 2011, it joined HSH, one of the largest employers’ associations in Norway. Trade union density is also low, although some of the gyms have workplace collective agreements. In Norway, there is no national minimum wage. Sectoral minimums in other industries ranged from 100NK to 159NK in 2010, indicating that instructors’ pay was situated towards the lower end of the labour market.</p>
<p>In Norway, the sector lacks the organization of the social partners and the institutions of VET that are typical of the national system. The industry in the UK is also somewhat unusual in that it has attempted to self-regulate in response to sectoral demands and a central role is played by the public sector. Given these particular sectoral institutions in each country, the next section explores whether there is any evidence of a national employment effect on work organization. The article first explores the relative complexity of job tasks and then examines mechanisms used to manage fitness instructors.</p>

<title>Work organization</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0950017012460325">Table 1</xref> provides some key features from the case study organizations, including size, pay levels and coverage by collective bargaining. Despite pay being considered low across all organizations, there were few recruitment difficulties. Union collective agreements were found only in the two UK public gyms and in the Norwegian not-for-profit gym. In these three cases, pay and conditions were better than their non-union counterparts. In terms of the qualifications required of new recruits, the four UK gyms followed the REPs and looked for either level 2 or 3. In Norway, instructors could have anything from a year of subject-relevant university education to a three-day in-company training course.</p>
<p>The job of a fitness instructor encompasses a range of activities, which may include inducting new customers into the gym, demonstrating the use of equipment, supervising gym users, offering help and advice, writing exercise programmes, taking group exercise classes (quite limited in these gyms), administrative work and cleaning the equipment and facilities. However, the role can vary significantly in terms of the particular combination, spread and depth of the activities involved. The research indicated that in both countries there was a trend towards two different roles for instructors.</p>
<p>One group of gyms (the two local authorities in the UK and two gyms in Norway) provided a role for instructors that was relatively broad and required the deployment of a range of skills and knowledge. In all cases, fitness instructors would induct new members into the gym, offer general help and advice to users and write individual exercise programmes. For example, at UK-LA2, fitness instructors were expected to carry out ongoing reviews taking into account changes in the customer’s life and adapting programmes accordingly (e.g. pregnancy, injury or any other health issues). Instructors at the other gyms also identified a broad role which required substantive technical skills and knowledge.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Inductions, personal programmes … if anybody needs help with anything, there is always people asking for different exercises to do or if they are doing something wrong, you have to put their technique right and stuff … (Jamie, instructor, UK-LA1)</p>
<p>We interview them [the customers] about their motivations, any possible goals … to try and devise a programme that will be a motivation for that specific individual. (Artur, instructor, Ngym3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Both local authorities in the UK ran an exercise referral scheme and had developed specialists to deal with this group of customers. At UK-LA2 one person in the gym spent all her time on referrals (although she was not on a higher pay grade), while at UK-LA1, the local council had a dedicated team who worked across a number of gyms. While this scheme pointed to much more complex job requirements, the numbers of those employed in this role remained relatively small.</p>
<p>The other approach, identified in two large private gyms in the UK and Norway, was a much more limited role with relatively narrow tasks and little deployment of the instructors’ knowledge. At UKgym2, the role of the two fitness instructors was limited to undertaking inductions, demonstrating the use of equipment and providing very basic exercise programmes. The resulting job was more about offering a generalized service to customers – ensuring that they were happy in the gym, answering any basic questions or queries, encouraging personal training, as well as telephone calls to ‘inactive’ members and keeping the gym clean and tidy. The gym manager claimed ‘they are basically just hosts pretty much’ in a ‘simple job’ that was ‘not very challenging’ and which was mainly a ‘stepping stone’ to becoming a personal trainer.</p>
<p>A similar role was found at Ngym1 in Norway, where fitness instructors were given the title of ‘motivators’. Their role was to provide basic advice and guidance to customers or, as the gym manager put it, ‘make people feel welcome’. Motivators were required to constantly ‘walk the floor’ and interact with as many customers as possible. The gym manager described the role as ‘very demanding and draining’ on those doing the job, as ‘you have to be very flexible and able to interact with all types of people from all walks of life’. Because of the high energy levels demanded in the role, only part-timers working a maximum four-hour shift were employed. Again, the understanding was that motivators would not give detailed advice or write tailored programmes for users.</p>
<p>The choice between these two models of work organization appears to reflect business strategy with no evidence of a national employment logic or union engagement at any level with issues of job design. In three of the private sector gyms (UKgym1, UKgym2 and Ngym1), pressures on revenues had led to a drive to expand personal training.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I have targets and a budget to hit each month with the personal trainers and so I have to have a certain amount of personal trainers here paying £85 a week to hit my target. (Fitness manager, UKgym2)</p>
<p>[the club] needs to do so many hours a year [personal training] … it was say whatever 6000 and then in this year now we have to do 8000 … of course they want more … we’ve got targets to meet and we try as a team to meet those targets. (Personal trainer, Ngym1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Differentiating the role of ‘fitness instructor’ from that of ‘personal trainer’ was not straightforward, as both could involve some element of individual instruction. Typically, customers would pay a premium to buy the services of a personal trainer who would provide in-depth, one-to-one instruction for the duration of the session. A fitness instructor would offer help and advice to gym users as part of their membership fee and they might write individual exercise programmes and undertake one-to-one training sessions. In addition, fitness instructors were employees, while in the UK personal trainers were typically self-employed and in the Norway gym in the study they were employees paid on a ‘sales-only’ basis.</p>
<p>There was evidence to suggest that the more a club moved towards personal training, the more this tended to limit or ‘strip out’ an instruction/teaching element from within the fitness instructor role. In two of these three gyms, the instructors’ role had been considerably narrowed, partly as a way to encourage the use of personal trainers. As a gym instructor and manager explained:
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s kind of a line … I am allowed to do it [write exercise programmes], but it is a kind of grey area … you don’t want to be going into personal trainer territory … because then why should they pay a personal trainer? (Dan, instructor, UKgym2)</p>
<p>The motivators are not supposed to be out there to give people instruction they are supposed to be out there for people who have got questions, so they are normally brief questions. (Fitness manager, Ngym1)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In the third gym (UKgym1), the role was a temporary position (six months to a year) used as a basis from which to become a ‘self-employed’ personal trainer.</p>
<p>At the other four clubs (UK-LA1, UK-LA2, Ngym2 and Ngym3), personal training was either not permitted or was extremely limited. The view was that the instructors should be providing a broad service for all customers, reflecting the public sector ethos in the two UK gyms and the responsibility of the not-for-profit Norwegian gym to serve the needs of its target population. The other gym in Norway pursued an approach that integrated personal training with the instructors’ role, thereby offering an alternative package to the two main chains.</p>
<p>The research highlights a clear trend in the way the job of the fitness instructor was being (re)designed, cutting across both countries. In parts of the private sector, the role was being narrowed as companies looked to increase revenues by expanding the use of personal trainers. The expansion of personal training also allowed the ‘delegation of uncertainty’ to employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0950017012460325">Lehndorff and Voss-Dahm, 2005</xref>) who had to make the role pay both for themselves and the organization by selling training to clients. In the public/not-for-profit sector in particular, where the move into personal training had been resisted, a broader role for fitness instructors had been maintained.</p>

<sec id="section6-0950017012460325">
<title>Monitoring and control</title>
<p>If the actual job tasks varied little between countries, what about the way in which instructors were managed? To a certain extent, there were a number of similarities across the two countries. The direct managerial supervision of instructors was somewhat problematic due to the nature of the job and the hours worked. Most instructors worked on a one-to-one basis with clients when they could not be easily monitored; and the clubs were open from early in the morning to late at night meaning that instructors often worked shifts that might not match those of their managers. Across the two countries, there were some standardized forms in relation to inductions and exercise programmes, but the detail was left to the discretion of the staff. There was a general recognition that instructors would have their own approaches, depending on individual experience, education and outlook.</p>
<p>In the UK, there was limited direct control over instructors through supervision or the specification of methods of instruction. At two of the gyms (UKgym2 and UK-LA2), managers laid out the daily structure of the job for individual instructors, with times for appointments, cleaning and floor walking. The supervisor or manager, however, was not necessarily present to ensure that these timetables were followed.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I have structured their day … I will check on it to make sure that little things, different things are done but it is left a lot to the instructor to make sure that they keep their day active. (Fitness manager, UKgym2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At the other two UK gyms, instructors had more discretion to organize their day. Fitness instructors at UKgym1 spoke of being ‘very much encouraged to go off and do our own thing’, with minimum levels of supervision. As the fitness manager reported:
<disp-quote>
<p>the way the club works is that you get on with it, you don’t wait for someone to say jump and then you jump.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>At UK-LA1, the functional manager was off-site leaving instructors to organize their own work around booked-in customers and cleaning activities.</p>
<p>At two of the gyms in Norway (Ngym1 and Ngym2) tasks were more clearly specified with managers often present to oversee their activities.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>They’ve got instructions and set patterns that they have to follow. They make sure that they are within all the departments at least once every 15 minutes. (Fitness manager, Ngym1)</p>
<p>The first thing they have to do in the morning is look in the book – then maybe from eleven to twelve you go to meet with a new person and make a programme for them, then two to three o’clock you are going to meet a person who has been training here … If it’s quiet then yes I would say you should do this, or this. (Gym manager, Ngym2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At the third gym, which was run on a not-for-profit basis (Ngym3), the instructors had more autonomy. They worked part-time, primarily when the gym manager was not on shift. Their scheduled work included booked-in one-to-one sessions with customers, replacing the receptionist when he/she was on a break and periodically recording the number of users in the gym. Outside these duties, they were free to manage their own time around a range of tasks, which included individual responsibility for cleaning and small maintenance jobs.</p>
<p>Country-based patterns were, however, apparent in the mechanisms used to monitor fitness instructors. In three of the UK gyms (UKgym2, UK-LA1 and UK-LA2), there had been a move to manage more closely the interactive parts of the job through the application of new technology. These gyms had invested in new computerized software systems that promised to solve the issue of high membership turnover. Using ‘cards’ or ‘keys’, the systems tracked customers’ use of the gym. The data enabled ‘low use’ members (those considered most at risk of leaving) to be identified on a computer as soon as they entered the gym and allowed instructors to share customer information. A manager at UK-LA2 explained the rationale behind the systems:
<disp-quote>
<p>The idea is the more people are interacted with, the more they feel part of our facility here and part of the social network and that people care about them and whether or not they come in, means they tend to come more often, the more they come, the longer they stay members.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>These systems were also able to monitor the instructors as each individual interaction with a member could be logged onto the computer. At all three clubs, management set targets for instructors, from 85 per cent to 100 per cent contact with those deemed ‘at risk’. Instructors were required to record any interaction on the computer, which also enabled management to check up on how they were using their time.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>This is the perception, instructors are sitting down doing nothing, reading a book right, whereas now this is a more qualitative and quantitative position to actually drill down and see what they are actually doing. (Multi-site manager, UK-LA1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This manager added that ‘purely from a management side of it, what we are getting out of them, [is] definitely more work’.</p>
<p>Instructors were generally positive about the potential for such systems to help track the progress that customers were making but regarded the targets and logging systems as problematic. In some cases, instructors felt that the requirement to detail interactions was based upon a management assumption that they were not to be trusted to proactively engage customers.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>What it’s trying to do is get us to liaise with customers more, but all it’s doing is keeping us on here [the computer] more. It’s kind of a bit of a cheek really just to assume that we are not liaising with customers. (Jamie, instructor, UK-LA1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>An instructor at UKgym2 argued that it tended to turn what should be a natural and spontaneous process into something quite ‘artificial’.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The problem is that it was OK at first and then they got league tables and they want you to be at 100 per cent all the time which isn’t really realistic … it is like you have got to kind of search people out … and just talking to them for the sake of so you can log it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Others complained about the logistical problem of having only one computer and the time involved in recording information, which could be better spent with customers.</p>
<p>At UKgym1, where these systems had not been introduced, instructors were given a target of speaking to five members a day, although there was no requirement to record these interactions. As instructors were being moved into personal training roles, it was felt that they were sufficiently motivated to interact with members as this offered a way for them to acquire clients.</p>
<p>In contrast to the UK, none of the Norwegian gyms had invested in computerized customer retention tools. Other forms of monitoring and control were in use but varied considerably across the different organizations. At Ngym1, where the job of the instructor was highly constrained, monitoring was at its most intense with the use of weekly ‘mystery trainer’ visits. These ‘pretend’ customers were used to score the performance and effectiveness of ‘motivators’, with poor results potentially leading to dismissal.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think especially through the mystery trainer is an example of how you are monitored and observed quite often, I was surprised at how many times I’d actually been evaluated … almost more than half my shifts I was getting reports. (Anders, instructor, Ngym1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At Ngym2, instructors explained that they were required to record how many clients they had helped in the course of the day but were not set any specific targets. At the third gym (Ngym3), there was little direct monitoring of staff. The gym manager explained that if, for example, he heard that an instructor was spending too much time on reception, he would simply have a talk with them. ‘I won’t accuse them of anything because I have to trust them you know and I do.’</p>
<p>A notable difference between the two countries was that in the UK there was more of an attempt to directly manage the instructor’s interaction with the customer through the use of technology and target setting. However, the use of ‘mystery trainers’ at one site cautioned against the view that Norwegian gyms necessarily offer a higher-trust working environment in line with the prevailing national employment model.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Comparative research on the impact of national systems on work organization has tended to focus upon a range of key interlocking institutions at sectoral and workplace level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0950017012460325">Holman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0950017012460325">Streeck, 1992</xref>). The Nordic countries, with their strong trade unions and well developed systems of social partnership around collective bargaining and VET, are said to be particularly advanced when it comes to developing more autonomous job roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0950017012460325">Gallie, 2007</xref>). In the case of the Norwegian fitness industry, however, these key institutions are absent. Yet some commentators point to the existence of national employment ‘logics’ which may have a more far-reaching influence on work organization. This article sought to test this proposition using the fitness industry as an exploratory case. The research found little evidence of any clear distinction between the work of a fitness instructor in Norway and in the UK, suggesting that if there is such a ‘logic’ it has been overwhelmed by specific industry dynamics.</p>
<p>This finding does not mean that there are no country-based differences. The recent introduction of individual targets for instructors in the UK linked to computer-based technologies is typical of the ‘rule-based’ management systems described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0950017012460325">Dobbin and Boychuk (1999)</xref>. These systems had not found favour in the Norwegian gyms as a way of managing either the customer or the employee. Regulations governing employment contracts also ensure that Norwegian personal trainers have employee status, whereas in the UK they are self-employed. If organizations in the UK continue to shift further towards a personal-trainer model, there may be longer-term implications for the numbers and deployment of fitness instructors.</p>
<p>Similarly, the role played by local authorities in providing gym facilities in the UK marks a significant contrast with Norway, where public sector provision is largely absent. The UK public sector has a broader social ethos to improve the health of the population and the exercise referral scheme has helped to pave the way for a more expansive instructor role, although the numbers involved are admittedly small. Nevertheless, the state-led public health agenda has clearly had an impact on job design, suggesting that future research on work organization needs to broaden its focus to take account of factors that lie outside the current analytical gaze (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0950017012460325">Grimshaw and Lehndorff, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Emerging literature in the field increasingly focuses on the tensions within national models, in particular between the competitive requirements of specific industries and the prevailing institutional environment (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0950017012460325">Berribi-Hoffman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0950017012460325">Crouch et al., 2009</xref>). These tensions are apparent in the fitness industry in both countries as many organizations attempt to stress quality and ‘professionalism’, while lacking the institutional supports that are required to deliver this type of service. The UK industry has responded with self-regulation of qualification standards. However, the reliance on the <italic>voluntary</italic> commitment of individual employers and the use of standards based around the ‘lowest common denominator’ have failed to ‘professionalize’ the workforce. In Norway, it is difficult to establish professional status unless instructors are qualified and rewarded as such. These tensions over issues of quality, while important, are currently not impinging upon organizational success sufficiently to bring forth an industry solution.</p>
<p>If there is to be a challenge to the status quo, therefore, it will probably have to come from instructors themselves, either as a result of future labour market shortages or from union organization. Given the legal backing available to unions in Norway, the recent collectivization of employers might be seen to offer better prospects for union organization across the sector, compared with the UK. However, the way the job is constructed in Norway severely constrains the potential for mobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0950017012460325">Kelly, 1998</xref>). Because there are so few low-paid jobs in Norway, the low wages of fitness instructors has a greater impact on the supply of labour than it does in the UK where low pay is more widespread. In Norway, a job as an instructor is viewed as a transitory position, suitable for students and young people before they move on to their ‘real’ career. As a result, they tend to have an ambivalent attitude to unions, which limits the potential for organization. In the UK, many of those entering as instructors have trained specifically for this job and see it as part of a longer-term career within the industry. Nevertheless, high turnover, small workplaces and the weak legal backing for unions in collective bargaining makes organization difficult, particularly in the private sector.</p>
<p>Although this research found little evidence of a national employment logic impacting on the work organization of Norwegian fitness instructors, these findings cannot be generalized to other sectors or countries. There are signs that in Germany some unions in emerging parts of the service sector have been effective primarily at workplace level through drawing on national rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0950017012460325">Doellgast, 2010</xref>). However, our research indicates that the absence of sectoral institutions can make it extremely difficult for isolated workplace unions to challenge the managerially determined patterns of work organization that have emerged.</p>
<p>This study confirms that although power is central to how work is organized, its distribution and effects need to be explored at national, sectoral and workplace level. Having relatively strong unions, more trust-based relations and supportive institutional arrangements at the aggregate level does not mean that their influence and effects are distributed evenly across a country. Indeed, this research serves as a reminder that even in countries like Norway, there may be many jobs which lie outside the dominant institutional structures and resemble quite closely their equivalents in neo-liberal economies. Future progress, both in Norway and the UK, will undoubtedly depend on the resourcefulness of unions and their ability to broaden their appeal and organize workers across a broader range of sectors.</p>
