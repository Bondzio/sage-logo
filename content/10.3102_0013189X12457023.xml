<abstract>
<p>Students who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) experience higher rates of victimization by bullying than do their heterosexual-identified peers. In this article, we investigate the extent to which this difference in rates of victimization can explain LGBTQ youths’ greater rates of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and unexcused absences from school. Our sample consisted of 11,337 students in Grades 7 through 12 from 30 schools in Dane County, Wisconsin. Using both multilevel covariate-adjusted models and propensity-score-matching models, we found that although victimization does explain a portion of the LGBTQ–heterosexual risk disparities, substantial differences persist <italic>even when the differences in victimization are taken into account</italic>. For example, LGBTQ-identified students were 3.3 times as likely to think about suicide (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001), 3.0 times as likely to attempt suicide (<italic>p</italic> = .007), and 1.4 times as likely to skip school (<italic>p</italic> = .047) as propensity-score-matched heterosexual-identified students within the same school who reported equivalent levels of peer victimization. Moreover, in our propensity-score-matched samples, we found substantial differences in suicidal ideation and suicide attempts at both higher and lower levels of victimization. This consistent pattern of findings suggests that policies aimed simply at reducing bullying may not be effective in bringing LGBTQ youth to the level of their heterosexual peers in terms of psychological and educational outcomes. Additional policies may be needed to promote safe, supportive school environments.</p>

<p>Students who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) report higher rates of victimization by bullying than do their heterosexual-identified peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013189X12457023">Espelage, Aragon, Birkett, &amp; Koenig, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013189X12457023">Kosciw, Greytak, &amp; Diaz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013189X12457023">Robinson &amp; Espelage, 2011</xref>). LGBTQ-identified students are also at greater risk for suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and unexcused absences from school when compared to their heterosexual-identified peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013189X12457023">Robinson &amp; Espelage, 2011</xref>). Thus, a reasonable question is, Does the higher rate of victimization by bullying explain the elevated risk levels of LGBTQ-identified youth? Numerous studies have found that accounting for peer victimization attenuates suicide-related disparities (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013189X12457023">Garofalo, Wolf, Wissow, Woods, &amp; Goodman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013189X12457023">Russell &amp; Joyner, 2001</xref>), and a prominent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013189X12457023">Bontempo and D’Augelli (2002)</xref> went so far as to conclude that heterosexual- and LGBTQ-identified youth who experience low levels of victimization have similar outcomes relating to suicide and unexcused absences, and thus that it is victimization that gives rise to disparities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0013189X12457023">1</xref></sup> In addition, school policies have also tended to focus on bullying prevention—usually, through generic anti-bullying policies that do not make explicit mention of sexual orientation or gender expression—rather than on other aspects of school environment. For example, in a 2009 national sample of LGBTQ-identified adolescents, more than twice as many students reported that their school had a generic anti-bullying policy (39%) than those reporting their school had an anti-bullying policy that explicitly included sexual orientation or gender expression (18%). Fewer than half of surveyed students attended schools with gay-straight alliances (GSAs) and only 13% were taught about LGBT individuals in their classes (mostly in history/social studies; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013189X12457023">Kosciw, Greytak, Diaz, &amp; Bartkiewicz, 2010</xref>). Recent high-profile examples of allowing generic anti-bullying policies but disallowing other factors associated with supportive environments for sexual minorities include the Anoka-Hennepin School District, which implemented a policy aimed at reducing bullying in general but that explicitly prohibited both positive and negative discussions regarding sexual identity (a so-called neutrality policy; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013189X12457023">Eckholm, 2011</xref>); and “Don’t Say Gay” bills introduced in the Tennessee (SB 49, 2012; HB 229, 2012) and Missouri (HB 2051, 2012) legislatures that would prohibit mention of sexual orientation in certain classes and that, in Missouri, would also prohibit GSAs. Under such policies, the primary (and perhaps only) permissible school policy that could reduce LGBTQ–heterosexual disparities would be a generic anti-bullying policy.</p>
<p>Given the importance placed on victimization by bullying in the literature and in current school policies, in this article we seek to provide a rigorous estimate of the extent to which peer victimization disparities explain educational and psychological disparities between LGBTQ-identified and heterosexual, non-transgender-identified (hereafter, heterosexual-identified) students. Such an estimate is needed for several reasons. First, in contrast to the research and policies mentioned above, other researchers have argued that preventing bullying may be only <italic>one</italic> component of a supportive school environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013189X12457023">Friedman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013189X12457023">Kosciw et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013189X12457023">Murray, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0013189X12457023">Russell, Kosciw, Horn, &amp; Saewyc, 2010</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013189X12457023">Garofalo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013189X12457023">Russell &amp; Joyner, 2001</xref>). Second, prior quantitative work on this topic suffers from methodological limitations. For example, these studies did not account for a number of demographic variables that differ between LGBTQ- and heterosexual-identified youth, or used only a very basic set of such variables (e.g., gender, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013189X12457023">Bontempo &amp; D’Augelli, 2002</xref>; gender and race/ethnicity, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013189X12457023">Garofalo, Wolf, Kessel, Palfrey, &amp; DuRant, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013189X12457023">Hatzenbuehler, 2011</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0013189X12457023">2</xref></sup> Because LGBTQ-identified youth tend to have demographically risky profiles (e.g., sexual minority youth report coming from lower socioeconomic status families; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013189X12457023">Remafedi, French, Story, Resnick, &amp; Blum, 1998</xref>), studies that do not address such differences are prone to overestimate the link between peer victimization and LGBTQ risk. Similarly, youth who ostensibly identify as LGBTQ on questionnaires disproportionately supply unusual responses to survey items that are in principle unrelated to LGBTQ identification, raising concerns that such students are willfully providing untruthful responses. Failure to exclude these potentially mischievous responders may artificially inflate the apparent LGBTQ–heterosexual risk disparities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013189X12457023">Robinson &amp; Espelage, 2011</xref>). Lastly, although researchers are starting to recognize the heterogeneity within the broad LGBTQ population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013189X12457023">Horn, Kosciw, &amp; Russell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013189X12457023">Robinson &amp; Espelage, 2011</xref>), few studies had large enough sample sizes to explore subgroup-level variation in risks (e.g., bisexual–heterosexual disparities).</p>
<p>The analytic strategy adopted in this article was designed to address these problems. We did so, first, by excluding potentially mischievous responders based on a method developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013189X12457023">Robinson and Espelage (2011)</xref>. Second, we sequentially condition on demographic factors (e.g., age, race, gender, socioeconomic status) and frequency of peer victimization in order to examine how the LGBTQ–heterosexual disparity estimates change with additional covariates. To better account for demographic and victimization variation, we also use propensity score matching to match LGBTQ- and heterosexual-identified students and test for evidence of risk disparities once demographic and victimization differences are eliminated. This process yields two sets of propensity-score-matching-based estimates: one set of estimates at the typical LGBTQ profile (i.e., higher average victimization) and one set at the typical heterosexual profile (i.e., lower average victimization), thereby providing matching-based disparity estimates at two different levels of victimization. Finally, we also examine the variability across different LGBTQ subgroups. Specifically, we assess whether or not risk disparities between heterosexual-identified and LGBTQ-subgroup-identified (e.g., bisexual) youth can be explained by victimization because uncovering variation within the LGBTQ-identified population may help schools identify their most vulnerable sexual-minority populations.</p>
<p>By obtaining a rigorous quantitative estimate of how victimization explains LGBTQ–heterosexual risk disparities, the current study marks a step forward in our scientific understanding of LGBTQ students’ experiences and outcomes in educational settings. Moreover, our findings have implications for policymaking: If we find that peer victimization accounts for part of LGBTQ–heterosexual risk disparities but does not fully address the disparities, then that would suggest there are other factors related to being LGBTQ identified that put youth at risk (e.g., perceptions of being different or unwanted, family rejection); and thus, a more robust and active approach on the part of the schools may be warranted in order to reduce the disproportionate risks of LGBTQ youth.</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>The analytic data set contains anonymous survey responses<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0013189X12457023">3</xref></sup> (collected via SurveyMonkey in 2008–2009) from a total of 11,337 students (<italic>N</italic> = 3,031 middle school [Grades 7–8]; <italic>N</italic> = 8,306 high school [Grades 9–12]) in 30 schools in Dane County, Wisconsin. The survey included 117 items on a range of topics, including sexual identity, suicide, sexual behavior, drug usage, bullying and victimization (see the Supplemental Online Materials for details on specific variables). The Dane County Youth Assessment (DCYA) is a county-wide survey administered across schools in the county as a collaborative project among the schools and several community organizations (e.g., United Way, Department of Human Services). The county represents geographically diverse areas ranging from small working farms to a large city. Free or reduced-price lunch ranged from 16% to 58% across the schools. The survey assessed a wide range of physical and mental health indicators, as well as various attitudes and social behaviors. Students completed these anonymous surveys independently while in school during proctored sessions. A waiver of active consent was employed and child written assent was used. Surveys were given to all 7th- to 12th-grade students, and the response rate was very high, ranging from 90% to 95% across the 30 schools. For our analyses (and consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013189X12457023">Robinson &amp; Espelage, 2011</xref>),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0013189X12457023">4</xref></sup> students who provided extreme responses (or no responses) to height and weight questions were excluded, as were students who claimed they were both LGBTQ identified <italic>and</italic> heterosexual identified. Students with incomplete data on the covariates used for matching were also not retained. The final analytic sample consisted of 11,337 students for Model 1 (discussed below). Following the approach developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013189X12457023">Robinson and Espelage (2011)</xref>, we then screened out students who may have willfully provided untruthful responses to survey items of interest in this study. That is, we screened out any student who provided more than one unusual response to a set of eight items that are in principle unrelated to sexual orientation and gender identity (e.g., how many hours they sleep at night). This final exclusion criterion (i.e., multiple low-frequency responses) resulted in a sample of 11,033 students for Models 2–4.</p>

<p>In the demographic section of the survey, students were asked to identify their sexual orientation/gender identity as <italic>gay, lesbian, bisexual, questioning, transgender</italic>, or <italic>none of the above</italic>. Students could choose more than one category. As shown in Table S3, a total of 588 students (5.2% of the analytic sample for Model 1) selected at least one LGBTQ category.

<sec id="section5-0013189X12457023">
<title>Suicidal ideation</title>
<p>Students were asked if they thought seriously thought about killing themselves in the past month, with mutually exclusive response options: <italic>no; yes, but rarely; yes, some of the time;</italic> and <italic>yes, almost all of the time</italic>. For our analysis, we created a dichotomous variable indicating “no reported risk” (corresponding to responses of <italic>no</italic>) or “any reported risk” (corresponding to responses of <italic>yes, but rarely; yes, some of the time</italic>; and <italic>yes, almost all of the time</italic>).</p>

<title>Suicide attempts</title>
<p>This item asked students if they attempted suicide in the past year, with mutually exclusive response options: <italic>no; yes, 1 time</italic>; and <italic>yes, more than 1 time</italic>. For our analysis, we created a dichotomous variable indicating “no reported risk” (corresponding to responses of <italic>no</italic>) or “any reported risk” (corresponding to responses of <italic>yes, 1 time</italic>; and <italic>yes, more than 1 time</italic>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0013189X12457023">
<title>Unexcused absences</title>
<p>Students reported how many days in the past 4 weeks they skipped school (i.e., were absent without permission): <italic>none; 1–2 days; 3–5 days; 5–10 days</italic>; or <italic>10 or more days</italic>. For our analysis, we created a dichotomous variable indicating “no reported risk” (corresponding to responses of <italic>none</italic>) or “any reported risk” (corresponding to responses of <italic>1–2 days; 3–5 days; 5–10 days</italic>; and <italic>10 or more days</italic>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0013189X12457023">
<title>Peer victimization</title>
<p>Peer victimization was assessed using several items in the DCYA. One group of four items comes from the University of Illinois Victimization Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013189X12457023">Espelage &amp; Holt, 2001</xref>) and asked how many times the following happened to the student in the past 30 days: (a) “I got hit and pushed by other students,” (b) “Other students picked on me,” (c) “Other students made fun of me,” and (d) “Other students called me names.” Response options were <italic>never, 1 or 2 times, 3 or 4 times, 5 or 6 times</italic>, and <italic>7 or more times</italic>. The items had high consistency (α = .86) and were averaged into an index.</p>
<p>Peer victimization was also assessed through four items that asked how frequently students were the victims of (a) bullying via the Internet or texting (cyber-bullying), (b) bullying on the basis of perceived sexual orientation, (c) bullying on the basis of race or ethnicity, and (d) bullying on the basis of how they look. Each item had mutually exclusive response options: <italic>never, rarely, sometimes, often</italic>, and <italic>very often</italic>. Because these items conceivably measure different constructs (i.e., cyber-bullying is a form of bullying, whereas the others are perceived bases of victimization, each targeted at potentially different groups), these items were not averaged into a single composite but rather were included separately in the models.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0013189X12457023">
<title>Multilevel Models With Covariate Adjustment</title>
<p>All models discussed here are estimated as multilevel models using the xtlogit command in Stata 11, with random intercepts for schools and school-clustered jackknifed standard errors, to account for nesting of students within schools. An initial model (Model 1) estimates how many times as likely as heterosexual-identified students LGBTQ-identified students are to have a negative outcome (e.g., to seriously think about suicide), before accounting for differences in demographics and victimization. All subsequent models exclude any student identified by the screener items as a multiple low-frequency responder (i.e., potentially mischievous responder; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013189X12457023">Robinson &amp; Espelage, 2011</xref>). Model 2 is identical to Model 1, except that it excludes multiple-low-frequency responders; comparing Models 1 and 2 illustrates the influence of the multiple-low-frequency responders on the disparity estimates. Model 3 adds demographic predictors, such as gender, age, a middle school indicator, race, disability, height, weight, two socioeconomic predictors (free/reduced-price lunch and whether the family has transportation difficulties), and an indicator for whether the student provided any (vs. no) low-frequency response to the screener items. Model 4 builds on Model 3 by adding covariates related to peer victimization. Then, the process of estimating Models 1–4 is repeated to calculate the (conditional) disparity between heterosexual-identified students and each separate LGBTQ-identified subgroup (e.g., bisexual-identified students).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0013189X12457023">
<title>Multilevel Models Using Propensity-Score-Matched Samples</title>
<p>Although Models 3 and 4 reflect a common approach—that is, covariate adjustment—the estimated odds ratios of interest can be susceptible to bias if the unadjusted covariate differences between LGBTQ- and heterosexual-identified students are moderately large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013189X12457023">Rubin, 2001</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0013189X12457023">5</xref></sup> Moreover, Models 3 and 4 base their estimation in part on extrapolating relationships to regions of data where there exist only LGBTQ or heterosexual students, but not both groups. To circumvent these undesirable features of standard covariate adjustment, we next used propensity-score-matching techniques to reduce the differences between LGBTQ- and heterosexual-identified students, thereby reducing the need to make strong modeling assumptions when estimating the disparities. Before discussing the specifics of the matching models, it is worth noting that whereas covariate adjustment provides an average conditional difference across the variable space, matching allows us to estimate average disparities between sets of students sharing a common profile but differing in one key dimension (namely, LGBTQ identification).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0013189X12457023">6</xref></sup> What this means for our study is that we can find (a) heterosexual-identified youth who match the <italic>LGBTQ-identified profile</italic> and (b) LGBTQ-identified youth who match the <italic>heterosexual-identified profile</italic>. This results in not just one but <italic>two matched samples each yielding a set of estimates</italic>: one matched sample of LGBTQ- and heterosexual-identified students who fit the heterosexual profile (e.g., lower victimization) and one matched sample of LGBTQ- and heterosexual-identified students who fit the LGBTQ profile (e.g., higher victimization), with the heterosexual- and LGBTQ-identified students in each matched sample having similar demographic characteristics and victimization profiles.</p>
<p>This allows us to answer two important questions: (a) What are the risk disparities when heterosexual youth are victimized at rates similar to LGBTQ youth (Model 5)? and (b) What are the risk disparities when LGBTQ youth are victimized at rates similar to heterosexual youth (Model 6)? The levels of victimization can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0013189X12457023">Table 1</xref>: For example, in the unmatched sample, 81% of heterosexual-identified youth report never being the victims of cyber-bullying (texting- or internet-based bullying), yet only 63% of LGBTQ-identified youth report never being the victims of cyber-bullying. After matching at the values for LGBTQ-identified youth, about two thirds of both heterosexual- and LGBTQ-identified youth report not being cyber-bullied (i.e., the variable values in the matched sample for Model 5 are closer to the values of the LGBTQ-identified youth in the unmatched sample). After matching at the values for heterosexual- identified youth, about four fifths of heterosexual- and LGBTQ-identified youth report no cyber-bullying (i.e., the variable values in the matched sample for Model 6 are closer to the values of the heterosexual-identified youth in the unmatched sample).</p>

<p><italic>Note</italic>. LGBTQ = lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning. For a complete list of variables included in the matching process, please see the supporting online materials. In this table, we present only the victimization differences (which were the variables with the largest LGBTQ–heterosexual differences), and the propensity-score differences (which is the measure of the composite differences between LGBTQ–heterosexual youth on all variables included in the matching). In addition, <italic>p</italic> values for continuous outcomes are based on school fixed-effect linear regressions, and <italic>p</italic> values for categorical outcomes reflect the significance on the χ<sup>2</sup> test of equal representation of LGBTQ across each category, based on school fixed-effect multinomial logit regressions.</p>
</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>We began the matching process by estimating the probability that a student is LGBTQ identified based on the previously mentioned demographic and victimization variables, and allowing for school random effects, among the sample that excludes multiple-low-frequency responders. The predicted probability is the student’s propensity to be LGBTQ identified. To construct the matched sample at the LGBTQ-identified values (Model 5), for each LGBTQ-identified student we found the heterosexual-identified student with the closest propensity score within the school and retained the match if the difference in propensity scores between the matched pair was within a caliper of 0.25 <italic>SD</italic>s of the propensity score in the unmatched sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0013189X12457023">Rosenbaum &amp; Rubin, 1985</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0013189X12457023">7</xref></sup> Once the matched sample was finalized, we assessed covariate balance: Before matching, LGBTQ- and heterosexual-identified students differed by 1.87 <italic>SD</italic>s on the propensity score (a composite measure of covariate difference); after matching, they differed by 0.00 <italic>SD</italic>s on the propensity score (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0013189X12457023">Table 1</xref>). Similarly, individual covariates included in the matching experienced a reduction in bias after matching, and no individual covariate differed significantly between LGBTQ- and heterosexual-identified students after matching. Hence, balance was achieved in both a standardized difference and a statistically significant sense. We used a similar process to construct the matched sample at the heterosexual-identified values (Model 6), except we allowed for the match to come from other schools in the district.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0013189X12457023">8</xref></sup> See the Supplemental Online Materials for additional details.</p>
<p>Using each matched sample, we again estimated odds ratios using multilevel modeling. To adjust for any remaining (albeit small) differences in covariates, we conditioned on the propensity score and all covariates included in the matching stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013189X12457023">Ho, Imai, King, &amp; Stuart, 2007</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0013189X12457023">9</xref></sup> Using the Hierarchical Linear Model (HLM) software (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013189X12457023">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002</xref>), in addition to school random intercepts, we allowed for random slopes on the LGBTQ and propensity score slopes, primarily because we are examining the overall LGBTQ–heterosexual risk disparity (not LGBTQ subgroup–heterosexual disparities) and because the composition of the LGBTQ group may differ across schools.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0013189X12457023">Table 2</xref> provides odds ratios (ORs) for three items: suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and unexcused absences; furthermore, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0013189X12457023">Figure 1</xref> presents the LGBTQ–heterosexual ORs visually. Model 1 shows that all categories of LGBTQ-identified students are at greater risk for each outcome. Model 2 shows that part of these elevated risks is due to the higher proportion of multiple-low-frequency responders (i.e., potentially mischievous responders) among ostensibly LGBTQ-identified students and that the transgender–heterosexual disparities in suicide-related risk are fully explained by removing multiple-low-frequency responders. For suicide ideation and attempts, risk disparities remain significantly elevated for LGBTQ- (overall), bisexual-, and questioning-identified youth when demographic (Model 3), and peer victimization (Model 4) covariates are added sequentially. Accounting for victimization (i.e., moving from Model 3 to Model 4) reduced the disparity estimate for suicidal ideation by about 37% and reduced the disparity estimate for suicide attempts by 33%. Concerning unexcused absences, LGBTQ-identified youth were 100% more likely to skip school than are heterosexual-identified peers with similar demographics (Model 3). Adding victimization covariates to the model reduced the estimate of increased LGBTQ risk to 79% (Model 4), a 21% reduction in the disparity estimate from Model 3.</p>

<p>Perhaps most telling are the propensity-score-matched models (Models 5 and 6). Model 5 shows that when heterosexual- identified youth had demographic and victimization profiles similar to LGBTQ-identified youth within the same school, LGBTQ-identified students were 3.3 times as likely to think about suicide (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001), 3.0 times as likely to attempt suicide (<italic>p</italic> = .006), and 1.4 times as likely to skip school (<italic>p</italic> = .046). When we found LGBTQ-identified youth who matched the heterosexual-identified profile (Model 6), the LGBTQ–heterosexual disparities were almost identical to those just mentioned: 3.5 for suicidal ideation, 2.9 for suicide attempts, and 1.6 for unexcused absences. Thus, in matched samples with both lower (Model 6) and higher (Model 5) levels of victimization, the LGBTQ–heterosexual odds ratios were strikingly similar. We return to this finding in the Discussion section.</p>
<p>Given the diversity within the broad LGBTQ category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013189X12457023">Horn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013189X12457023">Robinson &amp; Espelage, 2011</xref>), we now turn to analyses of risk disaggregated by subgroups. Lesbian/gay–heterosexual disparities for suicidal ideation were largely accounted for by the model including demographic and victimization covariates (Model 4), but lesbian/gay-identified youth remained 3.8 times as likely to attempt suicide even after accounting for victimization. The lesbian/gay–heterosexual disparity in unexcused absences was fully accounted for by eliminating the potentially mischievous responders (Model 2). In contrast, bisexual-identified youth remained more than 6 times as likely as demographically similar heterosexual-identified youth to consider suicide (OR = 6.49, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001) and attempt suicide (OR = 6.90, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001). Accounting for victimization differences reduced these differences somewhat, but bisexual-identified youth remained more than 4 times as likely to exhibit suicide-related risks (Models 4). Bisexual-identified youth were also significantly more likely to skip school, a consistent finding across all models. Questioning-identified youth demonstrated patterns similar to—but somewhat less risky than—those of bisexual-identified youth, such that covariate adjustment did not explain the questioning– heterosexual suicide-related risk disparities. However, when victimization was added to the model (Model 4), covariate adjustment did explain questioning–heterosexual disparities for unexcused absences. Finally, transgender–heterosexual disparities persist only for unexcused absences. The conspicuous change from high differential risk to no differential risk for transgender-identified youth when excluding potentially mischievous responders, however, raises concerns about the validity of the transgender-identified subsample. In a separate set of analyses, we verified that the LGBQ–heterosexual disparities persisted even when we excluded the students who identified only as transgender.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0013189X12457023">10</xref></sup></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In sum, although peer victimization does explain a portion of the LGBTQ–heterosexual risk disparities, LGBTQ-identified students report being at higher risk for suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and unexcused absences than demographically similar heterosexual-identified students even after accounting for victimization. That is, LGBTQ identification is a significant predictor of elevated risk, above and beyond the variables included in the covariate-adjusted multilevel models and matching approaches. These results are in agreement with prior studies that did not screen out potentially mischievous responders or include comprehensive demographic covariates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013189X12457023">Garofalo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013189X12457023">Russell &amp; Joyner, 2001</xref>). The consistency of findings across these different studies, which used different samples and methods, provides strong evidence that LGBTQ–heterosexual risk disparities exist even after accounting for peer victimization differences. Looking beyond the broad LGBTQ categorization, however, we see patterns that suggest much heterogeneity among sexual-minority youth. After accounting for victimization, bisexual- and questioning-identified youth appear to be at significantly greater risk than their heterosexual-identified peers, whereas some lesbian/gay–heterosexual disparities decrease to nonsignificant levels.</p>
<p>The sources of this variability within the LGBTQ-identified youth population are not clear; however, two potential contributing factors worth considering are (a) subgroup-level differences in acceptance of a sexual-minority identity and (b) biphobia. First, although it is well established that bisexual identities do exist and are not simply transitional identities on the path from heterosexual identities to lesbian/gay identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013189X12457023">Cass, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013189X12457023">Firestein, 2007</xref>), it is nevertheless plausible that a nontrivial proportion of the youth in our sample who identified as “bisexual” may ultimately identify as “lesbian” or “gay” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013189X12457023">Rosario, Schrimshaw, Hunter, &amp; Braun, 2006</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013189X12457023">Cass, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013189X12457023">Diamond, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013189X12457023">Rossi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0013189X12457023">Rust, 1993</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0013189X12457023">11</xref></sup> If these youth identified as “bisexual” as an intermediate step to a lesbian/gay identity, then the results of this study should not be interpreted as indicating that bisexual youth are inherently more at risk for negative outcomes. Rather, these results may be reflective of environmental factors (e.g., greater intolerance, less support from the family) that are associated with these students’ being less likely to claim a strictly homosexual identity and are also associated with higher risk for suicide. On this account, lesbian/gay individuals may not be less at risk per se, but rather youth who have adopted such identities may be embedded in more supportive environments that allow them to claim these exclusively homosexual identities at relatively young ages. On a second possible account for these patterns, “biphobia”—prejudice against bisexuals exhibited by both heterosexual and lesbian/gay communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013189X12457023">Bennett, 1992</xref>)—may lead some bisexual-identified youth to experience a “double discrimination” from both their heterosexual and lesbian/gay peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013189X12457023">Mulick &amp; Wright, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0013189X12457023">Ochs, 1996</xref>). This, in turn, may contribute to heightened feelings of isolation, depression, and generally riskier outcomes. More research is needed to better understand <italic>why</italic> subgroup differences exist.</p>
<p>The findings of the propensity-score-matched samples deserve special attention. Prior research has suggested that victimization has a differential association with outcomes for LGBTQ and heterosexual populations, such that disparities are more pronounced at higher levels of victimization (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013189X12457023">Bontempo &amp; D’Augelli, 2002</xref>). However, for each outcome in our data, the nearly identical odds ratios in Models 5 and 6 do <italic>not</italic> support the assertion that LGBTQ–heterosexual risk disparities are greater at higher levels of victimization with respect to the outcomes examined here.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0013189X12457023">12</xref></sup> Rather, peer victimization explains part of the overall observed disparities as revealed by the covariate-adjusted multilevel models, but disparities persist at both lower and higher levels of victimization as revealed by the propensity-score-matched models.</p>
<p>One might suspect that other individual-level differences—such as perceptions of parents’ love and support, physical abuse by parents, being kicked out of the home, childhood sexual abuse, or dating violence—explain the remaining disparities. To explore this explanation, we performed supplemental analyses that also conditioned on a broader range of victimization variables beyond the scope of schooling (i.e., childhood sexual abuse, physical abuse by parents, perceptions of parents’ love and support, being kicked out of the home, and dating violence): In these supplemental analysis, we found that LGBTQ–heterosexual disparities remained in suicidal ideation (OR = 2.51, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001) and suicide attempts (OR = 2.86, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001). Moreover, in ongoing research, we are finding that LGBTQ-identified youth are <italic>not</italic> engaging in sexually risky activities (e.g., anonymous sex, sex under the influence of drugs or alcohol, unprotected sex) significantly more so than their heterosexual-identified peers when victimization is lower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013189X12457023">Robinson &amp; Espelage, 2012</xref>). Taken together, these patterns suggest that the remaining disparities cannot be solely attributed to differences in perceived familial support, other forms of individual-level victimization/abuse, or sexual risk. Thus, we speculate that the disparities may be partially the result of stigmatizing, macro-level messages that youth receive about sexual minorities (e.g., they are unwanted, they are different) that persist even in the absence of direct individual-level peer victimization. For researchers, this suggests the need for a more thorough accounting of macro-level policies and climate. For practitioners, this may suggest a need for broader school-climate support for sexual minorities (including <italic>but not limited to</italic> inclusive anti-bullying policies), which may help to reduce the macro-level stigmatization that seems to contribute to elevated suicide risk.</p>
<sec id="section13-0013189X12457023">
<title>Potential Limitations</title>
<p>Although we have found consistent LGBTQ–heterosexual risk disparities across the various strategies and have taken several precautions to ensure the validity of the data, several limitations must be noted. First, the data come from self-reported, anonymous surveys. However, because of the sensitive nature of questions about sexual orientation and gender identity, this approach to data collection is the recommended practice for large-scale LGBTQ youth research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013189X12457023">Badgett &amp; Goldberg, 2009</xref>). A second limitation of this study is that the DCYA only asked about sexual identity, not sexual attraction or the gender of sex partners. Thus, the survey may not capture the full range of LGBTQ youth who experience same-sex or gender-nonconformist attraction or activities, but rather only those who <italic>identify</italic> as LGBTQ. Third, the data come from schools in one county, and thus the results may not be generalizable to schools in all locations. Finally, the data are cross-sectional and not experimental, and this research makes no causal claims. Although we use methods associated with causal inference (i.e., propensity score matching), these methods are used in the spirit of a careful comparative analysis, not a causal analysis.</p>
<p>Given these limitations, it is worth noting that several analytic choices and features of the data may have resulted in <italic>conservative</italic> estimates of LGBTQ–heterosexual risk disparities. First, we screened out potentially mischievous responders, who disproportionately ostensibly identified as LGBTQ (and coincidentally reported higher risk levels). Then, among the remaining students, we conditioned on (or matched and conditioned on) whether they provided any low-frequency responses. Although this process is rigorous in its treatment of survey data, it risks explaining away actual differences related to hardship associated with LGBTQ identification. Second, the dependent variables were dichotomized as “any reported risk” versus “no reported risk,” which facilitated estimation and interpretation but neglected differences in gradations of risk (and LGBTQ-identified students are more likely to be concentrated in high-risk categories than in moderate-risk categories; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013189X12457023">Robinson &amp; Espelage, 2011</xref>). Third, one of the victimization items we conditioned/matched on is victimization on the basis of perceived sexual orientation; thus, including this bias-based victimization variable may capture a unique form of victimization (specific to LGBTQ-perceived youth) and thus explain a portion of the true LGBTQ–heterosexual risk disparities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0013189X12457023">13</xref></sup> Fourth, the community in which these data were collected is a relatively progressive and inclusive community (e.g., the only openly lesbian U.S. congresswoman represents this county); therefore, the risk disparities may be greater in less progressive areas of the country.</p>

<title>Conclusions and Policy Implications</title>
<p>This research may be used to inform current policy debates regarding in-school discussions of bullying and sexual identity and, more generally, of supportive learning environments for sexual minorities. Presently, many schools are attempting to reduce bullying while avoiding mention of sexual orientation and gender identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013189X12457023">Kosciw et al., 2010</xref>). Our research suggests that LGBTQ identification remains a unique predictor of risk after accounting for peer victimization, raising concerns about policies that focus almost exclusively on bullying prevention to address LGBTQ–heterosexual risk disparities. Moreover, the nearly identical disparities among matched samples at both lower and higher victimization levels provides further evidence that addressing victimization while ignoring other aspects of the schooling environment is unlikely to eliminate disparities in suicide-related outcomes. To be sure, some of the causes for LGBTQ–heterosexual risk disparities are most likely beyond the control of schools (e.g., family rejection).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0013189X12457023">14</xref></sup> But in addition to pursuing inclusive bullying-prevention programs, there are a number of ways schools could try to foster a more inclusive and supportive learning environment for LGBTQ youth, such as training teachers and staff in sexuality diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013189X12457023">Bradshaw, Waasdorp, O’Brennan, &amp; Gulemetova, 2011</xref>), discussing homophobia in sports and physical education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013189X12457023">Barber &amp; Krane, 2007</xref>), incorporating instruction on the contributions of LGBTQ historical figures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013189X12457023">Lovett, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0013189X12457023">Toomey, McGuire, &amp; Russell, 2012</xref>), recognizing and modifying subtle forms of everyday heteronormativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013189X12457023">Murray, 2011</xref>), and supporting GSAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0013189X12457023">Toomey et al., 2012</xref>). Through a multifaceted approach to LGBTQ support, reductions in LGBTQ–heterosexual risk disparities are more likely to be achieved.</p>

<p>One potential limitation of this study is that the data are self-reported.

<p>We used a slightly different method to screen out extreme responders here. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013189X12457023">Robinson and Espelage (2011)</xref>, students were excluded if they provided heights below 4 ft 6 in. or above 8 ft or weights less than 75 lbs or more than 300 lbs. In this article, we used an empirically driven approach and excluded students with heights and weights in the top and bottom 2.5% of the initial distribution. This new approach resulted in excluding students with heights below 4 ft 11 in. or above 6 ft 8 in. and students with weights less than 89 lbs or more than 225 lbs. We note that either approach to screening leads to the same conclusion about LGBTQ–heterosexual risk disparities (and across all models) because students with values between the old and new exclusion criteria did not disproportionately identify as LGBTQ; nevertheless, we moved to this new screening approach as a precaution to screen out additional students who may not be taking the survey seriously.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013189X12457023">Rubin (2001)</xref> states that covariate adjustment can result in biased estimates, unless three conditions hold: (a) the difference in the average propensity scores of the groups being compared is small (less than 0.50 <italic>SD</italic>s); (b) the ratio of the variances of the groups’ propensity scores is close to 1; and (c) the ratio of variances of the residuals of the covariates (used in the regression model) is close to 1 after conditioning on the propensity score. When these conditions are not met, the group disparities estimated via covariate adjustment can be very sensitive to modeling choices (e.g., whether a quadratic term for a variable is added to the model), and the resulting estimate may be an under- or over-estimate of the true disparity. In our data set, none of the conditions held before matching: (a) the propensity score means differed by 1.87 <italic>SD</italic>s; (b) the variance ratio of the propensity scores was 11.21; and (c) many covariates had variance ratios of the residuals that were far from 1. After matching (and in each of our two matched samples, for Models 5 and 6), each condition was met: (a) the propensity score means differed by 0.00 <italic>SD</italic>s; (b) the variance ratio of the propensity scores was 1.00; and (c) the covariate variance ratios of the residuals were not far from 1.</p>

<p>In the terminology of causality, propensity score matching allows analysts to estimate “average treatment effects on the treated (ATT)” and “average treatment effects on the control (ATC).” Although we do not invoke matching to infer causality (but rather as a tool to avoid making the stronger functional-form assumptions required for covariate adjustment on unmatched samples with large covariate differences), we can nevertheless create matched samples in the way one would if they were estimating ATT and ATC. In an example analogous to the ATT, we start with the students in the “treated” condition (say, LGBTQ) and find suitable matches for them from the “control” condition (say, heterosexual). For the ATC, we start with the “control” and find matches from the “treated” condition.</p>

<p>This 0.25-<italic>SD</italic> caliper translates to retaining the match if the propensity score differed by less than 0.015 points. Note also that if more than one student in the opposite condition tied for the “nearest neighbor,” we retained all nearest neighbors and reweighted them to count as the inverse of the target student’s number of nearest neighbors (e.g., if three students were nearest neighbors for one student, then each of the three was given a weight of 1/3).</p>

<p>We chose to allow for matches outside of the school because there are comparatively fewer LGBTQ-identified students to use as potential matches within any given school. Thus, we could find a greater number of close matches than if we restricted our analyses to only within-school matches. Nevertheless, in a supplemental analysis we matched within schools, which as expected yielded a lower number of quality matches (total sample <italic>N</italic> = 2,458) and required a very small caliper (.0005, instead of .015) to achieve a nonsignificant difference on the propensity score (<italic>p</italic> = .82). Even then, there were statistically significant imbalances on several key variables (i.e., race, disability, victimization based on sexual orientation, and victimization based on looks). After statistically adjusting for these remaining differences, the within-school-based estimates for Model 6 were similar to the estimates allowing for matches across schools: suicidal ideation odds ratio (OR) = 3.62 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), suicide attempts OR = 2.57 (<italic>p</italic> = .042), and unexcused absences OR = 1.53 (<italic>p</italic> = .178). Thus, matching across schools within the county is unlikely to have introduced substantial bias. Rather, we were able to achieve a much greater number of high-quality matches on the individual-level covariates by allowing for matches across schools.</p>

<p>Note that this means these models are also “covariate adjusted” in a technical sense.

<p>Indeed, a youth may also adopt a “lesbian” or “gay” identity when surveyed, then adopt a bisexual identity at some later point (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013189X12457023">Diamond, 2003</xref>); moreover, there is great variability in the “coming out” process within LGBTQ subgroups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013189X12457023">Floyd &amp; Stein, 2002</xref>). Thus, our speculation here is not intended to deny multidirectionality and fluidity in sexual identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0013189X12457023">Rust, 1993</xref>) but rather to propose a plausible explanation for the observed patterns and a suggested direction for future research on environmental influences.</p>

<p>Moreover, we also performed a supplemental analysis to further test whether the LGBTQ–heterosexual disparities were greater at higher levels of victimization. In this new analysis, we created an interaction between LGBTQ identification and the propensity score (which increases as each dimension of peer victimization increases) and reestimated Models 5 and 6 with the new interaction term added. If the disparities were greater at higher levels of victimization, the interaction would be positive. For each outcome, the interaction was <italic>not</italic> significant, and the direction of the coefficient was <italic>negative</italic> in the majority of cases.

Thus, even the addition of these factors does not fully explain the disparities.</p>
