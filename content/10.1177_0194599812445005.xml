<p>I wish to comment on the recent article, “Subjective Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo,” by Balatsouras and Korres.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812445005">1</xref></sup> It follows a similar theme to an earlier publication, “Benign Positional Vertigo without Detectable Nystagmus,” by Tirelli et al in 2001.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812445005">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The importance of ensuring residents acquire sound technique in conducting Dix-Hallpike provocative positional testing cannot be overstressed, as they will be the ones to later teach other health professionals. It is attempting to elicit a brief but very clear clinical sign (visible brisk nystagmus) as the patient experiences vertigo. One finds residents frequently report a “positive” test because the patient said he or she was “dizzy” on lying down or sitting up. Repeat testing using Frenzel glasses confirms no nystagmus, so on conventional wisdom, the patient should be told that he or she does <italic>not</italic> have benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) but <italic>may have had it</italic>. However, the patient is asked to return immediately if further convinced that he or she is experiencing distinct positional vertigo. Sometimes a later test is positive and the diagnosis made on a sound clinical basis. For too long, progress in vestibular medicine has been hampered and muddied by unsubstantiated, speculative diagnosis.</p>
<p>It is true some patients do report being “dizzy” when lying down or arising. Balatsouras and Korres<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812445005">1</xref></sup> comment, “The main issue arising in cases of subjective BPPV is the explanation of the absence of nystagmus in positional vertigo during the provoking maneuver.” There are, of course, plausible explanations—very small otolith particles (“limited otoconia”) causing symptoms without the critical mass to evoke nystagmus.</p>
<p>Another is just patient expectation or fear, especially in the elderly.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon to successfully treat BPPV, but the patient reports feeling unspecifically dizzy for days or weeks and may have subtle detectable nystagmus. It eventually ceases. One possibility is that the delicate canal receptor (which has been forcefully deformed by the otoliths) is “bruised” and “heavy” and acts inappropriately on head movements. It is likely that, eventually, improved magnetic resonance inner ear imaging will clarify these possible phenomena. Meanwhile, the diagnosis of BPPV should be continued to be taught on sound clinical principles and the term <italic>subjective benign paroxysmal vertigo</italic> not be encouraged until there is more proof.</p>
