<abstract>
<p><bold>Background</bold>: Recent studies have demonstrated that trunk control likely plays a role in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Yet, the majority of ACL research remains focused on the lower limb, with limited information on the trunk position at the time of injury.</p>
<p><bold>Hypotheses</bold>: Athletes experiencing a noncontact ACL injury after a 1-legged landing position their center of mass (COM) more posterior from the base of support (BOS) at initial ground contact in comparison with uninjured athletes. The distance from the COM to the BOS (COM_BOS) is larger in female, as compared with male, athletes during 1-legged landing.</p>
<p><bold>Study Design</bold>: Case control study; Level of evidence, 3.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: Movie captures of 20 athletes performing a 1-legged landing maneuver resulting in a torn ACL were compared with matched (for gender, sport, and activity just before landing) movie captures of 20 athletes performing a similar maneuver that did not result in an ACL disruption (controls). The COM_BOS, trunk<sub>G</sub> angle, and limb<sub>G</sub> angle (both relative to the gravity vector) were measured in the sagittal plane at initial ground-foot contact. A 2-way ANOVA (injury status × gender) was used to examine the hypotheses.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: There was a significant difference in all 3 measures based on injury status but not on gender. The COM_BOS, normalized by femur length, and limb<sub>G</sub> angle were greater (Δ = 0.9, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001 and Δ = 16°, <italic>P</italic> = .004, respectively), and the trunk<sub>G</sub> angle was smaller (Δ = 12°, <italic>P</italic> = .016) in the participants who sustained an ACL injury as compared with controls. The average COM was calculated as 38 cm more posterior relative to the BOS in the participants who sustained an ACL injury as compared with controls.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: Landing with the COM far posterior to the BOS may be a risk factor for noncontact ACL injury and potentially can be addressed in prevention programs.</p>

<body>
<p>Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are typically sports related, occur in active healthy young adults (15-24 years old), involve expensive intervention with long recoveries, and result in many athletes losing knee function and quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512437850">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512437850">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512437850">26</xref></sup> For these reasons, a sustained and extensive research effort has been put forth to identify the risk factors associated with ACL injuries as a first step in trying to prevent them.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512437850">1</xref></sup> This effort has tended to focus on the lower limb,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512437850">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512437850">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512437850">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512437850">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512437850">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546512437850">31</xref></sup> yet more recent work has begun to focus on trunk orientation and control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512437850">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512437850">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512437850">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546512437850">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>The control of sagittal plane trunk position may play a key role in ACL injury, as it is central to balance control. The importance of trunk control in ACL injury is evidenced by the phantom foot mechanism in skiing, which partially attributes ACL injury to a strong quadriceps contraction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512437850">10</xref></sup> This mechanism was tested using a 2-dimensional (2-D) sagittal plane model of landing during high-speed downhill skiing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512437850">11</xref></sup> When a small balance disturbance caused a slight backward fall, ACL forces large enough to cause failure were seen during the model’s attempt to restore balance. A recent descriptive videotape study supported this finding, noting that athletes who sustained an ACL injury were leaning backward at the time of injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512437850">6</xref></sup> Blackburn and Padua<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512437850">3</xref></sup> demonstrated that increased trunk extension (measured as the angle between the trunk and the thigh) during a 2-legged drop landing increased the ground-reaction and quadriceps forces. Similarly, Kulas and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512437850">17</xref></sup> demonstrated that participants who increased trunk extension (measured as the angle between the trunk and vertical line) in response to an additional trunk load during a 2-legged drop test implemented a quadriceps dominant strategy (ie, there was an increase in quadriceps and a decrease in hamstring forces) upon landing. These 2-D sagittal plane studies indicate that when the trunk is more extended during a landing maneuver, the quadriceps is recruited in an attempt to maintain balance.</p>
<p>In opposition to these modeling and laboratory-based studies, an earlier video-based study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512437850">7</xref></sup> found that the hip angle (measured as the angle between the trunk and the thigh) was significantly more flexed at foot contact during a 1-legged landing maneuver that resulted in an ACL disruption (provocative landing position), as compared with a safe landing position. Therefore, the actual orientation of the trunk relative to the leg may not be as important as the position of the trunk relative to the foot, which is influenced not only by the trunk angle but the hip, knee, and ankle angles as well. If the gravitational vector from the body’s center of mass (COM, approximately located at the center of the trunk) does not lie within the base of support (BOS), then static posture is unstable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512437850">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512437850">16</xref></sup> To avoid a fall, the body’s posture must be altered so that the COM falls within the BOS. In a dynamic situation, the COM can fall outside the BOS, but if the distance is too great, then recovery is no longer possible, resulting in a fall.</p>
<p>This study tested the hypothesis that the distance from the COM to the BOS (COM_BOS) was larger at the time of initial ground contact in the provocative, as compared with the safe, landing position. In addition, the hypothesis that limb angle relative to the vertical (limb<sub>G</sub> angle) was larger, but trunk angle relative to the vertical (trunk<sub>G</sub> angle) was no different, in the provocative, as compared with the safe, landing position was also tested. The analysis was limited to the sagittal plane, as the trunk position in the frontal plane had previously been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512437850">14</xref></sup> Because female athletes tend to injure their ACL more frequently than do their male counterparts,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512437850">2</xref></sup> a tertiary hypothesis was tested: The COM_BOS and limb angle were larger in the female athletes as compared with the male athletes during a 1-legged landing maneuver.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Twelve videotapes of athletes captured during an ACL injury, acquired for a previous study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512437850">7</xref></sup> formed the basis of the current study. Sixteen additional movies in digital format were acquired from collaborators and the public domain. For a video or movie clip to be included within the study, it had to meet previously published inclusion criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512437850">7</xref></sup> The same author (BPB) assessed both the original videos, as well as the additional movie clips (8 additional movie clips met the inclusion criteria), resulting in a total of 20 movie clips of athletes performing a 1-legged landing maneuver that resulted in an ACL injury (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512437850">Table 1</xref>). All ACL injuries were confirmed based on the medical record, except two. These 2 videos were acquired directly from the public domain and the ACL injury was confirmed through media reports. The same author (BPB) assessed 50 sagittal view videotapes (12 were from a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512437850">7</xref></sup>) or digital movie clips of athletes (controls) performing similar decelerating or landing maneuvers during game situations that did not result in an ACL tear (32 met the inclusion criteria). The activity being performed just before ground contact was categorized into 1 of 3 activities: (1) stopping from a run (run-stop), (2) a vertical jump, or (3) a horizontal jump. From these 32 control clips, 20 were selected so that the controls were matched for gender, sport, and activity just before landing. To lessen any potential for selection bias, the matching was done without reference to the video data, and the athletes’ landing position did not factor into the acceptance or rejection of the video clip anytime during the selection process. This study was exempt from institutional review board (IRB) approval, as assessed by the IRB of the National Institutes of Child Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, as all movies were in the public domain.</p>

<p>The video recordings and digital movies were edited using Adobe Premiere Pro (version 2.0, Adobe Systems Inc, San Jose, California) and iMovie HD (Apple, Cupertino, California), respectively. For each movie, the frame in which the foot initially contacted the ground (initial contact) was captured and stored for analysis. This frame was distinguished from the series of frames that captured footfall by having at least a single point on the foot stop its downward progression. Image J (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland) was used for all measurements. For consistency, a single author (WS), who was not involved in assessing the video quality, performed all measures. Four months after the initial analysis, the measures were repeated by the same author, who was blinded to the initial results.</p>
<p>The first measure of interest was the COM_BOS. The COM was defined as the center of an ellipse delineating the athlete’s trunk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512437850">Figure 1</xref>). The major axis was the center line of the trunk (represented as the line from the center of the hip joint to the center of the shoulder joint), and the minor axis ran from the anterior to the posterior aspect of the trunk. The BOS was defined as the point bisecting the line of contact between the shoe and the floor at initial contact. To account for small variations in camera angle across images, perpendicular lines on the field of play (eg, the “key” in basketball) were used to denote the anterior and medial directions relative to the athlete. The COM_BOS (in pixels) was then taken along the anterior/posterior direction. Because the conversion from pixels to millimeters was not available, the COM_BOS was normalized by femur length (measured from the center of the knee joint to <?A3B2 tlsb=-0.01w?>the center of the hip joint), which was measured from the identical image as the COM_BOS. This scaling accounted for the variations in magnification factors and variations in athlete height. In addition, any slight rotation of the athlete away from the sagittal plane would have resulted in a foreshortening of the COM_BOS (by the cosine of the out-of-plane rotation angle). A similar foreshortening of the femur length would have also occurred. Thus, dividing the COM_BOS by the femur length minimized this error. Femur length was chosen over athlete height as the scaling factor because this single measure was not prone to cumulative measurement errors and has been correlated with body height.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512437850">18</xref></sup> Two angles (trunk<sub>G</sub> and limb<sub>G</sub>) were also measured. The trunk<sub>G</sub> angle was defined as the angle from the vertical to the center line of the trunk. The limb<sub>G</sub> angle was defined as the angle between the vertical and the thigh (represented as the line from the center of the knee joint to the center of the hip joint). A positive trunk<sub>G</sub> and/or limb<sub>G</sub> angle indicated that the trunk and/or limb was rotated anteriorly relative to the vertical.</p>

<p>An a priori power analysis revealed that 7 participants were needed for both the injured and the control groups (α = .05, β = .80). This was based on the assumption that the difference in the COM_BOS between the injured and control populations would be 0.246*height (H) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512437850">Figure 2</xref>) and that the variation in both populations would be equal to 75% of the average value of the COM_BOS. Thus, the original videotapes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512437850">7</xref></sup> (n<sub>injured</sub> = 12, n<sub>control</sub> = 12) were sufficient to test the main hypothesis, but the additional digital videos were added to match the 2 cohorts and investigate the difference across subpopulations.</p>

<label>Figure 2.</label>
<caption><p>Power analysis. (A) Assumed provocative landing position: To perform the power calculations, it was assumed that the line between the hip and the heel is 20° from the vertical (gravitational direction). Then, the distance from the center of mass to the base of support (COM_BOS) was calculated as the distance from the COM to the heel of the foot multiplied by the sin of 20° (0.246*height [H] = 0.720*H*sin(20°)). (B) Assumed safe landing position: In the control position, it was assumed that the COM was directly over the BOS. (C) Segment lengths: Segment lengths normalized by height as provided by Winter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546512437850">30</xref></sup> The key measurements used in the current study are the following: Trunk to heel = 0.720*H; Femur length = 0.245*H = (0.530*H – 0.285*H); Foot length = 0.152*H; Foot length = 0.618*femur length = 0.152*H(femur length/0.246*H).</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>A 2-way analysis of variance (2 × 2 ANOVA, SPSS 15.0, IBM Corporation, Somers, New York) was used to assess main and interaction effects of injury status and gender on 3 variables (COM_BOS, limb<sub>G</sub> angle, and trunk<sub>G</sub> angle). Intraclass correlation coefficients, using a 2-way mixed-effects model, were used to examine intrarater reliability. A discriminant analysis determined if any single variable could distinguish injury status. A <italic>P</italic> value less than .05 was considered significant.</p>

<p>Matching was completely successful for the first 2 criteria (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512437850">Table 1</xref>). However, because of the difficulty in obtaining control movie clips that fit the inclusion criteria, 2 controls categorized as horizontal jump were matched with 2 injured participants categorized as run-stop (all other parameters matched). No significant differences in any of the matching criteria were found between groups. For the COM_BOS, limb<sub>G</sub> angle, and trunk<sub>G</sub> angle, the intraclass correlation coefficients were 0.956 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.917-0.977), 0.988 (95% CI, 0.977-0.994), and 0.967 (95% CI, 0.937-0.983), respectively.</p>
<p>Injury status was a significant main effect for COM_BOS, limb<sub>G</sub> angle, and trunk<sub>G</sub> angle (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546512437850">Table 2</xref>). The COM_BOS, normalized by femur length, was greater in the ACL-injured population (Δ = 0.9, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546512437850">Figure 3</xref>). If an average height of 177.8 cm (5 ft 10 inches) and a femur length of 0.245*H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512437850">Figure 2</xref>) are assumed for both groups, then on average, the COM was 38 cm more posterior relative to the BOS in the participants who sustained an ACL injury as compared with controls (177.8*0.245*[COM_BOS<sub>Controls</sub> – COM_BOS<sub>Injured</sub>]) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546512437850">Table 2</xref>). The limb<sub>G</sub> angle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0363546512437850">Figure 4</xref>) was greater (Δ = 16°, <italic>P</italic> = .004) and the trunk<sub>G</sub> angle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0363546512437850">Figure 5</xref>) was smaller (Δ = 12°, <italic>P</italic> = .016) in the ACL-injured, as compared with the control, population. Interestingly, the same trends existed if each sport was evaluated separately, but because of power issues, significant differences were only found for basketball.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study demonstrates that having the COM far posterior to the BOS, a large limb<sub>G</sub> angle, and a small trunk<sub>G</sub> angle at initial ground contact are important components of the noncontact ACL injury mechanism. These results extend our previously defined provocative and safe landing positions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512437850">7</xref></sup> in the sagittal plane. In the provocative position, the athletes tend to land flat-footed, with the hip flexed, knee extended, and the COM far posterior to their BOS. In the safe position, athletes land on their forefoot with the hip in a neutral position, the knee slightly more flexed, and the COM close to the BOS, based on a sagittal plane analysis. These results may be useful in screening athletes who are at risk for ACL injury and for implementing a prevention program that trains athletes to land with the foot closer to the body. In addition, training athletes to fall safely when landing with the COM far posterior to the BOS, instead of reflexively activating their hip flexors and knee extensors, may help prevent ACL injuries. Future studies are needed to determine if neuromuscular interventions that focus on improving core<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546512437850">29</xref></sup> stability and trunk positioning can help reduce the incidence of ACL injuries.</p>
<p>Previous videotape studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512437850">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512437850">14</xref></sup> have failed to demonstrate significant coronal plane alignment (knee abduction, hip abduction, or trunk angle) differences at initial contact between the safe and provocative landing positions when comparing injured athletes and controls. Yet, other studies have demonstrated that increased knee abduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512437850">13</xref></sup> and lateral trunk bend<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512437850">14</xref></sup> during landing may be a risk factor for noncontact ACL injury in female athletes. Interestingly, the current study did not show significant differences between male and female athletes for any variable, indicating that a more posteriorly placed trunk may be a generalized risk factor across genders.</p>
<p>A consensus is beginning to form around the concept that an ACL injury is likely caused by a combination of forces. The critical force appears to be a compressive force on the lateral aspect of the knee,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512437850">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512437850">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512437850">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546512437850">31</xref></sup> resulting in a sliding of the lateral femoral condyle on the lateral tibial plateau with resultant ACL disruption, often referred to as a buckling of the leg, instead of the normal knee flexion to absorb the ground-reaction forces. Landing in an unstable posture may contribute to the ACL disruption by lowering the level of impulsive force required to buckle the leg and causing an ACL tear. The control participants land with the ankle plantarflexed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512437850">7</xref></sup> and the COM less than a single foot length posterior from the BOS. Thus, they are close to a stable static posture, and ankle dorsiflexion would extend the BOS toward the heel, creating a stable posture. In contrast, on average, the ACL-injured athletes land with the COM more than 2 foot lengths posterior to the BOS with a dorsiflexed ankle,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512437850">7</xref></sup> creating a less stable position. To stabilize their posture, these athletes would likely try to flex their trunk forward by activating their quadriceps and trunk flexors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512437850">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512437850">11</xref></sup> This vigorous quadriceps contraction would lower the impulse force necessary to tear the ACL by adding a compressive force as well as a secondary anterior shear force on the tibia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512437850">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512437850">27</xref></sup> This activation likely occurs before landing as the athletes prepare to stabilize their COM at the time of ground contact.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512437850">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>At the time of foot contact, the trunk’s momentum would naturally rotate the trunk forward, even without core muscle or quadriceps activation. Because the foot lands in a dorsiflexed position (near the end range of motion) in the injured athletes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512437850">7</xref></sup> the rotation of the tibia cannot assist in this forward rotation. Thus, the upper body and thigh rotate forward, while the lower leg and foot remain fairly stationary. This forward rotation of the upper relative to the lower leg would foster a forward translation of the tibia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512437850">5</xref></sup> enhancing the likelihood of ACL rupture.</p>
<p>The discriminant analysis demonstrated that positioning of the body’s COM is a likely risk factor for ACL injury but that it also likely works in conjunction with other factors to cause injury. No control participant landed with the COM_BOS greater than 1.6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0363546512437850">Figure 6</xref>); thus, the position of the trunk relative to the BOS is likely a primary risk factor for ACL injury when the COM_BOS is large. In the range of 1.2 to 1.6, both provocative and safe landings occurred. In this range, the posterior position of the trunk likely combines with other factors in order to result in injury. When the trunk is positioned close to the BOS (COM_BOS &lt; 1.2), ACL injury did not occur, with one exception. In this range, the location of the COM is not a critical factor, and other factors are the most likely cause of injury.</p>
<p>The COM_BOS was the measurement of interest for the current study because it provides a more complete description of the dynamic balance stability, as it is the cumulative effect of both lower limb and trunk position. Two previous sagittal plane studies examined the effect of trunk angle during 2-legged drop landing in healthy controls. These studies concluded that landing with the more extended trunk increased landing and quadriceps forces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512437850">3</xref></sup> and increased the anterior shear forces on the tibia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512437850">17</xref></sup> In contrast, a previous study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512437850">7</xref></sup> from which the current study evolved, demonstrated that a flexed hip, measured similarly to the aforementioned trunk angle, was present during a landing maneuver that led to ACL disruption. The divergence in results can be explained by the difference in the task evaluated. In the drop-landing task,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512437850">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512437850">17</xref></sup> the limb<sub>G</sub> angle is quite small, placing the COM close to the BOS. Thus, trunk extension brings the trunk further from the feet, decreasing stability and increasing the external knee flexor moment. To prevent knee collapse, the quadriceps force is increased. In the provocative position,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512437850">7</xref></sup> the limb<sub>G</sub> angle is large and the hip is flexed, placing the athletes’ leg anterior to their body, moving the COM far posterior to the BOS. This likely triggers strong core<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546512437850">29</xref></sup> and quadriceps muscle contraction in response to the unstable posture, which may have a deleterious effect on the ACL.</p>
<p>In a study by Zazulak and colleagues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546512437850">32</xref></sup> it was demonstrated that athletes who sustain ACL tears have greater preinjury deficits in proprioceptive repositioning of the trunk compared with uninjured athletes. Because of the small number of athletes who advanced to an ACL injury (4 female and 2 male) in their prospective study, the role that gender played in the relationship of these variables to ACL injury was not reported. Nonetheless, poor trunk control may have led athletes to allow their COM to be positioned in an unstable position posterior to the BOS, which contributed to the ACL rupture, irrespective of gender.</p>
<p>As with many imaging studies, an exact measure of the accuracy was not available for the current study. For example, in radiological studies, the accuracy is typically assumed to be one half the pixel resolution. On average, the femur length was 37.7 pixels for both populations. The difference in the COM_BOS across cohorts was 0.9, which on average would be 32.4 pixels, or 32 times the resolution. If the femur length was again assumed to be 37.5 cm, the average resolution was 1 cm. If an accuracy 4 times worse than a radiological study was assumed for the current methods, the accuracy would be 2 mm, well below the 38 cm reported for the ΔCOM_BOS. The possible acceptance videos in which the athletes were slightly rotated away from the sagittal plane would have added variability into the measures. Yet, even if a “worst-case scenario” was assumed in which (1) all the control participants were rotated 30° away from the sagittal plane, (2) all the injury videos were captured in a purely sagittal plane, and (3) the scaling by femur length did not compensate at all for this rotation, the difference in the COM_BOS between cohorts dropped to 0.8 and remained significant. Only when the scenario was changed to a 50° angle did the difference between cohorts become insignificant.</p>
<p>There were several potential limitations to this study. The movie clips were collected as a convenience sample and may not be representative of all noncontact ACL injury mechanisms. Yet, the observed motions likely represented some of the most common noncontact mechanisms of ACL injury. It was not possible to determine the exact moment at which the ACL injury occurred, creating possible millisecond differences in the timing of the first sequence picked as the foot touched the ground to the point of injury. However, it was likely that the ACL injury occurred within 50 milliseconds of ground contact.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512437850">19</xref></sup> There were also possible difficulties identifying anatomic landmarks in clothed participants with no markers, yet the reliability measures were excellent. Lastly, although every effort was made to eliminate bias throughout the experiment, there remained a minor potential for selection bias, as the inclusion criteria were based on a qualitative analysis. However, the quantitative measurements acquired (with the use of matched controls to reduce these potential errors) were a considerable improvement over previous descriptive studies based purely on visual estimates of body position. The other strengths of the study were the intentional focus on the sagittal plane to explore concepts that were raised in previous 2-D sagittal analyses of controls,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512437850">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512437850">17</xref></sup> eliminating redundancy with previous video-based studies that reported frontal plane kinematics,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512437850">14</xref></sup> the strong statistical differences between the ACL-injured and control cohorts, and the evaluation of posture during an event that directly resulted in ACL injury. Lastly, this work represents the largest quantitative video analysis study to date and the only one to match the 2 cohorts.</p>
<p>In conclusion, athletes captured on video while tearing their ACL landed with the COM far posterior to the BOS as compared with controls. This position likely increases the rectus femoris contraction at initial impact to prevent a backward fall. A strong quadriceps contraction lowers the impulse force necessary to tear the ACL by adding a compressive force as well as a smaller secondary anterior shear force on the tibia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512437850">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512437850">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512437850">28</xref></sup> Therefore, observation of consistent landing with the COM far posterior to the BOS may be helpful as a screening test for athletes at risk for noncontact ACL injury. Future work is needed to determine if training athletes to avoid this dangerous position helps reduce the risk of an ACL injury.</p>
