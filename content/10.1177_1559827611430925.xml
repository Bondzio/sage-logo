<p>Foodborne illnesses strike an estimated 48 million Americans each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These result in an estimated 128 000 hospitalizations and 3000 deaths. At least 31 pathogens, such as bacteria and viruses, and other causes are responsible for these illnesses.</p>
<p>The good news: Proper food handling, preparation, cooking, and storage can keep you and your family safe.</p>

<title>Preparing Foods Safely</title>
<list id="list4-1559827611430925" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Wash hands with warm water and soap for 20 seconds before handling food. Wash hands between handling produce or other foods and raw meat, poultry, or seafood.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Use separate cutting boards for preparing produce and meat, poultry, and seafood. Sanitize boards often by washing in dishwasher or with solution of 1 tablespoon unscented bleach in 1 gallon of water.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Wash fruits and vegetables with running water and dry with clean towel before peeling. Scrub melons and other thick or hard skinned fruits and vegetables with a produce brush before cutting. Cut away damaged or bruised portions.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Clean utensils and preparation surfaces frequently. Food safety experts advise that a solution of 1 tablespoon unscented bleach in 1 gallon of water works as well or better than more expensive “antibacterial” cleansers or sprays.</p></list-item>

<title>Cooking Foods Safely</title>
<list id="list5-1559827611430925" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Follow instructions for cooking or reheating preprepared or take-out foods.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Cook meats and poultry to recommended internal temperatures.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>145°F for whole meats (and let rest 3 minutes after removing from heat), 160°F for ground meats, and 165°F for all poultry. See <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.foodsafety.gov">www.foodsafety.gov</ext-link> for specific times for specific products and types of cooking.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>An instant-read food thermometer enables you to get it right every time.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Cook eggs until yokes are firm or use pasteurized eggs or egg product for recipes using raw eggs (such as mayonnaise or Caesar salad dressing).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Microwave safely. Microwave ovens heat unevenly and leave cold spots. They also have different power ranges.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Follow package instructions for frozen or prepared foods. Use an instant-read thermometer to check internal temperature.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For other foods, including leftovers, cover dish but vent, stir, and rotate midway through time to eliminate cold spots, and let dish stand for 1 minute after microwaving to complete heating. Use an instant-read thermometer to check internal temperature. General rule for leftovers: 165°F in thickest part of dish.</p></list-item>

<title>Storing Leftovers Safely</title>
<list id="list6-1559827611430925" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Refrigerate leftovers promptly in clean containers or storage bags. At room temperature bacteria doubles approximately every 20 minutes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Date leftovers and use within a day or two.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>When in doubt, throw it out.</p></list-item>
