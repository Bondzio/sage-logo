<p>The purpose of this study was to characterize the toxicity potential of melamine (MEL), cyanuric acid (CYA), and a combination of MEL and CYA in broilers. A total of 720 commercial 1-day-old COBB 500 male broilers were randomly allotted into 6 groups with 6 replicates each and 20 broilers in each replicate. The dietary treatments were as follows: group I was the control group, group II included 10 mg/kg MEL and 3.3 mg/kg CYA, group III included 30 mg/kg MEL and 10 mg/kg CYA, group IV included 100 mg/kg MEL and 33.3 mg/kg CYA, group V included 100 mg/kg MEL, and group VI included 33.3 mg/kg CYA. The trial lasted for 42 days. CYA alone and the combination of MEL and CYA had adverse effects on the performance, but MEL alone had no effects on the performance. On day 21, the uric acid (UA) content of group IV was increased in serum (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05); on day 42, the serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity and the level of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-8 increased in group IV (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05); 100 mg/kg MEL alone increased the level of TNF-α and the rate of renal apoptosis (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05); and 33.3 mg/kg CYA alone increased the level of IL-8 and the rate of renal apoptosis (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The livers contained MEL concentrations of 17–125 μg/kg wet weight and CYA concentrations of 28–73 μg/kg, and the muscle contained MEL concentrations of 14–105 μg/kg wet weight. It was indicated that MEL alone, CYA alone, and a combination of MEL and CYA inhibit the growth and damage the kidney and liver.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Melamine (2,4,6-triamino-<italic>S</italic>-triazine [MEL]) is widely used in plastics, such as dinnerware. MEL is also used in fertilizers and is a metabolite of the pesticide cyromazine in plants and animals. However, it is added into feeds and foods because of its high nitrogen content (approximate 66.6%). In March 2007, some dogs and cats had become ill, even died, because of ingesting the contaminated MEL pet food in United States, and in 2008, thousands of babies had serious illness because of MEL contamination in infant formula in China.<sup>

</sup> The toxicity of MEL has been extensively evaluated. Pathologic studied in rat and dogs indicate that high doses of MEL have diuretic properties but do not produce renal toxicity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0960327111422405">3</xref>
</sup> Cyanuric acid (CYA) is structurally related to MEL and usually used as a stabilizer in outdoor swimming pools. CYA was also evaluated for acute, subchronic, and chronic toxicity in rat, mice, and dogs,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0960327111422405">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0960327111422405">5</xref>
</sup> inducing a series of similar effects with MEL and no indications of renal toxicity.</p>
<p>Individually MEL and CYA are relatively nontoxic.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0960327111422405">6</xref>
</sup> However, MEL and CYA in combination can form insoluble crystals that obstruct and damage renal tubules and are presumed to cause renal failure.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0960327111422405">7</xref>
</sup> In recalled pet food (cats and dogs), both MEL and CYA were identified. This may be the reason for acute renal failure in cats and dogs.</p>
<p>No data could be found for the potential toxicity of MEL and CYA in combination in livestock and poultry. Few studies were carried out to explore the toxicity of MEL and CYA alone or in combination at lower dose. The purpose of this study was to assess the toxicity of MEL and CYA alone and in combination when fed to broilers and describe any clinical pathologic changes or histologic lesions, thereby providing crucial information for evaluating the significance of the contaminants in the poultry feed.</p>

<title>Animals and diets</title>
<p>The study was approved by the Sichuan Agricultural University Animal Welfare Committee. The experiment was conducted using a total of 720 commercial 1-day-old Cobb 500 male broilers. Birds were randomly allotted by body weight (BW) to 6 groups with 6 replicates each and 20 broilers in each replicate. Broilers were housed in electrically heated, thermostatically controlled cages (100 × 200 cm) with fiberglass feeders and a 24-h constant light schedule. The birds were allowed ad libitum access to the experimental diets and tap water. The basal corn–soybean meal diets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0960327111422405">Table 1</xref>) were formulated to meet or exceed the requirements (NRC, 1994) for starter and grower broilers.</p>

<title>Sampling and processing procedure</title>
<p>Two broilers per replicate were selected (within mean ± 2SD) to collect blood, and then the birds were euthanized. Samples of kidney tissues were obtained for histologic examination. The above study protocol was approved by the Department of Animal Husbandry, Ministry of Agriculture of the People’s Republic of China.</p>

<title>Pathologic examination and the apoptosis (AR) of kidneys</title>
<p>Tissues from the center of right liver and the top of right kidneys were collected and fixed in 10% buffered formalin. Liver was sampled because toxicosis was suspected.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0960327111422405">8</xref>
</sup> Sections from fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histopathologic examination. All biopsies were examined by four investigators independently and in a blinded fashion. For each specimen, five histologic features were evaluated. The individual features of liver that were evaluated included (1) cell tumefaction; (2) fatty degeneration; (3) cell granular degeneration; (4) cell hemorrhage; and (5) vacuolus degeneration. The individual features of kidney that were evaluated included (1) dilated renal tubules; (2) small blood vessel expansion; (3) acute, interstitial, mononuclear cell infiltration; (4) interstitial hemorrhage; and (5) epithelial cell expansion. For each feature, the investigator indicated the degree of involvement with normal or no involvement, no serious pathological changes, and obvious or serious pathological changes.</p>
<p>On days 21 and 42, top sections of the left kidney were dissected and immediately minced with surgical scissors for the determination of the apoptosis rate (AR) of kidneys. The sections were smashed to cell suspension and filtered through a 300-mesh nylon mesh, washed twice with cold PBS, and then the cells were resuspended in 1× binding buffer (Cat. No. 51-66121E) at a concentration of 1 × 10<sup>

<title>Blood analysis</title>
<p>Blood samples (10 ml) were collected via wing vein. At the time of collection, the blood samples were collected in nonheparinized tube, which were centrifuged (3000<italic>g</italic>) for 10 min to obtain serum. Serum samples were analyzed for serum total protein, albumin, globulin, sodium (Na), potassium (K), uric acid (UA), creatinine (CRE) levels, and alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities using an automatic biochemical analyzer (TMS-1024i, USA).

, when the broilers were fed with MEL, CYA, and MEL and CYA diets for 42 consecutive days. Residues of MEL in liver and muscle of broiler increased following the increased MEL concentration in feed. MEL concentrations were 125 μg/kg wet weight and 111 μg/kg in liver and 105 μg/kg wet weight and 94 μg/kg in muscle, when the broilers were administered MEL alone (100 mg/kg diet) and MEL and CYA (100 and 33.3 mg/kg diet), respectively. There was no significant difference in MEL concentrations in liver and muscle between groups I, II, III, and VI (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). CYA residue was highest (73 μg/kg) in liver, when the broilers received CYA alone (33.3 mg/kg diet). However, the residues of CYA were not detected in the muscle of broilers.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this experiment, when adding MEL alone, no effects were observed. These results are in agreement with a study conducted by Yan et al. who reported that BWs and FI were not affected when fed the diet containing MEL alone in ducks.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0960327111422405">11</xref>
</sup> Lu et al. reported the similar results in broilers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0960327111422405">12</xref>
</sup> But when MEL was administered daily at 10 g/animal, 2 sheep developed anorexia and died at approximately 16 and 31 days, respectively.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0960327111422405">13</xref>
</sup> The difference between the finding in poultry and sheep may have been due to the level of MEL exposure. The exposure level in the broilers and ducks was lower.</p>
<p>There were few reports of studies examining the effects of CYA alone and the combination of MEL and CYA in livestock and fowl. In one study, cats receiving CYA alone, 2000 mg/kg, developed clinical signs of vomiting and anorexia within 24 h of exposure.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0960327111422405">6</xref>
</sup> This study demonstrates that adding CYA alone, during the phase days 1–21, FI and ADG were significantly decreased and F/G was significantly increased. In the group fed with MEL and CYA combination, FI, ADG, and F/G had no significant effects on day 21 (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05), exclusive of ADG of group II and F/G of group III. But the phase days 22–42 and days 1–42, no effects in treatments were observed on FI, ADG, and F/G. In pigs after feeding diets containing MEL and CYA, the food consumption and weight gain were decreased, and the mortality rates increased.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0960327111422405">14</xref>
</sup> We could speculate that CYA alone and the combination of MEL and CYA had adverse effects on performance, which was relating to the added dosage, duration of exposure, and animal species.</p>
<p>The toxicity of MEL and CYA have been reported to be low in some animal species. In one study, large doses of MEL given to dogs, rabbits, and rats reportedly had no significant clinical effects.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0960327111422405">3</xref>
</sup> The acute toxicity of MEL in rodents is reported with oral lethal dose 50 (LD50) of 3100 mg/kg (male rats) and 3 900 mg/kg (male mice).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0960327111422405">15</xref>
</sup> In dogs, dietary monosodium cyanurate given for 6 months at a concentration of 0.8% in diet did not result in ill effect or renal lesion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0960327111422405">4</xref>
</sup> In this study, no significant effects of serum chemistry parameters and pathologic section of kidney were observed in diets containing MEL alone and CYA alone. These results were in agreement with a study conducted by Puschner et al. who reported that MEL or CYA alone, even at high doses of 181 mg/kg MEL and 243 mg/kg CYA, did not have any effect on serum chemistry parameters and renal function in cats.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0960327111422405">6</xref>
</sup> Reimschuessel et al. reported that no changes in renal functions were observed in cats and fish treated with either MEL or CYA alone at doses of 181 or 400 mg/kg of BW.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0960327111422405">16</xref>
</sup> In our study, in the same time, histopathological assessment of liver revealed that MEL or CYA alone induced swelling or deformation in the liver cells. However, we did not know the mechanism of liver damage.</p>
<p>In recent studies, cats and rats feeding diet containing a mixture of MEL and CYA showed significantly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and CRE and clinical signs indicated acute renal failure and the presence of renal crystals.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0960327111422405">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0960327111422405">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0960327111422405">18</xref>
</sup> In our study, the serum UA level of group IV was significantly higher than the control group.</p>
<p>Histopathological assessment also revealed the swelling of renal epithelial cells. These results showed the kidney was slightly damaged. But this study did not show renal crystals in the kidneys, it is possible that species differences in renal physiology might have contributed to variable crystal precipitation. At the same time, the dose of MEL and CYA was lower than other studies.</p>
<p>After repeated dietary administration of high-dose MEL to rats and mice, the main toxic effects are calculi formation, inflammatory reactions, and hyperplasia in the urinary bladder.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0960327111422405">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0960327111422405">20</xref>
</sup> Puschner et al. also presumed that inflammation reactions and cell death had resulted in renal damage.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0960327111422405">6</xref>
</sup> In our study, on day 42, the IL-8, TNF-α level, and the rate of renal cell apoptosis in MEL alone group (exclude IL-8 level), CYA alone group, and the group IV were higher than the control group. To the authors’ knowledge, there are no reports of inflammatory factors and cell apoptosis studies examining MEL, CYA, and the combined effects of MEL and CYA in livestock and fowl. In the present study, these results confirmed the inflammatory reaction and renal cell apoptosis in broilers.</p>
<p>The carryover of MEL from animal feed to animal-derived products is an important subject for risk assessment purpose. Bermudez et al. indicated broilers were fed diets containing 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0% of MEL from 1 to 21 days of age. For the 3.0% dose group, MEL concentrations in pectoral muscle and liver were found to be 600 and 700 mg/kg, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0960327111422405">
21</xref></sup> In the study of Lu et al., lambs were fed diets containing 2–100 mg/kg MEL for 60 days. The maximum MEL concentrations in lamb tissues were 22–374 μg/kg in muscle and 21–412 μg/kg in liver.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0960327111422405">10</xref></sup> In the present study, MEL residues in liver and muscle of broiler increased following the increase in MEL concentration in feed. The maximum MEL concentrations were 125 μg/kg wet weight and 111 μg/kg in liver, and 105 μg/kg wet weight and 94 μg/kg in muscle, when the broilers were administered MEL alone (100 mg/kg diet) and MEL and CYA (100 and 33.3 mg/kg diet), respectively. None of the MEL concentrations exceeded the maximum permitted residue level (2.5 mg/kg in food) set by the US Food and Drug Administration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0960327111422405">
22</xref></sup> To the authors’ knowledge, there are few reports of residue studies of CYA in any animal species. This study demonstrated that the liver of the broilers receiving MEL alone, CYA alone, and the combination of MEL and CYA with CYA of 28–73 μg/kg. Puschner et al. indicated that cats were fed diet containing MEL and CYA and the kidney of the cats contained MEL and CYA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0960327111422405">
6</xref></sup> The CYA concentrations increased from 44 to 62 μg/kg in gluteal muscle and from 59 to 120 μg/kg in liver, when the lambs were fed diet containing 100 mg MEL and 100 mg CYA per kg diet.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0960327111422405">10</xref></sup> So, we suspected that a higher dose of CYA in the diet resulted in a higher concentration in tissue.</p>
<p>In summary, we evaluated the toxicity of MEL and CYA alone or in combination (a 3:1 mass ratio) at lower dose and the deposition of MEL and CYA in broilers. The results indicated that MEL alone, CYA alone, and a combination of MEL and CYA inhibit the growth and damage the kidney and liver. A higher dose of MEL and CYA in the diet resulted in more serious lesions. The livers contained MEL concentrations of 17–125 μg/kg wet weight and CYA concentrations of 28–73 μg/kg wet weight, and the muscles contained MEL concentrations of 14–105 μg/kg wet weight. Our study may provide some information for further work on the human health risk assessment of MEL and CYA toxicology.</p>
