<p>This month, the World Health Organization (WHO) released a “Report Card” on the work of Dr Margaret Chan during her first 6-year term as Director General. It is an impressive 18-page summary of the work of WHO during this period and the achievement of her personal goals as director general. The highlights of this period have included major advances in the delivery of vaccinations, reductions in child mortality, progress against HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria, and support for the tobacco control convention. In the early years of this century, the number of child deaths, almost all preventable, hovered around 10 to 11 million deaths annually. In the past 6 years, the number has begun to decline again and may now be as low as 7.6 million. This represents a substantial advance toward achieving the UN Millennium Development Goals related to children.</p>
<p>Dr Chan was a key mover in launching the Decade of Vaccines in 2010. As a part of this initiative, a number of vaccine manufacturers and drug companies increased supplies and reduced the prices of vaccines for the developing world. This included a 95% price reduction for the new rotavirus vaccines, which led to its addition to the WHO-recommended vaccination schedule, a decision supported by a Cochrane Review.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539512457625">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539512457625">2</xref></sup> Rotavirus vaccination has reduced child admissions to hospital by at least 70% in developed countries where it is in use. Although it has great potential to reduce child mortality further, so far it has not been incorporated into the vaccination programs of most countries in our region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539512457625">3</xref></sup> During 2010, estimated global coverage with the third dose of diphtheria–tetanus–pertussis vaccine (DTP3) reached the highest levels ever reported (85%). Coverage with the other routinely recommended childhood vaccines was 90% for BCG (Bacille Calmette-Guérin) vaccine, 86% for the third dose of poliovirus vaccine, 85% for measles vaccines, 75% for the third dose of hepatitis B vaccine, and 42% for the third dose of HIB (<italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> type B) vaccine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539512457625">4</xref></sup> These are impressive figures and are due, at least in part, to Dr Chan’s strong advocacy. Fund raising for global health programs is always difficult and even more so in the current economic climate, but in 2011 donors pledged more than $4 billion to support the work of the Global Alliance for Vaccination, an amount that exceeded expectations.</p>
<p>Soon after her appointment, Dr Chan pledged her support for the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. But the fight against the multinational corporations that peddle the deadly scourge of tobacco is difficult and requires ongoing vigilance. Tobacco remains the number one modifiable risk factor for chronic disease, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. WHO estimates that tobacco use, physical inactivity, unhealthy diets, and the harmful use of alcohol, are responsible for about 80% of coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539512457625">5</xref></sup> In our region, the largest country, People’s Republic of China, is reported to have 51% of males and 2% of females older than 15 years who are smokers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539512457625">5</xref></sup> This remains a huge challenge to public health.</p>
<p>On a recent trip to Indonesia, we were surprised to see that the Marlborough man is still riding down the streets of Bali. The original Marlborough cowboys became the best-known advertisement for international tobacco companies, but like many of their customers, they all died of tobacco-related disease. But there he was, a resurrected Marlborough man riding his horses and pushing his deadly poison to the unsuspecting masses of Indonesia. At the present time, the global tobacco industry is concerned about new public health restrictions on tobacco advertising and is mounting major court cases in Australia, Norway, Turkey, and Uruguay. The continuing support of WHO in this fight against the promotion of tobacco in our region is of great importance.</p>
<p>These are but a few of the public health issues that Dr Chan has championed in her first 6 years and they constitute an impressive list of achievements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539512457625">6</xref></sup> The <italic>Asia-Pacific Journal of Public Health</italic> and the Asia Pacific Academic Consortium for Public Health (APACPH) join in congratulating Dr Chan on her first term and wish her continuing success in her international role.</p>
<p>Now is the time to be packing your bags for the 44th APACPH Conference (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.apacph2012.org/">http://www.apacph2012.org/</ext-link>) to be held in October in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Your editors will be there and will participate in a workshop on writing papers. We hope to meet many of our authors at the conference and at the workshop to offer comments on your papers.</p>
<p>This month in the journal brings an array of articles from around our region that illustrate the diversity of the countries and public health problems in our region. We travel to Korea, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Pakistan, Nepal, Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines. The articles selected cover many public health issues, but with continuing emphasis on the public health management of chronic disease. We are confident that this selection will add to public health achievements, and we welcome your feedback and comments in letters to the editor.</p>
