<p>Welcome to the 20th Anniversary year of our journal.</p>
<p>In preparing this, it seemed appropriate to go back to that first issue and Editorial by Verena Tschudin and Geoffrey Hunt in March 1994. It began,
<disp-quote>
<p>Nursing and the related disciplines of midwifery, health visiting and rehabilitation are moving into a new era. The general crisis in health care across the developed world has presented the need for new structures, conceptual frameworks and attitudes. Inchoate solutions to the crisis are appearing in different forms—the market and industrial-style management, self-help and the growth of alternative and complementary therapies, the shift to community care, the professionalization of nursing, the return to home birth, new technologies, a new awareness of rights on the part of patients, a growing critique of the biomedical model—all have different and sometimes conflicting impacts on the caring professions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733012474881">1</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>In that first issue, there were articles on topics such as ethical reasoning relating to dementia care, the role and function of professional codes, ethics education, and ethical aspects of gender and sexuality in healthcare.</p>
<p>The Editorial and content of the articles are familiar and would not seem so out of place in a current issue with words such as “crisis,” the “market,” and the movement toward professionalization. Responses to the “need for new structures, conceptual frameworks and attitudes” can now be recognized as remaining a necessary direction of travel rather than some destination arrived at. Dementia care continues to be very much on the ethics agenda as does ethics education and professional codes. There are also some new challenges relating to globalization, increasing diversity, austerity measures, and reports of unethical practices.</p>
<p>We have also witnessed progress in healthcare ethics scholarship and research. There have been significant developments in care ethics (with another special issue on this theme in the coming year), virtue ethics, and in relation to the analysis of concepts such as dignity and compassion. There has also been much activity in empirical or descriptive ethics with qualitative work relating to the experiences of patients, family members, and practitioners. Often, this work gives voice to the perspectives of the most marginalized people in our societies. Quantitative work has demonstrated correlations between, for example, moral distress and the ethical climate of healthcare organizations, and gives an indication of practitioners’ moral sensitivity, development, and empathy levels.</p>
<p>To mark the beginning of our anniversary year, we have some special contributions from key scholars in our field, namely, Verena Tschudin, Chris Gastmans and colleagues in Belgium, Jan Storch and colleagues in Canada, and also from Marsha Fowler and Anne Davis in the United States. We also have, as is usual, a very rich range of research articles from around the world and details of forthcoming events.</p>
<p>Our journal has now grown from six to eight issues per year, and we can look forward to publishing even more high-quality articles. I hope you enjoy reading <italic>Nursing Ethics</italic> in our 20th anniversary year, and I would like to thank you for your ongoing contributions as authors, reviewers, and readers. It is through you that we continue to develop our field and ethical healthcare practice globally.</p>
<p>I end with a letter from two of our most respected scholars and friends:
<disp-quote>
<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>We want to take this opportunity to congratulate all of you who have been involved in making <italic>Nursing Ethics</italic> a resounding success. As the only nursing journal focusing specifically on ethics, it provides a rich resource for nurses around the world. Contributors coming from most parts of the globe enrich our understanding of what it means to be ethical and of factors that hinder our being ethical in practice. We look forward to the future of the journal with enthusiasm.</p>
