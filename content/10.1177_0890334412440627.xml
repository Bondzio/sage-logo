<abstract>
<p>The journey toward Baby-Friendly status at Jersey Shore University Medical Center in Neptune, NJ began with a desire to improve overall breastfeeding rates at the hospital. Although evidence showed that hospitals that incorporated some or all of the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding had improved breastfeeding rates, it was difficult to overcome barriers that prevented the hospital physicians and nursing staff from seeing the value in adopting this quality initiative. Long-standing practices combined with misinformation compounded the problem. That situation changed when several factors nationally and statewide came together to create a prime environment for implementation of the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative. This article will discuss the barriers that one hospital encountered and the strategies used to overcome these common barriers to achieving Baby-Friendly status. This hospital is not yet designated as Baby-Friendly but is awaiting the outcome of a site visit in 2012.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Breast milk provides the best medical outcomes for infants and mothers, including reduction of respiratory and gastrointestinal illness, necrotizing enterocolitis, and breast and ovarian cancers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334412440627">1</xref></sup> Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data show that 75.3% of infants born in New Jersey hospitals receive breast milk in the first 2 days of life, which falls short of the Healthy People (HP) 2020 goal. By 6 months of life, exclusive breastfeeding rates are only 10.3%, well below the HP 2020 goal of 25.5%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0890334412440627">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0890334412440627">3</xref></sup> Most United States maternity care centers fail to support breastfeeding with evidence-based practices outlined by the World Health Organization’s “Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding” according to the 2009 National Survey of Maternity Practices in Infant Nutrition and Care (mPINC); even fewer hospitals have Baby-Friendly designation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0890334412440627">4</xref></sup> As of January 2012, New Jersey had no Baby-Friendly hospitals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0890334412440627">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The HP 2020 goals call for an increase in the number of US Baby-Friendly hospitals from the current 4% to 8%, yet the path to Baby-Friendly status proves difficult for many hospitals. This article discusses some of the challenges that Jersey Shore University Medical Center (JSUMC) in Neptune, New Jersey, faced in the journey toward the final phase of Baby-Friendly designation, and how these challenges were addressed.</p>
<p>Jersey Shore University Medical Center (JSUMC) is a level III regional perinatal center with 27 maternity beds and 21 neonatal intensive care beds. The quest for Baby-Friendly status began when the medical center became the first hospital in the state to implement the Family-Centered Maternity Care concept in 1991. With this concept came the conversion of the traditional maternity unit to one in which mothers and babies were encouraged to stay together in the same room, with minimal interruptions, from delivery to discharge. Under the influential leadership of the maternity unit’s nurse manager, the hospital began to incorporate some of the concepts into daily practice. For example, crib cards from formula companies were eliminated in favor of hospital designed crib cards. Tape measures branded with formula names were also discarded; instead, we purchased from another manufacturer that did not violate the WHO International Code of Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes. Formula representatives were restricted from coming to the hospital unless they had an appointment with the manager for a specific purpose. By 2002, our hospital was exploring the possibility of becoming Baby-Friendly designated. Attitudes, misinformation, culture, and long-standing practices made it difficult for the maternity clinical staff to accept the concepts of the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative. Despite these obstacles, the maternity department continued to modify practices slowly over time, and by 2009, many of the “Ten Steps” were already in place. With support from the hospital president and chief nurse executive, the determination to become Baby-Friendly certified was included as a top strategic goal for the hospital.</p>
<p>In 2010, JSUMC had an opportunity to apply for a grant from the New Jersey chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. We were informed that the New Jersey Chapter received funding via the State of New Jersey from the CDC Communities Putting Prevention to Work (CPPW) to assist the state in achieving the Healthy People 2020 goals of increasing the proportion of births occurring at Baby-Friendly designated hospitals. Every birthing facility in New Jersey was encouraged to apply for this grant; however, Jersey Shore University Medical Center was 1 of only 10 hospitals that were awarded the funding through a highly competitive process. As the recipient of this grant, we participated in the New Jersey Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (NJBFHI), which included monthly technical assistance calls, networking, collaborative summits, and auditing tools. The NJBFHI was invaluable in creating the momentum needed to rapidly move us through the phases required for Baby-Friendly designation. The NJBFHI—a highly publicized statewide project—reinforced the importance of the Initiative for our administration.</p>

<title>Physician Education</title>
<p>In 2009, we realized that physician education would be a daunting challenge, since the literature shows that physicians are often unfamiliar with how to give appropriate breastfeeding support and management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0890334412440627">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0890334412440627"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0890334412440627">8</xref></sup> We began by giving continuing medical education presentations for the OB/GYN and pediatric physicians, allowing opportunities to voice concerns and views. Many were apprehensive about the risk of inducing guilt in their patients if breastfeeding was actively promoted and supported in the maternity unit. To alleviate this concern, we employed our patient representative, who follows up all patients by phone after discharge to assess satisfaction of care, to conduct a short survey on patients’ perception of breastfeeding support. In the survey, we asked postpartum mothers how they chose to feed their babies; if they chose infant formula, we asked whether they felt “guilty” or “less supported” by the health care team for their feeding choice. Out of the 106 mothers surveyed, no mothers stated that they were made to feel guilty by staff for their feeding choices. These data were presented to both the OB/GYN and pediatric physicians at subsequent meetings, and the subject of guilt did not come up again.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0890334412440627">
<title>Skin-to-Skin Care</title>
<p>Some nursing staff hesitated to practice skin-to-skin care, fearing that it would place infants at risk for hypothermia if a radiant warmer was not used. The evidence supporting skin-to-skin care was presented at in-services held for both the day and night shift. These in-services sparked the interest of some nurse pioneers to try skin-to-skin care. Simultaneously, OB physicians enthusiastically supported the process by placing infants skin-to-skin with their mothers immediately after birth. The effects of skin-to-skin care were immediately apparent: infants did not get hypothermic, most breastfed within an hour, and they maintained breastfeeding success the following day. Our nursing staff perceived how skin-to-skin care positively affected their workflow in many ways, as mothers demonstrated fewer problems breastfeeding during their hospital stay and required less nursing time devoted to lactation management. They could also complete other tasks, such as charting, while the baby was on the mother’s chest. Finally, based on weekly patient interviews by the nurse manager, most mothers remarked on the bonding effects of skin-to-skin care, which boosted patient satisfaction and staff morale. Through word of mouth, experiences with skin-to-skin care spread among the staff, and compliance rapidly increased. We monitored our compliance by revising our nursing computer documentation to include skin-to-skin data on the newborn admission form. In May 2010, we reported our skin-to-skin data as 0%, since skin-to-skin care was not previously a nursing practice at our hospital. By December 2010, compliance with this practice improved to over 85%. This is a testament to the fact that long-standing hospital practices can be modified to incorporate current evidence-based standards of care.</p>

<sec id="section4-0890334412440627">
<title>Rooming-In</title>
<p>Many health care providers tending to postpartum mothers believe that separating the infant from the mother helps the mother to recover after a delivery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0890334412440627">9</xref></sup> However, mother-infant separation carries no benefit in the mother’s recovery from birth and may actually impede breastfeeding success.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0890334412440627">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0890334412440627">11</xref></sup> Dispelling the perceived need for mother-infant separation proved to be a difficult challenge. We addressed the challenge by using the in-service teaching model once more, again drawing from the volumes of evidence to support this practice. At the same time, we educated parents in their prenatal registration packets and prenatal classes about rooming-in. Rooming-in education was also given on admission: nurses assured the mother that she would not be separated from her baby except for emergencies or procedures, and that she would receive help any time it was needed during the hospital stay. We found that education of the staff and patients established the foundation for full implementation of the practice.</p>
<p>Traditional hospital practices commonly encourage mother-baby separation by creating nurseries that allow for public viewing of infants through glass windows. However, we shielded our nursery’s public view by pulling down the horizontal blinds. Doing so conveyed the message to everyone that infants were expected to stay with their mothers, not with their nurses. It also prevented open displays of patient names (posted in bassinets), respecting patients’ right to privacy. Finally, we began to call the nursery the “neonatal observation unit.” The idea of changing the name of the nursery has been successfully used by other Baby-Friendly Hospitals to promote rooming-in. In changing the expectation of the nursery’s function, we successfully modified hospital practices toward one that is evidence-based and in compliance with the “Ten Steps.” Currently, more than 80% of our patients room-in.</p>

<title>Culturally Compassionate Care</title>
<p>Jersey Shore University Medical Center captures patients from both Monmouth and Ocean Counties, with over 1.2 million residents total.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0890334412440627">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0890334412440627">13</xref></sup> Lakewood, the fastest-growing town in the state and located in Ocean County, is home to an emerging Orthodox Jewish community.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0890334412440627">14</xref></sup> JSUMC’s patient demographic is changing to reflect the increase in Orthodox Jewish mothers electing to deliver at our facility. In 2011, 13.4% of our maternity patients declared Judaism as their religion. With this change came many differences in patient needs during postpartum care.</p>
<p>Since it was apparent that our staff needed education, we began by first collaborating with our hospital’s specialty patient liaison to the Orthodox Jewish community. She assisted us in educating the staff about the religious beliefs of this community, which included a high awareness of the importance of breastfeeding. She also helped us conduct a small survey in which we asked Orthodox Jewish mothers what their “cultural norm” is after delivery of an infant. Since religious beliefs restrict family planning, mothers may have many children, heightening the need for recovery after delivery. In response to this information, we attended a Lakewood community event and discussed the benefits of rooming-in and exclusive breastfeeding. We also provided a forum for mothers to discuss what their expectations are of our facility in regard to postpartum care and breastfeeding support. We have made some progress in understanding the cultural differences in our patients and have adapted our education accordingly; the nurses and hospital staff receive additional training time to provide education in a more culturally sensitive manner while also maintaining patients’ views of their cultural norms. Reinforcing among staff that support for choice is paramount for culturally compassionate care has greatly assisted in creating a hospital experience that meets the patient’s expectations for care while providing vital information on feeding choices and preserving the philosophy of the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative.</p>

<sec id="section6-0890334412440627">
<title>Summary</title>
<p>In our experience, changing the culture and attitudes of people requires time and determination to assimilate new processes into practice, as the process of becoming Baby-Friendly was a slow drift from traditional methods of care to evidence-based, and often unfamiliar, practices. Today’s patients expect to receive competent medical care from skilled professionals, but what they remember is the supportive, nurturing hospital environment that is focused on their needs and expectations. This journey toward Baby-Friendly designation is enabling us to fulfill our ultimate obligation to practice evidence-based medicine so that our families have the best possible start. The strategies we used to address our challenges can be applied to other hospitals that are seeking Baby-Friendly Hospital designation or are implementing the “Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding.”</p>
