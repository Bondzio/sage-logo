<abstract>
<p>This article uses the layer-by-layer self-assembly method to fabricate multilayer film on poly(ethylene terephthalate) substrate. The hydrolization of poly(ethylene terephthalate) film was primarily performed with sodium hydroxide aqueous solution to produce a carboxyl-enriched surface. The multilayer films were fabricated by the alternate adsorption of the oppositely charged poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) and silver nanoparticles on poly(ethylene terephthalate) substrate. The assembly process was monitored by UV–VIS spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma. The surface topography and chemical composition of the self-assembly films was characterized by atomic force microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The images indicated that the silver nanoparticles were successfully assembled and well distributed on the substrate. Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the presence of metallic silver on the poly(ethylene terephthalate) substrate. The thermal properties of the multilayer films were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis and dynamic mechanical analyser. The results revealed that the storage modulus of ten-bilayer films decreases with temperature increasing and the glass transition temperature of ten-bilayer films have been found to be 99.3°C, whereas it is 94.8°C for the original poly(ethylene terephthalate) film.</p>

<p>The nanoparticles/polymer nanocomposites with functionality and high performance have attracted more attention owing to its exhibit noticeably improved properties than pure polymers, such as mechanical properties, flame retardancy, electrical conductivity, barrier performance and optical properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684412457101">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731684412457101">4</xref></sup> Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) film as an unique functional material are widely used in solar cells, anti-reflective film, conductive film, sensor, medical antibacterial material etc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684412457101">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684412457101">9</xref></sup> However, the homogeneous dispersion of nanoparticles and particle/matrix interface adhesion are always the major problem for preparing a polymer nanocomposite. Many methods have been employed to overcome such difficulties, including sol–gel processing, spray deposition, in situ polymerization, electroless plating and layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly.<sup>10–12</sup> Among them, the LBL self-assembly is still the most effective, simple, feasible and thickness controllable.</p>
<p>The LBL self-assembly technology has been of great interest since the method was presented by Decher in 1991.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731684412457101">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731684412457101">14</xref></sup> The technique permits the construction of multilayer films on charged substrates by sequential adsorption of oppositely charged species from an aqueous solutions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731684412457101">15</xref></sup> This technology has appeared as a promising method for the modification of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) film to impart new properties. Several groups have reported the fabrication of multilayer films on PET substrate via LBL self-assembly. Fu et al. treated aminolyzed PET film with chitosan-nanosilver and heparin by alternative deposited to construct antiadhesive and antibacterial multilayer films.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731684412457101">16</xref></sup> Fujimto et al. fabricated conductive multilayer films on PET by alternative adsorbed poly(allyamine hydrochloride) and poly(aniline).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731684412457101">17</xref></sup> Su et al. have carried out flexible NH<sub>3</sub> gas sensors by self-assembly of polypyrrole on PET substrates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731684412457101">18</xref></sup> Xu and co-workers have also developed anti-biofouling multilayers on PET film through the combination of self-assembly and michael addition reaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0731684412457101">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this paper, the LBL self-assembly technology was used to improve the thermal properties of PET film. The PET film was firstly hydrolyzed in an alkaline solution to introduce carboxyl groups, then the charged PET film was used as a substrate to sequentially adsorb AgNPs and poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) by LBL self-assembly method. The multilayer films were characterized by UV–vis, inductively coupled plasma (ICP), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Moreover, the thermal properties of the multilayer films were also investigated.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0731684412457101" sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title>
<p>The PET film was obtained from Dupont with a thickness of 150 µm. An aqueous solution of poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA, Aldrich, Mw = 100,000–200,000 g/mol, 20 wt.% in water) was diluted to 2 mg/ml with 0.5 M NaCl aqueous solution. All the chemicals were of analytic grade and were used without further purification. Double distilled water was used for all cleaning steps and as the solvent for the adsorption.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0731684412457101"><title>Preparation of the colloidal silver particles</title>
<p>In a typical experiment, colloidal silver particles were prepared by dropwise addition of NaBH<sub>4</sub> solution (50.0 mM, 1.0 mL) to an aqueous solution of AgNO<sub>3</sub> (0.1 mM, 100 mL) in the presence of trisodium citrate (0.3 mM) under vigorous stirring. The colloidal silver particles were obtained and aged for 2 hours prior to use.<sup>20</sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0731684412457101"><title>Multilayer assembly on PET substrates</title>
<p>The alternating assembly of the multilayer on PET substrate was prepared as follows. Firstly, the clean membranes were dipped into an aqueous solution of 1 mol/l NaOH at 70°C for 30 min to obtain surface-hydrolyzed PET films. Then the hydrolyzed PET substrate was immersed into PDDA solution for 10 min and rinsed with water, the modified substrate was dried with gentle stream of nitrogen. As a result, the surface charge of the PET substrate was reversed to positive. The positively charged PET substrate was immerged into the oppositely charged colloidal silver for 10 min and rinsed with water. After each layer deposition, substrate samples were rinsed with water. The adsorption and rinsing steps were repeated until the desired number of bilayers was obtained.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0731684412457101"><title>Characterization of the multilayer films</title>
<p>Transmission electron microscope measurement was carried out by using TEM (JEM-2100F, Japan). Zeta potential measurements were measured on a Zetasizer Nano ZS instrument (Malvern, UK). The UV-vis Spectrum in this paper was obtained using U-4100 (Hitachi, Japan). Surface morphologies of the self-assembled films were observed using AFM (NanoScope <italic>χ</italic>, Veeco, America). XPS measurements were performed on a PHI 5000C ESCA system with Mg Kα source at 14.0 KV and 25 mA (Perkin-Elmer, America). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed by thermal gravimetric (TG209F1, NETZSCH, Germany) at a heating rate of 10°C/min under nitrogen. The gas flow rate was 20 ml/min. The tensile modulus was determined by dynamic mechanical analysis (Q800, TA Instruments, America). Samples used in dynamic mechanical analyser (DMA) have been into the size of 20 mm in length and 5 mm in width. The temperature ranges from 35°C to 160°C. The heating ramp rate was 2°C/min for all temperature scan tests. Frequency of oscillations was fixed at 1 Hz and strain amplitude 0.01 mm within the linear viscoelastic region.</p>

<p>The electrostatic properties of the AgNPs and PDDA solutions have been studied by determination of their zeta potential. The opposite charges of the two solutions were confirmed by dynamic light scattering with values of: −17 mv for colloidal silver particles and +55 mv for PDDA solution. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684412457101">Figure 1(a)</xref> shows the TEM images of AgNPs in colloid solution. As can be seen, the image observations revealed that the AgNPs are spherical shape with diameter ranging from 20 to 30 nm. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684412457101">Figure 1(b)</xref> shows the size distribution by intensity of AgNPs in prepared silver sol. It was found that the width of hump was narrow, which demonstrates that the AgNPs have very good monodispersity.

<sec id="sec9-0731684412457101"><title>UV-vis analysis</title>
<p>The regularities of the multilayer deposition could be monitored by the UV-vis spectroscopy. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684412457101">Figure 2(a)</xref> shows the absorption spectra of the (PDDA/AgNPs)n multilayers film on PET film with <italic>n</italic> = 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10. The spectra of the multilayers exhibited an absorbance at 410 nm can be seen and increased with the increase of the number of bilayers. The inset photograph shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of AgNPs and PDDA in solution. The AgNPs has a characteristic absorption peak at 395 nm in accordance with the literature report, while the solution of PDDA has no current response in this region.<sup>20</sup> Therefore, the multilayers exhibited an absorption peak at 410 nm due to the adsorption of AgNPs. In addition, the absorption peak of AgNPs on multilayers was red-shifted compared to the silver sol due to the interaction between AgNPs and PDDA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684412457101">21</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684412457101">Figure 2(b)</xref> shows the relationship of absorbance at 410 nm with the number of layers. The absorbance was almost linearly increased with the number of layers, which suggests a regular deposition of the film.

<sec id="sec10-0731684412457101"><title>ICP measurement</title>
<p>Silver content in multilayer films was tested by ICP method. Sample solutions were prepared by dissolving 1 g films into 0.1 mol/dm<sup>3</sup> nitric acid. The relationship between silver content and layer number of multilayer films is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684412457101">Figure 3</xref>. It can be seen from the graph that the silver content in the multilayer films increased linearly with the increase of the layers. The result shows that the silver content has a good agreement with the absorbency of the multilayer films at 410 nm, which is mainly because there are more AgNPs in the multilayer films with the increase of the layers. Besides, we can see from the graph that there are less silver nanoparticles when assemble the advanced two layers, which is because the electric charge is asymmetrical on the film surface, and the surface is not smooth and with nanoscale holes, which has effects on AgNPs.

<sec id="sec11-0731684412457101"><title>Morphology of multilayer films</title>
<p>The change of surface morphology of the multilayers film was revealed by AFM image. The AFM images of PET films before and after coated with a ten-bilayer PDDA/AgNPs film are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684412457101">Figure 4(a) and (b)</xref> (both 2D and 3D are shown). Compared with the smoothness of original PET film, the surface of the multilayers film was roughened. The roughness was uniformly spread across wide area and the topography looks like rolling hills. Moreover, the nanoparticles are spread relatively homogeneously on the polymer surface because the three citric acid radical provide the barrier for particle agglomeration (shown as the white arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684412457101">Figure 4(b)</xref>).

<p>The chemical state of the silver on the PET substrate was investigated by XPS. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684412457101">Figure 5</xref> shows the wide scan and Ag 3d spectra of the multilayer films. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684412457101">Figure 5(a) and (b)</xref> show the XPS wide scan spectra of the PET film before and after coated ten-bilayer PDDA/AgNPs, respectively.

The other peaks at 284.8 eV and 533.9 eV are assigned to C1s and O1s. The strong signal of Ag at binding energy of about 372.9 eV indicated that the silver element have been effectively adsorbed on PET substrates. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684412457101">Figure 5(c)</xref> shows the Ag3d electron spectra for the self-assembly films presented two signal peaks with the binding energy of 368.3 eV (Ag3d5/2) and 374.3 eV (Ag3d3/2), and the spin energy separation of the 3d doublet was 6.0 eV. These peaks attributable to the Ag<sup>0</sup> species confirmed the silver presence on the self-assemblied films surface as metallic state.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731684412457101">22</xref></sup>

<sec id="sec13-0731684412457101"><title>Thermogravimetry analysis</title>
<p>To study thermal stability and silver loading of PET films before and after depositing, TGA was performed in air atmosphere with a heating rate of 20°C/min. Thermogravimetry (TG) and derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) curves of original and ten-bilayer AgNPs-coated PET films are showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684412457101">Figure 6</xref>. TG curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684412457101">Figure 6(a)</xref>, weight loss starts at 370°C and the weight residue at 500°C is 0.5%. This indicates that the thermal degradation of PET sample occurs at 370°C, and with temperature increasing, decomposition is gradually translated to ruleless disconnection of chain and volatilization of organic fraction, ending at 500°C. The result illuminates that the decomposition of PET films before depositing is much complete. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684412457101">Figure 6(b)</xref>, there is also weight loss step as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684412457101">Figure 6(a)</xref>, with the only difference being that the remainder contents is 10.4% at 500°C, because the AgNPs cannot volatilize during the temperature range. It can be deduced that the weight content of deposited AgNPs is about 9.9% on PET films. According to the DTG curves, PET samples undergoe single stage degradation with a single peak at around 450°C. The maximum decomposition temperature for the pure PET occurs at 451.5°C, whereas the ten-bilayer AgNPs-coated PET occurs at 457.3°C. This was due to the existence of inorganic AgNPs on PET films, which can act as a mass transport barrier between the PET films and the heat source during the degradation process.

From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684412457101">Figure 7</xref>, it is observed that the storage modulus of the original and coated PET decreases with increasing temperature due to the softness of these films. The value of storage modulus for PET decreases from 2064 to 214 MPa as temperature increases from 35°C to 160°C, whereas the value of storage modulus for ten-bilayer AgNPs-coated PET decreases from 2301 to 371 MPa within the same temperature range. This result reveals that the value of storage modulus increases after AgNPs coating on PET film. This change is due to the presence of the AgNPs which raises the stiffness of the PET film.

This Figure shows that the value of Tan δ initially increases with temperature due to the increase in loss modulus of material. As the material undergoes softening at higher temperature, the heat dissipates into the material thus decreasing the elastic response, which increases the value of Tan δ up to maximum. After that, the glassy phase starts to disappear and rubbery phase appears, then Tan δ radically decreases. Temperature corresponding to the peak of Tan δ is known as glass transition temperature (Tg).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731684412457101">23</xref></sup> It is observed that Tg of PET film is 94.8°C, whereas Tg of ten-bilayer AgNPs-coated PET films is found to be 99.3°C. The results clearly show that the value of Tg has been increased after coating AgNPs on PET films. The increase of the rigidity allowed the decrease of the PET chain mobility, which explains the shift of the Tg to higher temperature in the modified film.</p>

<p>The sequential adsorption of oppositely charged polyelectrolyte and nanoparticles by LBL self-assembly is an efficient method for obtaining thin multilayer films. The absorbance and concentration of AgNPs on multilayer films was increased with the increase of the number of bilayers. The morphology and chemical composition of the multilayer films was characterized by AFM and XPS. The results confirmed that the AgNPs were successfully assembled and well distributed on the PET substrates. The thermal property of the self-assembled films was investigated by TGA and DMA. The TGA and DTG curves indicated that the remainder content and the maximum decomposition temperature of the ten-bilayer AgNPs-coated PET films are all higher than original PET film. The DMA curves revealed that the storage modulus of the original and coated PET decreases with temperature increasing, the Tg of ten-bilayer films have been found to be 99.3°C, whereas the original PET film is 94.8°C. From the above results, we can conclude that the thermal properties of the AgNPs-coated PET films have been improved.</p>
