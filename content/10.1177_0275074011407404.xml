<p>The topic of the article is practice theory. Using a detailed example from public administration, we first discus the shortcomings of the model of practice as applied knowledge that we have dubbed the Received View. The first half of the article is a chronology of successive adaptations of the Received View. These adaptations have gradually brought the Received View more in accordance with the practice-oriented critique in social theory and research of recent years. These adaptations fall short, however, of offering a theoretical account that explains the relationships among practice, knowledge, and context. These adaptations do not enable us to show, as we wish to do, how knowledge and context can be explained in terms of—and are evoked within—practice, and not the other way round—and that this transpires within real worlds each of which has its own unique constraints and affordances, histories and futures. In the second half of the article, we pick up on a relational conception of practice, knowledge, and context in which practice is distinct and primary. To develop this aspect of practice theory, we make use of some key concepts from modern Japanese philosophy. The nondualist posture of Japanese philosophy gives rise to a useful conceptualization of the dynamic and fluid relationships among practice, the characteristics of the situation at hand, and the epistemic elements of practice itself. In this final section, we introduce three concepts that help capture this dynamic, relational understanding of practice: “actionable understanding,” “ongoing business,” and “the eternally unfolding present.”</p>

<title>Introduction: Practice and Knowledge of the World—the Received View</title>
<p>What is it that people—both professionals and lay people—do when they find themselves in situations that need to be resolved, or in routine situations that need to be carried forward effectively? How do they go about doing this? And how can we account for the fact that under ordinary circumstances people usually manage to arrive at a course of action that is acceptable to themselves and others? More broadly, what do people do when they engage in practice? Roughly speaking, by practice we mean any kind of activity the meaning of which (including the purpose) is derived from a given context. Scratching your ear is not a practice. Bricklaying, teaching, playing football, and brain surgery are.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0275074011407404">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Perhaps the most common way this is characterized—what we call the Received View—is that when people engage in an activity, they articulate the situation that confronts them as a particular kind of problem, after which they apply the relevant knowledge (including rules, procedures, and so on) that enable them to solve the problem. In this view, the knowledge people hold in their heads enables the activities that lead to the resolution of the problem. Thus, it is commonly said that knowledge is <italic>applied</italic> in practice. Professionals can be distinguished from lay people in that they have acquired through training a body of tested and proven specialized knowledge that enables them to resolve problems in their given field (an ability typically beyond the reach of those who are not professionals in that field). So, for example, an administrator in a child care office is understood to use her specialized training in social work, child services, and family law, to deal with the complex issues of a neglected child in a dysfunctional family.</p>
<p>But neither is the reality of experience always that simple nor as we well know is the model of practice as applied specialized knowledge sufficient to account for all that social theorists and social scientists have come to find important about understanding, assessing, and improving practice. It is our aim in this article to address this gap, in no small measure by reconceptualizing the relationship between knowledge and practice.</p>
<p>Why do we need such a reconceptualization in the first place? Clearly, we are all practitioners of some competence in one field or another and we are well aware how our understanding derives from our practical doings in world. This point has been very well made by authors in various fields. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0275074011407404">Greg Stolcis (2004)</xref>, an experienced administrator, in an article argues for the primacy of practitioner experience in public administration, writes: “(Our experiences) are an accumulations of jobs we have performed, tasks we have accomplished, roles we have assumed, skills we have acquired, and decisions (and the resulting consequences!) we have made” (p. 364). So, why belabor the obvious? The answer is that precisely because we are competent practitioners, we <italic>assume</italic> that the relationship between knowledge and practice is obvious and clear. We intuit it, yet we often do so without having a clear understanding of exactly how knowledge and practice mutually shape each other and enable us to move about effectively in a world of uncertainty and complexity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0275074011407404">Stolcis (2004)</xref>, for example, continues his observation by saying: “(E)perience is active and engaged participation in events or activities that lead to the accumulation of applicable knowledge and skills.” This is beautifully put, but nowhere does he specify <italic>how</italic> active participation results in knowledge. This has typically been taken for granted.</p>
<p>But isn’t it the whole point of practice that we don’t need such an intellectual understanding to perform some skilled activity? In fact, the common genre in practice writing is to present a case and point out its actionable features (situatedness, interaction, embodied values, the flow of action, narrative, background knowledge, and so on) that enable the actors to bring the situation to a satisfying conclusion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0275074011407404">2</xref></sup> Numerous writings have brought us valuable insights into the importance of practice and have done a great deal to erode the Received View of practice as explicable wholly in terms of applied knowledge. However, our understanding of how exactly practice, as a distinct phenomenon, generates knowledge and how knowledge functions within practice is underdeveloped. That is, the fact that part of what we know is generated in the course of practice is now well-documented; however, the various theoretical accounts of why this is the case is yet to be generally accepted by scholars, including within public administration and public policy analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0275074011407404">3</xref></sup> Accordingly, we argue in this article that it is useful to unpack the relationships among knowing, practice, and context in a way that explicitly addresses such questions. Most practice is a complex blend of what we know brought to bear on situations that require skillful acting—situations that need to be sustained or improved. To approach such situations, for example, as calling only for knowledge (practically applied) or as entailing acting construed simply as intuitive (with some knowledge tacked on), too often fails to shed light on the issues these questions point to.</p>
<p>To explore the relationships among acting, knowing, and context, we have divided the article in two parts. The first half of the article is a rough chronology of the successive adaptations of the Received View of practice as applied knowledge. These adaptations gradually brought the Received View more in accordance with the practice-oriented critique in social theory and research of recent years. We will show that these adaptations are important, but argue that they fall short of offering a satisfying theoretical account that explains the relationship of practice, knowledge, and context. In fact, these adaptations do not enable us to show, as we wish to do, how knowledge and context can be explained in terms of—and are evoked within—practice, and not the other way round—and that this transpires within real worlds each of which has its own unique constraints and affordances, histories, and futures. In the second half of the article, we pick up on what we think is an essential element needed in the reformulation of the Received View: a relational conception of practice, knowledge, and context in which practice is distinct and primary. To develop this aspect of practice theory, we make use of some key concepts from modern Japanese philosophy. To our mind, the nondualist posture of Japanese philosophy gives rise to a provocative and useful conceptualization of the dynamic and fluid relationships among practice, the characteristics of the situation at hand, and the epistemic elements of practice itself. And it does so in ways largely missed by much Western philosophy. In this final section, we introduce three concepts that help capture this dynamic, relational understanding of practice: “actionable understanding,” “ongoing business,” and “the eternally unfolding present.”</p>
<p>Let’s, in conformance with the genre, anchor our argument in an example. For two reasons we have chosen an example from public administration. First, public administration (similar to planning and public policy) is a profession <italic>par excellence</italic> where issues of action, value, knowledge, and personal engagement are entangled in answering the ever present question: What is the right thing to do in this situation? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0275074011407404">Wagenaar, 2004</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0275074011407404">4</xref></sup> Second, although there is a small but important literature that aims to acknowledge public administration’s inherently actionable, value-laden character from a pragmatist perspective, much of the doctrine and theory of public administration is deeply affected by the Cartesian conception of certain, procedurally and analytically derived, knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0275074011407404">Evans, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0275074011407404">Harmon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0275074011407404">Miller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0275074011407404">Shields, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0275074011407404">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0275074011407404">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0275074011407404">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0275074011407404">Stolcis, 2004</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0275074011407404">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>What follows is a protocol of an actual conversation between a department head and a detective in an urban police vice squad in a mid-size town in the Netherlands (we will return to this example later in this article). The conversation concerns how to classify and file a new case that has just come in.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Department Head:</speaker>
<p>Then there is rape here. . . . it comes from the police in The Hague. They have a girl from [the town of X].</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Detective:</speaker>
<p>We’re talking of rape here?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Department Head:</speaker>
<p>Yes. I checked it in the DPS [the Information System]. It shows she is 12, in juvenile care, and problems and everything. So it’s clear that this is a problem girl. And she would like to talk about a rape that maybe took place a few years ago. The city of [Y] will do the intake interview.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Detective:</speaker>
<p>Oh, so they will do the intake interview?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Department Head:</speaker>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Detective:</speaker>
<p>I always find that hard when someone calls, then now how do we find out who has the case—if you know what I mean.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Department Head:</speaker>
<p>Yeah, no one has it, so—</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Detective:</speaker>
<p>Yes, exactly. If you would assign the case now—</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Department Head:</speaker>
<p>Well, yes. I made an annotation so that whatever happens . . . it doesn’t come out of the blue.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Detective:</speaker>
<p>No, exactly. No, fine. But then I’m thinking, should I delete the case completely [from the registration system] or shouldn’t I? And just wait until something happens and then—</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Department Head:</speaker>
<p>Whatever you like.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Detective:</speaker>
<p>No, but how will you ever locate the case when somebody calls about it?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Department Head:</speaker>
<p>Yes, well, yes, you’ll see that there is an annotation already. Then you would have to check your work list for the annotation number. So if you search for her name, then she’ll pop up.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Detective:</speaker>
<p>Yes. Yes exactly. OK. Then I’ll just remove it.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Department Head:</speaker>
<p>Or you just put it in holding mode, these kinds of cases—</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Detective:</speaker>
<p>Yeah, that’s also possible.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Department Head:</speaker>
<p>. . . think about it . . . because there is another case coming in.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Detective:</speaker>
<p>Yeah. OK. That’s why I was wondering what I should do.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Department Head:</speaker>
<p>So you’ll put this one in holding mode?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Detective:</speaker>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Department Head:</speaker>
<p>Then what? . . .</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Detective:</speaker>
<p>. . . You know what’s likely to happen? If someone calls, then I’ll fill out a new form and before you know it I have registered the case twice. Does that make sense?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Department Head:</speaker>
<p>But in that case, I need to adjust the annotation or make a new annotation that the case is now in holding mode.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Detective:</speaker>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Department Head:</speaker>
<p>That’s a bit complicated</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Detective:</speaker>
<p>And it’s hard to get the big picture.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Detective:</speaker>
<p>I think if I don’t make an annotation for this case and that colleague calls again, it would be awkward. “Oh, I really don’t know [how to find it].” I always find that such a stupid answer.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Department Head:</speaker>
<p>No, precisely.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Detective:</speaker>
<p>OK, then I will do it.</p>
</speech>
<p>What is going on in this conversation may very well seem confusing—and not only to those conducting it. And the primary tool the Received View, the contention that practice is applied knowledge, offers little help in resolving the confusion or accounting for what the department head and the detective in fact accomplish in the exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0275074011407404">Figure 1</xref>). Typically, a diagnosis of such a conversation from the Received View would identify a need for more knowledge to resolve the confusion and enable effective practice. This could include knowledge about the actual situation, the relevant administrative procedures, the scope and aims of enabling policy mandates, and so on. More knowledge is also frequently identified as necessary for better policy implementation, evaluation, and redrafting (one could even imagine a consultant suggesting the introduction of a computerized case-tracking system and “knowledge base” in this situation). However, such knowledge is not always easy or possible to get, and when got, seems often to leave important parts of the world underilluminated and the route to effective practice obscure.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0275074011407404">Figure 2</xref> below represents the relationship between knowledge and practice at the core of the Received View. Admittedly, this is a simplified rendition of the dense and tricky relationship between knowledge and practice. For this reason, it would be easy to dismiss it as a straw man. Yet, this schematic view runs deeper than is usually appreciated, so it is worthwhile to consider some of its implications, including its rather considerable hold over both our institutionalized ways of managing society and our self-image as free, rational agents. We refer to this as the Received View because, although (as we sketch out below) it has been substantially challenged and augmented over the last two decades or so, the conception of professional practice as applied specialized knowledge still deeply informs such things as the curricula of our professional schools, the rhetoric of organizational management, the logic of information technology and knowledge management, prevalent doctrine about conducting legitimate and productive scientific research, the self-image of the people working in the complex and networked organizations through which we deal with collective problems, the form and logic of representative democracy, and a particular view of modern, liberal society. All are tied to the basic position that we master the world by acquiring knowledge of it and applying that knowledge within the constraints of given contexts. This is not the place fully (or even adequately) to explore these manifold connections.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0275074011407404">6</xref></sup> But they need to be noted to prevent a too hasty rejection of our schematic outline of the Received View as merely old hat and no longer worthy of serious attention.</p>

<caption>
<p>The Received View</p>
</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0275074011407404-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>A central reason for the tenaciousness of the applied knowledge conception of practical work and the many institutionalized ways of imagining, perceiving, organizing, and managing knowledge in our society, is that it substantially rests on a particular <italic>epistemology</italic>, one that has taken as almost self-evident a particular understanding of how we acquire and account for knowledge of the world around us. This epistemology is the well-known Cartesian epistemology of representation. It states that under certain felicitous conditions we can regard our knowledge as being a valid and reliable representation of external reality. These conditions entail performing certain formal, logical operations on the knowledge we posses so that the knowledge thus filtered is not contaminated by such threats to veracity as the effects of passion, emotion, the vagaries of our senses, or doctrinal bias. Knowledge thus understood, legitimizes our dealings with the world. In fact, in the Cartesian view, knowledge is seen as a guarantee of a proper understanding of the world, and in this sense stands in an hierarchical relation to practice and social interaction, it is understood as historically and ontologically prior to practice—in particular, our knowledge of the world enables us to act on it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0275074011407404">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>This has proven to be a broadly persuasive and influential understanding of the place of knowledge in human action. In fact, this is why we feel comfortable speaking of the Received View, as it is not <italic>just</italic> epistemology, but a powerful, all-encompassing moral-institutional epistemological complex that governs our mastery of the world and how we can and ought to act effectively and responsibly within it. Indeed, in our day it has largely crowded out other ways of relating to the word so substantially, that, although we may commonly draw on those other ways informally, we still resort to Cartesian epistemology as the grand narrative that explains what we have been doing, or at least, <italic>should</italic> have been doing. In fact, much of modern thought has not only been subject to the privileging of the Cartesian epistemology, but, as Charles Taylor has suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0275074011407404">Taylor, 1995b</xref>), it has also been epistemology-centered—that is, it has tended to privilege knowledge of the world (especially understood in Cartesian terms) as the primary mode of relating to it. Like Taylor, many social theorists and social scientists have increasingly found it necessary to ask what this Received View leaves out. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0275074011407404">Figure 2</xref> shows, practice is taken to be an empty box, as the subsequent application of prior knowledge. In the Received View, practice is enabled by the elements of knowledge, but it makes no contribution of its own to the conduct of everyday professional (or ordinary) life. In this fundamental sense, everything that is important to understand about professional practice ultimately can be accounted for in terms of the knowledge that enables it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0275074011407404">
<title>Reframing Epistemology</title>
<p>In better understanding the dominance of the Received View, we find it helpful to review some of the contemporary theoretical challenges to it. This in turn helps us frame our call for a reconceptualization of the relationship between knowledge and practice.</p>
<p>A number of contemporary philosophers and social theorists—including Heidegger, Dewey, Wittgenstein, Merleau-Ponty, Gadamer, Polanyi, Vickers, and Taylor—have, in different ways and with different emphases, challenged the dominant position of both Cartesian epistemology and epistemology itself. In rough outline, their argument is that formal knowledge emerges out of, and cannot be seen apart from, an often unacknowledged and largely tacit context of hunches, cues, bodily predispositions, expectations, appreciations, values, affects, and so on. That is, all knowledge, including formal knowledge, is embedded in ordinary experience, and, in an essential sense, gets its meaning, its life, from it. Traditional epistemology’s characterization of knowledge as explicit, objective, disengaged, universal, wholly transparent, and necessarily prior to practice (a set of characteristics that we summarize with the term <italic>formal</italic>), an ideal of knowledge that finds its most elevated expression in scientifically derived knowledge, is actually embedded in a “prior ontology of engaged, embodied agency” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0275074011407404">Abbey, 2000</xref>). All knowledge, such philosophers and social theorists argue, is necessarily bound to a certain perspective or “form-of-life.”</p>
<p>This is not a plea for relativism—after all, dealing with conflicting positions or “second opinions” is a commonly noted feature of practice—but instead a plea for acknowledging the fullness of life (the “surfeit of reality” as Gadamer calls it) that is the source and context of our engagement with the world as competent agents. Rather, this stance argues against the claim that knowledge is able to severe its bonds with its intrinsic experiential and embodied contexts within which alone what we know is acquired and deployed. That is, traditional epistemology, with its prescriptions for rightness and truth that have symbolized its claim to the privileged status of formal knowledge, seems no longer to have a viable claim to that privilege. So, to “overcome epistemology,” as Taylor puts it (Taylor, 1995), is to reacknowledge and revalue the experiential and contextual sources within which knowing is always embedded.</p>
<p>Given the force of this philosophical plea for overcoming epistemology, our subtitle—“toward and epistemology of practice”—might look somewhat anachronistic. Our aim, however, is, while we retain the concept of epistemology, to give it a wider meaning that is better in tune with the more inclusive conception of knowledge and experience that emerged in 20th-century philosophy and social theory. Accordingly, by “epistemology” we mean “ the sub-discipline of philosophy devoted to questions of knowledge and justification” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0275074011407404">Smith, 1997</xref>), with two important caveats. First, we do not take “knowledge” in the narrow scientistic sense of the Received View, but in a way that is inclusive of embodied, engaged, contextualized agency. Second, in the spirit of Taylor’s critique, we do not ascribe to epistemology the status of exclusive guardian of the foundations of effective and responsible understanding of and interaction with the world. Thus, we see an epistemology of practice as an inquiry into the possibilities and constraints of being engaged, embodied, contextualized agents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0275074011407404">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>In what follows, therefore, we explore an understanding of the relationship between knowledge and practice that aims to avoid the conceptual and linguistic predilections of the Received View.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0275074011407404">9</xref></sup> Although we wish in particular to escape the trap of privileging knowledge, we feel that a viable understanding of practice, and how knowledge derives from acting, needs to address some of the questions that have traditionally been handled—or claimed—by epistemology. In particular, we want to avoid the so-what reaction that threatens treatises on practice: Yes, you have shown that action plays a role in our moving about in the world, but how does that help us understand how we attain reliable knowledge of the world? Our aim in this article is not only to show the indispensability of action for knowing and navigating the world, but also that the traditional knowledge–action dichotomy is a false one—and, thus, the so-what question, in our view, is misguided. Consequently, our aim is to contribute to the development of the practice perspective by treating “knowledge” in terms of what we call “the epistemic dimension of practice.” Another way of putting the central focus of this article, then, is, How do we better understand what is entailed in the epistemic dimension of practice? This leads us to introduce the concepts of <italic>actionable understanding, ongoing business</italic>, and <italic>eternally unfolding present</italic> as first steps in breaking out of the hold that the Received View has on the prevailing understanding of the relationship between knowledge and practice. In doing so, we first turn to an exploration of how the Received View has been modified in the face of recent challenges to it, and outline how we see these modifications as positive but ultimately inadequate.</p>

<title>Modifications of the Received View: Reconceptualizing Context and Practice</title>
<sec id="section4-0275074011407404">
<title>A Role for Context</title>
<p>One important augmentation of the Received View to emerge over the last 20 to 30 years is assessing the <italic>context</italic> of practice as an essential element in understanding the work of professionals. As the vice squad example above suggests, administrators and other practitioners do not work in a vacuum. The context of their work influences the way they go about doing their work. If we stick with administrators, this insight was articulated persuasively by Jeffrey Prottas and Mike Lipsky who have shown how the particular context of public service work (underfunded agencies, excessive case loads, difficult clients, structural difficulties in managing public service delivery), resulted in various strategies of accommodation. “Street-level bureaucrats,” as these administrators have come to be called, do not slavishly follow rules, but have a measure of discretion in shaping their activities that allows them to make the work bearable and effective given the circumstances—and effective in ways that can rarely be explained solely in terms of applying professional knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0275074011407404">Lipsky, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0275074011407404">Maynard-Moody &amp; Musheno, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0275074011407404">Prottas, 1979</xref>). Similarly, work on rule application in the sociology of law, has shown different patterns or styles of rule application that are clearly tied to the organizational context in which an administrator workers works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0275074011407404">Kagan, 1978</xref>). In other words, context matters, in that it constrains and even shapes practice. Practitioners cannot neglect or go around certain elements of their immediate physical, social, or policy environments that often stand before them as more or less immutable. In addition to the knowledge they bring to bear on the situation at hand, practitioners also take constraints or opportunities in the environment of their work into account in shaping effective action. Taken together, knowledge and context both impact on the way that practitioners (and ordinary people) go about addressing everyday situations. We have summarized this in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0275074011407404">Figure 3</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>Although this augmentation of the Received View is extremely important, it still is widely treated in ways that can be seen as resting on the same Cartesian epistemology. Practice is still taken to be an empty box contributing nothing important or unique in its own right. All elements of practice, by this augmented view, can be accounted for in terms of knowledge plus context: we need practice to put knowledge to work within the constraints and affordances of a given context. Yet, anything that transpires in practice that might not be readily explained as an aspect of knowledge or context is treated as no more than the likes of intuition—a random factor viewed at best as necessary to close the knowledge–context–practice equation, and at worst as a threat to the ideal of good, reliable knowledge.</p>
<p>More broadly, this amended epistemological stance reflects little more than an illustration of the firm grip that the Received View, for all its seeming simplicity, has on our understanding of self and society. An upshot is that, as we saw earlier, the representational view of knowledge is, quite literally, at the center of a great many institutions that, taken together, are considered central to modern, rational society. An appreciation of the institutionalized implications and assumptions of the Received View, allows us better to understand the significant change along all these dimensions that is implied by the approach to practice we wish to develop here. But before we turn to what we will call the Practice Perspective, we need to discuss another important modification of the Received View that takes some of the criticism that has been leveled at it so far into account.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0275074011407404">
<title>A Role for Practice</title>
<p>Another obvious way to improve on the Received View is to allow for the reciprocal influence of practice on knowledge and context (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0275074011407404">Figure 4</xref>). Here, knowledge still tends to be privileged in understanding how we act in the world. The difference, however, is the realization that, in the application of knowledge in a given context, practice has the ability to confirm or modify both knowledge and context.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0275074011407404">10</xref></sup> Let’s unpack this statement.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0275074011407404-fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>On the knowledge side of the equation, this makes intuitive sense. As most are ready to admit, our understanding of the world, as exemplified in our knowledge of it is almost always incomplete and sometimes ineffective. By applying it, we expose it to more aspects of empirical reality. This can add to or change or confirm what we know, and thereby we become more experienced, more seasoned, more effective practitioners. We also know that such learning can only be attained by engaging in the actual practice. It is not always (and in some cases, rarely) something that can be learned by reading books and manuals or by going to training sessions. Although to become a physician, one has to master the basic principles of physiology, pharmacology, and so on, to become a functionally competent physician, one has to apply this abstract knowledge in the actual practice of diagnosing, prescribing treatment, observing effects, and so on (this is in itself a complex statement, to which we shall return later). One has to see these principles in action, as it were.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0275074011407404">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>This has become more widely recognized by adherents of the Received View and institutionalized, for example, in the mandatory period of practical training that is an element of the curricula of professional programs. But again, the implications of this seemingly small adjustment to the model run much deeper than might at first blush be surmised. That is, this move claims, at least implicitly, that practice itself makes a distinct, <italic>autonomous</italic> contribution to the knowledge–context nexus. Practice leaves its own fingerprints on the things we know and the contexts within which we act. It is no longer a mere derivative of knowledge enacted within context. This means that we have to ask ourselves some important questions. What does this autonomous contribution of practice amount to? In particular, how is it a distinct contribution that cannot be reduced to either the application of knowledge or the constraints and affordances of a context? What is it that practice contributes, both to knowledge <italic>and</italic> to context? How does practice influence or modify knowledge and context? What does this mean for the way we conceptualize the relationship among knowledge, practice, and context? How do we assess, understand, and get about in the world when practice is an autonomous force in itself? Ultimately, our attempt to address such questions will lead us to reject the Received View and begin to formulate an epistemology rooted in practice.</p>
<p>But even if we remain within the confines of this modification of the Received View, we can begin to answer some of these questions. The influence of practice on knowledge is, in a way, the easiest to grasp. Knowledge is a human artifact. Although it is constrained by empirical reality, it acquires its status as knowledge through careful and systematic operations of the initial impressions of our senses, not, as we saw, by being a naïve reflection of what is “out there.” These careful and systematic operations are necessary because people are fallible in their grasp of reality. They are easily swayed by presumptions, prejudice, passions, and bias. The logical operations of the mind are necessary instruments in combating this fallibility. It is the operational nature of knowledge generation that gives it validity and certainty. Knowledge is <italic>au fond</italic> a reflexive act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0275074011407404">Taylor, 1995b</xref>, p. 4). To engage in practice is in a way to expose the fruits of these operations once more to empirical reality, and where they are proven to be deficient, to modify and improve them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0275074011407404">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the reciprocal modification, we see how practice comes to engage knowledge. An enduringly important contribution to the broader understanding of the relationship between knowledge and practice is Michael Polanyi’s famous distinction between “tacit knowledge” and “explicit knowledge” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0275074011407404">Polanyi, 1962</xref>). For Polanyi, tacit knowledge is what we know but cannot say, particularly knowledge that is tied up with things we do. A classic example is riding a bicycle. Very few riders can say which way to turn the handlebars to stay upright or to prevent a fall. In fact, if asked, many say “I don’t know.” Yet, by definition, if one can ride a bike one must know how to turn the handlebars to keep upright—it is part of what knowing how to ride a bicycle means. For most riders, then, knowing which way to turn the handlebars is something they know but cannot say—that is, it is “tacit knowledge.” A parallel bit of explicit knowledge in this case would be something like “to keep your balance on a bike, always turn in the direction of a fall.” This we <italic>can</italic> say, thus as knowledge is explicit. It is commonplace at the very least that the expertise of practitioners entails a good deal of knowledge that cannot be made explicit.</p>
<p>It needs to be noted further that tacit and explicit knowledge are two distinct kinds of knowledge (or, as Polanyi often puts it, two dimensions of knowledge). Tacit knowledge, for example, is not knowledge that has yet to be (or needs to be) made explicit (and vice versa). Each does work the other cannot. A person who has not learned to ride a bike cannot be told “always turn into a fall” and thereby acquire the ability to stay upright: he or she must also acquire the tacit knowledge involved. Neither, as we have noted, does tacitly knowing how to ride enable one to say explicitly which way to turn the handlebars.</p>
<p>It also follows from their distinct character that one kind of knowledge cannot be turned into the other. Although resources of time, talent, and money are commonly put behind the notion that tacit knowledge can and must be made explicit to be useful, assessed, or improved (this has been a common theme, for example, in IT and “knowledge management”), this is a conceptual and operational mistake. There is no operation that can be performed on one kind of knowledge that will turn it into the other. Each kind can, however, be used as a tool to help leverage or generate the other. Although riding a bike, for example, one can use the tacit knowledge of keeping balance in ways that can help one discover explicitly which way the handlebars are to turn to avoid a fall—that is, one can use tacit knowledge and the activity of bike riding as tools to generate the explicit knowledge. Likewise, a novice bike rider might find the explicit knowledge that one turns into a fall as a useful aid in trying to acquire the tacit knowledge of remaining upright.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0275074011407404">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Polanyi’s distinction between tacit and explicit knowledge is commonly paralleled with the distinction drawn by Gilbert Ryle between “knowing-how” and “knowing-that” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0275074011407404">Ryle, 1949/2009</xref>). We contend, however, that these two important sets of distinctions are themselves distinct and that it can be useful to make their differences clear. For Ryle, “knowing-that,” in its most central sense, refers to things we can express in propositions whose truth or falsity can be tested. If someone says “I <italic>know that</italic> Carnegie Hall is on West 57th Street,” that claim can be checked to see if it is correct. Knowledge of this sort is “knowing-that.” The claim “I <italic>know how</italic> to ride a bicycle,” can also be checked to see if it is true or false by seeing what happens when a person gets on a bike. Yet the things one knows that enable him or her to ride are not expressible in the way examples of “knowing-that” are and do not lend themselves to tests of true or false. What we know in this way Ryle calls “knowing-how.” Moreover, Ryle claims, “knowing-how” is acquired over time, whereas “knowing-that” can be grasped at once. We contend, however, that it is a mistake to conflate “knowing-how” with “tacit knowledge” or “knowing-that” with “explicit knowledge.” Specifically, we would argue that “knowing-how” and “knowing-that” can each entail both tacit and explicit knowledge (and we believe there are instances of “knowing-that” which are necessarily acquired over time).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0275074011407404">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Polanyi and Ryle’s distinctions have proven to be useful and provocative concepts in developing a better assessment of the relationship between knowledge and practice. We would hope that the four forms of knowledge we have presented here, drawing on Polanyi and Ryle, will also prove of some value. There continues to be much to learn concerning how these concepts might enrich our understanding of expertise and professional practice. We would observe, nonetheless, that all this has yet to escape the pull of the Received View. Indeed, the distinction between tacit and explicit knowledge and that between knowing-how and knowing-that have repeatedly been treated as prior to and enabling of practice. The importance of their challenge to the Received View should not be underestimated, but the fact that they have also been broadly incorporated into contemporary versions of the Received View cannot be ignored. Ultimately, we would aim to treat both sets of distinctions, (along with the fourfold combinations of them we offer in Note 14), as tools of practice, as things that come after and are made possible <italic>by</italic> practice—that is, as part of the epistemic dimension of practice.</p>
<p>However, the reciprocal modification of the Received View argues for the <italic>mutual</italic> influence of practice on knowledge and context. We have seen how practice influences knowledge, but how does practice influence context, as context by definition is something outside of us, something that is always to one degree or another both beyond and within our control? (In the most basic sense, we can modify what we know by reflecting on it; but reflection alone cannot, it might seem, modify context.) Our interaction with a given context, however, encounters the texture of that context, allowing for certain courses of action while restraining or preventing others. The extreme case of resistance, of course, is immutability. There are times when the world won’t budge. It contains rocks against which we bump our head, hot surfaces that threaten to burn us, or in the social world, laws and other institutional fixtures that forbid (or punish) certain actions. Context clearly informs practice. By its very nature it is more or less difficult to alter or modify by the swift and fleeting nature of practice. A rock can bruise our head, but not vice versa. Yet only practice acting through elements of context can change context. Rocks can crumble rocks, heat can melt them, and pressure can change natural elements into rock. By definition, context is self-possessive.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0275074011407404">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is precisely this position that has been fundamentally challenged in a most interesting and fruitful way by practice theorists in recent years. This has been a challenge that has led to a radically altered notion of the relation between agency and structure. But along with these broader theoretical moves, there are also simple, intuitively easy ways to appreciate how practice can modify external context that stay within the assumptions of the (modified) Received View. Take cooking, for example. Every experienced cook has organized his or her kitchen in such a way that the space and the tools are within easy reach or sequence. One can find one’s tools blindly in the middle of preparing a particular dish. This will do for the repertoire of cooking that he or she usually engages in. However, when one decides to embark on a new cuisine, it is quite likely one will have to rearrange the space and the tool set-up in way that accommodates the practical demands of that style of cooking. One has, in other words, modified the external context of one’s cooking practices. The parallel may be said with respect to other examples of work contexts.</p>

<title>Toward a Practice Perspective</title>
<sec id="section7-0275074011407404">
<title>Knowing in Context</title>
<p>Even this modified view of the knowledge–practice–context relationship leaves out important elements. It still tends to privilege knowledge as the appropriate mode of grasping what goes on around us, as the engine that drives our dealings with the world. In doing so, it rejects as noise or as irrelevant epiphenomena, much that persistently accompanies our attempts to find our way in the everyday world. For example, on an experiential level, doing things in the world (including engaging in a practice) seems often less a matter of applying bits of knowledge and more a matter of a continuous, ongoing stream of activity (Bourdieu, 1973). Often there is something that feels automatic and natural in such activities—even (or especially) in the case of embodiment, as if the body engages in the action in a somewhat autonomous way, uncoupled from our conscious thought. We do things “without thinking.” In fact, as we have all no doubt experienced, thinking about them can interrupt or disable the flow of action (playing piano or using a lathe might be good exemplars of this point). Very often, practice has an unplanned, improvisational quality that can be essential to understanding and carrying out effective practice.</p>
<p>In another sense, the received epistemological view provides little if any means to account for values that can stimulate professional activities, guide them as they unfold, and that supply a kind of measuring stick by which we can judge whether we should continue, stop, or redirect our actions or gauge success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0275074011407404">Cook &amp; Brown, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0275074011407404">Schein, 2004</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0275074011407404">16</xref></sup> It also leaves out the interactive nature of much practical work. Almost everything a practitioner does is done with—and made possible by—interaction. To accomplish something, we often interact with things, with material artifacts that we manipulate or act on according to more or less explicit expectations of what our actions will bring about. Inevitably, the objects “talk back,” at times defying our expectations and forcing us to adapt our assumptions about the characteristics of the objects, the nature of our interventions, or both. We also interact with people—especially people who are experienced in a particular field of practice, whereby the process of interaction seems to contribute something essential to finding our way into and about that given world. Knowing in the world is a joint experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0275074011407404">Shields, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0275074011407404">Wagenaar, 2004</xref>). The Received View, however, drives us into an image of individuals who, in splendid isolation, turn over bits of knowledge in their heads until, one hopes, it all pans out. Finally, it leaves out the massive, largely tacit body of understandings, memories, expectations, and routines that, together, inform the essential context of our actions.</p>
<p>Differently put, the epistemological view of our grasp of the world has emerged as peculiarly impoverished. Obviously, knowledge, as the collected, solidified, and systematized remnants of earlier experiences, does play an important role in how we grasp the world, but by putting knowledge forward as the major, privileged, or exclusive way of relating to the world, we overload it. We leave out the whole living, experiencing, interacting, embedding material and social environment that often gives rise to what we know in the first place and without which it simply wouldn’t make sense to us. It forgets—and in fact dismisses as irrelevant—the fact that knowledge is at all times embedded in a particular practical context, and emerges from our active engagement with some particular slice of the world (as Stolcis so beautifully puts it, as noted earlier on in this article). The explicit, universal knowledge of the Received View has come to seem far too narrow a bridge between self and world.</p>
<p>The particular practice or activity theory formulated by Jean Lave and her collaborators in the late 1980s and early 1990s can, in an important way, be taken as an explicit move to formulate an alternative to the Received View. Interestingly enough, it uses context as a lever to reconceptualize the knowledge–practice–context nexus. Lave argues that while it is by now a common and well-accepted insight that human action is indexical, that is, situated in and directed toward a material and social world, much less attention has been given to the conceptualization of the <italic>relations</italic> between the persons acting and the surrounding world (see for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0275074011407404">Wenger 1998</xref>, p. 53). In general, this relation is described either in deterministic terms (context as a rigid container that causes human behavior, yet is untouched by the influence of human actions), or in subjectivist terms (the ethnomethodological view of contexts as interpersonal constructions, that arise out of human interaction). Lave has summarized this dilemma with the felicitous phrase, “One has system without individual experience, the other experience without system” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0275074011407404">Lave, 1988</xref>, p. 150).</p>
<p>In addressing this dilemma, Lave and others have focused on the social. They treat context as a “social world constituted in relations with persons acting” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0275074011407404">Lave, 1993</xref>, p. 5). In other words, this reframes the concept of context. Instead of it being a fixed container, it now is seen as a dynamically integrated system of <italic>relations</italic>. To denote the relational conception of context, Lave uses the term <italic>setting</italic>. It signifies both the active, ongoing relationship that the actor maintains between herself and her environment, and the fact that this relationship is driven by the particular intentions and understandings of the individual as they emanate from the task that she engages in. Instead of passively reacting to the constraints of a particular context, the term <italic>setting</italic> suggests that the actor purposively seeks out those elements of her environment that are relevant to the task at hand. In this sense the actor “negotiates” her environment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0275074011407404">17</xref></sup> Thus, actors and their world stand in a purposeful, dialectical relationship with each other. In trying to solve problems that come up in the course of their everyday work, they improvise with the material, social, and experiential resources at hand. Dialectical means here that problem and solution are not given, but bring each other into being in the process of acting on the world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0275074011407404">18</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section8-0275074011407404">
<title>Knowledge, Context, and Practice as Mutually Constitutive</title>
<p>We depict this understanding of the relationships among context, practice, and knowing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0275074011407404">Figure 5</xref>. There are things that are characteristics of our interactions with the world, not just properties “out there.” For example, cold is neither a property of the world or of the self, it comes into being only in the interaction of the two: there is cold only when we interact with the world. Something similar might be said for knowing and context: for us, they only have ontological status when and to the extent that we interact with them in practice.</p>

</fig>
<p>Yet, there is a sense in which even this is too narrow. Context, used here as “setting” also has an inherently systematic character. The elements of a given kind of context (physical, social, cultural, policy, organizational, and so on) do not and cannot be simply thrown together randomly. Rather, a context’s elements are related to one another systematically. Its systematic character is, in fact, how a context is constituted, how we identify it as distinct from other contexts or from an indistinct amorphous background; it is how we recognize that we are at the office rather than in a golf game, in a conversation rather than a chorus. When we interact with a context, its systematic character gives shape to our actions. That is, a context’s form informs practice. The form of a given context affords some practices while constraining others (there are things we can and cannot enact in a workshop, others in a board meeting). Just as cold arises in our interaction with the world, so do the affordances and constraints of a context arise in our interactions with it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0275074011407404">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Similarly, knowledge also has a systematic character that informs what and how we know, and thus also how we act. Just as the term <italic>mythology</italic> can refer both to the study of myths and to the systematically related set of myths embraced by a given people, so do we wish the term <italic>epistemology</italic> to refer both to the study of knowledge and to the systematically related bits of knowledge of a given community and the patterned activities that give rise to them and imbue them with the particular sense or meaning that enables us to recognize them as relevant, usable knowledge in a given context.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0275074011407404">20</xref></sup> This is why a particular professional community, for example, accepts some things as legitimate knowledge while rejecting others: some things find a foothold within the systematic structure of their epistemology, others do not. Similarly, no bit of knowledge exists on its own; part of what it means for something to be knowledge (rather than a hypothesis, a bit of information, or just nonsense, and so on) is that it is a part of an epistemology. This point can be seen in some rather common sense examples. In learning a field or skill, for example, we often reach a point where we say “oh, this is too much to learn.” Yet it often turns out that it was not too much but too little: when we learn more, suddenly things “make sense” or “fall together.” What is going on in such instances, we contend, is a shift in the epistemology that makes possible a better organization of what is known, which makes new knowledge easier to “take in” and existing knowledge easier to draw on. That is, how the bits of knowledge are systematically organized changes. Similarly, sometimes after things “fall together,” we discover that bits of knowledge we thought were essential suddenly appear useless. Such examples suggest that there are times when what we need is not more knowledge but a better epistemology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0275074011407404">21</xref></sup> Such phenomena reflect the systemic character of knowledge.</p>
<p>There is more than an echo of Dewey here. This understanding of practice and knowledge as a form of purposeful, flexible engagement with the world clearly resonates with Dewey’s notion of “inquiry” or “productive inquiry.” Dewey saw “inquiry” not merely as a kind of cognitive, analytic reflection on the world, but as an active engagement <italic>with</italic> the world, or, to put it differently, as an active extending of what one knows beyond the immediate situation. His aim was to develop a unified account of doing and knowing in which inquiry is ongoing action in and on a situation that has become indeterminate by some sort of blockage or opportunity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0275074011407404">22</xref></sup> As a result, routine action precipitates a restructuring of the original situation through cognitive, physical, and/or communal activities that ultimately bring about closure (even if temporary or provisional). Inquiry, or practice in our terms, is thus transformative. This is why Dewey often calls it “productive” inquiry: the result of such inquiry is a kind of closure made possible by productive restructuring of the original situation. A situation that is indeterminate has become whole again, at least temporarily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0275074011407404">Burke, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0275074011407404">Dewey, 1920/1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0275074011407404">Strauss, 1993</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0275074011407404">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Practice theory (in the formulation of such writers as Lave and Dewey) goes a long way in breaking down the dualism that is inherent in the Received View. With its emphasis on participation as an epistemic route into the world, and the inescapable indexicality of human action, such treatments of practice help provide important elements of a theory of practice. Practice is no longer a mere conduit for knowledge <italic>of</italic> the world; it is the vital element of <italic>knowing in</italic> the world. The knowing participant manages to move about in the everyday world in a sensible and effective manner because he or she is an actively engaged part of a world that is made one’s own.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0275074011407404">24</xref></sup> In particular, knowledge, practice, and context are no longer self-contained, closed boxes, but functional elements of one integrated system of activity, in which each allows for the others to contribute to the effective engagement with the everyday world. As we suggest in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0275074011407404">Figure 5</xref>, practice, knowledge, and context are mutually constitutive, with the broad, shaded arrows indicating the dynamic, ongoing character of this generative process.</p>
<p>Yet, we feel such theories, despite their many strengths and virtues, require (and help enable) us to push one step further. To see why and where, let’s focus on what many consider a main asset of a theory of practice. As we argued above, one of the major attractions of the Received View, one of the elements that most closely binds it to the institutions of modernity, is the promise of control. This promise resides in two closely linked forms: control over knowledge—through the formal operations in thinking that leads to certain, reliable knowledge uncontaminated by passion, bias, or prejudice—and, control over external reality—through the formal operations of scientific research and the innovation and deployment of technology. Tellingly, it is precisely on this issue that the Received View finds itself most vulnerable, and that practice theory can be further developed. First, empirically speaking, the quest for control has turned out to be far more elusive than either enlightenment thinkers, rationalists, or modern technologists had envisioned. The literature on this is now too extensive to be discussed in any detail here, but <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0275074011407404">Merton’s (1936)</xref> notion of the “unintended consequences of concerted action,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0275074011407404">Pressman and Wildavsky’s (1984)</xref> analysis of policy implementation as the “complexities of joint action,” Ulrich <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0275074011407404">Beck’s (1992)</xref> concept of the “risk society,” and the emerging sciences of complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0275074011407404">Urry, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0275074011407404">Waldrop, 1992</xref>) are sufficiently well-recognized to make the case for the necessarily limited reach of either form of control.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0275074011407404">25</xref></sup> The basic argument is that the well-known procedure of analytically breaking the object to be known and controlled down into its supposedly constitutive elements, and to proceed then by regrouping those elements into a working model of the object, the performance of which can then be gauged by changing the value of one or more of the constituent variables, is inherently deficient. It misses many of the interactions within the systems that produce the contingent, unforeseen outcomes that have dramatically compromised efforts of social engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0275074011407404">Dryzek, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0275074011407404">Waldrop, 1992</xref>). Complexity makes for a contingent, unpredictable world, particularly the world of human affairs, in which certainty is often in short supply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0275074011407404">Wagenaar, 2007</xref>). Meanwhile, we would note, simplicity, also, has proven to have pitfalls of its own). The best we can hope for is to harness uncertainty and complexity (and simplicity), aware that there are better and worse ways of doing this. We feel that any theory of knowledge, practice, and context must be able both to account for, and to deal effectively with, this fundamental aspect of reality.</p>
<p>The upshot is that a practice perspective has to answer two related challenges. First, it has to explain how people harness uncertainty, complexity, and the limits of predictability, when they extend their actions in ongoing time. This is a simple but deep requirement. The Received View has the central and almost always overlooked quality that it is retroactive: it explains how actors think and decide <italic>ex post facto</italic>. Once all the information on how a particular decision has run its course is in, we can exhaustively explain how that decision was made. Much policy analysis, for example, is of this kind.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0275074011407404">26</xref></sup> But actors live in a world where the outcome of decisions is generally <italic>not</italic> immediately or completely known, where problem formulations are unclear and fundamentally contested, where no one can oversee the implications of alternative courses of action, where, in short, the answer to the question “What to do?” is shrouded in fog.</p>
<p>This is a situation that no one can escape. It is our nature as human beings that we are always standing at the edge of the present, venturing into an uncertain future, guided by an ambiguous history of experience, convention, artifact, and habit—and empowered by a capacity, as dazzling as it is fallible, for imagining the unrealized and then judging what we ought to do and how best to do it. Within this inescapable present, we find ourselves bound, often inexplicably, to groups of bewildered fellow actors for whom our collective past seems as inevitable as our future is inscrutable. This is all we have. This is the human condition. Yet, in such a world, most actors have learned to move about routinely in ways that more often than not are effective and responsible. How do they do it? Differently put, a theory of practice has to be able to explain how actors arrive at effective and responsible courses of action with only limited information about the situation at hand and inherently fallible guesses about the future. It has to account for the strategies actors employ and the resources they use. In other words, it has to explain how we are able so often to go beyond what we already know and perceive.</p>
<p>A theory of practice must also address the constraining effects of history. As we saw, actors are locked inside a perspective—that of their own personality and experience, that of their group, and that of their milieu (nation, gender, historical period, and so on). Although these perspectives allow the actor to act, they also constrain him or her in interactions with others. This is the fundamental epistemic dilemma of perspectivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0275074011407404">Fay, 1996</xref>). Although we are dependent on our knowledge, experience, insights, values, and preferred solutions to find our way in the world, these also prevent us from grasping the full spectrum of knowledge, experience, insights, values, and solutions that are available in the human community. How, in knowing and moving in the world, can we overcome our confinement within our own horizon? The version of practice theory discussed here certainly suggest some ways to overcome the constraining effect of context by exploring how we move about effectively in a contingent, unpredictable world. But we feel that these challenges need to be addressed more explicitly or systematically.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0275074011407404">27</xref></sup></p>

<title>From Epistemology to Practice: Turning Knowledge on its Head</title>
<p>Taking our next step toward a practice perspective actually entails making a substantial shift. Specifically, we believe it means treating knowledge and context as aspects of practice—or more specifically, as artifacts of practice. In a sense, this shift turns the original formulation of the Received View on its head: rather than practice being seen as wholly explicable in terms of knowledge (or knowledge constrained by context) here, as suggested in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0275074011407404">Figure 6</xref>, we see practice as primary and knowledge, along with context, as calling for explication in its terms. Indeed, we wish to characterize knowledge as part of an epistemic dimension of practice, and the elements of context as artifacts of practice that constitute its social and physical worlds. In making this move, we introduce three interrelated concepts: “actionable understanding,” “ongoing business,” and “eternally unfolding present.” Accordingly, a central undertaking of professional practice is generating an understanding of a situation at hand that enables effective and responsible action within “ongoing business.” This “actionable understanding” is informed by a constantly renewed past, directed at an always partially decipherable future, and situated in a present that is “eternally unfolding.” Below, we explore these three aspects of the shift.</p>

</fig>
<p>In developing these concepts, let us return for the moment to the vice squad example at the beginning of this article.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0275074011407404">28</xref></sup> We will then develop each concept making use of the example. The setting in which the vice squad’s work takes place is a small suite of offices that is part of a larger regional police station. The largest room contains desks for all of the detectives. The detectives take turns staffing a 24-hr hotline (the <italic>piket dienst</italic> in Dutch). There are terminals for accessing the information system, and places to store paperwork. The other rooms are much smaller and are used to interview victims and witnesses or to interrogate suspects. The unit consists of 10 detectives, some of whom are employed part-time. Each morning at 8:00, the detectives meet in a so-called <italic>work meeting</italic> to discuss the progress on cases that are under investigation and to assess and distribute the cases that came in that night.</p>
<sec id="section10-0275074011407404">
<title>Actionable Understanding</title>
<p>We have deliberately chosen an example that is conspicuously ordinary. This kind of exchange between public servants could have taken place in any office, in any country, on any particular day. The detectives need to move forward with their ordinary tasks of dealing with events and organizing work. Within that ongoing flow of activity, situations are encountered that impede what needs to be done and others that facilitate it. The matters that prompt discussion in this example involve the registration of an incoming case. The situation arises out of a routine task of the unit: how to keep track of the cases that come in and are in various stages of investigation. An examination of the nature of such cases will help sketch out an understanding of some of what is entailed in this part of the vice squad’s work.</p>
<p>In much of the world of public administration, a case is an elementary particle. It is the basic administrative unit, to which administrative actions and permutations are grafted. A case is also an empty placeholder that allows both the activities concerning individual clients and the organization of administrative work at the agency level. Additionally, a case has a physical substrate in the form of a paper or digital file. All this is true and nonproblematic, at the surface level. In reality, a case is a construction, or better, an enactment, an ongoing, joint achievement of a community of administrators.</p>
<p>In general terms, a “case” is an artifact of practice within the field of public administration, the product of a certain amount of administrative processing in support of various policy aims. It can be distinguished from the “raw” situation that initially comes to the attention of the vice squad. Some of these “raw” situations are not entered as cases because the detectives decide they do not merit investigation or they fall outside the jurisdiction of the unit. A lot rides on the decision to enter a particular situation as a case. Once a situation is designated as a case, the unit in fact enters into an implicit agreement with the outside world (victim, suspect, the DA, police superiors, the community) to work on the case in an effective and responsible manner. In other words, the administrative act of transforming a raw situation into a case creates a complex set of mutual expectations, rights, and responsibilities between the unit and the outside world. For example, victims and their families may expect to be treated with respect and sensitivity. Conversely, they are expected to be truthful about what has happened. Similarly, suspects have certain legal rights (e.g., the right to have a lawyer), but forfeit others, as when they are obliged to hand over any evidentiary materials relevant to the case (e.g., computers, clothes). Communities have a right to be informed about certain risks (as when a child molester is active in a neighborhood). And the formal registration of a case signals to the larger police organization that the vice squad has taken on itself the responsibility to handle the case in a professional, responsible, and timely manner, and to bring it to an appropriate end. This is what engagement amounts to: the active involvement of a professional organization with its environment.</p>
<p>In this way, this vice squad registers roughly 400 cases per year. Now, the act of registration per se, (creating an administrative artifact that has an entry in some system of registration) poses various challenges for the detectives. These may have to do with such things as the nature of sexual pathology or the demands of the police organization. For example, some of the situations that are transformed into cases involve identical persons (as in this instance). Such cases create boundaries that real world situations may not have. For example, the squad may register as a case under investigation the sexual abuse of an eldest daughter by her father. Some months later, a younger daughter calls the unit reporting that she has been regularly abused by her father and her uncle. Must this be registered as a separate case? In the raw situation, both instances of abuse are probably part of a pattern of pathological family relations, but the presence of an uncle in the second situation might warrant its registry as a separate case. This is a matter of the legal constraints and affordances of the unit’s work environment. The upshot here is that the seemingly neutral term <italic>register</italic> does not necessarily capture all the work that constitutes establishing a case—work, it should be noted, that is largely implicit and nested inside the workflow of the unit. Similarly, the term <italic>case</italic> does not necessarily capture the complex, multilayered, relational, practical, and moral configurations that are brought into being by the act of creating a case—which are themselves various kinds of constraints and affordances of the social, cultural, or policy contexts of this work.</p>
<p>For the detective and department head to register something as a case means they have formed an understanding of it that entails a number of things, including, making it an active, ongoing, and embedded part of their work, having it fall under various laws or policies applicable to the vice squad, addressing the possibility of it articulating with other public agencies (e.g., social services), and trusting that doing this is consistent with their often taken-for-granted sense of what is and what might be, of what is desirable, and what is to be avoided in such a situation, and to do all this in a way that enables them to take an appropriate action on it at an appropriate time—that is, an action that is effective and responsible given these sorts of contextual factors. This is an example of what we have come to call an <italic>actionable understanding</italic>. In this instance, the vice squad must develop a mutually held understanding of the case that enables them to take mutually acceptable action on it. Their chief job at this point, we argue, is not applying knowledge, but generating a form of practice, within which they very well may develop new knowledge or deploy existing knowledge. But it is the practice that is primary. Knowledge is a tool of it. The value of that knowledge lies in its utility within practice, not in a supposed ability to give rise to practice. To form such an actionable understanding clearly entails balancing many factors. And a sound accounting of what the members of the vice squad do must be explicable in terms of them. What the detectives know—or need to know—is only one of those factors, and thus it alone cannot account for what is done.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0275074011407404">
<title>Ongoing Business</title>
<p>For the vice squad, the various dimensions of the challenge of registration—its practical topography—are not wholly pregiven by policy mandates or administrative rules, but only become clear as the trajectory of a case evolves. They emerge out of the <italic>ongoing business</italic> of the squad. To grasp the full dimension of everyday practice, it is important to elaborate on what we mean by the <italic>ongoing business</italic>. Several common terms give an initial suggestion as to what we mean by it: “business as usual,” the stable state,” the “ground” to the “figure” of challenge and opportunity. All these point to the practical work of these detectives, which consists of a flow of routine actions and understandings, a certain physical environment, a set of tools, the presence of colleagues who behave in predictable ways, and shared memories, meanings, and expectations, that, taken together, form the experiential environment of the unit. In other words, this is the stuff that is expected to be there, and which often merits no special attention. Ongoing business is part of the intersubjective landscape of the members of the work unit, and the embodied reality in which they operate.</p>
<p>We want to emphasize that, although ongoing business involves physical objects or artifacts such as tools, work procedures, and legal rules, these do not necessarily constitute a physically fixed or static structure. Ongoing business is made up of <italic>experience</italic>, shared by the members of the unit. Ongoing business is simultaneously tied to the experiences and activities of the detectives, yet also independent of them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0275074011407404">29</xref></sup> That is, it exists independent of the presence of one or another individual detective, yet it could not exist outside the experiences of the squad as a whole. In that sense, ongoing business is a <italic>collective</italic> entity. As a collective possession, it is part of the body of experience of each individual member as he or she is socialized into the unit. Ongoing business is part of what makes a collection of individuals into a community. It is also what gives particular meaning or purpose to the activities that constitute the practice of that community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0275074011407404">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>Also, ongoing business is, of course, dynamic. This comes from its experiential nature. As it continuously interacts with the world, it is continuously informed and influenced by what goes on in the world. Most events simply assert the ongoing business, thereby contributing to its stability, but some events may be perceived as a threat. For example, during the time this case was being observed, one of the detectives, who had been on pregnancy leave and was just returning to work, began to behave erratically, such as showing up late for work, or refusing to take on tasks. Part of the ongoing business of the unit is that detectives are always on time, do not hesitate to take on assigned tasks, (except when they are demonstrably overburdened; task assignment is more or less a collective decision that is discussed in the morning work meeting), and do not object when another detective asks to take over a task. These habits make it possible to navigate the fundamental unpredictability of the work, in terms of when cases come in, how many there are, and how the trajectory of the cases develops. Against this background, the erratic behavior of the detective was a tear in the fabric of the ongoing business. This led to a lot of discussion among the detectives, the central theme of which was a weighing of mutual solidarity against their anger at this violation of the unspoken rules of the work unit. In our terms, what was at stake was the integrity of the “ongoing business,” of the stable state that made the work of the unit possible. The discussion among the detectives of how to deal with the errant colleague was a rare occasion in which the ongoing business itself became a subject of reflection. What the detectives discussed among themselves was if the ongoing business should be adapted to include the temporary presence of an unreliable colleague or if its integrity should be maintained by removing the colleague.</p>
<p>The concept of ongoing business, then, points to a dynamic, developmental, often taken-for-granted and unproblematic background against which and within which problems and opportunities of community’s practice arise and are dealt with. For the vice squad, dealing with ongoing business is neither primarily a matter of applying knowledge nor is it fruitful for an observer to account for all that is going into ongoing business and the vital role it plays in the squad’s practice solely in terms of what can be known. Knowledge does not give rise to ongoing business, rather the practices of the squad, of which, ongoing business is an essential element, determine what knowledge is needed and how it is best deployed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0275074011407404">
<title>The Eternally Unfolding Present</title>
<p>In the dialogue from the vice squad case, we note that one thing that might be immediately apparent is that there is a discussion taking place in the present. To take this a step further, the dialogue is part of the practice of the detectives, and practice necessarily takes place in the present. In another sense, however, this may seem so obvious that it could easily be dismissed as a trivial observation. In fact, it is often taken for granted that what needs to be explained and/or what provides for explanation lie beyond what is immediately apparent. Many of our analytic traditions would incline us to say, “Sure, the detectives are talking. But to find out what’s really going on we need to dig below the surface.” Indeed, the familiar phrase “what’s <italic>really</italic> going on” is implicitly an ontological claim that the real stuff, the stuff with explanatory power, is of a different kind and that it lies elsewhere. As we have observed above, for example, the Received View’s accounts of practice tend to privilege explanations given in terms of knowledge seen as underlying and enabling practice. Although we do not at all wish to dismiss wholesale the value of “digging below the surface,” it has been our aim to question the predilection of privileging knowledge, or other foundational “essences,” in this way, especially as doing so tends to deny explanatory power to practice itself. In this spirit, we contend that as practice necessarily takes place in the present, the understanding of knowledge and context we are advancing must be based on this, not vice versa. In this spirit, it is within the immediate present of practice that we believe actionable understandings are formed and ongoing business is sustained. It is also there that we see knowledge and context taking on the form and meaning that constitute them as artifacts of practice. To sketch this out, we turn our attention briefly to matters of ontology.</p>
<p>The modern world has cultivated a dominant ontology that is intimately interconnected with the Cartesian epistemology sketched out above. Indeed, the two conceptually reinforce each other, and are pillars of the Received View. We need, therefore, to outline this ontology, identify how it supports Cartesian epistemology, and put forward an alternative ontology with some importantly different epistemic implications.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the dominant ontology, there exists an all-encompassing physical universe that behaves in ways captured by the observations and theories of the physical sciences. The past is the past of the universe, and the future is determined by its present state. We live in this universe, and, as physical beings, are part of it. From our inner lives, we peer out through the capacities of our senses and minds (which themselves may or may not be wholly physical) to grasp the nature of the universe and the patterns of its workings. Anything we might say about the outer world—anything we might claim to know—that is not in keeping with this ontology is, at least in theory, either illusion or poetry (as one 20th-century philosophical school was fond of saying).</p>
<p>Yet, as contemporary philosophers and social scientists have looked ever inward, ontology itself has come increasingly to look like a conceptual scheme for understanding our experience of the world, and less an account of the world itself. If ontology is a direct account of anything, it has been suggested, perhaps it is one of our inner experience of the world, not of the world outside us. And if this is so, then any knowledge associated with ontology might be less about the world (physical or social), and more about our experience of it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0275074011407404">31</xref></sup> The patterns of the universe’s workings, after all, do not appear directly to us—whereas our consciousness of them does. Some have seen in this the danger of falling into a solipsistic trap. Consequently, a cottage industry in theories has sprouted up that purport to draw correspondences of various sorts between the patterns we find in our subjective experience and the way the world actually is. Although philosophers, physical scientists, and social scientists have struggled to perfect such theories, proof of any sort has remained stubbornly elusive. If we follow this path, at least one form of intellectual honesty brings us to the edge of an unbridgeable gap between a consciousness we have direct access to and an outer world we do not.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0275074011407404">32</xref></sup> In the face of such challenges, however, the Cartesian epistemology and its accompanying ontology have maintained a surprisingly tenacious grip on our understanding of ourselves and the world. At this point, these two contending sets of ontological and epistemological observations have come to form a seemingly incommensurable and irresolvable counterpoint—particularly to the extent that each seems often to claim that it contains the other. Indeed, this remains a key conundrum of contemporary thought.</p>
<p>One philosophical approach more in keeping with what we believe is the inescapable primacy of human experience, including ways we would relate to practice, can be found in the work of the major 20th-century Japanese philosopher Nishida Kitaro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0275074011407404">Nishida, 1911/1990</xref>). A major project of Nishida’s was to address traditional questions of Western philosophy from the perspective of Eastern thought, especially Zen theory and practice. For Nishida, an ontology should rest first and always on consciousness, not on an outer physical world. Since, Nishida argued, the only thing we have direct access to, the only thing we “cannot even begin to doubt,” is consciousness, we ought to honor this fact and build our understanding of experience and of the world from that point.</p>
<p>In Nishida’s view, at the core of consciousness what we find is “nothingness.” One way of unpacking this claim—which may at first seem contradictory or obfuscatory—is to understand “nothingness” as “no-thing-ness.” That is, what we find at the core of our being, at the inescapable center of our consciousness, is not things but process or activity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0275074011407404">33</xref></sup> All we are aware of comes and goes: a rock or the sun or a person enters our consciousness and then departs and is potentially different when it enters again.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0275074011407404">34</xref></sup> It is out of such occurrences within conscious experience, Nishida holds, that we create and unify our sense of the world, our thoughts, memories, intentions, and our selves. Looking inward, Nishida (like most modern physicists looking outward) reminds us that all “things” are really “events”. So the world around us and each of its constituent parts (including our memories of them), Nishida claims, are for us collections of experiences, or “systematic singularities” (to use his term), that we assemble to make sense of experiences within our consciousness (akin to what above we have called “artifacts”).</p>
<p>Following this, the constraints and affordances of the outer world only come to us through our experience of them. The world in which we live is made by us in interaction with those constraints and affordances. For us, then, the world exists in our interaction with it. This interactive character can be seen in the work of another 20th-century Japanese philosopher Watsuji Tetsuro. Watsuji held that what is commonly understood as the basic properties of the world are actually properties of our interaction with the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0275074011407404">Watsuji, 1935/1961</xref>). In fact, the example of cold given above comes from Watsuji. Cold, he argued, is not a property of the world, it is not just molecules moving at a given speed; nor it is just within us, because without the movement of molecules there is no experience of cold. Cold is a property of our interaction with the world, it arises and exists only within that interaction. So too, Watsuji insists, for much if not all of the elements of our experience of the world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0275074011407404">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>In keeping with this ontological stance, Nishida holds that we exist always in the present—specifically, the present of consciousness. The past, in his view, is accessible only in the present; it is constantly assembled and reassembled as we move though time. Likewise, the future, for us, remains always a feature of our present imaginings (perhaps constrained by our ongoing reassembly of the past). Accordingly, we exist in what here we wish to call an <italic>eternally unfolding present</italic> where all is process. Even the myriad things of the world are “systematic singularities”—artifacts to the extent that we shape and/or give meaning to them in an ongoing way in our interaction with the world within the unfolding present.</p>
<p>This sketch of Nishida’s ontology leads us to his epistemology. What we might claim to know about our experience (that is, about ourselves and the world) is also an aspect of the workings of consciousness within the unfolding present. Knowledge, from Nishida’s perspective, is something we produce when we withdraw, to one degree or another, from active engagement with the world and reflect abstractly on that engagement. It is something we hold in that part of present consciousness we call memory, and which only has life when we use it to develop our understanding or to inform our actions as we return to fuller engagement with the world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0275074011407404">36</xref></sup> The knowledge of a principle of physics, or a law regulating the rights of suspects, by this account, is a systematic singularity, evoked in the present consciousness of our ongoing memories. Such a systematic singularity is useful to make sense out of and/or to manipulate other systematic singularities, which are constructed in our conscious experience of particular constraints and affordances of the social or physical world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0275074011407404">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>We see the ontology and epistemology suggested by Nishida as helpful in moving from an understanding of knowledge as underlying and enabling practice to seeing practice itself as having an epistemic dimension—including seeing knowledge as an artifact of practice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0275074011407404">38</xref></sup> If we are constantly within the eternally unfolding present, knowledge cannot be seen as something static, something that can be stored away so that later it can be retrieved, distributed, and shared.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0275074011407404">39</xref></sup> As our opening quote from Montaigne suggests, if we know something, we know it now. What we know is sustained, evoked, shaped and deployed only in the present. Beyond this, it has no reality for us, and thus no reality of its own. Conversely, since the eternally unfolding present is the only reality we have, it is only within that reality that what we know has any life. It is for this reason, in our view, that knowledge cannot be seen as enabling practice because practice is a necessary condition for knowledge, not the other way round. It is this sense of knowing—as evoked within our consciousness through engagement with the world within an eternally unfolding present— that we wish to capture by saying that practice has an epistemic dimension.</p>
<p>What we know indeed plays a role in how we act, how we engage the world, and how we give shape to the world through practice. It is tied up with what we do, but it is not something that comes before or underlies what we do. We may use a hammer in building a bookcase—it helps us interact with wood and nails, and it helps us give shape to the bookcase. But the hammer does not give rise to what we do. It maybe necessary in deploying our skills, but it alone does not produce those skills. It can be a valuable and, in some ways, necessary tool in the practice of building a bookcase. But it is the hammer that is an artifact of the practice of building a bookcase, not the practice that is a product of the artifact. Likewise, with knowledge: it is a valuable and necessary part of practice. But it is something that is evoked and deployed within and by way of what we do, not something that underlies and enables what we do. It is in this way that we see knowledge as an artifact of practice.</p>
<p>Just as our engagement with the world is informed in part by the epistemic dimension of practice (by what we know), it is also informed by the constraints and affordances that we encounter in our interactions with the physical and social world—that is, by context. As with “knowledge,” we also wish to see “context” as an artifact of practice. There is another concept in Nishida that helps us to do this. Nishida expresses the concept in the Japanese word <italic>basho</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0275074011407404">Nishida, 1933-1934/1970</xref>). In colloquial Japanese, the word <italic>basho</italic> generally means “place.” But as a concept in traditional Japanese culture and modern Japanese philosophy (and more recently Japanese social science),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0275074011407404">40</xref></sup> the term suggests much more.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0275074011407404">41</xref></sup> Nishida notes that everything that exists does so in a particular location (a <italic>basho</italic>), and the social and physical history embodied in a given <italic>basho</italic> make possible and inform the activities that take place within it (they also inform our identity).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0275074011407404">42</xref></sup> Conversely, who we are and what we do in a given <italic>basho</italic> sustain and shape the <italic>basho</italic> itself. For our purposes here, this suggests a “sense of a particular place,” one that both affords a particular kind of practice, and, in turn, is constituted by that practice.</p>
<p>A typical example of <italic>basho</italic>, to stay with the Japanese theme, is one from sumo wrestling. A sumo match takes place in a sumo ring. The ring is a particular place: it has a given size and configuration. The characteristics of the ring afford and constrain the practice of sumo—that is, without the ring, there cannot be a proper sumo match. The ring, meanwhile, is itself constituted by the rules and traditions of the practice. And in an important sense, the ring only really becomes the ring when it is in use, when it is affording the practice. Otherwise, it is little more than a circle on the floor. It is only within the unfolding present of a match that the ring affords practice, and it is only in affording practice that it is truly the ring, the <italic>basho</italic>, of sumo. Likewise, it is only when sumo wrestlers physically and mentally locate themselves within the ring—when they have a sense of that particular place—that they can meaningfully engage in the practice of sumo wrestling. The same would be true of a tennis court or a football pitch. This can also be said of the context of many forms of practice—from the example of the vice squad above, to the setup of a traditional lecture hall, to the design of an office, factory, laboratory, or workshop, and so on. The idea is that such a context both affords the particular practices that take place within it, and is itself informed by those practices. In our terms, the context of a practice—its <italic>basho</italic>—is itself an artifact of that practice: it derives its ongoing existence, form, and meaning from the practice it affords.</p>
<p>So, let’s return to our observation about the vice squad case. There is a discussion between the detective and the department head that is taking place in the present. The discussion is part of their practice, and practice (like all life) necessarily takes place within an eternally unfolding present. We take this present not simply as the temporal dimension of the case, but as the ontological setting within which practice occurs and knowledge and context are evoked. The dialogue proceeds like a tennis match: at each step of the dialogue, terms, ideas, concerns, and the like are volleyed back and forth until the parties are able to move on to the next step. At the beginning, the detective and the department head have exchanges about how the case is identified, in which various terms are used (“rape,” “checked it in the DPS [the information system]” “intake interview,” and so on). The focus shifts to how they should handle the case (giving it one or another “annotation,” putting it in “holding mode,” “delete the case completely,” and so on). There is also a concern about being able to locate the case properly in the future (“. . . when someone calls . . . how do we find out who has the case . . .”). Each comment seems to unfold from the previous one and lead to the next. All of these things are part of what the detectives know. It is within this unfolding dialogue (“unfolding present”) that what the detectives know is evoked, tested, modified, agreed on, and referenced to the future. How they ultimately deal with the case (annotate, put on hold, and so on) is generated within the dialogue. It is in this sense that we see their practice as having an epistemological dimension. Knowledge was not retrieved and applied in a way that enabled practice. Rather, within their ongoing practice, the detectives evoked various things they know about dealing with cases and used them as tools to generate an understanding of the case at hand that enabled them to move on to the next thing.</p>
<p>The detectives have various forms of tools at their disposal that enable and give particular character to their work. These include conventions like “intake interview,” physical infrastructure, such as the information system and the files, and concepts—including ones that have legal and policy aspects—such as “case.” These tools neither come to the detectives’ hands fully formed nor are they immune to change over time. Like Watsuji’s characterization of “cold,” such tools arise for the detectives in their interaction with them. It is within the detectives’ interaction with the social and physical world of their practice that these tools have their particular form and meaning. An “intake interview” does not exist except when it is enacted. The information system only has the functions it does to the extent that the detectives put it to use. “Case” does not sit on a shelf waiting to be deployed, but has function and meaning only when referred to or used in practice.</p>
<p>Similarly, the various things that make up the social and physical world of the detectives’ work are not fixtures of nature, but things that are created and sustained within their practice. They do not have fixed functions and meanings. Rather, their identity is constantly being evoked, deployed, and modified in what the detectives do. They are in that sense “systematic singularities” of the detectives’ practice. The specific meaning and use of the terms <italic>case</italic> and <italic>annotation</italic> in the dialogue, for example, are given their specific meaning and use by the detectives in the course of their conversation. In a larger sense, the theme running through the entire dialogue about how to deal with the case is an exercise in defining it as a systematic singularity. Various bits of its history, present state, and future are referenced and treated as meaningful parts of a single thing, a single case: it comes from the police in The Hague, it is found in the DPS [information system], it gets a particular annotation designating its present state, which, in turn, anticipates how it might be handled in the future. These are seen by the detectives not as isolated unrelated events, but are actively put together by them in the course of their conversation as a systematic singularity within their practice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0275074011407404">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>In another sense, we can see “annotation,” “holding mode,” “delete the case completely,” and the like as artifacts of the detectives’ practice. At various points while the detectives talk with one another, they withdraw partially from direct engagement with the case to reflect on it. In doing so, they evoke systematic singularities like “holding mode” that aid in this reflection. Their discussion about how the case might be annotated, for example, drew both on memories of the term’s use in the past and on projections of how it might function in the future. In this part of the discussion, the form and meaning of “annotation” was augmented by its application to the case at hand—that is, it was further shaped as an artifact of the detectives practice. This process, in turn, helped the detectives form an understanding of the case that enabled them to move to the next step with it: “holding mode” and “annotation,” as forms of knowing, enabled the generation of an “actionable understanding.” What the detectives know is not static stuff that is stored away and later retrieved in a way that gives rise to practice. It is an artifact of practice that is shaped by the very practice that it aids.</p>
<p>Finally, the practice of the detectives is afforded, in part, by the social and physical world within which it transpires, by its context. The setup of the office, the infrastructure of the hot line and the information system, the laws and policies that apply to the vice squad, the traditions of the unit’s “ongoing business,” and so on are embodied in the particular place—the <italic>basho</italic>—of the vice squad’s practice. And the specific form and meaning that the elements of this <italic>basho</italic> have are, in turn, evoked, confirmed, and modified through their use within that practice. They are, in this sense, artifacts of the unit’s practice. For one of the detectives to engage in practice effectively, he or she must have a “sense of the particular place” within which he or she works. A detective must have, for example, an actionable understanding of “annotation” to use the term and its associated applications properly, in a way that the others in the unit can accept as appropriate (such an understanding is among the things that someone new to the unit would likely lack). Just as a familiarity with the rules and the court of tennis affords the game, so does a familiarity with the <italic>basho</italic> of the vice squad afford effective practice within it.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In recent years, what we have called the Received View has faced growing theoretical and empirical challenges. It is no longer secure to assume that knowledge necessarily precedes, underlies, and enables action. Yet typically the assumption that it does is at least implicit in such things as the design of research, consulting, education, and training programs, and in the drafting, implementation, and assessment of public policies. This is true to a greater degree than is generally appreciated or that the strength of the challenges might lead one to assume—and is indicative of the tenacious grip that the received view still has on us. For such reasons, more work needs to be done on the development of theoretical and practical alternatives to the Received View. Our aim here has been to make a contribution to this work.</p>
<p>It is our contention that one viable and potentially very valuable alternative is to “turn knowledge on its head”—to see practice as having an epistemological dimension, rather than seeing knowledge as giving rise to practice. In outlining this view, we have noted the growing sense that practice is not explicable solely in terms of what is known—or conversely, that practice is solely a matter of putting knowledge into action.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0275074011407404">44</xref></sup> We have noted as well the growing awareness of various ways in which practice is systematically shaped by the contexts within which it takes place—that practice responds to both the constraints and affordances of its native milieu. Even in traditional terms, work on such themes has, at the very least, begun convincingly to show that there are significant elements of practice that are not exhaustively explicable in terms of what is known.</p>
<p>Although noting the importance of such challenges to the Received View, we have argued that ultimately not all that goes on in practice can be explained solely in terms of knowledge and context. Indeed, we hold to the view that practice itself is not passive but active, and that among its active traits is that it gives shape to knowledge and context, that the contents of knowledge and context are accepted, sustained, and modified or rejected through practice. We have argued that this brings us to a point where practice and knowledge can be seen as mutually constitutive, as can practice and context.</p>
<p>At this conceptual juncture, it is our contention that a broader shift needs to be taken—specifically, that knowledge and context need to be seen as artifacts of practice. This includes seeing practice as having an epistemological dimension. We have argued that among the implications of this shift are three key concepts: actionable understanding, ongoing business, and the eternally unfolding present. This shift and the concepts it entails bear both on how we understand the relationship between knowledge and practice theoretically and on how that theory might help redesign applied efforts.</p>
<p>We believe that turning knowledge on its head deserves further exploration conceptually and in practice. There is need, for example, for the epistemological shift we have proposed to be expanded and tested. Systematic application to full case studies would be quite valuable. We ourselves are currently building on the insights from Japanese philosophy to develop a broader theoretical basis for the assessment of cases in public administration and technological innovation (in expanding the concept of actionable understanding, for example, to account for the epistemic dimension of networked human systems). Also, other epistemologies that do not assume that what we know must be placed ahead of what we do might be proposed (along with their accompanying ontologies, when needed) and assessed against what is outlined here. There are several applied areas where the concepts we propose might suggest redesign of traditional approaches. The standard model for training in corporations and public agencies, for example, rests firmly on the Received View: work stops, a period of training ensues (frequently offsite—that is, out of the <italic>basho</italic>), after which employees return to the workplace to put new knowledge into practice (not always with sterling success). Billions are spent annually on training following this model. What might corporate and public agency training look like (and what might its costs be) if work and workplaces were designed to foster learning as part of work practice rather than as an interruption in it?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0275074011407404">45</xref></sup> Similarly, although professional schools often incorporate a training element (from practicals to internships to residencies), the curricula in such schools are often quite divorced from the training. In some cases, the explicit justification for this is the perceived need to master the theory to enable the practice. Although we would not disparage at all the need for professional education that includes absorbing theories and other forms of inherited wisdom or even raw information, we would question the justification. Accordingly, we believe there is room to reexamine the design of professional programs with an eye to greater linkages between the “theory” and “training” elements. Seeing practice as necessary for knowing could be a fruitful point of reference in such redesign. The domain of public policy also reflects the deeply rooted nature of the Received View. The difficulty of accounting for policy implementation and evaluation solely in terms of acquiring and deploying necessary knowledge has by now been well established. The extent to which this difficulty is exacerbated by and persists due to the influence of the Received View has not been sufficiently explored by any means. We believe that reconceptualizing such issues in terms of the practice perspective we have outlined could prove to be a useful contribution to the field. Overall, it is our hope that what we have suggested here is deserving of further exploration.</p>

<p>This is not just a deficit in social theory or public administration. Philosophers have been struggling with the closely related concept of experience, and its relationship with knowledge, since its classical Greek origins. Jay, in his masterful history of the notion of experience in philosophy frames it as a struggle—perhaps oscillation is the better term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0275074011407404">McDowell, 1996</xref>)—between empiricism and idealism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0275074011407404">Jay, 2005</xref>). Since the classical Pragmatists have revived the concept, things have hardly improved. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0275074011407404">Bernstein (2010)</xref>, in his excellent chapter on “Experience after the Linguistic Turn,” observes that “One of the most controversial discussions among historians and feminists has been about whether the so-called linguistic turn displaces the direct appeal to experience” (p. 126). One could even wonder how controversial this issue really is among those who have turned the linguistic or argumentative corner, given the decided preference for obtuse, abstract theory in much interpretive, poststructuralist writing in public administration and public policy analysis.</p>

<p>Of the three “applied” disciplines which deal with collective problem solving—planning, public administration, and public policy analysis—public administration occupies a middle position where it comes to the acknowledgment of the role of practice in explaining what its practitioners do, and in integrating is and ought. Planning has a long-standing affiliation with pragmatist ideas and concepts to the point that these are now integral to much planning theory and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0275074011407404">Friedman, 1973</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0275074011407404">1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0275074011407404">Forester, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0275074011407404">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0275074011407404">Healey, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0275074011407404">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0275074011407404">Hoch, 1994</xref>; Innes &amp; Booher, 2005, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0275074011407404">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0275074011407404">Wagenaar, 2011b</xref>). Policy analysis, by contrast, is still firmly in the grip of the Cartesian world view. While, in the last three decades, hermeneutics and poststructuralism have swept through the theory of public policy, this has done little to integrate notions of practice and experience in understanding what it is that policy makes do, let alone in suggesting what they might do to improve their practices. Flyvbjerg’s book on <italic>phronesis</italic> is a lonely and valiant attempt to turn the tide; whereas Wagenaar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0275074011407404">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0275074011407404">2011a</xref>) has argued for a dialogical approach to policy analysis. Although public administration has also seen its share of poststructuralist theorizing, it has at least experienced an important debate about the contribution of pragmatist thought to the field. Although this debate lacks the breadth and finesse of pragmatist thought in planning, and at times is overtly abstract (such as Harmon’s otherwise admirable book), it tries at least to articulate how core pragmatist concepts such as “experience” would work in public administration, and how common administrative tasks can be reorganized along pragmatist principles (see, in particular, the work of Patricia Shields in this respect). Interestingly, both in American and European public administration there are developments that, although they do not wear their pragmatist credentials on their sleeve, are certainly pragmatist in spirit and practice. We are thinking here of participatory forms of service delivery under the banners of civic capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0275074011407404">de Souza Briggs, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0275074011407404">Stone, Henig, Jones, &amp; Pierannunzi, 2001</xref>) and public value management, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0275074011407404">Stoker, 2006</xref>). Yet in many administrative institutions, one witnesses a depressing gap between the doctrine of public administration (with its all too real implications for administrative design, organizational process, and human resource management) and the practice of public administration “on-the-ground” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0275074011407404">Duiveman, Wagenaar, &amp; Kruiter, 2010</xref>).</p>

<p>We are, in our critique of the Cartesian epistemology, of course, highly indebted to Charles Sanders Peirce. Peirce mostly takes aim at Descartes’ appeal to universal doubt and subjective consciousness as procedures for arriving at certain knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0275074011407404">Peirce, 1992</xref>, ch. 3). But Bernstein rightly concludes that the impact of Peirces’s critique of Descartes has a much wider reach, in effect “(demolishing) the interrelated motifs that constitute Cartesianism.” He then lists these motifs as follows: “the ontological dualism of mind and body; the subjective individualism implicit in the appeal to direct personal verification; the method of universal doubt that is supposed to lead us to incorrigible truths; the conviction that unless we discover firm foundations for knowledge we cannot avoid epistemological skepticism; the belief that knowledge of the world consists of having ideas that correctly represent and correspond to this world; the doctrine that “vagueness” is unreal and that the epistemological endeavor is to know clearly and distinctly a completely determinate reality; and, most fundamentally, that we can break out of language or systems of signs and have direct, immediate knowledge of non-linguistic objects” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0275074011407404">Bernstein, 2010</xref>, p. 18). If we run through this listing of Cartesian dogmas, the tenacity of the Cartesian world view will become immediately obvious.</p>

<label>8.</label>
<p>One challenge in addressing traditional epistemology is that we automatically evoke a series of deeply embedded dichotomies that underlie how we see ourselves in relation to the world. We think here of such common dualisms as actor versus context, structure versus agency, mind versus body, knowledge and action, pure and applied knowledge, language and experience, and fact and value –dichotomies that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0275074011407404">Harmon (2006)</xref>, for example, so tirelessly challenges in public administration. In keeping with what we have said above, there is a tendency to assume a particular ordering of self and world, knower and known, which we argue hardly holds in the experience of ordinary people acting in and with the world. The problems engendered by such dualities are too extensive to discuss in any detail here. To do justice to its their many ramifications, which all resonate with each other in complex and often unexpected patterns, would require a separate publication. We would mention here just a few points that are relevant to the theme of this article. The mind–body duality directly descends very strongly from the representationalism of the 17th-century scientific revolution. The challenge has been framed as liberation from religious and metaphysical superstition that affords an epistemically correct and truthful representation of an observer-independent external reality. This set in motion a host of reactions, some of which remain at play to this very day. One is the intense proceduralism of traditional epistemology deriving centrally from Descartes’ attempts to secure confidence in the outcomes of one’s thinking, and his conflation of truth and justification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0275074011407404">Toulmin, 1990</xref>). As is well-known, reason came to be firmly tied to following carefully prescribed procedures, to the point that in much of modern, established epistemology, reason and rationality are synonymous with following methodological procedure. A second is the disappearance of the body from awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0275074011407404">Leder, 1990</xref>). The act of knowing is understood to take place in the mind—although this has been increasingly challenged by the need to account for the role of the body in various forms of knowing. This is seen in such everyday experiences as “muscle memory” or the disappearance into the background of subtle skills of judgment and motion in the course of learning a complex skill such as sailing or driving a car (even in the realm of mental experience, we must account for the likes of Proust’s fabled “madeleine”). Another ramification of the disappearance of the body from awareness is the primacy that is accorded to language as something that is both opposed to and superior to experience—consider the “text metaphor” in hermeneutics, anthropology, and the social sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0275074011407404">Ricoeur, 1977</xref>). There is a tendency here to treat language as a representation of experience, as if experience cannot be “known” in any other way and can only be mediated by language. There has been something of an eclipse of the notion that language is itself a modality of “being-in-the world” (and a very important one for self-reflective beings) working alongside and in interaction with other modalities in constituting ourselves as the oriented, engaged agents we are (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0275074011407404">Csordas, 1995</xref>, p. 11). It is this crisscrossing of such deeply burrowed predilections and assumptions that make it particularly difficult to find a clear, unencumbered language for stating an alternative perspective.</p>

<p>We are certainly not the only ones who struggle with the conditioning effects of the concepts and language of the Received View when discussing practice. In her important and thoughtful book, <italic>The Body Multiple</italic>, the Dutch philosopher–anthropologist Annemarie Mol, for example, discusses the various terms that are in use for moving away from a “realist” perspective of (social) science and the subject–object dichotomy. After discussing, and rejecting, performance and construction, she finally settles for enacting:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>This, then, may be a way out of the dichotomy between the knowing subject and the objects-that-are-known: to spread the activity of knowing widely. To spread it out over tables, knives, records, microscopes, buildings, and other things or habits in which it is embedded. Instead of talking about subjects <italic>knowing</italic> objects we may, then, as a next step, come to talk about <italic>enacting</italic> reality in practice.

<label>10.</label>
<p>There are, of course, historical antecedents to the idea that practice can have a role in what and how we know, and such antecedents have been increasingly explored in contemporary social theory and social science (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0275074011407404">Flyvbjerg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0275074011407404">Harmon, 2006</xref>, p. 65). Of particular value in recent years has been work building on Aristotle’s concept of <italic>phronesis</italic> or practical wisdom, acting well or appropriately in a given situation (in a casual sense, this is akin to <italic>savoir fare</italic>). <italic>Phronesis</italic> is acquired over time and through experience. It involves the ability to generalize over a set of past situations in determining how best to act in a present one. Although <italic>phronesis</italic> points to the idea of knowledge acquired and refined in practice, ultimately that knowledge can still (and often is) treated as making <italic>phronesis</italic> possible: one acquires over time, knowledge that enables one to act in ways that display <italic>phronesis</italic>. So as a general rule, this remains within the Received View’s privileging of knowledge as prior to and enabling of practice.</p>

<p>Oakeshott captures this very effectively in a comparison with cooking:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It might be supposed that an ignorant man, some edible materials, and a cookery book compose together the necessities of a self-moved (or concrete) activity called cooking. But nothing is further from the truth. The cookery book is not an independently generated beginning from which cooking can spring; it is nothing more than an abstract of somebody’s knowledge of how to cook: it is the stepchild, not the parent of the activity . . . .(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0275074011407404">Oakeshott, 1962</xref>)</p>

<p>We argue for this as follows. Imagine, for example, a musical instrument technician adjusting the key mechanism on a flute. The key mechanism is a system of levers whose tension is set by a number of pin springs. For the mechanism to work and feel right, the tension on the springs has to be set properly. This is something a master technician must be able to do, and an apprentice must learn. A master technician might <italic>know that</italic> a particular spring should be set somewhere between X and Y grams of resistance as measured with a tension gauge. Since this is something that can be said, it is an <italic>explicit</italic> form of <italic>knowing-that</italic>. The technician must also be able to judge exactly where between X and Y that spring needs to be set: at some point he or she will <italic>know that</italic> the key feels right. But the subjective feeling is not something he or she can express explicitly, so this bit of <italic>knowing-that</italic> is <italic>tacit</italic> (the technician might say “now it feels right,” but this is a report about the spring being set properly, not a report of what the feeling actually is). Importantly, what enables the technician to <italic>know that</italic> the key feels right rests with his or her ability to judge the feel of keys—this is something the technician <italic>knows how</italic> to do, but this knowledge is not something he or she can say (as with <italic>knowing that</italic> the key feels right). This is an example of <italic>knowing-how</italic> that is <italic>tacit</italic> (it is important to note that <italic>knowing-how</italic> to judge the feel of keys and <italic>knowing-that</italic> a particularly key feels right are two different things: one is the ability to judge, the other is making a particular judgment). Finally, we would note there are all kinds of things people <italic>explicitly</italic> say related to what they <italic>know how</italic> to do. These would be examples of <italic>know-how</italic> that is <italic>explicit</italic>. It is important to note the nature of this kind of knowledge. Things said here are not expressed in forms whose truth or falsity can be determined (in contrast to <italic>explicit</italic> forms of <italic>knowing-that</italic>). They are not simply reports of what we <italic>know how</italic> to do. Rather, they constitute a form of knowledge expressed in the likes of metaphors and images (they are explicit, but not literal). So, the technician might say judging keys entails having a sense of the way “they are kind of bouncy” or that it’s “like pressing on a balloon.” Anyone who has taken lessons in a sport or in musical performance will be familiar with an abundance of metaphors and images teachers use to express <italic>explicitly</italic> things that are intimately linked to (but which cannot be reduced to) the performance of skills—to <italic>tacit</italic> know-how. When a vocal coach says “as you sing that phrase, let the air come out like a stream of water flowing over your tongue,” the singer must come to <italic>know how</italic> to use this <italic>explicit</italic> expression in a way that is coordinated with what he or she <italic>knows how</italic> to do <italic>tacitly</italic> when singing. Tacit forms of knowing-that (like the technician knowing-that “the key now feels right”) are, of course, acquired over time, they are, indeed, one of the hallmarks of acquired expertise. This, we note in passing, calls into question Ryle’s contention that it is only knowing-how and not knowing-that which is learned over time.</p>

<p>At best, we can try to control some elements of context to make it work for us. We can, for example, apply heat to iron ore so that we extract the pure iron and mold it into a desired shape.

<p>The term <italic>setting</italic> thus transcends the dichotomy between context as a fixed, observer-independent, system of structures and constraints impinging on the actor and the ethnomethodological notion of context as purely constructed in the interactive experiences of actors. Setting encompasses both. Describing the way housewives purposefully move about in a supermarket, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0275074011407404">Lave (1988)</xref> formulates the notion of setting as follows:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>On the one hand, context connotes an identifiable, durable framework for activity, with properties that transcend the experience of individuals, exist prior to them, and are entirely beyond their control. On the other hand, context is experienced differently by different individuals. The apparently contradictory features of the term may be accounted for by recognizing that in ordinary usage context refers to relations between arena and setting rather than to a single entity. There is a distinction to be made here between the constraints imposed by the supermarket as arena and the constructable, malleable nature of the setting in relation with the activity of particular shoppers. Because a social order and the experience of it mutually entail one another, there are limits on both the obdurate and malleable aspects of every context. A setting is generated out of a person’s grocery-shopping activity and at the same time generates that activity. (p. 151)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Lave’s words are echoed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0275074011407404">Stolcis (2004)</xref> when he describes the everyday practice of administrators:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Contemporary public administration practice operates in a problem-solving fashion within the framework of its constitutional authority. Part of the practice of modern governance is in determining the boundaries of our constitutional and legal authority and in crafting realistic problem-solving strategies that respect these boundaries. This is the coin of the practice realm. Responsible practitioners quickly learn to successfully operate and administer within the confines of their constitutional authority. Those who do not master this skill typically have a brief, and often unhappy, career in the practice world. (p. 364)</p>

<p>It is this duality, being simultaneously inside our conventions and out there in the world, that Dewey aims to capture in his central concept of “experience”—and, we should add, has frequently been misunderstood by his critics as constituting some kind of foundationalism (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0275074011407404">Miller, 2004</xref>). What makes an experience the experience it is for Dewey is what he calls its “pervasive quality,” something that is immediately felt and that is unique to that particular experience. In that sense, experiences are not just subjective or mere words that could have been otherwise. Yet, what makes an experience an experience for a particular person, that makes it stand out from the flow of random noise around us, and that makes it indubitably manifest itself as an experience, is the history of the interaction of a particular actor and her environment. It is this interaction, stretched out in emergent time and suffused with the purposes of the actor that gives experiences their unique, urgent character (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0275074011407404">Dewey, 1994</xref>.

<p>A number of implications follow from this approach to practice that deserve emphasis. First, it is a clear instance of the general <italic>antidualism</italic> of Dewey’s (and Lave’s) position. With his use of the term <italic>situation</italic>, he suggests what can be taken as an ecological view of the relation of actor and his or her environment. According to Dewey, there exists a strong continuity between actor and environment. Actors are not distinct objects, but form, with their environment, a “living system”, or as Burke, an astute Dewey scholar, characterizes it, “a dynamic system incorporating both organismic and environmental elements, with some sort of built-in impetus towards self-maintenance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0275074011407404">Burke, 1994</xref>, p. 27). The Deweyan heritage can be found as well in Engeström’s concept of an activity system, in Wengers concept of a “community of practice,” and in Vicker’s notion of an “appreciative system” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0275074011407404">Engeström, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0275074011407404">Vickers, 1965/1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0275074011407404">Wenger, 1998</xref>). Practices are thus not just a patterned fabric of activities, but also contain the spaces and artifacts that are necessary to fulfill the practice. For example, the practice of teaching requires a classroom, a black board, textbooks, and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0275074011407404">Elmore, 1996</xref>). Second, it is important to observe that such conversations with the world involve engagement with the task at hand and active participation in the community that forms the social setting of that activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0275074011407404">Vickers, 1965/1995</xref>). This implies that practice involves the whole person instead of a disengaged actor who receives information or acquires knowledge about preexisting objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0275074011407404">Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991</xref>). Engaging in practice implies that the actor’s identity is involved. But, to avoid misunderstanding at this point, identity should not be understood in its familiar subjective meaning but in a social sense. That is, we define our identity in terms of our experiences with membership in various groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0275074011407404">Wenger, 1998</xref>).</p>

<p>There are, of course, themes within Western philosophy that to a degree resonate with the view we are proposing here. One might even be tempted to find examples of this in such classical icons as Descartes’s <italic>cogito ergo sum</italic> and Kant’s treatment of noumena and phenomena. However, the net effect of the Western view, as we have noted, treats epistemology as primary and characterizes knowledge as prior to and enabling of practice. Our aim in making use of Nishida is to help counterbalance this net effect. In the West, even those who may propose a thought experiment that, like Descartes’s, begins with experience, typically end up offering a positivist ontology in keeping with an epistemology that makes knowledge a prerequisite for understanding the world and acting on it. There seems to be a predilection to believe that it is in getting our epistemological house in order that we are then able to address matters of ontology, practice, and so on. Charles Taylor characterizes this as a kind of doctrine whose assumptions “give epistemology pride of place. These are assumptions Descartes gave articulation to; central is the view that we can somehow come to grips with the problem of knowledge, and then later proceed to determine what we can legitimately say about other things: about God, or the world, or human life. From Descartes’s standpoint, this seems not only a <italic>possible</italic> way to proceed, but the only <italic>defensible</italic> way. Because, after all, whatever we say about God or the world represents a knowledge claim. So, first we ought to be clear about the nature of knowledge, and about what it is to make a “defensible claim” (Taylor, 1995, p. vii). This predilection does not obtain in Nishida. Although the Cartesian <italic>cogito ergo sum</italic> characterizes being as entailed in thought, Nishida begins first and always with an undifferentiated consciousness (or “nothingness”) within which both being and thought are then created. It is this that helps to provide a foothold for understanding practice—at root, the generative activities of consciousness—as prior to what we know and to the world that we construct.</p>
