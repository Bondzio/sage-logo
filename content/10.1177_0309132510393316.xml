<abstract>
<p>This report offers a comparative perspective on the nature of youth agency in different parts of the world, demonstrating how ‘youth’ can provide a window on subaltern responses to economic restructuring. I outline key points about the theorization of agency within human geography and then describe the importance of young people’s resistance. I then discuss young people’s resourcefulness as a form of agency as well as ‘negative agency’: instances in which children and youth reproduce and deepen dominant structures of power. Finally, I identify a need to reflect further on the social nature of young people’s action and the importance of humour and irreverence in youth practice.</p>

<title>I Introduction</title>
<p>While carrying out research on student activism in north India, I met a young man called Jaipal. He was in his late twenties in 2005 and belonged to the middle-ranking Jat caste. Jaipal referred to himself as unemployed (<italic>berozgār</italic>), but studied in a university in Meerut City. Politics was Jaipal’s metier. He was often at the forefront of collective student demonstrations against the university bureaucracy. A typical morning might find him leading protests against the corruption (<italic>bhrashtāchār</italic>) of university bigwigs or barracking a neglectful college bureaucrat. But, come the evening, Jaipal often went to the homes of university administrators to collude over how to make money from illegal admissions. It was an open secret in Meerut that many student leaders protested alongside other students against ‘corruption’ while also making money through nefarious means. Everyone knew that Jaipal could ‘get things done’.</p>
<p>The idea that ‘young people have agency’ has become a type of mantra within social science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0309132510393316">Durham, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0309132510393316">Katz, 2004</xref>). We are now well accustomed to reading stories of children and youth who protest against injustice, often in difficult circumstances, or who express agency simply through their own resourcefulness. What is much less clear is why this matters for human geography. What I want to suggest in this progress report – the second in a series of three – is that an examination of the practices of young people aged between 8 and 30 can act as a lens through which to apprehend the spatial nature of resistance, multiple forms of agency, and the social and often mischievous character of subaltern action. I examine the question of theorizing agency (section II), multiple scales of resistance (section III), and different forms of young people’s resourcefulness (section IV). I then return more centrally to the questions posed by the example of Jaipal and examine the deeply contradictory nature of much youth agency (section V) and the social and irreverent nature of young people’s social practice (section VI).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0309132510393316">
<title>II Theorizing agency</title>
<p>Scholars have made great strides recently in emphasizing the varying manner in which marginalized populations, including young people, pursue their goals in different places (see especially <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309132510393316">Coe and Jordhus-Lier, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0309132510393316">Katz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0309132510393316">Shakya and Rankin, 2008</xref>). Three key analytical points about agency can be distilled from this body of work. First, scholars have come to imagine agency in relation to multiple structures of dominance rather than with respect to a single form of oppression, for example with reference solely to capitalism. Youth agency can only be apprehended by understanding how children and youth navigate plural, intersecting structures of power, including, for example, neoliberal economic change, governmental disciplinary regimes, and global hierarchies of educational capital (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0309132510393316">Katz, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, scholars have shown that the nature of ‘agency’ and young people’s capacity to act positively in relation to surrounding structures varies a great deal across space and time. In the present global conjuncture there are good reasons for re-emphasizing marked spatial variations in the quality of education, level of familial support, and job opportunities available for young people and hence their capacity for effective agency (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0309132510393316">Lloyd, 2005</xref>). Scholars have also shown that structures in a particular place do not press down on people in an even way over time. Structures not only shift in their nature and intensity with the passing of time, they also become more or less salient at particular extended ‘moments' in people’s lives (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0309132510393316">Jeffrey, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0309132510393316">Johnson-Hanks, 2002</xref>). As I noted in my first report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0309132510393316">Jeffrey, 2010a</xref>), recent scholarship on children and young people in geography and related disciplines often suggests that young people face especially daunting challenges – and in a sense ‘discover’ or ‘perform’ their agency – during specific durations in their biographies, such as the early years of secondary school, after dropping out of school, or when confronting educated unemployment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0309132510393316">Johnson-Hanks, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>A third recent initiative in studies of childhood and youth has been to reflect on what if anything might be distinctively interesting about young people’s agency relative, for example, to the agency of older adults. To grapple with this question is to engage with one of the most baffling paradoxes of contemporary globalization. On the one hand, the dismantling of the welfare state in many countries, restructuring of families, and extension of free-market economic measures have constrained the agency of young people in different sites. On the other hand, young people are becoming centrally involved in a range of disparate, and sometimes complexly linked, forms of action. Writing nearly 80 years ago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0309132510393316">Karl Mannheim (1972</xref> [1936]: 108–109) famously argued that each generation experiences a ‘fresh contact’ with their social and natural environment, and he emphasized young people’s proclivity for ‘state-of-the-art’ cultural and social practices. But even Mannheim would be perplexed by the intensity of young people’s contemporary assertion, from strikingly new efforts to fashion youth cultures (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0309132510393316">Cole and Durham, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0309132510393316">Lukose, 2005</xref>), to novel types of economic activity and ‘hustle’ (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0309132510393316">Mains, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0309132510393316">Roitman, 2004</xref>), to innovative political mobilization of various hues (see Honwana and de Boeck, 2005). Perhaps one of the inevitable consequences of this curious combination of young people’s subordination and assertion is that people in their teens and twenties have become fetishized within the popular media as heroes and zeroes, innocent and guilty – the problem and the panacea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309132510393316">Alexander, 2009</xref>). This is not only true of the West (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0309132510393316">Comaroff and Comaroff, 2005</xref>), and nor of course is it new (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0309132510393316">McDowell, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>III Scales of resistance</title>
<p>What are young people doing in the face of these threats to their security, respect, and livelihoods? Some, like Jaipal, are engaged at least for part of the time in collective protest. It is clear that young people have been in the vanguard of some extraordinary historical changes since the early 1980s. There is now a large literature that examines, for example, the ‘young lions' of the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309132510393316">Bundy, 1987</xref>), the youthful provocateurs of the campaigns against neoliberal economic change in South America in the early 2000s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0309132510393316">Harriss, 2003</xref>), and the young, energetic demonstrators of the global anti-capitalist movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0309132510393316">Juris and Pleyers, 2009</xref>). There is an equally important literature on the myriad, often subtle, ways in which young people exercise resistance on an everyday basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0309132510393316">Waters, 2004</xref>), engage politically with family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0309132510393316">Crotty et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0309132510393316">Skelton, 2008</xref>), and politicize aspects of their developing gendered and sexualized identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0309132510393316">Tucker, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent geographic literature points to four intersecting levels or sociospatial scales of political action. First, there have been several recent studies of how young people negotiate with senior kin, typically within the home. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0309132510393316">Skelton (2008)</xref> has described the attempts of a lesbian young woman in the UK to confront negative stereotypes associated with her sexuality, especially with respect to her relationship with her parents – a process that entailed reflection on the nature of ‘home’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0309132510393316">Johanna Waters (2004)</xref> has examined how young people who have migrated away from home may in their new situation acquire opportunities to resist parental projects. Second, there have been a number of studies of resistance that reflect on how the urban neighbourhood comes to feature in young people’s politics. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309132510393316">Fernando Bosco (2010)</xref> has documented the day-to-day activities of children who assist their mothers in community advocacy work in an area close to San Diego, charting their efforts to raise money and provide social support within the household. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0309132510393316">Andrew Tucker (2009)</xref> has conducted research with gay young men in Cape Town, South Africa, who contested dominant notions of sexuality through public acts of intimacy at various ‘social nodes' around the city. In a somewhat similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0309132510393316">Driskell et al. (2008)</xref> show that neighbourhood spaces served as a resource for youth in New York City keen to improve their locality. Young people acquired experience and confidence in the city through such simple acts as installing garbage cans on a street corner or improving a playground, successes that – once inscribed on the landscape – could provide the inspiration for future political acts.</p>
<p>A third set of studies focus on young people’s involvement in creating political networks that are translocal but remain in some sense regional in nature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0309132510393316">Andrew Burridge’s (2010)</xref> work on the emergence in 2007 of the No Borders Movement in a region straddling the boundary between the USA and Mexico offers an example. Burridge shows that young people campaigned against state violence towards illegal immigrants to the USA through constructing camps on each side of the national border, which served as seed-beds for further protest. Paralleling Burridge’s work in certain respects, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0309132510393316">Michelle Fine (2007)</xref> describes how students from different school districts in New Jersey and New York came together to critique the hidden curriculum within many US schools. Fine and collaborators brought students from different social and geographical backgrounds into contact within ‘research spaces' where they learned about each other’s views and experiences and developed roles as organic intellectuals (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0309132510393316">Gramsci, 1971</xref>).</p>
<p>A fourth area of research focuses on global forms of youth mobilization. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0309132510393316">Juris and Pleyers (2009)</xref> have used ethnographic fieldwork with young people involved in global justice movements in Europe and North America to propose that a new form of ‘alter-activism’ emerged in the 1990s and 2000s. Alter-activism is distinct from other forms of protest in its commitment to establishing links among young people in diverse transcontinental settings, through the use of new media, specially designed political ‘camps', and direct action broadcast on the web. The potential of the web to open up new possibilities for youth mobilization is a broader theme of recent work. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0309132510393316">Valentine and Holloway (2002)</xref> describe a project to bring children in New Zealand and the UK into conversation via the internet. The initiative fostered a new level of understanding among school pupils about the differences and similarities between young people’s lives in the two quite different sites.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0309132510393316">
<title>IV Forms of resourcefulness</title>
<p>Another key point emerging from recent geographical and anthropological writing is that young people’s agency takes multiple forms, often departing from open resistance (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0309132510393316">Durham, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0309132510393316">Katz, 2004</xref>). Resourcefulness is an especially common topic in recent studies. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0309132510393316">Tatiana Thieme (2010)</xref> shows how young people in Nairobi, Kenya, responded to a depressed economic environment by becoming involved in community-managed garbage collection and toilet cleaning ventures – initiatives supported by a Non-Governmental Organization and private company. This youth work involved both subversion – for example, youths sometimes found it expedient to break the rules by dumping waste material in public areas – and more concerted efforts to critique the state’s approach to urban planning in Nairobi. In research with girls in the Indian Himalayas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309132510393316">Jane Dyson (2008)</xref> also charts the manner in which young people sometimes subvert dominant norms. Dyson builds on the work of Bakhtin on carnival to suggest that girls challenged local notions of appropriate femininity while collecting lichen in the forests surrounding their village. In marked contrast to the demure form of behaviour expected of them in the presence of their parents, they played rough games, talked openly about their developing sexuality, and exchanged ribald jokes.</p>
<p>The resourcefulness of young people often resides in their ability simply to survive, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0309132510393316">Katz (2004)</xref> has demonstrated in her study of household reproduction, intergenerational relations, and globalization in Sudan and New York. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0309132510393316">Jennings et al. (2006)</xref> elaborate on this theme when describing how young people in California are able to acquire new skills, social connections, and a certain know-how through working part-time in supermarkets in the face of a shortage of other opportunities. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0309132510393316">Linda McDowell (2003)</xref> suggests that young people in northern England excluded from good work were often able to obtain relatively stable forms of employment and build social links. The theme of resourcefulness also surfaces in recent work in the global south. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0309132510393316">Kate Swanson (2009)</xref> has described how Andean children have responded to diminished prospects in rural areas by migrating to Ecuador’s largest cities to beg. Swanson conceptualizes begging as a means through which young people build social networks and acquire money to finance their schooling. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0309132510393316">Samantha Punch (2007)</xref> has made parallel observations in work on young people’s seasonal migration from southern Bolivia to Argentina to obtain work in the informal economy, jobs which become crucial to the establishment of reputations of competence and success. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309132510393316">Tatek Adebe (2007)</xref> offers further evidence of resourcefulness in research with children in Ethiopia, who have negotiated shifts in rural livelihoods through developing entrepreneurial skills in domestic work and trade.</p>
<p>These accounts deepen our understanding of the temporality of young people’s agency. Within the scholarly literature, children’s agency is often conceptualized in terms of ‘tactics' – immediate responses to the vagaries of fluid events – rather than orchestrated ‘strategies' aimed at long-term change (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0309132510393316">de Certeau, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0309132510393316">Honwana, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0309132510393316">Vigh, 2006</xref>). But <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0309132510393316">Swanson (2009)</xref>, for example, points to highly strategic forms of long-term planning among children and youth.</p>
<p>Recent work on young people’s everyday agency also tells us a great deal about space and place. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0309132510393316">Lorraine Van Blerk (2006)</xref>, in a study of child workers in Kamapala, Uganda, showed that children’s capacity to establish themselves in informal work was linked to their sense of spatial security. Children survived in Kampala by establishing ‘niche spaces' in the city that served as markers of belonging and foundations for accumulation strategies. This point also comes across in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0309132510393316">Kristina Gibson’s (2008)</xref> study of the survival strategies of Blacc, a homeless young man in New York. Gibson shows how Blacc managed his marginalization within the city through an array of tactics – ‘fighting and laying low, independence and sticking together’ – that entailed a constant search for places of protection as well as incessant movement about the city.</p>
<p>What also emerges strongly out of these studies is the value of a grounded approach to the analysis of young people’s practices, one sensitive to the importance of space not as a static container for action but as actively entangled in the drama of youth in practice. Here is an opportunity for geographers to influence wider social science debates: by breathing new life into the Mannheimian language of ‘fresh contact’ to examine precisely what this contact might mean in terms of young people’s relationship to materials, technologies, and spatial ideas. More broadly, recent work on young people’s resourcefulness illustrates the central importance of children and youth to an understanding of economic globalization, new informal economies, and household reproduction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0309132510393316">
<title>V Negative agency</title>
<p>Up to this point I have rehearsed examples of young people’s agency that geographers have tended to support. But many geographers and anthropologists have highlighted how forms of dominant power often characterize youth action. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0309132510393316">Burridge (2010)</xref> in his research on the No Borders Movement describes how tensions between the camps on the Mexican and US sides of the border quickly became apparent. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0309132510393316">Juris and Pleyers (2009)</xref> suggest that global networks of activism exclude children and youth from poorer backgrounds at the very moment at which they seek to challenge the status quo. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0309132510393316">Dyson (2010)</xref>, young women’s friendship networks in north India are a critical resource for girls struggling to cope with burdensome work and also a means through which young women police each other’s behaviour and reinforce performative hierarchies of femininity. What appears to be occurring in the work of Burridge, Juris and Pleyers, and Dyson are different varieties of rehierarchicalization.</p>
<p>It is not just that dominance fragments progressive projects, but also that young people are engaged in reactionary strategies that sustain and replenish established power structures. This is evident in an emerging literature on privileged youth. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0309132510393316">Waters and Brooks (2010)</xref> have documented the social and spatial strategies through which young people in the UK seek international educational opportunities thus reproducing class inequalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0309132510393316">Waters and Brooks, 2010</xref>). It is evident too among poorer and lower middle-class young people. For example, my work in north India charts the manner in which young men excluded from secure employment act as brokers between government educational institutions and private educational entrepreneurs in the supply of licences, and disbursement of college seats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0309132510393316">Jeffrey, 2010b</xref>). Men like Jaipal profit from the neoliberalization of higher education even while they continue in other contexts to engage in subaltern protest against educational commercialization and corruption. In a somewhat similar manner, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0309132510393316">Oskar Verkaaik (2004)</xref> shows in his ethnography of the Muhajir Qaumi Movement in Pakistan that urban youth, distinct from older sections of society, imagine large-scale ethnic-religious violence as an opportunity for self-assertion and ‘fun’. These Muslim young men simultaneously contest, negotiate, and deepen social inequalities based upon gender, class, and religious affiliation. Such observations challenge the argument that the oppressed slowly detach themselves from dominant ideas during the course of political mobilization (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0309132510393316">Freire, 2000</xref>) and the opposite notion that democratic movements gradually become complicit with power – young people’s social practices are often simultaneously progressive and reactionary.</p>
<p>Two further points emerge here. First, it is important to note that young people’s involvement in reproducing and deepening established structures of power is never a consequence of their being simply brainwashed into doing what capitalism and associated disciplinary regimes tell them they should do. For example, people in different parts of the world, including children and youth, who imagine themselves as entrepreneurs typically build up this sense of self by creatively engaging with free market discourses circulated by the state and other institutions, and they also often draw on local notions of shrewdness and enterprise. Second, to observe that young people are involved in both reactionary and progressive action inevitably provokes questions about scholars' own positionality. I will engage with this issue in more detail in the final progress report, but I want to note here that any attempt to contrast the practices of young men like Jaipal with a somehow purer form of youth political action risks obscuring the extent to which political action always involves compromise. As one of Jaipal’s friends put it, ‘I am just doing ordinary politics'.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0309132510393316">
<title>VI Concluding thoughts: Social agency and humour</title>
<p>Young people are commonly embroiled in vibrant forms of action at the local level that allow them and their families to endure difficult conditions and sometimes challenge pernicious structures, insights that emerge especially clearly in recent work on ‘vital conjunctures' – critical durations of social crisis – in the global south. Children and youth culturally produce and reimagine local places and are also increasingly implicated in regional and global mobilizations. At the same time, young people are often perpetuating established structures of power. They do so not through simply imitating past practices but by developing reinvigorated reactionary practices.</p>
<p>The further significance of recent work on young people’s agency is twofold. First, a comparative focus on children’s and youths' practices offers a challenge to the overly individualized accounts of agency which dominate social science thinking in the West. Much of the classic writing on agency, emerging out of the Marxist or romantic traditions, emphasized striking acts of individual and heroic resistance (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0309132510393316">Mahmood, 2005</xref>). In a somewhat similar vein, the anthropological and sociological youth literature of the 1980s and 1990s tended to link young people’s agency to the capacity to carve out spaces of individual assertion independent of adult worlds and convention (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0309132510393316">Durham, 2008</xref>). But recent studies of children and youth highlight the deeply social nature of young people’s agency. Young people are able to endure hardships, rework structures, and resist oppression precisely through forming bonds with other young people and with older adults. Young people in many contexts equate agency with the cultivation of interdependencies rather than individual action and autonomy. Change in this analysis often occurs through a form of capillary action or ‘warrening from within’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0309132510393316">Thompson, 1963</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, spirited mischief and irreverence frequently surface in accounts of young people’s tactics in varied global settings (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0309132510393316">de Certeau, 1984</xref>), possibly reflecting young people’s proximity to early childhood. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0309132510393316">Verkaaik (2004)</xref> argues that fun and horseplay are the primary mechanisms through which Muslim youth in urban Pakistan perform and imagine their agency. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0309132510393316">Kate Swanson’s (2009)</xref> account of the informal economy in urban Ecuador contains many references to the humour and mischief displayed by children on the street. In the West, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0309132510393316">Hopkins (2008)</xref> offers insights into how Scottish Muslim youth use humour to defuse racial tension, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0309132510393316">Bourgois's (1995)</xref> analysis of Harlem youth is woven through with references to how humour works to reproduce and contest gender and racial inequalities.</p>
<p>Social agency and humour are but two interesting issues among many emerging topics. The further elaboration of connecting themes in the study of global youth depends crucially on a continued supply of the type of engaged, fine-grained qualitative studies reviewed in this paper. It is worthwhile emphasizing this point in a context in which fewer and fewer scholars have the time, inclination, and funding to conduct prolonged ethnographic fieldwork. How do we build up a long-term picture of young people’s changing practices? How do we best connect individual in-depth studies in ways that are generative intellectually and practically? And how do we learn and practise new collectives and collaborations? These are some of the questions I will take up in the final report.</p>
