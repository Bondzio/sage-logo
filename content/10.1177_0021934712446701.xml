<abstract>
<p>The practice of skin bleaching, or chemically lightening the skin, has become more common worldwide in the past 30 years. In Africa, the practice is especially problematic, because caustic ingredients are combined with bleaching products, increasing the risk for health problems, such as irreversible skin damage, cancers, and liver or kidney failure. Despite these risks, skin bleaching remains prevalent, with rates nearing 30% in East Africa. The few interventions implemented to prevent skin bleaching show marginal success in decreasing these numbers. This study takes steps to identify the most effective means of prevention for a Tanzanian community where skin bleaching practices are prevalent. A team of 20 Tanzanians worked toward this goal using participatory research techniques. Results yielded components for the structure of an ideal intervention program, including (a) didactic education, (b) governmental action, and (c) educational media. Implications for practice, policy, and research are discussed.</p>

<p>With increasing popularity over the past 30 years, skin bleaching has become one of the most common forms of potentially harmful body modification practices in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021934712446701">Charles, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021934712446701">Hall, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021934712446701">Mahé, Ly, Aymard, &amp; Dangou, 2003</xref>). Skin bleaching is the application of topical creams, gels, soaps, and household products (e.g., toothpaste, bleach, washing powder, battery acid) to the skin in an effort to lighten one’s complexion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021934712446701">Boyle &amp; Kennedy, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021934712446701">Mahé et al., 2003</xref>). Commonly, these bleaching agents contain mercury, lead, steroids, hydroquinone, glucocorticoids, and other toxic agents that put users at risk for developing serious health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021934712446701">Boyle &amp; Kennedy, 1985</xref>), including irreversible skin damage, such as skin lesions; epidermal atrophy (wasting of the epidermal layer of the skin); exogenous ochronisis (a blue-black discoloration); skin irritations, such as eczema and bacterial and fungal infections (e.g., scabies or acne); various cancers (skin cancer and leukemia); and liver and kidney disease or failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021934712446701">Mahé et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021934712446701">Ramsay, Goddard, Gill, &amp; Moss, 2003</xref>). The dangers of skin bleaching are maximized when users mix bleaching creams with household chemicals, such as toothpaste, washing powder, or battery acid, a practice common in many African countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021934712446701">Ajose, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021934712446701">Pitché, Kombaté, &amp; Tchangai-Walla, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>While current research addresses the prevalence, patterns of use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021934712446701">Fokuo, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021934712446701">Hall, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021934712446701">Pierre, 2008</xref>), consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021934712446701">Ajose, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021934712446701">Ly et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021934712446701">Mahé et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021934712446701">Olumide et al., 2008</xref>), and most recently, the motivations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021934712446701">Kpanake, Muñoz Sastre, &amp; Mullet, 2010</xref>) for skin bleaching, recent government bans on the sale and distribution of skin-bleaching products open new avenues of research to study compliance, interventions, and persistence. Given the inability of these government bans to effectively prevent skin bleaching, current studies emphasize the need to investigate other strategies aimed at prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021934712446701">Dadzie &amp; Petit, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021934712446701">Hall, 2010</xref>). This study explores the most effective means for disseminating skin-bleaching prevention messages in Tanzania, where the practice is widespread.</p>
<sec id="section1-0021934712446701">
<title>Background on Skin Bleaching in Africa</title>
<p>The global production and sale of skin bleaching products is a multibillion dollar industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021934712446701">Glenn, 2008</xref>), and skin bleaching in much of Africa is a common practice. Skin-bleaching rates in African cities vary, with documented prevalence ranging from 25% in Bamako, Mali (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021934712446701">“Trend of Women,” 2001</xref>), to 60% among specific populations in Lusaka, Zambia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021934712446701">Pitché et al., 2005</xref>). Although there are some men who engage in the practice, typically, women have composed the largest group of skin bleach users in Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021934712446701">Ajose, 2005</xref>). Skin bleaching has historically been most prevalent among younger, rural, and/or poor women; however, the demographic of people who practice skin bleaching in Africa has been shifting since the 1970s. The past several decades have seen a rise in use among older, more educated, and cosmopolitan Black women as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021934712446701">Glenn, 2008</xref>), although more rural and poorer women still make up the majority of users.</p>
<p>For many African women, having a lighter skin tone has been equated with youth and beauty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021934712446701">Pitché et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021934712446701">Lewis, Robkin, Gaska, &amp; Njoki, 2011</xref>) also found that Tanzanian women have six chief reasons for engaging in skin bleaching practices, including (a) to remove pimples, rashes, and skin disease, (b) to have soft skin, (c) to be white, “beautiful,” and more European looking, (d) to remove the adverse affects of extended skin-bleaching use on the body, (e) to satisfy one’s partner and/or attract mates of the opposite sex, and (f) to satisfy or impress peers. These key motivations have been conceptually tied to remnants of slavery, colonization, and globalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021934712446701">Lewis et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section2-0021934712446701">
<title>Preventing Skin Bleaching</title>
<p>While the detrimental health effects and key motivations of skin bleaching are well documented, dangerous skin-bleaching products are readily available at low prices and over the counter in many African cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021934712446701">Mahé et al., 2003</xref>). With many people still engaging in this practice, discovering new means to curb the use of skin-bleaching products and prevent dangerous health consequences remains a pressing area of inquiry. One current strategy is changing governmental policy around the sale and distribution of dangerous skin-bleaching products. In response to the prevalence of skin bleaching in African nations, the governments of Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and Zimbabwe banned the import and sale of skin-bleaching products that contain mercury and hydroquinone.</p>
<p>In 2003, the Tanzanian Food and Drug Authority (TFDA) also banned the “manufacture, sale, supply, and distribution” of 168 different skin-bleaching products containing prohibited ingredients, such as hydroquinone, steroids, and mercury compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021934712446701">TFDA, 2003</xref>). Additionally, the TFDA began to educate industries and the general public about the potentially dangerous effects of skin bleaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021934712446701">TFDA, 2004</xref>). Some of these educational methods include brochures, books, newspaper articles, drug information bulletins, local radio programs, and public forums (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021934712446701">TFDA, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021934712446701">“Warning Issued,” 2009</xref>). The Tanzanian government’s response to the issue of skin bleaching among its citizens reflects concern about the effect these products have on the well-being and health of users and has assisted in removing skin-bleaching creams from the shelves of many Tanzanian merchants. However, despite the TFDA’s efforts, the ban on the importation, exportation, and sale of skin-bleaching creams is poorly enforced, and these creams are still readily available on the black market and persistently used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021934712446701">Lewis, Robkin, Gaska, Njoki, &amp; Andrews, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>As in other countries with similar bans, Tanzania is experiencing resistance to compliance with these restrictions. These banned products are often smuggled in from neighboring African countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021934712446701">Dooley, 2001</xref>), and skin bleaching remains a public health problem in most parts of Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021934712446701">Dadzie &amp; Petit, 2009</xref>). Researchers suggest that in order to implement effective interventions, further efforts, such as public health campaigns, continued research on psychological factors involved in the issue, and community education, need to be implemented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021934712446701">Brown-Glaude, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021934712446701">Dadzie &amp; Petit, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021934712446701">Hall, 2010</xref>). Studies in Jamaica and in various countries in Africa propose that educating people about the risks of skin bleaching and empowering communities to want to change the perception of skin color could be effective tools; community-based programs, such as the Ghana Skin Foundation, make strides in this direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021934712446701">Brown-Glaude, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021934712446701">Chisholm, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021934712446701">Fokuo, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021934712446701">Dadzie and Petit (2009)</xref> suggest that research be conducted on how to encourage intergovernmental compliance with current bans to aid in skin-bleaching prevention.</p>
<p>Because macrolevel policy change often does not address the preexisting psychosocial environment that the policies are aimed at changing, they can be ineffective on their own. In Africa, long histories with globalization and colonization have impacted individual and societal beliefs and psychology about standards of beauty (e.g., tan or lighter skin tones). The motives that Tanzanians have for engaging in skin-bleaching practices are largely complex and personal; therefore the government cannot address the issue through policy changes alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021934712446701">Lewis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021934712446701">Mahé et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021934712446701">Pitché et al., 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021934712446701">Hall (2010)</xref> suggests that in order to initiate real change, destigmatization of the motivations for skin bleaching needs to be advocated, and subsequent studies acknowledging the realities of these motivations are needed. Others suggest that more pressure on corporations to change their concept of beauty may be influential to discourage skin bleaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021934712446701">Shimo, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Another concern with relying on macrolevel policy change in this area is enforceability. In Tanzania, evidence suggests that the TFDA has been unable to fully enforce the regulations and ensure the safety of skin-bleaching cosmetic products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021934712446701">Kisule, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0021934712446701">Tarimo, 2007</xref>). One hindrance to enforceability is the black market that exists to provide skin-bleaching products to the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021934712446701">Dadzie &amp; Petit, 2009</xref>). The skin-bleaching black market thrives due to the continued demand for bleaching products and multiple points of entry that the Tanzanian and other governments are unable to monitor and regulate due to limited resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021934712446701">Dadzie &amp; Petit, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0021934712446701">Tarimo, 2007</xref>). Given the existence of a black market economy for skin-bleaching products, more effective enforcement practices need to be put in place by the TFDA for the law to be successful.</p>
<p>Additionally, macrolevel policy change is often difficult to implement when it does not originate from the people it most directly affects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021934712446701">Rudkin, 2003</xref>). Macrolevel policies aimed at curbing skin-bleaching practices may lack legitimacy in the eyes of Tanzanians due to a lack of shared power or consultation in creating these policies. Multiple disciplines, such as psychology, social work, and economics, have recognized the importance of involving community members and citizens in decision-making processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021934712446701">Bishop, Vicary, Browne, &amp; Guard, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021934712446701">Economos &amp; Irish-Hauser, 2007</xref>). If nations are to develop policies that effectively curb the sale and use of dangerous skin-bleaching products, these considerations must be incorporated.</p>
<p>With the case of skin bleaching in Tanzania, those who use bleaching products and the larger social networks that encourage the practice must be involved in the creation of policies to combat it. Additionally, policy makers must take into consideration that in Tanzania, women typically use skin-bleaching products more than men, underscoring the need for this demographic to be included in decision making regarding the practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021934712446701">Lewis et al., 2011</xref>). When policy change involves historically marginalized populations, such as women and people of color, policy makers should consider possible mistrust, abuse of power, institutional discrimination, societal discrimination against women, and social norms that allow others to exercise control over women’s bodies. These factors may impact support or resistance to new policies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0021934712446701">
<title>The Present Study</title>
<p>Although there is evidence that skin bleaching increases risks for serious harmful health consequences, there is a relative lack of prevention efforts to combat this practice. Due to the increasing rates of people bleaching their skin in East Africa and globally, many studies have investigated the health risks and health complications of skin bleaching throughout the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021934712446701">Mahé, et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021934712446701">Ramsay et al., 2003</xref>). However, no known studies to date have put forth interventions or empirical intervention research aimed at decreasing and/or deterring skin-bleaching practices among East African women. This study begins to address this significant gap in the literature by examining the elements that should be considered in the design of efficacious interventions to reduce the prevalence of this potentially harmful practice.</p>
<p>The current study takes a community empowerment perspective, allowing for the needs, concerns, and historical factors impinging upon skin bleachers to influence research, interventions, and policies (Dalton, Elias, &amp; Wandersman, 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021934712446701">Lewis et al., 2009</xref>). The involvement of community women at the policy and decision-making levels has potential to decrease resistance and increase participation in interventions aimed at reducing the use of these products. To this effect, the current study addresses the research question: What are the most effective ways to inform the Tanzanian community about the psychological and health-related risks of skin bleaching?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0021934712446701" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>This research aimed to identify the most effective framework for a health dissemination model to effectively inform the Tanzanian community about the psychological and health-related risks of skin bleaching. This framework was developed through a series of peer-led focus groups involving a small sample of Tanzanians. The research was conducted in Dar es Salaam, the former capital and current largest city in Tanzania. Tanzania is the largest geographic East African nation. Gaining its independence from Britain in 1964, Tanzania is the result of a merger between the mainland (previously Tanganyika), Zanzibar, and Pemba. It has a total population of 35.57 million (mainland, 34.57 million; Zanzibar, 1 million) in a country slightly smaller than New Mexico and Texas combined (378,640 square miles: mainland, 378,000 square miles; Zanzibar, 640 square miles). The population includes more than 100 different ethnic groups and three primary religions: Islam (45%), Christianity (45%), and indigenous beliefs or traditional African religions (10%). About 1% of the population consists of people from Asian, European, or Arab decent. Kiswahili and English are the official languages in Tanzania, although English is spoken less often than Kiswahili (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021934712446701">Bureau of African Affairs, 2006</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section5-0021934712446701">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>A total of 20 Tanzanian participants were randomly recruited through flyer distribution within and around Dar es Salaam, the capital city of Tanzania. Random selection occurred by choosing interested potential participants’ names out of a hat. The randomly selected candidates were then contacted and asked to participate. All of the contacted candidates agreed to participate in the study. Of the 20 participants in the study, 10 were male and 10 were female, with a mean age of 26.14 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 8.25). Ten different ethnic groups were represented among the participants. None of the interview participants originated from Asian, European, or Arabic countries. Occupations varied and included students, vendors or merchants, beauty professionals, persons who were unemployed or not in school, finance workers, secretaries, entertainers, teachers or educators, government officials, and consultants. Most of the participants had some formal education, with 41% making it to high school. The majority of the sample were single (79%), and 65% had no children.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0021934712446701">
<title>Research Design</title>
<p>Peer-led focus groups were used as the primary mode of qualitative data collection for this study. A strengths-based approach was utilized, whereby participants were encouraged to recognize and build on their own strengths, the strengths of their collective communities, and existing resources to accomplish a goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021934712446701">Jason, Keys, Suarez-Balcazar, Taylor, &amp; Davis, 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0021934712446701">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Local approval was granted from the Tanzanian government to conduct data collection before the project began. Institutional review board approval was also granted in the United States by the sponsoring university.</p>
<p>All participants completed a consent form in order to participate in the study. Participants were also asked to complete a consent form granting permission to be audio and video recorded, in order to facilitate the richness of this process and accurate data gathering. All participants were fully briefed on their rights and then were asked to engage in the focus groups. None of the participants denied permission to be included in the study or to be audio or video recorded. The consent forms were written and administered in Kiswahili or English, according to the participant’s preference, by a fluent Kiswahili- and English-speaking researcher.</p>
<p>The data collection involved one intensive half-day workshop (5 hr) that consisted of three simultaneous breakout focus groups (one for self-endorsed bleachers, one for self-endorsed nonbleachers, and one for a combination of both groups) that were each facilitated by either the principal investigator or one of two contracted research assistants from the University of Dar es Salaam, all fluent in Kiswahili. This method (simultaneous breakout focus groups each facilitated by one researcher) was chosen in order to grant adequate time to each participant to share his or her perspective in a smaller group setting while feeling comfortable around those who share similar skin-bleaching practices. The focus groups took place at a local conference center in Dar es Salaam, and all participants were reimbursed for their travel to the site and were given meals and small cash incentives for their involvement in the research.</p>
<p>The agenda included (a) breakfast and networking, (b) welcome and introductions, (c) breakout focus groups (2 hr), (d) all participant focus group discussion about findings and recommendations, (e) lunch and networking (1 hr), and (f) workshop wrap-up (Q&amp;A and workshop evaluation). The entire day was conducted in Kiswahili.</p>
<p>Together the focus group participants worked to identify the most effective means of health dissemination to inform the Tanzanian community about the psychological and health-related risks of skin bleaching. The participants contributed to the design and development of the project by providing the researcher with consultation regarding a number of pragmatic aspects of a potential prevention model, including the structure of the dissemination model (e.g., public service announcements versus community brochures, posters, or other effective forms of dissemination), the pacing of dissemination model (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly dissemination), and the location of the dissemination model (e.g., locally in Dar es Salaam or more widespread in other Tanzanian cities).</p>
<p>Additionally, participants provided suggestions and advice about how to position a dissemination model within the Tanzanian community context to best facilitate the most effective transfer of information and programming about the psychological and health-related risks of preserving skin-bleaching products and practices.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0021934712446701">
<title>Instrument</title>
<p>The research protocol used to facilitate all focus groups began with an introduction to the practice of skin bleaching. This was followed by five semistructured questions that queried about prevention efforts: (a) What should the design of the prevention model look like? (b) What should the structure of the prevention model look like? (c) What should the pacing of the prevention model look like? (e) What should be the location of the prevention model? (f) How will the prevention model be positioned?</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>All interview data were contextually analyzed for content to identify emerging thematic categories and subthemes that described the most effective framework for a health dissemination model to effectively inform the Tanzanian community about the psychological and health-related risks of skin bleaching.</p>
<p>After transcribing and translating all of the audiotapes from the workshops, three procedures guided the thematic data analyses that are established iterative techniques for aggregation and synthesis of qualitative data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021934712446701">Morgan, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0021934712446701">Taylor &amp; Bogdan, 1998</xref>). Through a qualitative review of the interview data, an initial list of ideas was generated about what was in the data and what recurrent themes emerged. For example, people indicated that there was a great need for education to prevent skin bleaching.</p>
<p>Second, open coding procedures were employed in which the author produced initial codes from the data. In this basic analytic technique of the qualitative methodology known as grounded theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021934712446701">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>), the author extracted and noted concepts that seemed to exemplify participants’ cognitive schemas about skin-bleaching prevention. These included suggestions such as that skin-bleaching prevention should include organizational seminars and workshops, home-based education, and media or that regulations should be put in place to ban skin bleaching. After this open coding, the author used a comparative approach to cluster related concepts. For example, the first two of the concepts above (organizational seminars and workshops and home-based education) were grouped together because they all describe forms of didactic education as a key form of skin bleaching intervention or prevention.</p>
<p>Third, another member of the research team then examined each of the concept clusters and named them by common theme, referring back to the data for confirmation. This peer examination, and the alignment of its themes with those documented in theoretical literature on skin-bleaching prevention, provided confirmation of the credibility of the three major themes identified and discussed in the next pages.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>From the analysis across the workgroup data, three themes emerged on how a prevention model should be structured: (a) didactic education, (b) governmental action and policy change, and (c) educational media. Within these overall structures, specific designs emerged. For the didactic education component, it was suggested that the intervention include organization seminars and workshops and home-based education. For the governmental action and policy change component, it was suggested that the intervention include forms of regulations. Finally, for the educational media component, it was suggested to include print media (e.g., brochures, posters, billboards, newspapers, books), electronic media (e.g., television, movies), and radio in the intervention. There were two suggestions about the content of prevention messages: to be frank and to show the dangers of skin bleaching.</p>
<sec id="section11-0021934712446701">
<title>Didactic Education</title>
<sec id="section12-0021934712446701">
<title>Organization seminars and workshops</title>
<p>Based on participants’ responses, four methods for designing an intervention based on organizational seminars and workshops emerged: (a) the use of influential people (e.g., models, leaders, experts, women’s groups), (b) incorporation of people involved in skin bleaching (users of skin bleach and business people) as educators, (c) distinct workshops for bleachers and nonbleachers, and (d) teaching others how to teach about skin bleaching. The respondents suggested presenting statistics about skin bleaching and frankly presenting the dangers of skin bleaching to the community during these seminars and workshops. Finally, five locations were designated for these seminars and workshops: salons, schools, religious institutions (e.g., churches and mosques), hospitals, and social gatherings (e.g., parties, marketplace, workplace, recreational centers, festivals, pageants).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0021934712446701">
<title>Home-based education</title>
<p>Two methodological themes emerged from the respondents in terms of home-based education: Educate users at their home (perhaps 1 hr per week, preferably on Saturday evening), and experts and specialists should come up with an intervention that would educate families about the dangers of skin bleaching. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021934712446701">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Print media</title>
<p>Within print media, participants expressed five specific forms that should be utilized to disseminate information about skin bleaching: (a) newspapers, (b) billboards, (c) books, (d) brochures, and (e) posters. Three themes emerged as to the intervention design within these forms of print media: Show negative images about the dangers of skin bleaching, show authentic information (statistics and real pictures), and utilize influential people, such as models, experts, and community leaders, to disseminate the information.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0021934712446701">
<title>Electronic media</title>
<p>Two forms of electronic media were specified by the participants: television and movies. Two important aspects of using electronic media were identified: the use of influential people (e.g., models, experts, leaders) and advertising during key times in order to reach the largest audience. Key times that were expressed by the participants were during family programs, favorite TV shows (such as prime time news), and on Saturday nights and Friday evenings.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The main research question of discovering the most effective means of disseminating prevention messages in Tanzania was addressed through these focus groups, yielding results that will serve to be invaluable for the development of prevention strategies for skin bleaching and that will be utilized in multiple ways. The suggestions from participants in this study represent the first set of ideas to be documented directly from community members themselves on how to best prevent skin-bleaching activities. As a first step in developing effective means of preventing the harmful health consequences of skin bleaching, involving the community in all phases of development is crucial. The results of the study generated a multitude of ideas that can be used, from general guidelines (use television and movies) to specific implementation strategies (show messages on Friday and Saturday nights during prime-time family programming).</p>
<p>The results support the assertion that interventions to address skin bleaching should use both top-down (governmental) and bottom-up (community) approaches. While participants encouraged propositions like home-based education workshops and community-based education in salons, churches, and schools, they also stressed the need for governmental regulation and enforcement of skin-bleaching bans. Furthermore, they stressed the need for using mass media avenues for dissemination of prevention messages, such as utilizing television, movies, and radio. Since macrolevel policy change is unable to (a) address the preexisting psychosocial elements that sustain the practice of skin bleaching, (b) completely control the high demand for bleaching creams or their underground distribution, or (c) address the need for Tanzanians to have decision-making power so they will fully endorse the restrictions placed on bleaching products, utilizing more grassroots approaches and avenues that address popular culture are necessary to complement policy-level changes.</p>
<p>The suggestion to be frank and to discuss the dangers of skin bleaching speaks to the need to disseminate truthful information. It may also point to misinformation about skin bleaching circulating in the community. While product placement and advertising may perpetuate myths about skin bleaching, misconceptions about the effectiveness and proper usage of these products may also stem from strong social networking in the community. As in many African nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021934712446701">Ikoja-Odongo &amp; Ocholla, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021934712446701">Lie &amp; Biswalo, 1998</xref>), oral transmission of information is still very strong in Tanzania (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021934712446701">Mofu, 2004</xref>), and Tanzanians continue to share beauty secrets and information orally about skin bleaching and its utility as a method for treating skin disorders across a number of different venues, such as at the salon, with their seamstress, at family gatherings, and with their friends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021934712446701">Lewis et al., 2011</xref>). Through these communications, women can easily learn where to purchase such products, how to make them from scratch, how to apply them, and what the expected results are.</p>
<p>Since word of mouth may be the source of misinformation about skin bleaching, it follows that it must also be a technique in disseminating the truthful harmful consequences of the practice as well, and the results of the study support this notion. Participants extensively detailed multiple word-of-mouth networks to utilize for skin-bleaching prevention. From hospitals and homes to churches and salons, informal local structures were highly emphasized as necessary components of an intervention program. Because of the importance of these venues in Tanzanian society, it is crucial that any health prevention or intervention program consider the utility of word of mouth in the community.</p>
<p>In addition, the study results underscored the importance of trusted, influential key informants as a suggested mode of communication. Trusted community members are needed to provide didactic education in homes, schools, the marketplace, and other local settings. Influential people were also emphasized in utilizing mass media, such as musicians composing songs that include prevention messages and influential entertainers and experts appearing in print and electronic media. Utilizing community popular-opinion leaders to disseminate prevention messages is a widely used practice in public health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021934712446701">NIMH Collaborative HIV/STD Prevention Trial Group, 2010</xref>). The suggestions of the sample corroborate the utility of trying this evidenced-based practice with skin-bleaching prevention.</p>
<p>Taken together, the strategies put forth by the sample—didactic education, policy, and media—represent a comprehensive means of addressing the potentially harmful effects of skin bleaching. They also provide a framework for addressing other health concerns or potentially harmful body modification practices. Their suggestions address the community, government, and larger cultural influences on behavior to create a comprehensive framework for prevention. Additionally, anyone interested in prevention messages must consider the most appropriate languages in which to make materials available, both for oral and print media. This study used Kiswahili in all phases of the research, as this was the language preference of most of the sample. Special attention to language must be considered for reaching communities most affected by skin bleaching for any future prevention efforts, as preferred language and literacy vary greatly in the region.</p>
<sec id="section20-0021934712446701">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>While the findings from this study should prove useful in a number of ways, it is also important to recognize the limitations of the study. The sample of Tanzanian participants was largely skewed toward unmarried, childless participants from the northern regions of Tanzania. Therefore, caution must be used when generalizing to the larger population. Information from this sample was also generated during the course of 1 day; it would be advantageous to continue to generate ideas about prevention over time, giving participants multiple opportunities to consider the most effective options for prevention as they go about their daily lives. Despite these limitations, the present findings take an important first step toward documenting the most effective means of disseminating skin-bleaching prevention messages in Tanzania.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0021934712446701">
<title>Implications for Research, Policy, and Practice</title>
<p>Future research on this topic could proceed in a multitude of directions. First, findings from this study could be utilized to develop prevention strategies and to generate a line of intervention research that evaluates the utility and effectiveness of various techniques aimed to reduce the practice of skin bleaching. Another possible line of future research includes developing a full participatory action research study that trains community members in research techniques in order to have Tanzanian laypeople lead future efforts in their communities on skin-bleaching prevention. Further research could also investigate ideal modalities for skin-bleaching prevention with larger samples of participants with potential generalizability to larger regions. Future studies should consider including samples from rural areas to ascertain how to best reach the many women who use skin-bleaching products outside of main cities. Special consideration for language and literacy should be explored.</p>
<p>The findings could also prove useful outside the research arena. Governments and policy makers interested in enforcing bans on skin-bleaching products could use the suggestions from the sample to develop more effective means of curbing the demand for skin-bleaching products in their areas. It may also be useful information for community groups and public health agencies interested in developing skin-bleaching prevention measures. Finally, it could inform the literature and practice of preventing other potentially harmful body modification practices. Skin bleaching is a widespread practice among Tanzanian and other African women; using community-based and participatory practices, the opportunity to prevent the dangerous health consequences of this practice is a promising area for continued practice and research.</p>
