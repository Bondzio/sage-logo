<p>Van Nijnatten explores issues of the child, family and child welfare services from a constructivist perspective, combining psychological and sociological considerations of child development to incorporate a holistic approach which encourages open dialogue between families and child welfare workers. He argues that a dialogic approach enables family members to discuss the issues which are pertinent to their individual situation, and therefore offers a possible ‘way out’ of negative situations. He suggests a shift in child welfare approaches from a managerial style to a dialogical approach.</p>
<p>A discussion of the individual’s sense of agency is developed in Chapters 1–3. Chapter 1 presents a vignette of a child, ‘Jennifer’, a member of the welfare system, unable to engage in dialogue due to past experiences with a family who severely discouraged her contributions. Jennifer’s lack of dialogue limits her ability to assert agency in her life. A discussion of the term ‘agency’ as a social organizational process is offered and Van Nijnatten suggests that people are unable to make sense of their agency alone as they need to engage in discussion with other members of society in order to understand their social position. Chapter 2 continues this exploration of agency through considering how dialogue aids children’s psychological development. This is approached through children’s development of agency as an individual but also makes important connections to the social surrounds of the child in this process. The social nature of agency is developed further in Chapter 3, where it is argued that a child’s identity is constructed through the dialogues the child has with parents during the various periods of their childhood. Intersubjectivity is introduced here as an interactional understanding of social relationships where it is argued that, if people do not have interactive agency, their ability to form relationships is affected.</p>
<p>Chapters 4 and 5 initiate a different approach to the issues discussed in Chapters 1–3. Social policy becomes the central theme, and the systematic evolution of political change and its affect on families and child welfare is discussed. This is initiated in Chapter 4 with reference to the change in power over families, from a patriarchal approach to an increase in state and public policy interest. This move encourages a view of the child as being more competent and having a voice in matters concerning them. It is suggested that families should support the interests of their children in order to promote respectful relationships, but it is also acknowledged that allowing children the same legal rights as adults is counterproductive as this neglects the developmental nature of agency. Chapter 5 presents child rearing as a partnership between the family and government agencies, where child welfare intervenes when parents can no longer provide a consistency of care. When intervention occurs, it is argued that the process focuses too heavily on a managerial, administrative role. Van Nijnatten suggests that assessment should be considered as an interaction between the public sector and the private life of families where a shared intersubjectivity of a common goal can provide a continuity of care. It is further suggested that, if a business type model is to be used, it should be a guide which is flexible to the needs of each individual family.</p>
<p>A strong case for the use of a dialogic approach to assist children with change when entering the child welfare system is argued in Chapter 6. Discussions with the child about their past, present and future should be promoted as this offers an understanding of continuity and helps children define and conceptualize their problems. The dialogic process is concurrently advantageous for child welfare workers as it enables them to access the root of the problem and co-construct a way forward for the family. Chapter 7 explores what a dialogic child welfare would look like in practice where dialogue would be more central than in a managerial approach, and time and freedom for reflection would be afforded for colleagues, management and professionals.</p>
<p>Chapter 8 summarizes and reiterates the importance of agency and a shared understanding of situations between children, family and child welfare and emphasizes a dialogical approach to support change and continuity.</p>
<p>This book is timely in addressing the importance of communication between early childhood services and families. Van Nijnatten uses a well-informed voice throughout, combining his personal experience of the child welfare system together with an extensive theoretical knowledge of the area. The synthesis of theoretical perspective and real life material captures the interest of the reader and would appeal to both undergraduate students of childhood studies and welfare, and academics investigating new philosophical approaches to continuous problems in the area of social welfare. It offers an important contribution to the field of childhood studies and social work through its argument for the necessity of an open discourse between all members involved. It aligns with previous work prioritizing the voice of the child in social policy (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461445612446268">Hallett and Prout, 2003</xref>) but develops this position by offering a practical way to implement such an initiative. However, although a good argument is made for a dialogic approach to child welfare, ambiguity concerning children such as Jennifer, who are unable to engage in dialogue and assert agency, is evident.</p>
<p>Theoretically, although the book offers an important contribution to the field, a rigorous analysis of the dialogic approach is lacking. The inclusion of research findings on the application of a dialogic approach is needed to support the claims that such an approach is effective, but this evidence is not provided. To clearly explicate the argument, the book would also have benefited from a rigorous discourse analysis of the conversation transcriptions Van Nijnatten has presented.</p>
