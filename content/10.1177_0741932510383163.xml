<abstract>
<p>This article critiques the treatment of disability as cultural difference by the theorists of the “social model” and “minority group model” of disability. Both models include all of the various disabling conditions under one term—disability—and fail to distinguish disabilities from cultural differences (e.g., race, ethnicity, or gender differences). Equating disability with cultural difference, they adopt a political strategy of positive identity similar to that used in other civil rights movements. The consequences of this strategy for the disability movement and special education are discussed.</p>

<body>
<p>According to the theorists of the “social model” of disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0741932510383163">Barnes, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0741932510383163">Oliver, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0741932510383163">1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0741932510383163">1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0741932510383163">1996b</xref>), disability is not a product of bodily pathology but of specific social and economic structures that exclude impaired people from full participation in mainstream social activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0741932510383163">Oliver, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0741932510383163">1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0741932510383163">1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0741932510383163">1996b</xref>). Thus, they see people with disabilities as an oppressed social group. Their oppression is attributed to the capitalist mode of production or the structures of industrial capitalism and its demands for increased productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0741932510383163">Abberley, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0741932510383163">Finkelstein, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0741932510383163">Oliver, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0741932510383163">1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0741932510383163">1996a</xref>). In such theorizing about disability as a form of social oppression, people with disabilities are viewed as the collective victims of an uncaring and antagonistic capitalistic society, a system of social relations that produces ableism or disableism and social exclusion. Also, doctors and “pseudoscientific paramedical professions” are considered to contribute to the social oppression of people with disabilities by exerting their power over people with disabilities in their pursuit of the restoration of normal function. Consequently, the social model or theory suggests, disability politics should move away from compensation for differences and correction of disabilities and toward the empowerment and negotiation of a positive identity for people with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0741932510383163">Oliver, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0741932510383163">1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0741932510383163">1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0741932510383163">1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0741932510383163">1996b</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0741932510383163">Oliver (1996b)</xref> attacks physicians and related professionals as follows:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>the medical profession, because of its power and dominance, has spawned a whole range of pseudo-professions in its own image; physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, clinical psychology; each one geared to the same aim—the restoration of normality. And each one of these pseudo-professions develops its own knowledge base and set of skill to facilitate this. (p. 37)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Precisely who is an oppressor is not clear. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0741932510383163">Oliver (1996b)</xref>, physicians have no consciousness of their role because they “are trapped in a set of social relations with which they are not trained or equipped to deal” (p. 36). The problem, for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0741932510383163">Oliver (1996b)</xref>, is that physicians and “pseudoscientific paramedical professions” are seen as trapped in their social roles as experts and, at the same time, as oppressors of people who have disabilities.</p>
<p>According to proponents of the social model, the political strategy of the disability movement should be the removal of barriers imposed by social structures and attitudes. Therefore, the disability movement should aim at correcting the oppression of and discrimination against people with disabilities, promoting their social inclusion, developing their positive identity, and creating a barrier-free society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0741932510383163">Finkelstein, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0741932510383163">Oliver, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0741932510383163">1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0741932510383163">1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0741932510383163">1996b</xref>).</p>
<p>Proponents of the social model have often criticized the emphasis on cure and prevention and have opposed efforts to maximize the functioning of people with impairments. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0741932510383163">Oliver (1989)</xref> has argued against conductive education for people with cerebral palsy. Moreover, some supporters of deaf culture have strongly argued against the technology of cochlear implants for deaf infants and children (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0741932510383163">Sparrow, 2005</xref>). This antipathy toward habilitation is often justified on the grounds that deafness, for example, is simply a different human condition, not a disability. Thus, cochlear implants have been perceived as a threat coming from the hearing majority to the “culture of deafness,” the sign language community, and “deaf identity” (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0741932510383163">Woodcock, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>A similar approach to disability, called the “sociopolitical approach” or “minority group model,” has been proposed by scholars with disabilities. These include Irving Kenneth Zola, Harlan Hahn, Anita Silvers, and others in the United States. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0741932510383163">Hahn (1989)</xref> emphasizes the environmental conditions that are characterized as disabling. In his words:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>The . . . definition of disability directs attention to the sociopolitical significance of the interaction between persons and the environments that surround them. From this perspective, the basic problems encountered by citizens with disabilities can be traced to the external configurations of a disabling environment rather than to the internal traits of so-called personal defects or deficiencies. (p. 227)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In the American version of the model, people with disabilities are considered an oppressed minority (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0741932510383163">Hahn, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0741932510383163">1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0741932510383163">1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0741932510383163">Liggett, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0741932510383163">Silvers, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0741932510383163">Zola, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0741932510383163">1989</xref>). Specifically, disability has been viewed as a function of social imposition or dominance of powerful forces. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0741932510383163">Skrtic (1991)</xref> has specified this thesis for special education:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>In organizational terms, student disability is neither human pathology nor an objective distinction; it is an organizational pathology, a matter of not fitting the standard programs of the prevailing paradigm or a professional culture, the legitimacy of which is artificially reaffirmed by the objectification of school failure as a human pathology through the institutional practice of special education. (p. 169)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>If disability is not considered as a matter of pathology, then a strategy of medical intervention is not appropriate. Instead, people with disabilities are better advised to pursue social change. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0741932510383163">Hahn’s (1989)</xref> words,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>The sociopolitical approach also suggests that the most effective solutions to the difficulties confronting people with disabilities can be attained by efforts to improve the status of this group as a whole rather than by actions focusing on distinct individuals. As a result, this definition is the primary foundation of the minority group model of disability. (pp. 227–228)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Thus, the “minority group model” includes the argument that “disabled people should be brought into the American political system as another interest group” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0741932510383163">Liggett, 1988</xref>, p. 271). In short, the strategy of theorists of the social model and minority group model “aim at addressing issues of oppression and discrimination of disabled people, caused by institutional forms of exclusion and by cultural attitudes embedded in social practices” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0741932510383163">Terzi, 2004</xref>, p. 141).</p>
<sec id="section1-0741932510383163">
<title>Disability as a Conglomeration of Different Disabling Conditions</title>
<p>Undoubtedly, disability as a unified category is extremely useful for the provision of some services through legislation (e.g., social security, health care, transportation, education, and employment). That is, the general concept of disability does form a basis for social policy. Thus, it is valuable for several advocacy and self-advocacy groups struggling for the rights of people with disabilities (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0741932510383163">Hallahan, Kauffman, &amp; Pullen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0741932510383163">Kauffman &amp; Hallahan, 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0741932510383163">Oliver &amp; Zarb, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0741932510383163">Shakespeare, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>However, disability is rather a problematic category for scientific and educational purposes because it constitutes a very abstract, general concept. It is a generalization starting with other concepts such as hearing impairments and deafness, visual impairments and blindness, deaf–blindness, physical disabilities (orthopedic and other health impairments), intellectual disabilities, emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD), autism spectrum disorders, speech or language impairments, specific learning disabilities, traumatic brain injury, and so on. The basic problem with the term <italic>disability</italic> is that it covers a huge range of impairments or disabling conditions—<italic>disability</italic> encompasses extreme heterogeneity of type and severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0741932510383163">Kauffman, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>From an educational perspective, the type of disability and its degree of severity underline the potential need for individualized special education services (including inclusive settings). The general concept of disability contributes little to the selection of specific treatment approaches or appropriate educational programs. Moreover, students with exclusively physical disabilities do not usually need special education but social and architectural accommodations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0741932510383163">Hallahan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0741932510383163">Kauffman &amp; Hallahan, 2005b</xref>).</p>
<p>The conceptual difficulties and complexities encountered in using the general term <italic>disability</italic> should not be replaced by oversimplifications. Unfortunately both the social model and the minority group model in their purest forms reduce the notion of disability to a purely sociological subject, simply mirroring the error of simplistic biological determinism (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741932510383163">Anastasiou &amp; Kauffman, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0741932510383163">in press</xref>-a, in press-b). Replacing biological determinism with cultural determinism, proponents of the social model engage in speculation about people with disabilities who, paradoxically, they view as if they are empty of biological features. That is, in its purest form the social model recognizes physical impairments but argues that these are not inherently disabling in any significant way, that social structures alone create disability.</p>
<p>We recognize here the deep and perpetual philosophical differences in the recognition and treatment of disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0741932510383163">Kauffman, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0741932510383163">Kauffman, Nelson, Simpson, &amp; Mock, in press</xref>). We have addressed some of these philosophical issues elsewhere (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741932510383163">Anastasiou &amp; Kauffman, in press-b</xref>), and a full treatment of them is well beyond this discussion. This is not to say that they are unimportant or irrelevant, merely that many books and articles are needed to address past, current, and future aspects of ontology, epistemology, and other aspects of what might be termed “philosophical realism” (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741932510383163">Bunge, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0741932510383163">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0741932510383163">Bunge &amp; Mahner, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0741932510383163">Neiman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0741932510383163">Niiniluoto, 1999</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section2-0741932510383163">
<title>Human Diversity and Disabilities</title>
<p>Among the severe limitations of both the British “social model” and the American version of the “minority group model” is the failure to recognize the profound difference between the individual and the group. They also fail to recognize the reality of disability. As one proponent of the social model put it, “Disablement is nothing to do with the body” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0741932510383163">Oliver, 1996b</xref>, p. 35). Differences and disabilities need to be viewed in the context of human commonalities and diversity. Disabilities lie in what are judged to be extremes of human diversity. Though disability is part of the human condition and experience, it is not just another difference to which we are indifferent (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0741932510383163">Kauffman, 1999</xref>). If it were, then it would seem reasonable to assume that there would be nothing wrong with treating children in such a manner that they could no longer hear, see, walk, or speak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0741932510383163">Harris, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0741932510383163">Kauffman &amp; Hallahan, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>People can be different in many ways, such as in their skin hue, hair color and texture, voice, and facial expressions. This kind of variability in individual traits does not define disabilities. Also, people differ as groups in terms of gender, language, religion, ethnicity, sexuality, and social class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0741932510383163">Lewontin, 1995</xref>). Still, these differences among groups are not disabilities in the same sense that physical or cognitive impairments are (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0741932510383163">Anastasiou, Gardner, &amp; Michail, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0741932510383163">Coutinho &amp; Oswald, in press</xref>).</p>
<p>Having overused “difference talk” in heated debates, proponents of social and minority group models have forgotten to address the question, “Different from what?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0741932510383163">Terzi, 2004</xref>). Each of the aforementioned differences implies a way in which two or more people are not like each other. In other words, in speaking about difference we implicitly compare one or more differences in existence. In the case of skin hue, voice, facial expressions, individual preferences or gender, language, religion, ethnicity, and sexuality, there is no average. There are just differences, mainly in terms of culture. Social class is a prominent exception, mainly because of a vertical and rather continuous social distribution of wealth, power, and status. But disabilities are another exception to nondisabling differences for radically different reasons.</p>
<p>Apart from cultural, gender, and class differences, individuals differ in how well they perform critical activities in everyday life, critical in terms of the evolutionary history of human species. The abilities to hear, see, walk, speak, learn, communicate, and socialize are <italic>critical</italic> and enormously important because they have been acquired in the course of the evolutionary history of the human species. People with disabilities have restrictions in performing critical evolutionary abilities. Statistical distributions of these critical abilities are continuous. At some quantitative threshold, we recognize that they become disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0741932510383163">Kauffman &amp; Hallahan, 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0741932510383163">Kauffman &amp; Lloyd, in press</xref>). Thus, disability represents an important deviation from the statistical norm in some critical abilities for our species. It is extremely important to recognize that disabilities are both atypical and natural.</p>
<p>Disabilities concern performances that are at the extremes, much lower than is typical in a statistical sense. Disability always represents deviance from a statistical norm, from a normative expectation for performance in an important area of human activity. Such deviance is produced by any measurement. <italic>Atypical</italic>, as we use the term here, is related to significant deviations from a mean in statistical distributions of important human characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0741932510383163">Kauffman &amp; Hallahan, 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0741932510383163">Kauffman &amp; Lloyd, in press</xref>).</p>
<p>Atypical is the opposite of <italic>usual</italic> or <italic>typical</italic>, but not the opposite of <italic>natural</italic>. People with disabilities share many common human attributes (for further details see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0741932510383163">Lewontin, 1995</xref>). To speak about disability as a natural part of human life is not a matter of political correctness but rather an understanding of the whole range of differences and experiences, including the concept of humanity. From an evolutionary perspective, the meaning of humanity may lie primarily in variation, as a universal reality of existence of living beings rather than in averages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0741932510383163">Gould, 1996a</xref>). Hence, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0741932510383163">Gould (1996a)</xref> used the term <italic>full house</italic> to encompass the concept of all humanity, from least to most on any measured dimension.</p>
<p>Atypical is sometimes used as antonym of <italic>normal</italic> in a statistical sense, but the statistical concept of <italic>normal</italic> is irrelevant to a sense of “social normality,” as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0741932510383163">Barnes (1991</xref>, p. 24) has concluded. Proponents of a social model juxtapose the statistical atypicality of disabilities with a sociological caricature of normal social roles, attempting to eliminate the role of important individual features from their analyses. Escaping to the haven of social constructionism, they attempt to avoid tackling the problem of disability in terms of critical intrinsic differences, which of course are heavily mediated by social and technological factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741932510383163">Anastasiou &amp; Kauffman, in press-b</xref>).</p>
<p>Ignorance, intolerance, prejudice, and political expediencies have sometimes led to the abuse of others, sometimes justified by a concept such as <italic>drapetomania</italic> (the supposed mental disease that makes slaves run away from their masters; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0741932510383163">Wakefield, 1992</xref>) and sometimes by social attitudes toward a concept (e.g., <italic>homosexuality</italic>, once considered the love that dare not speak its name and once considered a psychiatric disorder; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0741932510383163">Bayer &amp; Spitzer, 1982</xref>). Today, these labels (drapetomania and homosexuality) are considered by most people to be irrelevant to the concept of disability or disorder. But these historical psychiatric approaches underline the fact that we cannot accept thoughtlessly every conceptualization of disability, even if some of the supposed disorder meets an accepted criterion of deviance from what is judged to be normal. Judgment of deviance itself is not sufficient to define a disability. After all, as John Stuart Mill suggested, it is a logical error “to believe that whatever received a name must be an entity or being, having an independent existence of its own” (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0741932510383163">Gould, 1996b</xref>, p. 181).</p>
<p>Conceptualizations of disability must, in our view, account not only for our sameness (we are all human beings with a lot of common attributes and a common fate) but also for the variability of human nature (we are all individuals, distinctively different from each other). Our conceptualizations must account not only for the discontinuity of critical evolutionary abilities (some people are unable to hear, see, walk, speak, learn, communicate, or socialize like most of us) but also for the dissimilarities among and within disabilities (people with disabilities confront different predicaments in terms of type and severity of their disabling conditions).</p>

<p>When a difference becomes a disability, it is not parallel to the phenomenon of a cultural difference, as implied by the social model or minority group model that demands the uniform treatment of all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0741932510383163">Kauffman &amp; Landrum, 2009</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0741932510383163">Shakespeare (2006)</xref> argued, disabilities constitute “a complex interaction of biological, psychological, cultural and socio-political factors which cannot be extricated except with imprecision” (p. 38). Shakespeare’s balanced and interactional view is an important step toward careful thinking. We might apply this view of differences to ethnicity, social class, gender, sexuality, and so on. Only extreme nationalists or tribalists would see <italic>socially</italic> important biological differences in different ethnic identities. As for social classes, the “cognitive elite theory” of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0741932510383163">Herrnstein and Murray (1994)</xref> tried to explain social stratification in American life on the basis of IQ differences and underlying genetic differences, but it proved to be unfounded in academia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0741932510383163">Neisser et al., 1996</xref>) and was also considered a typical example of biological determinism and anachronistic social Darwinism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0741932510383163">Gould, 1996b</xref>, p. 367). Concerning gender differences, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0741932510383163">Shakespeare (2006)</xref>, we cannot imagine why being a woman would put any individual at a disadvantage in the absence of social barriers. Similarly, we cannot imagine “why being gay or lesbian would put any individual at a disadvantage in the absence of prejudice and discrimination” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0741932510383163">Shakespeare, 2006</xref>, p. 41).</p>
<p>More analytically, we might consider the special case of “race.” “Race” is a very problematic category for scientific reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0741932510383163">Barbujani, Magagni, Minch, &amp; Cavalli-Sforza, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0741932510383163">Lewontin, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0741932510383163">Smedley &amp; Smedley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0741932510383163">Sternberg, Grigorenko, &amp; Kidd, 2005</xref>). “Racial” differences are sometimes conventionally categorized by skin color or other aspect of physiognomy, but <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0741932510383163">Kauffman and Landrum (2009)</xref> have noted how lineage, not any physiognomic feature per se, is the basis for classification. Only racists argue for critical differences in different “races” from a genetic or evolutionary perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0741932510383163">Smedley &amp; Smedley, 2005</xref>). Contemporary research indicates that the folk classification of “races” does not correspond to genetically discrete groups; outward characteristics, such as skin color, hair texture, and facial features, which have been used to classify “races” in the past (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0741932510383163">Gould, 1996b</xref>) are considered today trivial from the aspect of genetic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0741932510383163">Bamshad &amp; Olson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0741932510383163">Barbujani et al., 1997</xref>). We cannot imagine any evolutionary advantage that depends on skin pigmentation except, of course, past adaptation to the sun and weather conditions. Although the difference in levels of melanin between Americans of African and European origins is trivial from the point of view of genetics and physiology, <italic>the social phenomenon of racial discrimination is real and unacceptable to us</italic>. A classification of “Black race” can cost someone in standard of living, educational and occupational opportunities, health care, and ultimately years of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0741932510383163">Lewontin &amp; Levins, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0741932510383163">Smedley &amp; Smedley, 2005</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0741932510383163">Sternberg et al. (2005)</xref> argued, “Race is a social construction with no scientific definition” (p. 46) and of course “is not a biological construct” (p. 57). Therefore, we need to be careful to distinguish the folk conceptions of constructs from the scientific constructs themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0741932510383163">Sternberg et al., 2005</xref>). In conclusion, <italic>“race” as biology may well be fiction, but racism is a very real social problem</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0741932510383163">Anastasiou et al., in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0741932510383163">Smedley &amp; Smedley, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Our point here is that disabilities are not comparable to ethnic, gender, sexual, or “race” differences. Comparatively few restrictions experienced by people with disabilities can be attributed <italic>exclusively</italic> to social barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741932510383163">Anastasiou &amp; Kauffman, in press-b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0741932510383163">Shakespeare, 2006</xref>). Surely, social arrangements can be unjustifiable sources of exclusion and discrimination for people with serious mobility problems, deafness, blindness, and so on. But this social approach has its limits; it does not tell the whole story. A person having a visual impairment herself concedes, “Some of the most profound problems experienced by people with certain impairments are difficult, if not impossible, to solve by social manipulation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0741932510383163">French, 1993</xref>, p. 17).</p>
<p>We cannot speak from our personal experience about the confusion of disability with cultural or linguistic differences (CLDs). Nevertheless, we do understand that CLDs are often confused with disabilities (either CLD is mistaken for a disability or a disability is denied because of a CLD). Moreover, disproportionality of identified disabilities among various ethnic and gender groups is a serious problem and a great concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0741932510383163">Anastasiou et al., in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0741932510383163">Coutinho &amp; Oswald, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0741932510383163">Kauffman et al., in press</xref>). But conceptualizing disability as the result of a single and specific social dimension—social oppression—comes to a logical dead end. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0741932510383163">Harris’s (2000)</xref> words,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>if disability could be identified simply in terms of social conditions, for example, social exclusion, or discrimination, then all victims of racial and gender discrimination would count as disabled and Jews, Blacks and Women would be people with disabilities. (p. 95)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The disproportionality issue is serious and deserves further comment. Misidentification (either false positive or false negative) can be a result of bias in identification, and such bias must be avoided in every way possible. However, disproportionality could also be accounted for by factors other than bias in identification, and it is important to note how these other factors could be explanatory. Let us consider three. First, genetic or other biological factors could give rise to differences that are disabling, as is certainly true in the case of some genetic (and therefore ancestral) syndromes, such as Tay–Sachs disease or sickle cell anemia. Second, different ancestry groups may experience different levels of risk factors that increase the chances of disability, as under the present social order is surely true of various groups experiencing the risk factors of discrimination, unemployment, malnutrition, poverty, and other life circumstances known to be disadvantageous to physical and mental development. Third, Gladwell and others (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0741932510383163">Gladwell, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0741932510383163">Kauffman &amp; Lloyd, in press</xref>) have discussed how small differences in the tails of distributions (i.e., a small percentage of extreme outliers) can produce the statistical phenomenon of disproportionality when there is no significant difference in central tendency (e.g., mean). This phenomenon can lead people to draw false conclusions about populations or make false assumptions about disproportionality.</p>
<p>In sum, cultural differences lie primarily or exclusively in social values. Besides, biological reductionism is wrong because it fails to incorporate social analysis, reducing all cultural differences to biological terms. Intellectual disabilities, autism, and EBD may be at least partially intrinsic, but they are also socially mediated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741932510383163">Anastasiou &amp; Kauffman, in press-b</xref>). Cultural reductionism is wrong, too, because it fails to confront the structural-biological and functional (cognitive-behavioral) level of analysis, reducing all disabilities to social construction.</p>

<title>Implications for the Disability Movement and Special Education</title>
<p>Typically, proponents of a social or minority group model have promoted the idea of full inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0741932510383163">Oliver, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0741932510383163">Skrtic, 1991</xref>), defined as the full-time teaching of all children with disabilities in general education classes in their neighborhood schools, regardless of the type or severity of disability. Thus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0741932510383163">Oliver’s (2000)</xref> social model is based on arguments that American full inclusionists, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0741932510383163">Lipsky and Gartner (1996)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0741932510383163">Stainback and Stainback (1991)</xref>, have embraced. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0741932510383163">Oliver (2000)</xref> called for the abolition of special education because it does not fit into the postmodern spirit of a postindustrial society or late capitalism. In his ideological analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0741932510383163">Oliver (2000)</xref> judged that special education has no future because the new trends in the politics of postmodernity leave no space for it. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0741932510383163">Oliver’s (2000)</xref> words,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>In these increasingly intense struggles between conservative and radical forces, standing still is not an option for special education. If the forces of reaction emerge triumphant, society will not continue to fund special places for special people because the economic returns will not justify it and eradication will be the preferred option. If the forces of radicalism emerge triumphant, there will simply be no place for special education in the inclusive society.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>We agree with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0741932510383163">Oliver (2000)</xref> on the point that some political forces would be very pleased to see the elimination of special education; neoliberal privatization and marketization policies represent some of them (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741932510383163">Anastasiou &amp; Kauffman, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0741932510383163">in press</xref>-a). The self-labeled Marxist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0741932510383163">Oliver (2000)</xref> considers this project an objective and inescapable process and goes so far as to entertain the idea of the demise of special education.</p>
<p>With respect to inclusive education, which has become a worldwide phenomenon (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0741932510383163">Anastasiou &amp; Keller, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0741932510383163">Warnock, 2005</xref>), our general position is that <italic>some</italic> children can be taught well in general education classrooms and inclusive settings. Unfortunately, <italic>some</italic> cannot because of the nature of their special educational needs (for further discussion see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0741932510383163">Kauffman &amp; Hallahan, 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0741932510383163">Kauffman &amp; Hung, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0741932510383163">Warnock, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0741932510383163">Zigmond, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0741932510383163">Zigmond &amp; Kloo, in press</xref>). Placement of students with physical disabilities in general education is right when their educational needs can be met there, which is often but far from always the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0741932510383163">Kauffman &amp; Hallahan, 2005a</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0741932510383163">Hallahan et al. (2009)</xref> wrote,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>Educating students with physical disabilities is not so much a matter of special instruction for children with disabilities as it is of educating the nondisabled population. . . . People with physical disabilities solve many of their own problems, but their lives are often needlessly complicated because the nondisabled give no thought to what life is like for someone with specific physical limitations. Design adaptations in buildings, furniture, household appliances, and clothing can make it possible for someone with a physical disability to function as efficiently as a nondisabled person in a home, school, or community. (p. 514)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>But unfortunately this is not the case for <italic>all</italic> children with disabilities (i.e., each and every one of them; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0741932510383163">Bateman, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0741932510383163">Rozalski, Miller, &amp; Stewart, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0741932510383163">Zigmond &amp; Kloo, in press</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0741932510383163">Hallenbeck and Kauffman (1996)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0741932510383163">Brigham and Kauffman (1998)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0741932510383163">Gliona, Gonzales, and Jacobson (2005)</xref> explain why special, dedicated environments are sometimes necessary for students with disabilities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0741932510383163">Kauffman, Lloyd, Baker, and Riedel (1995)</xref> raised serious questions about the full inclusion of all students with EBD, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0741932510383163">Kauffman, Bantz, and McCullough (2002)</xref> described how the special needs of students with EBD were met successfully in a self-contained special class. If we really want a political strategy to achieve social inclusion of people with disabilities to the greatest extent feasible, then we cannot behave as ostriches, burying our heads in the sand and declining to deal with difficult educational problems and complex dilemmas, pretending that they do not exist.</p>
<p>The ideal of an inclusive democracy does not necessarily correspond to full inclusion of all students in general education classrooms. Equity in education should not be confused with uniformity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0741932510383163">McKay, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0741932510383163">Rozalski et al., in press</xref>). Social justice cannot be achieved for students with disabilities by merely aping the civil rights movement for ethnic or racial minorities. Social injustice can be perpetuated in at least two ways. The first is to treat students with typical abilities unequally because of some irrelevant difference such as skin color or parentage, as in the case of racially segregated education. The second, equally unjust, is to educate all students with disabilities the same way along the placement dimension, as in the case of full inclusion or any other uniform placement decision (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0741932510383163">Kauffman &amp; Landrum, 2009</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0741932510383163">Gliona et al. (2005)</xref> explain, some students with disabilities need education that is better, more accurately described as dedicated than as segregated. A pragmatic approach to disability recognizes that we should provide for students with disabilities the best education we can, regardless of type or degree of disability. The learning needs of a particular student are the right starting point for a discussion of the kind of education we should offer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0741932510383163">Bateman, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0741932510383163">Bateman &amp; Linden, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The practical consequence of missing the meaning of disabilities, such as autism, EBD, and intellectual disabilities, is the failure to recognize that the students with these disabilities need additional and special support when this is required. Failure to recognize special needs diminishes the opportunities of people with disabilities to have intensive and appropriate education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0741932510383163">Kauffman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0741932510383163">McKay, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0741932510383163">Zigmond &amp; Kloo, in press</xref>). Such failures diminish also the possibility of pursuing an independent life. Thus, the path of ignorance, the path of pretense that disabilities are just another difference, and the cynical assumption that nothing can be done by special education to help them may be seen for what they are (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0741932510383163">Kauffman &amp; Konold, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0741932510383163">McKay, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Meeting the learning needs of all children with disabilities requires thinking about both the multifaceted needs of children and the demands of social inclusion. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0741932510383163">Low (2006)</xref>, a blind activist, noted that an efficient strategy of social inclusion</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>entails modification of the impairment through prevention and cure, and modification of the individual through treatment, training and rehabilitation, as well as modification of the environment; and . . . a recognition that inclusion is a two-way street which requires the disabled person to come halfway to meet society at the same time as requiring society to make its maximum possible accommodation to him. (p. 111)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In our view, the social inclusion of people with disabilities can be served by two complementary strategies: (a) treating the recognition of difference as a political issue and removing barriers to parity in social life and (b) creating political pressure for social compensation or redistribution of resources and opportunities, the aim being to offer maximum educational, economic, and social opportunities for people with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741932510383163">Danermark &amp; Coniavitis Gellerstendt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0741932510383163">Erkulwater, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741932510383163">Fraser, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0741932510383163">2000</xref>). A balanced and comprehensive political strategy in which there is both a concern for social redistribution and recognition of diversity can revive the stagnant disability movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0741932510383163">Erkulwater, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0741932510383163">McKay, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0741932510383163">Shakespeare, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In the past two decades the politics of “recognition of difference” have disfavored the disability benefit programs that are part of the social welfare state. During debate over the American Disabilities Act in 1990, Bob Kafka, a wheelchair -using activist, expressed this distaste with the following words: “We are not going to be passive recipients of charity anymore. We’re changing our image. We are demanding our rights” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0741932510383163">Shapiro, 1993</xref>, p. 135). But downsizing welfare programs has had grotesque consequences for many of society’s most vulnerable people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0741932510383163">Edelman &amp; Ehrenreich, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The negative consequences of a monolithic “identity” or “civil rights” political strategy are plenty. As Burke (2002) put it bluntly, “Rights do not create jobs” (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0741932510383163">Erkulwater, 2006</xref>, p. 235). Even if the “social model” approach has facilitated the self-organization of some people with disabilities, especially those of people with physical disabilities and deafness, it has not been sufficient to improve opportunities for <italic>all</italic> people with disabilities or ensure their full participation in social life, which is our common purpose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0741932510383163">Erkulwater, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0741932510383163">Shakespeare, 2006</xref>).</p>

For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0741932510383163">Oliver (1993)</xref> welcomes the restructuring of the British welfare state because he believes that it reduces the “culture of dependency” (see his discussion pp. 51–53) of people with disabilities in education, health care, financial support, and any other state provision.

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0741932510383163">Oliver (1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0741932510383163">1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0741932510383163">1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0741932510383163">1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0741932510383163">1996b</xref>) is right when he notes the limits of the social welfare state and the micro politics of power, that is, the existing problems of state intrusion on privacy and professional paternalism on one hand and the pathetic dependency of people with disabilities on the other hand. However, his hostility toward any kind of professional assessment, identification processes, and professionalized welfare services on an individual basis as well as his sterile anti-institutional attitude do not allow him to fully appreciate the significance of the macro politics of power, that is, the substantial disinvestment in social welfare programs as well as the dependence on private philanthropy in “privatization times” in absence of the welfare state (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0741932510383163">Oliver, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0741932510383163">1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0741932510383163">1996b</xref>; also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0741932510383163">Edelman &amp; Ehrenreich, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0741932510383163">Erkulwater, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0741932510383163">Harvey, 2005</xref>). We do not live in a purely “cultural” society that has no relationship to economics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0741932510383163">Fraser, 2000</xref>). And the current reality is that social welfare services have slid down a steep slope and the “safety net” has been left with more holes than ever. Thus, the neglect or underestimation of the politics of redistribution in such a sociopolitical context of limited resources can lead to losses of rights <italic>and</italic> benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0741932510383163">Bauman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0741932510383163">Erkulwater, 2006</xref>). Indeed, today’s social reality is that governments in the United States and European countries have reduced entitlement spending and expenditures for rehabilitation services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0741932510383163">Edelman &amp; Ehrenreich, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0741932510383163">Erkulwater, 2006</xref>). In more philosophical language, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0741932510383163">Bauman (1994)</xref> warned of the threats of a generalized deinstitutionalized attitude toward provisions for social welfare:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>Recent years have been marked by a slow yet relentless dismantling or weakening of agencies which used to institutionalize the <italic>commonality</italic> of fate, and their replacement with institutions expressing and promoting the <italic>diversity</italic> of fate. The intended or unintended effect of the process is to re-cast the commonality (and communal action in general) from being the source of individual security into the individual’s burden and bane; an extra load to carry, adding little to the individual’s personal well-being, yet something one cannot, regrettably, easily sake off though one would dearly like to. (p. 20)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Today the promise of the social model and identity politics has been broken. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0741932510383163">Erkulwater (2006)</xref> has extensively analyzed,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>The negative conception of disability rights rings hollow for those individuals who are disabled or otherwise disadvantaged that they may never be able to work. For them, the social safety net is a vital prerequisite to community integration. . . . By presenting policymakers with a false choice between welfare and work . . . the rhetoric of disability rights has sometimes, however unintentionally, undercut the foundation needed to build extensive, publicly backed income support and social services programs that, in addition to civil rights, are required for true integration. (p. 242)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In short, there is the need to keep in mind those who have disabilities but whose needs and interests are lost in philosophical debates, political deliberations, and false strategy choices. After all, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0741932510383163">Marx’s (1959)</xref> famous thesis, “Social life is essentially <italic>practical</italic>. All mysteries which mislead theory to mysticism find their rational solution in human practice and in the comprehension of this practice” (p. 285). Regrettably, the social model fails to read the sociopolitical context, and, unintentionally, this can be harmful for the needs and rights of many people with disabilities, as well as many poor people who have no disabilities. Thus, an initially heretic idea has proved, in one respect, to be conservative. In our view a balanced approach to the disadvantages of disability should be based on two pillars: recognition and social compensation. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0741932510383163">Erkulwater (2006)</xref> words, “The welfare rights are just as significant to social inclusion as antidiscrimination rights. . . . Rights without social support are mere paper guaranties” (p. 242).</p>
<p>Today’s special education, without demonization and hyperbole, can be viewed as a basic part of a social compensatory strategy, trying to help the full development of atypical students to face their predicaments, maximizing their functioning and educational capabilities. The juxtaposition of special education and social inclusion is as wrong as the juxtaposition of social welfare and disability rights. In many diverse ways (including inclusive and pull-out settings), special education serves two just aims: personal improvement and social inclusion. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0741932510383163">Kauffman (2002)</xref> has put it,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>I think I do understand the necessity of valuing people whether they have disabilities or not, the importance of getting on with one’s life whether they have disabilities or not, the need to get the past lamentation. But I cannot bring myself not to care or not to want to help change a disability into an ability–and in my judgment any humane society will care enough about people with disabilities to want to do the same. (p. 93)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Special education should continue to strive for two goals: (a) reducing disabilities and their effects and (b) fostering the positive valuing of people with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0741932510383163">Hallahan &amp; Kauffman, 1994</xref>). We should emphasize the process of development and allow special education—specially designed and highly intensive, individualized instruction—to flourish. We need to recognize that there are, should be—indeed, <italic>must</italic> be—differences between general and special education and that social justice demands both (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0741932510383163">Zigmond &amp; Kloo, in press</xref>). Both biological and sociocultural determinism represent a pessimistic and rather cynical view of the possibilities of educational outcomes for infants, children, and adolescents with disabilities. We do need to recognize the fact that disabilities are socially constructed in part without denying the biological differences from which they are constructed or the value of such social construction for achieving what we consider basic fairness.</p>
