<abstract>
<p>This article, by analyzing a major development initiative undertaken in upstate New York, seeks to broaden our understanding of a dominant model of economic development: industrial recruitment. Whereas prior studies have examined this model mainly within separate, individual communities, this article broadens the analysis to the regional level and examines how regional economic development organizations can help mediate local political fragmentation that can potentially undermine cross-jurisdictional economic development ventures. With this, we explore how these organizations can exploit the bonding and bridging social ties within and between communities to advance a project, the methods they employ to broaden cross-community consensus regarding a project, and how they can potentially mediate political conflict that may arise as a result of a development venture.</p>

<p>Even prior to the major economic contraction witnessed in 2008–2009, the economies of upstate New York faced serious systemic challenges stemming largely from the extensive economic restructuring dating back to the 1970s and earlier. Once an economic powerhouse with incomes above the national average, large-scale industrial retrenchment related in part to globalized economic linkages has threatened entire metropolitan areas in the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr283-0160323X11420885">Kuzniak 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0160323X11420885">Pendall and Christopherson 2004</xref>). These shifts have not gone unnoticed by state and local officials who have undertaken numerous economic development initiatives aimed at diversifying upstate’s traditional, manufacturing-dependent economy.</p>
<p>This article, by analyzing a major regional development initiative undertaken in one county in upstate New York, seeks to broaden our understanding of a common model of development: industrial recruitment. Researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160323X11420885">Duncan 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0160323X11420885">Ramsey 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0160323X11420885">Sharp et al. 2002</xref>) have analyzed how what they term “community social organization” influences development strategies. Although this study continues the analysis of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0160323X11420885">Sharp et al. (2002)</xref> in regard to industrial recruitment, it shifts the focus to regional-level economic development initiatives that span community lines. Appropriately, this article analyzes the role of cross-jurisdictional economic development organizations in the implementation of regional industrial recruitment projects.</p>
<p>The article’s emphasis on regional actors arises from the issue of political fragmentation or the array of disparate political and jurisdictional bodies within metropolitan areas. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0160323X11420885">Rusk (2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0160323X11420885">2005</xref>) argues that fragmented governance undermines regional development as various governments and institutions attempt to promote their own interests at the expense of regional well-being. To compete local communities rely, in part, on the fostering of social capital as the community literature is full of cases that suggest social capital enhances local economic development. Therefore, can the fostering of social capital <italic>across</italic> jurisdictions, in turn mediating political fragmentation, also enhance <italic>regional</italic> economic development?</p>
<p>The specific questions that arise from this study include: What methods do regional economic development organizations use to amass local support for projects that span municipal lines, how do these entities use or exploit bonding and bridging social capital that exists within and between communities to advance industrial recruitment projects, and how can these entities mediate local political conflict that can potentially arise with the advancement of said projects?</p>

<title>Industrial Recruitment</title>
<p>Industrial recruitment conventionally involves efforts to attract an outside firm (electronics, food processing, etc.) to an area using various types of tax incentives and public subsidies, including zero- to low-interest loans and enhancements to physical infrastructure. Not surprisingly, industrial recruitment has received wide scholarly attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160323X11420885">Crowe 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0160323X11420885">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0160323X11420885">Eisinger 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0160323X11420885">Flora 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr281-0160323X11420885">Hansen 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0160323X11420885">Turner 2003</xref>). Often generating substantial employment opportunities and attractive to politicians who use high-profile projects to boost their public persona, industrial recruitment has been a popular strategy over the last few decades. The approach, however, has its fair share of critics. They illustrate that such strategies often seek to attract firms in stagnant sectors with low levels of innovative capacities and corresponding wages. Indicative of their marginal commitment levels to communities, such firms are also likely to peruse for locations with low labor costs. Moreover, once a firm’s subsidies from a community expire, it is not uncommon for these interests to pick up and move to another location offering new incentives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0160323X11420885">Eisinger 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Other researchers have suggested that beyond the ineffective use of public resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0160323X11420885">Buchholz 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0160323X11420885">Burstein and Rolnick 1995</xref>), offering incentives to firms to invest in certain locations has a marginal effect on the location choices of firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0160323X11420885">Wolman 1988</xref>). Rather than simply public incentives, companies tend to locate in places that have highly trained labor pools, good transportation networks, and access to customers and suppliers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0160323X11420885">Turner 2003</xref>). Finally, as public resistance to direct firm subsidization grows, business leaders have increasingly turned to more comprehensive plans that aim to strengthen the region’s workforce and physical infrastructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0160323X11420885">Gainsborough 2003</xref>). This sometimes involves either the explicit or tacit support of expanded regionalism or regional cooperation.</p>

<title>Overview of Regionalism</title>
<p>Although the definitions vary, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0160323X11420885">Briffault (2000)</xref> explains regionalism as formal or informal policies that “shift certain authorities to institutions, organizations, or procedural structures with larger territorial scope and more population than existing local governments.” From this understanding, metropolitan areas are real economic and social units in which residents, businesses, and markets are all interdependent. As metropolitan areas continue to grow, many issues facing communities are largely beyond the scope, capability, and proficiency of local governments. Regionalists, therefore, argue that numerous issues, including land-use policies, transportation networks, pollution, and economic development are generally beyond the adequate accommodation of local, fragmented governments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0160323X11420885">Swanstrom 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>This study focuses on the economic development component of regionalism, and much has been written in this area. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0160323X11420885">Rusk (2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0160323X11420885">2005</xref>) argues that fragmented governance undermines economic development and that such conditions explain, for example, why parts of the highly fragmented Midwest and Northeast (including upstate New York) have fallen behind. Rusk and others contend that economic competitiveness requires flexibility and cooperation, but with governance fragmented between cities, suburbs, towns, and villages, for example, constituencies are also fragmented, and thus parochial rather than metropolitan interests are privileged. Fragmentation also tends to weaken central cities, and therefore any economic gains in the suburbs are offset by declines in the former (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0160323X11420885">Dreier, Mollenkompf, and Swanstron 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0160323X11420885">Orfield 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0160323X11420885">Rusk 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0160323X11420885">Lubell, Feiock, and Ramirez (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0160323X11420885">Hamilton, Miller, and Paytas (2004)</xref> analyze how government arrangements shape regional development pressures. Fragmented metropolitan areas located in states with highly centralized state governments have the worst competitiveness outcomes. In contrast, centralized or integrated metropolitan regions located in decentralized states fare the best on these scales. While these studies support Rusk’s arguments, most metropolitan areas remain highly fragmented and few mayors and city managers are pushing for greater regionalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0160323X11420885">Norris 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Due to the difficulties in achieving regionalism at the municipal level, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0160323X11420885">Pastor (2001)</xref> argues that a better route is through ethnic, labor, faith-based, and economic development organizations. Such actors could bridge municipal lines and organize specific constituencies around common interests. Yet, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0160323X11420885">Foster (1997)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0160323X11420885">Leibovitz (2003)</xref> point to the difficulties in achieving regional cooperation among local economic development corporations. Such entities resist subservience to a regional body even if consolidation brings greater economies of scale. Competition between cities and strong local identities also undermines collaboration. Nonetheless, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0160323X11420885">Gainsborough (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160323X11420885">Christopherson and Clark (2007)</xref> suggest that business groups have an interest in regionalism when it is seen as an avenue to continued economic expansion. In this sense business-centric regionalism relates to the concept of the growth machine. Developed by Logan and Molotch (1987), the growth machine is a coalition of business and government elites that sees land as a community’s central commodity. The growth machine’s interest is to maximize the rents or the “exchange-value” of properties and land.</p>
<p>Because of the elusive nature of regional collaboration, even in economic development, what processes and conditions can facilitate this project as it relates to industrial recruitment? Previous studies have suggested that successful industrial recruitment projects are more likely to occur in communities that possess high levels of social infrastructure and social capital than in those that do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0160323X11420885">Ray 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0160323X11420885">Sharp et al. 2002</xref>). If these are positively associated with community-level economic development, will this also be the case for regional economic development involving industrial recruitment?</p>

<title>Social Infrasctructure and Social Capital</title>
<p>Social infrastructure can be understood as the extent of social organizations, activities, and venues that foster, strengthen, and maintain social relationships. It is closely related to the concept of social capital. Defined by numerous scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160323X11420885">Coleman 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0160323X11420885">Putnam 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0160323X11420885">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0160323X11420885">Woolcock 1998</xref>), social capital is generally understood as networks, trust, and norms of reciprocity available to social groups that facilitate resource potential for groups and individuals. Concerning development, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0160323X11420885">Sharp et al. (2002)</xref> argue that locales with strong social capital possess broader capacities to “coordinate action among diverse institutions and organizations … mobilize resources … and plan and act strategically to balance diverse community goals” (p. 407). Social capital can be divided into bonding and bridging components. Bonding social capital is associated with tightly woven relationships and overlapping social networks within communities. Bridging social capital consists of weaker social networks that nonetheless tie individuals and groups in a community to important resources outside of their locale.</p>
<p>Numerous studies have examined the effects of bonding and bridging social capital on industrial recruitment ventures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160323X11420885">Crowe 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0160323X11420885">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0160323X11420885">Sharp et al. 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0160323X11420885">Crowe (2007)</xref>, for example, suggests that a community’s interorganizational network structure impacts the likelihood of implementing industrial recruitment projects. Although bridging social capital was more conducive for industrial recruitment, Crowe found that communities can best foster economic development if they can strengthen both bridging and bonding ties.</p>
<p>Although prior studies have greatly contributed to the literature, they have all examined how social capital has affected industrial recruitment within specific, individual communities. A gap in the literature exists surrounding how social capital affects industrial recruitment when a project lies <italic>across</italic> different communities. Existing research has also not thoroughly examined the role of county governments in such projects. When counties become involved, this inevitably brings representatives from communities throughout the county into the political milieu.</p>
<p>Finally, despite a growing amount of research on the role of regional economic development organizations in forging development projects, only certain aspects of such actors have been studied. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0160323X11420885">Hall (2008)</xref>, for example, underscores the role that regional economic organizations have in attracting federal grants to localities. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0160323X11420885">Green et al. (2002)</xref> find that economic development agencies are more effective at luring new firms and investment than local governments. Given their importance, more aspects of these organizations need to be examined. Listed below are the article’s main research questions that attempt to fill in some of the gaps in the scholarly material.</p>
<p>(1) How do regional, nongovernmental economic development organizations use or exploit social infrastructure and bonding and bridging social capital to advance regional industrial recruitment projects? Similarly, can such organizations also strengthen bridging and bonding social ties? (2) When industrial recruitment projects span municipal boundaries, through what methods do regional, nongovernmental economic development organizations foster multicommunity and county support for their advancement and implementation? (3) Large industrial recruitment projects can potentially create political conflicts in the communities in which they are proposed. How can regional, nongovernmental economic development organizations mediate political conflict within and between such communities?</p>

<title>Data and Methods</title>
<p>This study relies on archival and qualitative interview data. The archival data include minutes from meetings, organizational newsletters and annual reports, and dozens of newspaper articles from the 1980s to the 2000s. The <italic>Times-Union</italic> of Albany and the <italic>Saratogian</italic> of Saratoga Springs were the main sources of newspaper data. The materials were chosen based on their relevance to the research questions. The researcher also conducted structured and semistructured interviews with fifteen participants. Based on purposive sampling drawn from newspaper coverage and membership lists, interviews were conducted with municipal planning officials, mayors and town supervisors, and leaders from local economic development organizations and local nonprofit groups in New York’s Capital Region. The selection of participants rested on their involvement with local economic development and urban planning issues. All interviews were tape recorded and transcribed verbatim.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0160323X11420885">1</xref></sup>

<title>Industrial Recruitment in the Capital Region</title>
<p>The Capital Region is typically understood as the four-county area orbiting the cities of Albany, Schenectady, Troy, and Saratoga Springs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0160323X11420885">2</xref></sup> Its population stood at 794,293 in 2000.</p>
<p>At the height of industrial contraction in the 1980s, local and state leaders convened to discuss economic diversification. Based on the location of existing firms (IBM in Poughkeepsie and Endicott, NY), access to markets, and the skill set of the local workforce, state officials concluded that semiconductor manufacturing was a viable path for economic growth in upstate New York. The discussions culminated in the late-1990s when a coalition comprising local economic development organizations, higher-education officials, and local and state officials including State Senator Joseph Bruno, Governor George Pataki, Senator Charles Schumer, and others formed the Semiconductor Task Force. The group worked to attract Sematech, a consortium of major semiconductor firms, to build a chip fabrication facility in the Rensselaer County town of North Greenbush.</p>
<p>The proposed facility, however, faced immediate resistance and town residents organized to block the proposal. The Rensselaer County Green Party was particularly involved in halting the project and partnered with others to influence the town board. Concerned with the project’s potential impact on the town, including a substantial increase in traffic congestion, land speculation, and unknown effects on the local water supply, in 1999 the North Greenbush town board rejected an environmental review for the project, effectively killing the venture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0160323X11420885">Bolton 1999</xref>; Interview with anonymous North Greenbush official, February 11, 2009).</p>
<p>Rensselaer County is split between the relatively low-income cities of Troy and Rensselaer and the more middle-class, suburban towns adjacent to those cities. Despite the economic benefits to the area, neither Troy nor the other neighboring municipalities were involved in the project. Divided demographically and politically, the county also possesses a partisan split between the Republican dominated county administration, the personalistic-style of municipal government in Troy, and the competitive partisan environment in the suburban towns. This fragmented environment was of no help in the promotion of the semiconductor project.</p>
<p>The rejection was a major blow to the Semiconductor Task Force, but it did not curtail efforts at attracting a semiconductor firm to the region. Indeed, many of the same players in the Sematech venture would become involved in a new recruitment campaign the very next year in 2000. This time the object of their efforts was Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), a major semiconductor firm based in Dresden, Germany. In addition, the preferred site would not be in Rensselaer County, but a large, 650-acre plot known as Luther Forest located in the towns of Malta and Stillwater in Saratoga County, about fifteen miles north of Albany. Officials in Saratoga County were acutely aware that the demise of the Sematech project rested on the overwhelming local opposition of residents in North Greenbush. Cognizant of this factor, county and regional officials would boost their community outreach efforts and work to both strengthen and capitalize on the bonding and bridging social ties present in Saratoga County.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0160323X11420885">
<title>Politics of Industrial Recruitment in Saratoga County</title>
<p>An organization central to the Saratoga County high-tech recruitment effort was the Saratoga Economic Development Corporation (SEDC). Created in 1978, the SEDC is a private, nonprofit consulting firm whose mission centers on promoting business expansion and economic growth in Saratoga County. It is funded by the membership dues of private businesses in the county. Ken Green headed the organization during the years building up to the semiconductor project. A key role of the SEDC was to act as a liaison between local, county, and state officials. This was crucial in that local and county support for the project had to be attained in order to acquire subsequent financial assistance from the state.</p>
<p>Although Green faced challenges in building support for AMD, he was able to capitalize on his reputation for bringing numerous projects to the area, notably the State Farm Insurance Northeast Regional Headquarters in Malta. Because of this project, Green already had close, existing relationships with town officials. But with Luther Forest lying within two towns, the project site would have to clear the town boards of both Malta and Stillwater.</p>
<p>Beyond Green’s favorable reputation, this process would be facilitated by the bonding and bridging social capital that existed in the county in part through the structure of the county government. Because town supervisors from across Saratoga County comprise much of the twenty-three-member County Board of Supervisors, they have the potential to use bonding ties to amass support for projects within their own municipalities, while also cultivating bridging ties when they are in the role of a county supervisor. Thus, the arrangement in Saratoga County likely broke down administrative barriers. For example, the town supervisor of Malta, David Meager, had served not only on the county board but also as the chairman of the Saratoga County Economic Development Committee. Having been town supervisor since 1972, Meager wielded considerable clout in Malta. He had also served as the Chairman of the County Board of Supervisors in 1976 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0160323X11420885">Crowe 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Ken Green was able to exploit bridging ties in the county in that Meager, as Chairman of the county economic development committee, was also the Chair of the county’s Empire Zone Board. In this role, he contracted out the SEDC to manage its Empire Zone Program. Empire Zones are designated areas in New York state that qualify for various tax benefits to promote development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0160323X11420885">New York State Department of Taxation and Finance 2009</xref>). Conscious of any appearances of conflicts of interest over the Luther Forest project, in 2002 Meager resigned his committee post (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0160323X11420885">Crowe 2003</xref>). He, however, retained his post as town supervisor.</p>
<p>The SEDC would also exploit the same type of networks between Stillwater and the county. With these strong ties local and county officials would eventually secure funding from the state for a massive water project. Here, Stillwater’s former town supervisor, J. Gregory Connors, had served on the county’s water committee. As a result, he possessed a strong relationship with the Saratoga County Water Authority. Because the fabrication of semiconductors requires vast amounts of water, in order to attract AMD, county officials would have to construct an extensive new system. They favored a $66 million plan that diverted water from the Hudson river through a twenty-eight-mile line along the Interstate 87 corridor to Malta and Stillwater.</p>
<p>Evoking dissention from Democrats in Saratoga Springs, landowners, and environmentalists, the waterline became one of the most contentious issues involving the AMD project. Connors, however, worked with Raymond Callanan, Chairman of the county water committee and with the president of the Saratoga County Water Authority, Michael Millea, in securing state funding for the waterline, including a $10 million grant through Senator Joseph Bruno (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0160323X11420885">Saratoga County Government 2006</xref>). They were also able to negotiate settlements between local landowners and the Water Authority. Beyond the AMD project, the waterline was important to Stillwater in that the town had no independent source of water. Acquiring this infrastructure, therefore, was also crucial to non-AMD-related development—a position held by both Connors and Ed Kinowski, the current town supervisors of Stillwater (Interview with Kinowski, January 13, 2010).</p>
<p>Perhaps even more salient than the county government’s structure, the SEDC also capitalized on the arrangement of the local and county industrial development agencies (IDAs) which promoted bridging ties. IDAs were created in the 1960s to facilitate local governments' access to the bond markets. They are funded through the fees generated by completed projects. Saratoga County’s IDAs are less fragmented than those in the other regional counties. For example, the county has five local IDAs and one county IDA, while Albany County has nine dispersed among various municipalities. Furthermore, the local IDAs in Saratoga County are closely integrated. The Saratoga County IDA organizes the local IDAs and the SEDC staffs them. Therefore, the structure helps promote communication and a unified economic development vision that has been a boon for the county (Interview with Tucker, June 23, 2009).</p>
<p>The harmonization of the county’s IDAs facilitated the AMD project in Stillwater. The town board’s support was strengthened when an agreement was reached between Stillwater, the SEDC, and the Saratoga County IDA in regard to school financing. The IDA ensured that school taxes from the town’s portion of the Luther Forest site continued to go to the Stillwater district after considerable tax breaks were granted to AMD. Because the SEDC staffs the local IDAs, policy formulation was easier to achieve, making for an overall streamlined process (Interview with Tucker, June 23, 2009).</p>

<p>Even though the structure of Saratoga County’s government and IDAs strengthened bridging social capital in particular, which subsequently facilitated consensus building between local and county officials, the main responsibility still fell on the SEDC to cement the deal with AMD. Overall, the SEDC primarily led a large-scale effort to “educate” local leaders about semiconductors. The process was intense and included activities that sought to strengthen both bridging and bonding ties. In addition to organizing dozens of local meetings, the group planned to have delegations of local leaders visit semiconductor sites around the country. These activities were vital for the process of building local support and consensus for the project, as it was “unknowns” that undermined the similar project in Rensselaer County. Green explained:<disp-quote>
<p>We had some eighty-six meetings with Malta and Stillwater to pre-approve a generic environmental impact statement. Early on we sat down with these people in their communities, I’m talking about the fire people, the ambulance people, the leaders of the community, and the planning board people, and we convinced them to take a trip to Chandler, Arizona [where IBM had a similar facility] …. We had some consultants that understood the industry, and we put them in a classroom and they taught us. Then we went and toured the parks and the facilities. Finally, we left them alone, and they went to see the political leaders of that community … and asked them questions that they needed to ask. It built a little bit of camaraderie—a team—and they could see … how the companies were making the communities better. (Interview with Green, July 10, 2009)</p>
</disp-quote>The SEDC also planned trips to other cities with large semiconductor facilities including Burlington, Vermont. These trips had both bonding and bridging aspects in that they brought together local leaders for extended periods of time as well as connected leaders from Saratoga County to their counterparts in other places around the country, respectively.</p>
<p>The SEDC also sought to mediate political tensions by working with local leaders and residents to address concerns that if left unresolved could have derailed the project. For example, a decision between the SEDC and Malta to preserve recreational trails adjacent to the technology campus as well as 728 acres of park and woodland areas in the campus itself dampened much of the project’s local opposition (Interview with Metz, September 23, 2008). Importantly, the SEDC made this agreement known to residents with mailed fliers and numerous community gatherings.</p>
<p>Local officials noted that the SEDC showed a great willingness to seek compromises and address the concerns of the town boards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0160323X11420885">Mertens 2003</xref>). Paul Sausville, the current town supervisor of Malta explained:<disp-quote>
<p>[The SEDC] came to the planning board … and we had an outcry of people…and we listened to them and respected their ideas and responded to them. The town board was {also} skeptical, asked a lot of questions, negotiated the legislation to the benefit of our town’s people—required that there be host community benefits …. Again, the relationship that [the SEDC] built with the town and the townspeople to well over fifty meetings we had. It was all about relationship building. (Interview with Sausville, October 23, 2009)</p>

<title>Project Moves Forward</title>
<p>Malta and Stillwater approved the Luther Forest site for nanotechnology and semiconductor companies in 2004. Largely through a $4.8 million state grant, Malta purchased 1,186 acres from the Luther Forest Corp., a subsidiary of the SEDC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0160323X11420885">Crowe 2005</xref>). Luther Forest Corp. could now sign a deal with a prospective semiconductor manufacturer—one that included massive public subsidies. Local funding for the project came through a $550,000 loan from the Saratoga County IDA. State funding was even more critical. The SEDC worked with State Senator Joseph Bruno, who represented the district, and counted on him to lobby Gov. George Pataki and Speaker of the New York State House, Sheldon Silver, for an incentive package (Interview with Green, July 10, 2009).</p>
<p>Partnering with the SEDC in marketing the AMD project was the Center for Economic Growth (CEG), a membership–based organization in Albany that seeks to foster regional economic development by integrating the various government and private sector bodies throughout the Hudson River Valley. Led by Michael Tucker, it markets the region to outside firms and investors. One of CEG’s key initiatives has been Advancing Tech Valley, which seeks to broaden the Hudson River Valley’s high-tech base. CEG’s main role with the AMD project was to prepare a financial model for lawmakers, illustrating the economic impact of the semiconductor plant. It also helped connect AMD officials and high-tech delegations from numerous countries with Albany Nanotech and the College for Nanoscale Science and Engineering at the University at Albany. Indeed, the growing conglomeration of technological expertise in Albany was one of the factors that attracted AMD to Luther Forest (Interview with Green, July 10, 2009).</p>
<p>Still, state leaders poured huge sums of public funds to lure AMD. The Pataki administration assembled roughly $1.2 billion worth of state, local, and federal assistance. Its justification arose from the estimated $3.2 billion that AMD would invest. Leaders also estimated the plant would create 2,000 construction jobs, 1,500 permanent jobs at the plant itself, and nearly 7,000 support jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0160323X11420885">Rullison 2006</xref>). Furthermore, regardless of their financial model’s accuracy, CEG indicated that the $1.2 billion in subsidies granted to AMD would be entirely paid back through increased property and income taxes within three years of operation.</p>
<p>Construction continues on the AMD (now Global Foundries) project at Luther Forest. The cost has increased to $4.6 billion and additional financing was secured through investors in Abu Dhabi. Close to 1,000 construction workers are now on site, and the SEDC is working at attracting supplier firms to AMD/Global Foundries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0160323X11420885">Rullison 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The work of the SEDC can be summarized into four main components, and each necessitated substantial communication, negotiation, and compromise. Because no firm would relocate without a shovel-ready site (1) the SEDC identified and secured the necessary permits for a shovel-ready site; (2) through visitations of semiconductor sites around the country and dozens of meetings with local officials in Malta and Stillwater (strengthening bonding ties), the SEDC diffused the resistance of local planning and zoning boards in Malta and Stillwater. The SEDC also helped negotiate host community benefits that dampened residential opposition. In addition, exploiting the bridging social ties that existed between municipal and county government; (3) the SEDC helped convince the county to pay for a new water system that chip fabrication requires. And finally, once localities and the county were on board, (4) the SEDC (and CEG) worked to secure massive state funding for AMD. Once more, strong bridging ties between SEDC and state lawmakers, notably Senator Bruno, were necessary to achieve this end.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, while the SEDC certainly exploited the bonding and bridging ties that existed in the county and in some ways helped foster greater ties through their activities, the SEDC’s actions also had ramifications that split political leaders and residents. The most visible example of this was the fight over water. Democrats Cheryl Keyrouze and Joanne Yepsen of Saratoga Springs argued that the new water system for the plant would accelerate urban sprawl in a county in which open space was already under severe threat. They joined a lawsuit with the Association for the Protection of the Adirondacks to block the project. However, a State Supreme Court justice ruled against their suit (Hornbeck 2008).</p>
<p>In addition, dozens of county residents and businesses had refused to permit the waterline to cross their properties. The landowners' suit concerned the State Environmental Facilities Corp. which had an $11 million public investment in the project. Moreover, John Lawler, President of the Saratoga County Water Authority, warned the state it would run out of money and be forced to stop construction on the project if the lawsuit continued (Hornbeck 2008). The state Supreme Court eventually ruled in favor of the water authority but issued that $50,000 be granted to any landowner whose property was damaged by construction of the waterline.</p>
<p>Development can, of course, be controversial, but the findings here suggest a type of paradox in that while the SEDC was attempting to build consensus over the AMD project, it inevitably caused political division as well, weakening bonding ties. Nonetheless, the waterline’s controversy arose not so much because of its connection to AMD, but because leaders and residents deemed it would expedite further development. Indeed, J. Gregory Connors, former town supervisor of Stillwater, made no secrets of his desire to capitalize on the town’s new water source to expand development. Connors is the Vice President of the Connors Group, a major real estate development firm in Saratoga County. Furthermore, former town supervisor of Malta, David Meager, is also the owner of the Adirondack Trust Company, the largest financial firm in the county. Therefore, they had strong ties to the county’s growth machine, and beyond the political and social ties between the various parties in Saratoga County were strong economic motives for advancing the AMD project.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Building off existing studies of industrial recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0160323X11420885">Flora 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0160323X11420885">Sharp et al. 2002</xref>), this article examines this development strategy but expands it to the regional scope and analyzes how regional economic development organizations like the SEDC play a central role in not only attracting large firms to a region but also in shaping important development patterns. It also explores how these actors use and exploit bonding and bridging social ties related to the manner in which institutions are arranged. In this case, the SEDC exploited the <italic>bridging</italic> attributes of social capital in Saratoga County’s governance structure as well as the county’s IDAs. These findings suggest that economic development officials need to be highly conscious of how institutions are structured. Exploiting these arrangements was a necessary but not sufficient mechanism for establishing consensus over the AMD project. The SEDC also led dozens of community meetings with Saratoga County leaders and residents and arranged elaborate visits to semiconductor sites around the country. In this sense, the SEDC was not just educating/lobbying local officials but building stronger <italic>bonding</italic> ties between the various parties involved in the project.</p>
<p>This research also suggests that regional economic development organizations can play a vital role in mediating local political conflict surrounding development projects. Much of this surrounds complex negotiations over host community benefits. This role, however, has its limits. Despite the SEDC’s efforts at bolstering bridging and bonding social ties in order to reach consensus over AMD, the organization’s objectives created new tensions mainly over water infrastructure and ancillary development. Ultimately, however, the SEDC’s leadership, its ties to well-connected allies (CEG), the strong bridging social ties between the various levels of government, the economic motivations of key actors, and the strong political ties between Republican officials in Saratoga County overcame the barriers to the AMD project.</p>
<p>This assessment, however, introduces an important limitation of the study. The research represents a relatively “extreme” case in that Saratoga County is highly homogeneous politically, economically, and in regard to race and ethnicity. Therefore, future research ought to explore how regional economic development organizations operate in areas of greater socioeconomic and racial/ethnic diversity. If such places lack the bridging and bonding social ties of more homogenous places, can these organizations exploit or attempt to strengthen other factors that assist in consensus building?</p>
<p>This research also relates to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0160323X11420885">Rusk’s (2005)</xref> understanding of how high levels of political fragmentation undermine the competitiveness of metropolitan areas and states. The SEDC assisted in cutting across numerous levels of government and various entities at the local level. Nevertheless, the SEDC was not involved in other areas of the Capital Region. Therefore, the political gulf between Saratoga County and the rest of the Capital Region still existed. This dynamic concerned the Capital District Regional Planning Commission (CDRPC), which noted that the new jobs in Saratoga County were far from the region’s population centers (Interview with Ferraro, April 13, 2009). Although the CDRPC is expanding transit services to the AMD site, the region’s continuing employment decentralization undermines efficient transit use.</p>
<p>Whereas the SEDC is Saratoga County centric, CEG’s broader constituency of “Tech Valley” facilitates social ties between county lines. Although this research suggests that private economic development organizations can work to create regional partnerships to advance economic development, it should be clear that this is a “business-centric” regionalism in which other voices struggle to gain a seat at the table. Indeed, other groups in the Capital Region were forced to lobby for certain “justice-oriented” measures. For example, A Regional Initiative Supporting Empowerment (ARISE), a coalition of nonprofit and faith-based community partners, wanted specific guidelines drafted that would require any contractor involved with the Luther Forest site construction to hire a minimal number of people of color and workers from low-income neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Moreover, the CEG has realized that regional industrial recruitment will take more than just tax incentives. It has been lobbying state and county leaders for more funding for community colleges that will train the area’s new technology workers (Interview with Paska, December 10, 2010). The CEG’s advocacy for higher education and its program Advancing Tech Valley also illustrates the role of such bodies in fostering new kinds of industrial policies. Rather than policies designed by state planners, it represents a framework devised by local business leaders, managers of large firms, and educational officials. Future research ought to explore the cultivation of new industrial policies, what interests they serve, and how they can be made more democratic so that a broader spectrum of groups in communities and regions can benefit from economic growth.</p>
