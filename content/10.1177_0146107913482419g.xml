<p>This book is a reprint of Gray's 2008 Mohr Siebeck volume (WUNT II/242); the latter was his 2005 doctoral dissertation (Catholic University of America, directed by Frank Maloney). The book is suited for NT scholars whose specialty is Mark's Gospel. Readers are expected to know and translate NT Greek.</p>
<p>Gray examines the theological role of the temple in Mark 11–15 by analyzing several sections (11:12–14, 15–19, 20–21; 12:1–9, 10–12, 13–34, 35–37; 13; 14:32–42, 58; 15: 29–32, 34–37, 38, 39). His primary argument is that in Mark 11–15 Jesus judges the temple, proclaims its end, and embodies the new temple. Gray's primary method of analysis is inter- and intratextual; he draws lexical connections between words in Mark and HB/OT parallels. The frequent use of this <italic>gezerah shavah</italic> strategy makes the book read like certain patristic or rabbinic commentaries in which the meaning of a text is reducible to words and (the interpretation of) their lexical parallels.</p>
<p>Gray reads the violent episode in the temple as an eschatological judgment in which Jesus offers a “prophetic gesture foretelling” the temple's destructive end (p. 29). Parallels between Mark's association of the “way (<italic>hodos</italic>)” with the temple, Isaiah's use of this word (to refer to a “new Exodus”), and Malachi's use (to refer to eschatological judgment) together lead Gray to argue that Jesus comes “as the ‘Lord’ described by Malachi … as judge of the temple” (p. 22).</p>
<p>The second chapter identifies Jesus' eschatological rejection of the temple as a central thread in the teaching about the mountain being thrown into the sea, the parable of the withered fig tree, and the parable of the tenants. In contrast to the doomed temple, Jesus will form a new community: “What the temple should have been, the Christian community will be: a place of prayer and faith where sins will be forgiven without animal sacrifice” (p. 91). Jesus' citation of Psalm 118 is a claim that he is “to be the new cornerstone of the eschatological temple” and the “new locus of God's healing and forgiving presence” (p. 76). Jesus' use of Psalm 110 highlights his priestly authority and related role of “founding and dedicating the temple” (p. 88–89). Allusions to Solomon and Melchizedek buttress Jesus' “authority to both judge the temple and found a new one” (p. 92). Jesus' entrance into—and judgment of—the temple parallels the plot of Malachi 3, so that his “coming to the temple is the eschatological <italic>kairos</italic>, the fulfillment of the Scriptures of Israel” (p. 93).</p>
<p>In Chapter 3, Mark 13 (Jesus' “prophetic eschatology”) is identified as the climax of eschatological claims about the temple's destruction and the new temple. Understanding the “relationship between Jesus and the temple” as the “interpretive backdrop” for the Olivet discourse undergrids Gray's claim that chapter 13 contains multiple references to the temple. Thus, whereas the widow gives her money to the “old” temple, the woman who anoints Jesus gives to the “new” temple (p. 101). Mark uses the latter woman to show that “Jesus is the true temple for which sacrifice is of lasting value” since it is a sacrifice “of oneself” rather “animal or simply monetary” (p. 102). Mark 13 refers not to the final <italic>parousia</italic> but to judgment of the temple. Such judgment converges with references to “eschatological language borrowed from the prophetic judgment oracles” against Jerusalem (p. 141). As “a symbol of the cosmos” (p. 149), the temple veil (and its tearing) is but one reason for reading Mark 13:24–27 as a reference to the end of both the temple and the world.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 covers the Last Supper, Gethsemane, the trial narrative, and the crucifixion. Gray perceives the temple entrance and Last Supper preparation to be a presentation of Jesus as an alternative (in the offering of his body and blood) to the temple cult. Jesus' language (14:24) indicates that he is the “new cultic sacrifice for sins” (p. 162). Jesus' death “signals the end of the temple … which in turn signals the end of the age” (p. 193). The centurion's confession “points to Jesus' death as the inauguration of the new eschatological temple” (p. 197).</p>
<p>Gray's arguments depend largely on his identification (and interpretation) of intertextual parallels. Many alleged parallels seem tenuous, such as the claim that Mark 13 draws on Psalm 110; Daniel 7, 9, 11, 12; Jeremiah 4, 14, 30, 51; Isaiah 6, 9, 13, 19, 34, 66; Ezekiel 7, 13–14; Micah 3, 5, 7; and many other HB texts. A discussion of intertextual method (e.g. Hays or Robbins) could have established criteria for determining the legitimacy of such parallels. The parallels Gray uses are mostly limited to HB prophetic texts; incorporating other 2<sup>nd</sup> temple texts—such as Jewish anti-temple polemic in the Dead Sea Scrolls—could have enhanced his discussion and tempered certain assertions (would Jesus' claim that the temple would be lost “immediately shake the disciples' faith” (p. 53)?</p>
<p>Several claims in the book are asserted without evidence, such as his note that Mark is written post-70 <sc>ce</sc> (p. 153). Many of these unsupported assertions are theological: Jesus' use of the first person address when quoting Isaiah 56:7 indicates he is “the owner” of the temple (p. 32); the fig tree episode signifies both a “lack of prayer and faith” in the temple and the “fruitfulness of a believing response to Jesus” (pp. 41, 44); the “hour” Jesus mentions in his Gethsemane prayer (14:35) “must be understood as the eschatological tribulation” (p. 170); Mark portrays Jesus as the “only acceptable sacrifice and atonement” (p. 32); the “Christian community” will be “the new place for prayer and forgiveness” (p. 54). Such claims would be more palatable if Gray were forthcoming about how his reading of Mark is colored by his own theological lens(es). Finally, there are a dozen minor (spelling and grammar) errors (pp. 52, 61, 69, 83, 92, 98, 125, 133, 153, 172, 179, 199).</p>
