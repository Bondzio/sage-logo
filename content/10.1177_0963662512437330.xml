<abstract>
<p>We review rhetorical studies of the public understanding of science that were published in journals since the last major review in this journal (1994–2011). Our review suggests that a vibrant and increasingly sophisticated body of research 1) has pursued Gross’s (1994) emphasis on contextual studies and studies emphasizing judgment of scientific rhetorics, 2) is producing a growing body of work designed to develop specific strategies for scientific rhetorics, and 3) has produced a host of studies exploring science–public interactions (rather than producing sustained fora for such interactions, as Gross argued for). It has, however, 4) produced only modest independent development of rhetorical theories.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>The field of research often identified as public understanding of science (PUS) is broad and encompasses many disciplines. Scholars in rhetorical studies began to engage scientific discourse in earnest in the mid-1970s at the same time as history and philosophy of science were hitting their stride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0963662512437330">Wander, 1976</xref>). These early studies were thoughtfully reviewed in the pages of this journal by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963662512437330">Gross (1994)</xref>. Taking Gross’s essay as an appropriate starting point for readers of this journal, our essay reviews the expansion of such work since 1994, with a focus on journal-length articles published in English. By review, we mean a focused analysis designed to illuminate trends, provide assessments of strengths and weaknesses, and to offer insights on avenues for future strong work. Our review suggests that a vibrant and increasingly sophisticated body of research has pursued Gross’s emphasis on contextual studies and studies emphasizing judgment of scientific rhetorics, is producing a growing body of work designed to develop specific strategies for scientific rhetorics, and has produced a host of studies exploring science–public interactions (rather than producing sustained fora for such interactions, as Gross argued for). It has, however, produced only modest independent development of rhetorical theories.</p>

<sec id="section2-0963662512437330">
<title>2. Gross’s starting point</title>
<p>Given the early state of research in the area, Gross’s essay, published in this journal in 1994, provided less of a review of an established line of research and more of a prospectus for promising work. It offered a set of prescriptions and proscriptions that were generated by identifying the key features of rhetorical study and tying those features to the few extant related studies of scientific discourse in the public realm.</p>
<p>Gross based his argument in a sturdy strand of rhetorical study then common in Departments of (Speech) Communication in the U.S. and increasingly becoming common in Departments of English. These approaches were predominantly derived from a lineage traced to Aristotle’s <italic>Rhetoric</italic> as a foundational text. Specifically, Gross noted that academic work in this tradition attended to the situatedness of discourse (as opposed to its timeless qualities), included attention to formal or “stylistic” elements such as metaphors or genres, and entailed ethical and political stands.</p>
<p>Gross’s central argument was that there were two primary extant models of “public understanding of science”: the “deficit” model and the “contextual” model. He articulated several lines of criticism against the “deficit” model, and he suggested that rhetoric was largely irrelevant within that model. In contrast, he indicated that “in the contextual model, rhetoric and rhetorical analysis play major roles” (p. 6). In defending the contextual model, Gross first provided an illustration of the ways that case studies, which are a staple of rhetorical studies, could be used to build substantive empirical knowledge. He then argued that rhetorical approaches often produced results similar to sociological studies, and that the ability to arrive at similar conclusions from disparate sources added additional surety to conclusions, rather than being a sign of the irrelevance of either approach.</p>
<p>In addition, to this major claim, Gross argued that an additional strength of rhetorical analysis was to be found in its necessary attention to a “moral order in the process of formation” and the rhetorician’s consequent willingness to engage in judgment, rather than merely description. Although such judgments are necessarily “relative to particular publics” (p. 5), they are none-the-less important contributions because they are the bases for social action. For Gross, rhetoric was not merely “a theory capable of analysing public understanding” but also “an activity capable of creating it” (p. 5). Gross concluded by calling for fora for the creation of science within the context of social life, writing that “a forum must be available that insures the political equality of expert and lay representatives and guarantees closure” (p. 17).</p>

<sec id="section3-0963662512437330">
<title>3. What counts as “rhetorical studies of public understanding of science” today?</title>
<p>Since Gross’s essay, a variety of other perspectives on rhetoric, and rhetoric-related positions, have flowered. This makes identifying what is a “rhetorical” study of “public understanding of science” a contentious matter. While programs identifying themselves explicitly as “rhetorical studies,” especially in the U.S., remain located primarily within Departments of Communication Studies and of English, the Aristotelian tradition no longer dominates these programs. Indeed, rhetorical studies in these departments often incorporate voices from outside of those disciplines, including feminist, post-Marxist, and other materialist and post-structuralist perspectives. Moreover, many scholars in other disciplines studying PUS have freely utilized concepts such as metaphor, narrative, or genre that received their original academic treatments in rhetorical theory (especially Aristotle’s <italic>Rhetoric</italic>), without paying attention to those theoretical sources. Even when crucial basic assumptions differ, many fields share overlapping concerns and areas of focus with the academic disciplines of rhetoric. This is especially the case with work in linguistics, sociology, and psychology because discourse plays a fundamental role in psycho-social processes.</p>
<p>Consequently, a review of “rhetorical studies” might take in, on the most expansive possible definition of rhetoric, almost all of the humanistic and qualitative work done in PUS. Alternatively, using the most narrow possible definition, it might take in only a few dozen essays (those which treat rhetoric as the study of the available means of persuasion, emphasize context, take an ameliorative orientation, <italic>and</italic> draw in depth on the methodological and theoretical apparati of some specific theory styling itself as a rhetorical theory). This review strikes a middle ground, reviewing articles published in English that identify with rhetoric (through disciplinary location, publication venue, or author’s affiliation) or that employ key terms of art historically developed in rhetorical studies (rhetoric, metaphor, narrative, genre, etc.). Approximately 400 articles were identified that had at least one of these elements, while 70 articles fit the more stringent definition for this review. Our analysis excludes articles that take a universalist approach rather than a persuasion-oriented, situated, or ameliorist approach (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963662512437330">Koteyko et al., 2010</xref>), and required sustained attention to rhetorical forms, concepts, or theories rather than simple mention of key terms. Articles are selected for citation in this essay based on their ability to represent themes parsimoniously.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0963662512437330">
<title>4. Overview of analysis</title>
<p>We take Gross’s essay as a starting point for this review based on the assumption that a journal identifies a readership with somewhat shared and enduring orientations. Given that assumption, one might reasonably seek to assess the extent to which his prescriptions and proscriptions have been borne out in the ensuing years. With regard to Gross’s central theme—the value of a “contextual” rather than “deficit” approach—the conclusion comes almost too easily. Almost all of the studies that we have reviewed have adopted Gross’s preferred “contextual” approach, and little work has adopted the “deficit” model. This central theme of Gross’s vision has been enacted. Scholars’ enactment of the other themes—the importance of judgment and public action, the importance of creating a sustained public forum, and the role of rhetoric as a theoretical undertaking—has been more varied. The amount of work addressing each theme differs markedly, and work on each theme exhibits disparate strengths and weaknesses. Like Gross, and in accord with our understanding of the rhetorical tradition, we offer both descriptions and judgments of works that enact these themes, including prescriptions for what we see as stronger work for the future. In each case, a summary overview of work in the area is followed by an evaluative discussion based in a single model text or set of texts.</p>

<title>5. Judgment-focused works: Challenging science or its public representations</title>
<p>Many essays employing the rubrics of rhetoric have taken as a central focus opposition to the legitimacy of science or to specific scientific claims. Such a focus arose early in rhetorical studies of science, in part due to an inherent tension arising from many scientists’ understanding of science as a-rhetorical. If a rhetorician were to engage science at all, then that would require assuming that there were some rhetorical aspects to science. This sets the rhetorician in opposition to the scientist. That opposition was heightened in cases where rhetoricians assumed not only that discourse mattered in science, but that <italic>only</italic> discourse mattered in science.</p>
<p>Although such a tension may not be inherent to rhetorical studies of the public understanding of science (even those who believe science itself is non-rhetorical are often willing to admit there may be rhetorical elements to the way science is presented to non-scientists), the carry-over from rhetoric of science studies is visible in rhetorical studies of PUS. A large group of studies of public presentations by and about science challenge their veracity or epistemic validity by identifying the reliance of scientific popularizations on myth or other cultural narratives. Some studies ground their analysis in comparisons of popular discourse and scholarly history of science, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963662512437330">Fleming and Goodall’s (2002)</xref> critique of the myth that Darwin’s <italic>Origin of Species</italic> shattered the religious faith of Victorians or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0963662512437330">Lessl’s (1999)</xref> analysis of how science textbooks use the story of Galileo. The failure to provide a faithful history typically justifies the condemnation of these discourses, although Fleming and Goodall make the case that the use of a “cultureshock” narrative is also counterproductive to fostering important scientific values. Other studies focus primarily on identifying the mythic contours of the discourse in question, presuming that the appearance of mythic narratives undermines the special standing or legitimacy of those narratives and the scientists who deploy them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963662512437330">Johnson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0963662512437330">Lessl, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0963662512437330">2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Challenges to science move from debunking toward overt hostility in studies arguing that science is not only governed by social forces, but allied with oppressive forces. In some studies, the threat is described primarily as the dominance of particular worldviews (which are presumed undesirable). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963662512437330">Littlefield’s (2009)</xref> analysis of the usage of fMRI in criminal proceedings thus concludes: “Far from describing the brain and its functions, fMRI and Brain Fingerprinting produce models of the brain that reinforce social notions of deception, truth, and deviance” (p. 365). Other studies explicitly link the worldviews so identified to specific oppressions, such as Orientalism or colonialism. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0963662512437330">Mechling and Mechling’s (1995)</xref> analysis of Disney’s “Our Friend the Atom” project identified the project as an embodiment of Orientalism as they challenged what they called the “prideful view that we could convert the villainous atom into the heroic atom, our servant, our friend” (p. 450). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662512437330">Bass (1998)</xref> argued that popular science stories about lethal viruses like Ebola employ the racist entailments of European colonialism to “present ideologically charged images of the Third World and its relationship to the West as objectively based scientific ‘fact’” (p. 430).</p>
<p>A few studies further link these worldviews to the production of specific actions by audiences. Thus, Johnson’s analyses of a traveling museum about the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963662512437330">2008</xref>) and advertisements for the drug Sarafem (2004) conclude that the discourse leads individuals to identify psychiatric medications as the appropriate means to deal with emotional and social issues. Of the museum she writes, “The gentle and benevolent conditioning to a way of thought and a manner of speaking, rather than a ‘hard sell’ approach, makes pharmaceutical remedy an obvious and desirable mode of self care” (2008: 344). Likewise, she concludes that the Sarafem advertisements promote use of the drug by fusing “postfeminist and scientific rhetoric, resulting in a depoliticized feminism defined by neutrality, objectivity, and individual choice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963662512437330">Johnson, 2004</xref>: 331).</p>
<p>Many articles in this group thus present their challenge to science as a fundamental matter of oppositional interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963662512437330">Happe, 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963662512437330">2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0963662512437330">Lopez, 2007</xref>). Other essays, however, hold out for the possibility of reconciliation or revision. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963662512437330">Larson et al. (2005)</xref>, for example, analyze the use of militaristic metaphors in three different public issues (invasive species, foot-and-mouth disease, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome). They conclude that this metaphor is pervasive and problematic. Yet their approach remains open to the possibility of a revised rhetoric, as they conclude that “militaristic metaphors are still part of a pervasive, but by no means inevitable, mode of science and policy communication” (p. 243). In a few cases, essays explicitly offer alternative options. Some of those options can themselves be interpreted as oppositional to conventional science <italic>in toto</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0963662512437330">Scott, 2002</xref>), but in some cases scientists are represented as capable of using better rhetorics. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963662512437330">Jack (2009)</xref> analyzes the use of the motif of democratic discourse by nutritionist Lydia J. Roberts, suggesting that in one case her usage served to reinforce the power of scientific elites, whereas in another instance, the motif was used in a more authentically democratic manner.</p>
<sec id="section6-0963662512437330">
<title>Evaluation</title>
<p>Different evaluative criteria are required for studies that argue with a specific scientific claim or metaphor as opposed to those that assume science to be inherently an enemy of the author and reader. The latter tend to share the assumptions of some strains of ideological critique that presume human interests are the sole factor that shapes discourses. From such a perspective, there is no explicit standard for evaluation outside of the text’s relationships to preexisting power dynamics.</p>
<p>With regard to those studies that adopt a more melioristic set of goals—identifying errant or problematic features of specific public representations of science—desirable trends can be indicated by way of an example. Although several essays are laudable, we direct attention to an essay by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963662512437330">Koerber et al. (2008)</xref>, which examines a scientific study of pain relief medicine in labor. Their article in the <italic>Journal of Business and Technical Communication</italic> (<italic>JBTC</italic>) argues that the public distortion about labor medication began in the scientific article itself, rather than in media representations that followed. This <italic>JBTC</italic> article’s meritorious features include the identification of a precise corpus of discourse, an explicit consideration of a particular audience and agon for that corpus, the utilization of specific criteria for judgment, a theoretical base for those criteria that rigorously guides the analysis, and discursive precision.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963662512437330">Koerber et al. (2008)</xref> define a single text—a report published in the <italic>New England Journal of Medicine</italic> (<italic>NEJM</italic>)—as the focus of their analysis. They appropriately situate that text within its agonistic framework (especially a Canadian physician’s several published challenges to the study). They also identify clearly that the relevant audience is not simply other scientists working in the area, but rather the mass media who disseminate the results of the study. In recommending a study that contextualizes a single text, we are not suggesting that a rigorous study must focus on only one text. However, precisely identifying the corpus or archive of texts is important when multiple texts are analyzed. Likewise, understanding the rhetorical dynamics of a text often is enhanced by attention to the agonistic elements of public discourse that shape the constraints and challenges that rhetorical action negotiates. Attending to these relationships may reveal a more fine-grained set of processes and may encourage an analysis that can be more convincing to a broader range of audiences.</p>
<p>The essay by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963662512437330">Koerber et al. (2008)</xref> achieves that broader potential for persuasiveness also because it employs explicitly stated and theoretically grounded criteria to guide its analysis. The authors apply the criteria from Habermas’s ideal speech situation to identify the distortions in the <italic>NEJM</italic> article. They show that the authors’ choice of the term “neuraxial” failed to meet the criterion of comprehensibility given the typical vocabulary choices of experts in the field, and therefore it was likely to be weakly decipherable to other researchers, physicians, and a broader public (who would not be able to “look up” the technical term, because it did not exist as such). With regard to the criterion of truth value, they argue that the article was distorting, because it conflated the unique conditions of the study with typical conditions (greater use of oxytocin prior to pain medication and different combinations of medications). Most intriguingly, the authors are able to turn the combination of these violations of comprehensibility and truth value into a criticism of the authors’ sincerity, by use of the voice of the counter-agonist. The Canadian physician was positioned to argue that the study’s authors should have made the key differences between the study and actual clinical conditions more obvious. The failure to do so means that the choice of the ambiguous term “neuraxial”—which conflates the two different conditions into a singular category—appears strategic, and hence by Habermas’s criteria, insincere. Finally, by attending to the criterion of appropriateness, they are able to show the predictability of the impact of these choices in the public media.</p>
<p>We contend that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963662512437330">Koerber et al.’s (2008)</xref> essay successfully makes its case on the criteria it sets forth. While an expert researcher in labor medication (or a pharmaceutical representative) might still disagree with the implication of the <italic>JBTC</italic> essay (that early use of pain medication is not warranted by the <italic>NEJM</italic> study), such a researcher could not deny that Koerber et al. have established a prima facie case (i.e. one that would require counter-evidence and argument in order to deny) that the strategic use of the term “neuraxial” constituted a violation of the norms of ideal speech. Simultaneously, Koerber et al. have made a well-anchored contribution to the academic literature in public understanding of science; they have shown how novel word choices in scientific articles, by constructing novel categories strategically, can serve as insincerity-devices that set up a chain of misrepresentation that stretches from scientific discourse through public media (see also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963662512437330">Condit, 2007</xref>). One does not have to like or agree with the Habermasian framework to find the demonstration of that process convincing.</p>

<sec id="section7-0963662512437330">
<title>6. Action-focused works: Proposing rhetorical strategy and tactics for PUS</title>
<p>Although we found the enjoinment to judgment that Gross articulated to be most often enacted by negative critique of scientific rhetorics, his enjoinment to action (and implicitly to judgment) is also evident in what we perceive to be an increasing willingness to specify rhetorical approaches that might be useful or even laudatory for public communication about science. Such studies range from the broadly strategic to the more narrowly tactical. The recent increase in attention to policy areas where humanists might find scientific alliances laudable (sex education, climate change, biodiversity) may have contributed to a growing willingness to use the resources of rhetorical analysis for making more productive public rhetorics of science rather than solely for oppositional critique. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963662512437330">Ceccarelli (2011)</xref> has described such a study as an “Isocratean” approach.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, this orientation can put such studies at odds with the studies whose focus was to challenge science and its public rhetorics. For example, where opposition-based approaches assumed that science was delegitimized to the extent that it was shown to utilize broader cultural narratives, rhetoricians operating from the Isocratean perspective may positively recommend the embedding of scientific perspectives in cultural discourses. This conclusion is well illustrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662512437330">Jensen’s (2007)</xref> treatment of Dr. Ella Flagg Young’s largely successful efforts to incorporate scientific findings about sexual issues into school curricula in 1913. Jensen concludes that this case illustrates that “scientific findings generally will not influence public policy decisions until advocates present their logic by drawing from cultural rationale with which audiences are comfortable” (p. 219). As a matter of broad strategy, therefore, the merging of scientific and culturally relevant perspectives might be lauded rather than denigrated from within the Isocratean perspective.</p>
<p>Another informative strategy-level article in this category was <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0963662512437330">Park’s (2001)</xref> analysis of the outcomes of public debates between creationists and evolutionists. Park argues that these debates generally went in the favor of creationists in large part because creationists were better debaters who carefully prepared and better controlled the negotiations about the grounds on which debates were to be focused. His analysis points not only to the inherent disadvantages that scientists face in translating the scientific mode of discourse into a public debate format, but also to the strategic desirability of better preparation by scientists defending the evolutionary cause.</p>
<p>Sidler and Jones’ essay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0963662512437330">2008</xref>) illustrates the movement of PUS into the internet and other new media in their analysis of two genetics-focused websites: the Genetic Alliance and the Innocence Project. They proceed from detailed discussion of the strengths and challenges illustrated by these two well-developed sites to recommendations for the development of web interfaces. Sidler and Jones combine broad strategic advice about developing audience-sensitive websites and many specific, focused recommendations as well.</p>
<p>Other studies have focused on specific, tactical recommendations. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963662512437330">Gronnvoll and Landau (2010)</xref> survey the alternative metaphors for gene–environment interaction and offer one of their own. In other cases, authors offer something like a tool kit of tactical options, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963662512437330">Dyehouse’s (2011)</xref> survey of available visualization strategies for science popularization.</p>
<sec id="section8-0963662512437330">
<title>Evaluation</title>
<p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963662512437330">Gross’s 1994</xref> review, he argued that rhetorical studies made their contributions in large part through the accumulation of case studies, which taken together illuminated the contours of rhetoric’s operation in PUS. The role of the case study is particularly important for work pursuing an Isocratean agenda. Rhetoric is often described as a <italic>techne</italic> or art rather than a science because the work of rhetoric is always done at complex points of contingency. There is no one rhetorical strategy that always works with every audience to achieve an absolutely predictable effect. Instead, proposing rhetorical strategies requires awareness of the broad range of possible approaches and tools, a selection from among those tools in light of the specific conditions and objectives at hand, and the difficult challenge of constructing the specific case in the forms specified by the knowledge of the available options. A rhetorical literature that supports such a highly skilled practice will not simply find some strategies and tactics “good” and some “bad.” Instead, it will begin to elucidate the specific kinds and range of effects allied with particular options and seek to identify the contingent conditions and internal associations that seem to be associated with successful uses of those tools.</p>
<p>In the past fifteen years, the rhetorical work in public understanding of science has made some notable progress toward such goals. Yet this is a large task, and much fruitful work remains to be done. To illustrate, consider the several studies that have begun to address the desirability of apocalyptic discourse for scientifically significant public controversies. A forerunner of this work might be <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0963662512437330">Reeves’ (1998)</xref> detailed and historically grounded assessment of the relative advantages and disadvantages of “bold” vs. “bald” scientific style in early AIDS research papers. Reeves shows that bold strategies were more effective at gaining attention and assigning their users credit for the discovery, but that they fomented something like backlash against their users as well. Four years later, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0963662512437330">Väliverronen and Hellsten (2002)</xref> tightened the focus by contrasting apocalyptic metaphors and more hopeful metaphors in the biodiversity debates. By tracing out different examples of apocalyptic metaphors (e.g. “burning library”) they argued that these metaphors had functioned productively to open up a broad range of considerations related to biodiversity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0963662512437330">Spoel et al. (2008)</xref> expanded the focus from metaphors to narratives, using two case studies to argue that apocalyptic narratives had been effective in promoting the climate change perspectives of their users. At the same time, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0963662512437330">Nerlich and James (2009)</xref> argued, in their analysis of the metaphor of an “antibiotic apocalypse,” that effects were multiple and simultaneously created advantages and disadvantages. Their presentation of these different potential effects was given an experiential perspective by a reply from a scientist who deployed those metaphors.</p>
<p>This stream of research has shown productive development over time. The broad contrast of “bald” vs. “bold” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0963662512437330">Reeves, 1998</xref>) has been further specified via the apocalyptic frame. This frame has been explored in two different rhetorical tools (metaphor and narrative), and multiple topics (climate change, antibiotic collapse, biodiversity). The assumption of multiple different (and sometimes conflicting) effects is becoming instantiated in the working assumptions of scholars. Further progress would seem to be possible if the kinds of situations that produced particular effects were parsed. Obviously, further cases will be needed in order to gain a greater sense about the frequency or reliability with which specific effects might occur.</p>
<p>In this one important area, studies in the rhetoric of public understanding of science have begun to bear out the promise of the case study approach that Gross earlier identified. However, further development along these lines will be needed to achieve the level of contribution imagined by Gross. Progress will also require a self-conscious effort to integrate those case studies into programs of research focused on providing something like a technical array useful for the more skillful practice of constructing public rhetoric of science.</p>

<title>7. Public fora and understanding the public–science interaction</title>
<p>Gross also called for a robust forum in which the conduct of the creation of science within the context of social life might be participated in equally by scientist and non-scientist. This call was part of a chorus of voices within Public Understanding of Science and Science Studies generally which have urged and attend to such fora. These efforts are ongoing, but a major alternative has been a flourishing of studies that examine how it is, within our existing political systems, that the interactions between scientists and the broader public are carried on. While description of existing modes of interaction is the primary goal of such works, many assume that better modes of interaction are possible.</p>
<p>Many of these studies continue to emphasize the disadvantages faced by the public, and they presume the disproportionate power of specific scientific discourses or entities. Thus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963662512437330">Keränen (2005)</xref> analyzes the “cultural maps” of biomedicine and the general public during a controversy over breast cancer research. These “maps” of science–public interaction reaffirmed scientific and institutional control over public health research and dismissed public concerns about biomedical research. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662512437330">Endres (2009)</xref> examines how American Indian objections to locating a nuclear waste depository at Yucca Mountain were dismissed out of hand.</p>
<p>Several other studies show that “science” does not always dominate. They emphasize how the public contributes to—and in some cases drives—the course of science–public interactions. A key example is provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963662512437330">Jordan’s (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963662512437330">2009)</xref> examination of the interactions of medicine and popular culture that produce the “plastic body,” a view of people as malleable objects “whose corporeal identity is always in a state of potential transition” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963662512437330">2004</xref>: 327–328). Jordan shows how this view of the body, central to medical and popular discourse about plastic surgery and body alteration, “is produced rhetorically through a contentious amalgamation of individual desire, cultural knowledge, and institutional disciplining” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963662512437330">2004</xref>: 348). These discourses of plastic surgery depend on medical techniques and authority, but the justification of medical intervention now depends on strategic invocations of cultural norms of “health” and “normalcy” rather than traditional medical standards of surgical intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963662512437330">Jordan, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In a very different example that foregrounds the interactivity of science and the public, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0963662512437330">Ratto (2006)</xref> examines the use of “foundation” and “splicing” metaphors to describe the Human Genome Project (HGP) and post-HGP projects. The analysis shows how these metaphors play a key role in “strategic alliances between scientists, policymakers, technology providers, public health experts, and many others” and how those alliances are realized (p. 32).</p>
<p>Further emphasizing the active role of the public, some rhetoricians are beginning to examine how publics react to scientific and biomedical policies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963662512437330">Bennett (2008)</xref> studies the interlocking strategies used by queer men to protest the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ban on blood donation by men who have sex with other men. The blood ban is justified as medically necessary by the FDA, but advances in testing technology have made HIV detectable in blood donations and reduced the odds of contracting HIV/AIDS through a transfusion. According to Bennett, “the ban is ominous because of the false epistemological images of queer men it circulates” (p. 40). Furthermore, while blood donation is a medical act, it is justified publically as a ritual of citizenship. In a different example of active publics, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963662512437330">Kuypers (2000)</xref> studies a public letter written by fundamentalist James Dobson against fetal tissue research, noting how the letter deploys traditional oppositions between science and religion to justify and motivate opposition. Further studies of reaction to, and protest against, scientific and medical policies might be helpful in more fully charting how publics engage with scientifically-justified policies (for another example, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963662512437330">Ding, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Other studies attend to science–public interactions without framing these as simply a contest between scientists and the public. Such an approach is illustrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963662512437330">Evans and colleagues (2009)</xref> in their study of the “certainty trough,” which describes different reactions to biomedical research. They show that researchers directly involved with a research agenda are aware of the uncertainties about achieving medical applications, and opponents of research are equally aware of these limitations. However, supporters and funders operate at a remove from the research and view its promise as more real and achievable than do the other groups. Further, Evans and colleagues indicate that the discourse of researchers is responsible for creating the increased expectations supporters have. Further emphasizing that science is not itself a homogeneous entity, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0963662512437330">Paul (2004)</xref> shows how popularizations of science are used by other <italic>scientists</italic> “to evaluate, to rethink, and to locate their own work in a larger context” (p. 60).</p>
<p>Finally, one of the most highly attended set of issues with regard to public–science interaction in the past eighteen years has been the creation of “pseudo-controversies.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963662512437330">Ceccarelli (2011)</xref> provides the most succinct definition: “A scientific controversy is ‘manufactured’ in the public sphere when an arguer announces that there is an ongoing scientific debate in the technical sphere about a matter for which there is actually an overwhelming scientific consensus” (p. 196). Additionally, we would note that a pseudo-controversy is often “a contest for ownership of scientific authority” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662512437330">Douglas, 2009</xref>: 146) that is driven by economic and ideological motives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662512437330">Banning, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963662512437330">Hass and Kleine, 2003</xref>). In addition to pseudo-controversies, these types of disingenuous public debate have been called “manufactured controversies” (Ceccarelli), “junk science” (Hass and Kleine), and “backlash” (Douglas). Examples of these pseudo-controversies typically include debates about global warming and evolutionary theory. These issues have also been addressed by historians, philosophers and sociologists of science who examine how uncertainty is produced, but we agree with Ceccarelli that an important contribution of rhetorical studies to this area is a focus on how <italic>controversy</italic> rather than uncertainty is produced.</p>
<p>In one such study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963662512437330">Haas and Kleine (2003)</xref> employ a primarily deductive approach to defining “junk science” and then use that definition to examine popular texts supporting and opposing claims about environmental toxins and endocrine system disruption. While identifying “junk science” as contests over scientific authority in the public sphere that blur scientific, ethical, and policy claims together, their study simultaneously examines “junk science” as an accusation employed for ideological and economic ends and as a genre of discourse independent of the accusation.</p>
<p>Banning and Douglas both examine pseudo-controversies over global warming and describe differing contexts for judgment. Both offer harsh judgments of the skeptics’ rhetorics. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662512437330">Banning (2009)</xref> argues that the inappropriate appearance of a two-sided debate on the issue is partly “because global warming skeptics have used strategies and coercions that lie mostly beneath the radar of public life to manipulate public opinion” (p. 286). The success of these strategies, Banning claims, is partly the result of public expropriation of academic critiques of science, which adds weight to media portrayals of global warming scientists and global warming skeptics as two equivalent sides of a debate. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662512437330">Douglas (2009)</xref> argues that skeptics invoke Mertonian norms of disinterestedness and organized skepticism in a rhetorical performance “as cynical as it is naive” (p. 146). The invocation of organized skepticism is used to defend a dogmatic belief in science’s miraculous power to overcome any challenge.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0963662512437330">Paroske (2009)</xref> offers an alternative approach that seeks to understand the social sources that might generate a public controversy where scientific controversy does not exist. He examines controversy over South African President Thabo Mbeki’s claim that HIV does not cause AIDS. Paroske labels the President’s strategy as an “epistemological filibuster”—the strategic use of “uncertainty over how thoroughly to deliberate as a means to preclude the resolution of that issue in government action” (p. 151). Although he notes the similarity between Mbeki’s claims and those of global warming skeptics, Paroske contextualizes Mbeki’s claims as part of the challenge of international science policy controversies, where different civic traditions of deliberation are at play. In doing so, Paroske contributes to a laudatory if nascent trend of internationalization of PUS-rhetoric (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963662512437330">Ding, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0963662512437330">Xiao, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0963662512437330">2004</xref>). His close reading of Mbeki’s letter to world leaders justifying the policy shows that, initially, Mbeki can be understood as operating from a deliberative stance that views science as the ultimate space for a full and fair consideration of all points of view, although Mbeki’s opposition to distributing AIDS medication becomes identical to the intransigence of global warming skeptics when he refuses to act after hearing the findings of his own panel of experts.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963662512437330">Ceccarelli’s (2011)</xref> essay on manufactured controversies moves understanding of the phenomenon forward by employing a comparative case study approach to identify commonalities in arguments and counterarguments in pseudo-controversies. Whether it serves to create an “epistemological filibuster” or a “fairplay wedge” that opens space for alternative (non)scientific viewpoints, the strategy of controversy manufacturers is the same: a narrative of controversy that “identifies skeptics as heroes in an unfolding scientific revolution, oppressed by mainstream scientists who are ideologically deaf to their appeals and who try to silence them so that others are not exposed to their heresy” (p. 198). Such a narrative casts scientific peer review as a tool of oppression and creates a double bind for science’s defenders who are challenged to debate—to refuse is to appear undemocratic, while agreeing creates the appearance of legitimacy for controversy-makers. Defenders of the scientific mainstream “often fall into the traps that have been set for them, replying with arrogant dismissal that serves only to confirm their opponents’ charges” (p. 198). Ceccarelli offers this analysis in an “Isocratean” spirit of producing and improving public rhetorics and thus closes her essay with suggested strategies for defenders of science countering these manufactured controversies. These include shifting the debate to the values and political issues driving the controversy and reframing dissent as a normal part of science.</p>
<sec id="section10-0963662512437330">
<title>Evaluation</title>
<p>The studies that examine the interaction of science and its publics cover a wide range, but the study discussed above by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0963662512437330">Paroske (2009)</xref> embodies qualities worth highlighting. Most importantly, Paroske manages, in an effective fashion, the challenge of accepting the conclusions of the scientists without losing sight of the goal of understanding the opponents’ motivations. Maintenance of this balance is related to the careful political and cultural contextualization of Mbeki’s speech and opposition. The essay particularly models the recognition of multiple contexts necessary for understanding international controversies: South African norms for deliberation that are influenced by the history of apartheid, and Western science and post-Reagan AIDS policy. Second, the study combines the careful consideration of context with a close reading of Mbeki’s pronouncements on AIDS. The controversy can only be sufficiently understood when the relationship of the textual elements and the contextual elements is developed. Finally, Paroske’s evaluation of Mbeki’s rhetoric has nuance because it attends to temporality rather than rendering a judgment that is time-insensitive; instead of condemning Mbeki out of hand for questioning the link between HIV and AIDS, Paroske shows how Mbeki’s initial stance was grounded in South Africa’s civic norms of deliberation and how Mbeki drifted over time from those norms into intransigence similar to that of global warming skeptics.</p>

<title>8. Theory building</title>
<p>In many major journals in communication studies, an article about rhetoric that does not claim to make a contribution to rhetorical theory is unlikely to be published. It is therefore notable that relatively few articles in our corpus were framed primarily as a contribution to rhetorical theory in general or to theories of PUS-rhetoric in particular. Given the intense attention to theory in much of the rest of the rhetorical community in this era, it is somewhat surprising that Gross’s thematization of rhetoric as a theory received far less attention than his thematization of rhetoric as an activity oriented to public action. There are nonetheless some notable exceptions. Rhetorical constructs addressed include ethos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662512437330">Constantinides, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0963662512437330">Skinner, 2009</xref>), argument spheres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963662512437330">Keränen, 2005</xref>), and articulation and rhetorical registers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0963662512437330">Lynch, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963662512437330">Crick and Gabriel (2010)</xref> added to the work on Habermas in relationship to science, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0963662512437330">Tillery (2003)</xref> provided an interesting study utilizing genre theory to argue that environmental activists created a new scientific genre in response to the constraints they faced.</p>
<sec id="section12-0963662512437330">
<title>Evaluation</title>
<p>While we cannot here provide a treatise on what constitutes good theory building, we can point to the promising future potentials for PUS-rhetoric of science via an exemplar. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0963662512437330">McClure’s (2009)</xref> essay provides an expansion of the theoretical construct of the “narrative paradigm” via Kenneth Burke’s concept of identification. The utility of the expansion is illustrated by its application to the narrative of “Young Earth Creationism.” McClure’s essay is, in our view, laudable as a model of theory building in part because it shows how the proposed theoretical construct illuminates a problematic and important rhetoric: McClure’s modification of narrative theory successfully explains how “Young Earth” Creationism can meet the narrative test of probability for the majority of Americans, even though the “Young Earth” narrative is inconsistent with the scientific evidence and internally inconsistent with regard to the biblical texts upon which it is based. Understanding the case from within this theoretical construct provides an important lesson for those interested in the public understanding of science, because it shows that simply piling on “more education” is not likely to be sufficient to redress the rejection of evolution by these members of the populace.</p>
<p>McClure’s theory building not only meets the test of utility, it also is carefully constructed with respect to the existing theoretical literatures. Instead of simply repudiating Fisher’s narrative paradigm, McClure teases out its strengths and limitations. Instead of simply trying to supplement the theoretical gap with an alien theoretical construct, McClure argues for the fundamental compatibility of the merger as he constructs it.</p>
<p>There is clearly room for more work of this nature, which expands rhetorical theory in ways demanded by the complexities of publics constituted in technologically saturated societies.</p>

<sec id="section13-0963662512437330" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>9. Conclusions</title>
<p>Our search found that about 20 articles published per year were rhetorical studies directly related to PUS. Given this modest output, and given that research in the area is spread across at least four major and often conflicting missions, the increasing sophistication in this work and the progress made toward the various goals of each mission are impressive. The body of research is, however, far from sufficient to the demands in the area. Given the thorough diffusion of science and technology throughout contemporary life, and the challenges inherent to making decisions in a democratic manner in the face of the specialization required for advanced technologies, it will likely be important for achieving better human futures if more rhetoricians and members of allied disciplines participate in these efforts to understand science–public interactions, to challenge scientific rhetorics where they are problematic or unjustified, to improve scientific rhetorics where they can be improved, and to build a theoretical structure to support these efforts.</p>
<p>To achieve this promise, there is a need not only for more work in PUS-rhetoric, but also for a continuation of the trajectory of improving quality and sophistication. The kind of interdisciplinary breadth that is represented in the articles we reviewed brings with it the energy and innovative potentials that are possible when one draws from many sources. But it does so at the risk of loss of depth and precision. Studies that use terms such as “narrative” or “metaphor” without benefit of sustained attention to the full range of positions in the large methodological and theoretical literatures extant about such concepts tend, at best, to re-invent the wheel. At worst they ignore (or fail to engage) counter-evidence that exists already in the academic corpus. The result can be shallow works that do not add to our collective understanding, but rather merely rehearse pieties of particular political groups. Indeed, we found some works that used the term “rhetoric” in their title, but used the term merely in the lay sense Gross deprecated (i.e. faulty, as opposed to “good” discourse). Invariably, such articles also did not refer to existing theories or employ any of the well-developed methodological approaches used in rhetorical studies (as reflected, for example, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963662512437330">Brock et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963662512437330">Burgchardt, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The injunction for rhetorical work to produce “judgment” that enhances public “action” is an important one, but when pursuing such a goal, it is only through methodological rigor or thorough attention to the developed literatures about how rhetorical forms have been shown to function in multiple arenas that scholarship about PUS can be identifiable as rhetorical scholarship, which is to say distinguished from simple partisan political opinion.</p>
<p>Scholars working on these projects will simultaneously face the continuing challenge of overcoming the barriers to locating and sharing work across disciplinary silos. Based on the growth and progress in the area across the past decade and a half, however, there is every reason to expect that research in this vein will continue to expand its potential to contribute to human well-being in technocratic democracies.</p>
