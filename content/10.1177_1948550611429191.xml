<abstract>
<p>In societies that oppose social inequality (low power distance societies), intergroup social comparison is relatively more prevalent. However, with an intergroup comparison focus, differences between groups are more salient and self-stereotyping more likely. Consequently, gender stereotypes regarding math may be relatively more consequential in low relative to high power distance societies. To examine this hypothesis, results from a standardized math exam among eighth graders compiled in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study were analyzed. As predicted, the societies' power distance predicted gender differences in math performance: The pattern of boys outperforming girls was more pronounced in low relative to high power distance societies. This effect was independent of the societies' gender equality and prevalence of implicit stereotype.</p>

<p>Gender differences in math performance have long been debated. Although a meta-analysis of studies conducted within the United States found no gender difference (<italic>d</italic> = −.05; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1948550611429191">Hyde, Fennema, &amp; Lamon, 1990</xref>), across societies the magnitude of the difference varies. For example, in the 2007 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), which administered a standardized test of math to eighth-grade students from 49 societies, boys outperformed girls statistically significantly in 8 societies, whereas girls outperformed boys in 16 societies. Recent research has identified factors underlying such cross-societal variation. One factor is the societies' gender relations: gender differences in math achievement are smaller in societies with greater gender equality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1948550611429191">Guiso, Monte, Sapienza, &amp; Zingales, 2008</xref>). Another factor is the prevalence of implicit stereotype that associates men with math and science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1948550611429191">Nosek et al., 2009</xref>). In an analysis of TIMSS 2003 data set, Nosek and colleagues revealed that the pattern of boys outperforming girls in math is relatively more pronounced in societies where such a stereotype is more prevalent. The current research examines the role of another factor: cross-cultural differences in social comparison foci.</p>

<title>Power Distance, Social Comparison Foci, and Gender Differences</title>
<p>Social comparison can be either intergroup focused (e.g., boys comparing with girls) or intragroup focused (e.g., boys comparing with other boys). Among individuals adopting an intergroup comparison, differences between groups are salient and stereotypical characteristics of the in-group are a relevant source of their self-concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1948550611429191">Turner &amp; Onorato, 1999</xref>). Guimond and colleagues extended this rationale to gender research and suggested that because individuals with intergroup comparison focus are more likely to ascribe to stereotypical characteristics of one’s own gender, genders should be more differentiated among these individuals relative to those with intragroup comparison focus. This rationale was examined on the topic of relationalism, in which the prevalent stereotype is that women are more relational than men are. This study found that although women were more relational than men were when participants adopted an intergroup comparison focus, the difference diminished among participants adopting an intragroup comparison focus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1948550611429191">Guimond, Chatard, Martinot, Crisp, &amp; Redersdorff, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>This theory generalizes to research examining the intersections between culture and gender because cultures vary systematically on chronic social comparison foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1948550611429191">Guimond et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1948550611429191">Yuki, 2003</xref>). According to Guimond and colleagues, intergroup social comparison is more pervasive in societies that are low in power distance, where social inequality is regarded as illegitimate. In this cultural context, intergroup contacts are seen as natural and form an important basis of individuals' social identity as explicated by the social identity theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1948550611429191">Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979</xref>). In contrast, intragroup social comparison is more pervasive in societies that are high in power distance, or in those societies where inequality is regarded as natural and is rigidly institutionalized. In this cultural context, culturally prescribed scripts guide social relationships that cross group boundaries, and targets of social comparisons that are relevant for social identity are confined to one’s own group. In sum, in this cultural context the primary source of social identification stems from intragroup relationships, and intragroup social comparison is more pervasive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1948550611429191">Yuki, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>This theory predicts that men and women are more differentiated on those issues that are relevant to prevailing gender stereotype (e.g., an association between women and relational orientation) in low relative to high power distance societies. Supporting this rationale, cross-cultural research has revealed that whereas women were more relational compared to men in low power distance societies, this gender difference was relatively smaller in high power distance societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1948550611429191">Guimond et al., 2007</xref>). In sum, prevailing gender stereotype is relatively more consequential in low compared to high power distance societies.</p>

<title>Does Power Distance Predict Gender Differences in Math Performance Across Societies?</title>
<p>Research in social psychology shows that gender stereotypes regarding math is particularly threatening and performance inhibiting among women with stronger gender identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1948550611429191">Schmader, 2002</xref>). The current research locates this dynamic in a cross-cultural context and examines whether the pattern of boys outperforming girls on math is more pronounced in low power distance societies, where gender differences are relatively more salient, compared to high power distance societies.</p>
<p>Note, the current framework is conceptually distinct from the theory based on stereotype prevalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1948550611429191">Nosek et al., 2009</xref>). Nosek and colleagues argued that prevalence of gender stereotypes at society level indicates citizens' exposures to a systematic gender bias that is embodied in sociopolitical institutions (e.g., school curriculum, infrastructure for gender equality), which in turn is detrimental to performance. In contrast, the current theory suggests that societies—even among societies where gender stereotypes on math are similarly prevalent—vary in the extent to which these stereotypes are consequential, as a function of power distance differences. In short, I predict that power distance moderates gender differences in math performance independently of the effects associated with stereotype prevalence.</p>

<title>Method and Results</title>
<p>The TIMSS has been conducted four times before (1995, 1999, 2003, &amp; 2007), and its standardized exam on math among eighth graders has been administered at least once in 71 societies. For each society, the difference between boys and girls was obtained from the most recent data (a positive value indicates better performance among boys; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1948550611429191">Mullis et al., 2008</xref>). For 48 societies, the score was obtained from the 2007 version, and for the remaining societies the score was obtained from the earlier versions (11 societies from the 2003 version, 2 societies from the 1999 version, and 10 societies from the 1995 version). Societies' relative standing in gender difference in math was consistent across four versions (α = .647) among 15 societies that participated in all of them.</p>
<p>Each society’s power distance was scored by Hofstede’s power distance index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1948550611429191">Hofstede, Hofstede, &amp; Minkov, 2010</xref>). This score was available in 54 of the 71 societies in the TIMSS. The prevalence of implicit stereotype was obtained from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1948550611429191">Nosek et al. (2009)</xref>. Scores in this index indicate mean level implicit association between men and science among individuals in each society. This information was available in 34 societies. In addition, the role of development, indexed by per capita gross domestic product (GDP) in U.S. dollars for 2007 available in 69 societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1948550611429191">The World Bank, 2010</xref>), and societie’s masculinity available in 54 societies (Hofstede et al., 2010) were considered. Regarding the dimension of masculinity–femininity, a society is said to be masculine when gender roles are clearly differentiated—men are supposed to be competitive whereas women are supposed to be nurturing—whereas a society is said to be feminine when both genders are supposed to be relationship-oriented and nurturing (Hofstede, 1984). To the extent that prior research identified gender equality as a predictor of gender difference in math (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1948550611429191">Guiso et al., 2008</xref>), I examined whether math performance is more differentiated between genders in masculine societies.</p>

<p>Next, the role of power distance was examined independently of the effects associated with other factors in a series of multiple regression analyses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1948550611429191">Table 2</xref>). Power distance was a significant negative predictor of gender differences in math performance independently of the effects associated with implicit stereotype (Model 1: β = −.407, <italic>p</italic> = .034), masculinity (Model 2: β = −.329, <italic>p</italic> = .017), and in the model that controls for both of these factors (Model 4: β = −.465, <italic>p</italic> = .018). The same relationship emerged in the model that controls for per capita GDP (Model 3: β = −.331, <italic>p</italic> = .059) and in the model that controls for per capita GDP and masculinity (Model 5: β = −.358, <italic>p</italic> = .044). However, in two models that control for per capita GDP along with implicit stereotype, the role of power distance in negatively predicting gender difference in math failed to reach statistical significance (Model 6: β = −.310, <italic>p</italic> = .177; Model 7: β = −.362, <italic>p</italic> = .116).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1948550611429191">

</xref></sup> In sum, in all models power distance was a moderate negative predictor of gender difference in math performance (β weights ranging from −.310 to −.465). In regression analyses, neither stereotype prevalence, masculinity, nor per capita GDP emerged as a reliable independent predictor of gender difference in math performance after controlling for power distance.</p>

<p>Finally, I examined whether power distance interacts with implicit stereotype in predicting gender differences in math. Specifically, this analysis examined whether gender difference in math is particularly pronounced in low power distance societies where gender stereotype regarding math is prevalent. This interaction, however, was not significant (β = .203, <italic>p</italic> = .323). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1948550611429191">Nosek et al. (2009)</xref> reported that gender stereotype regarding math is prevalent worldwide (stereotype associating men with math and science was evident in all societies examined). This suggests that the lack of the interactive effect might be due to the absence of societies in the current data set where the gender stereotype was not prevalent.</p>
<p>Similarly, neither masculinity nor per capita GDP interacted with power distance in predicting gender difference in math (<italic>p</italic>s &gt; .557). These analyses suggest that the role of power distance in predicting gender difference in math is empirically distinct from previously identified factors.</p>

<sec id="section4-1948550611429191">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study found that gender differences in math performance are predicted by the societies' power distance: The pattern of boys outperforming girls in math was relatively more pronounced in low relative to high power distance societies. Moreover, this relationship remained significant after controlling for factors identified in prior research, gender equality, and the prevalence of implicit stereotype.</p>
<p>Although research in social psychology has examined the influence of stereotype on performance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1948550611429191">Schmader, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1948550611429191">Shih, Pittinsky, &amp; Ambady, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1948550611429191">Steele, 1997</xref>), cross-cultural examinations of these dynamics have been rare. In recent years, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1948550611429191">Nosek et al. (2009)</xref> identified the role of stereotype prevalence in predicting gender differences in math across societies. The underlying process, according to these researchers, is that the prevalence of gender stereotypes at society level indicates its citizens' exposures to a systematic gender bias that is embodied in its sociopolitical institutions, which in turn influence performance resulting in a pattern of performance that is consistent with the stereotype: in this sense gender stereotypes in a society and performance difference are mutually reinforcing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1948550611429191">Nosek et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, the current research focused on cross-national differences in the extent to which stereotype affects individuals: gender stereotypes are more consequential in low (vs. high) power distance societies with their orientation toward intergroup social comparison. Although this account assumes the prevalence of gender stereotypes in environment, the process through which the stereotypes influence performance is conceptually distinct from the account based on stereotype prevalence. Findings supported the two theories' orthogonal relationship. Power distance was uncorrelated with the stereotype prevalence, and the predictive relationship between power distance and gender difference in math remained significant after controlling for the stereotype prevalence. Hence, this research identified a novel process through which gender stereotypes influence gender differences in math observed across societies.</p>
<p>One discrepant finding from past research is that the measure of gender equality failed to predict differences in math performance. This issue is not specific to the measure of equality incorporated in this research as the measure used in the past research (the gender gap index in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1948550611429191">Guiso et al., 2008</xref>) also failed to predict gender difference in math in the current dataset (<italic>r</italic> = −.071). The discrepancy may be due to the difference in international tests examined—whereas the current study examined TIMSS, Guiso and colleagues examined Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). One difference between these two international tests is the content coverage. For example, PISA has more items in content areas where gender difference is more pervasive (e.g., spatial reasoning; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1948550611429191">Wu, 2010</xref>). Hence, the discrepant finding suggests the possibility that the role of gender equality in predicting math performance may vary across different content areas of mathematics.</p>
<p>Finally, whereas the current research identified the role of power distance on math performance in a cross-cultural analysis, psychological processes that underlie this relationship were not directly examined. Specifically, the current study did not directly examine the relationship between societies' power distance and chronic social comparison foci as well as the relationship between chronic social comparison foci and math performance. Future examinations of these processes will be crucial to the framework advanced in the current research.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, whereas much research in social psychology has examined dynamic relationships between stereotype, social identity, and performance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1948550611429191">Schmader, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1948550611429191">Shih et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1948550611429191">Steele, 1997</xref>), the current research situated these dynamics in a cross-cultural context and identified a previously unrecognized process through which stereotype influences gender differences in math performance.</p>

<label>2.</label>
<p>Due to a strong correlation between per capita GDP and power distance, standard errors for their regression coefficients were increased in the models that entered both of these factors (the variance inflation factor for power distance ranged from 1.459 to 1.660 in the four applicable models). This, combined with smaller sample size, resulted in reduced statistical power for Models 6 and 7.</p>
