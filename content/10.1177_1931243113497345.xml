<p>One of the days that makes Boston special is Marathon Monday, an event that annually attracts thousands of runners, tens of thousands of spectators, multiple professional news organizations, and scores of students covering the event for various campus media outlets. Among them are Suffolk University broadcast journalism students.</p>
<p>In the immediate vicinity of the finish line, some two hours after the elite runners had come through, junior Dan Lampariello was waiting for his mother, aunt, and uncle to run by. And then, it happened: an explosion. “You could definitely feel it going down through you,” he said later. He pulled out his smartphone to snap a picture of the scene and the immediate confusion. In the ten or so seconds that took, the second explosion rocked Boylston Street. Lampariello captured the instance of that blast, a picture that went around the world and became the impetus for a live telephone interview with <italic>ABC News</italic>, which had cut into regularly scheduled programming to cover the terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>Fatma Tanis, a student in a sophomore-level broadcast journalism course, was also just blocks from the finish line, completing an interview with a runner who had finished the marathon. She was still recording, as a young girl danced and flirted to her lens. And then that first explosion sent shockwaves through the girl and the crowd around her. Tanis never turned the camera off, instead frantically following the scurrying that ensued. In just seconds, she captured the sound of the second explosion. She grabbed her gear and started running toward the smoke and screams.</p>
<p>Instinct took over. These students gathered video and interviews and tried to figure out what they were witnessing. I was at the marathon too, but blocks from the bombs and mayhem when I started hearing from my students. After confirming they were not injured, I told them to meet me back at school. As my students began crafting their stories, I sent word to former students from two universities at which I had previously taught that we had some powerful material. It did not take long for those journalists to reach out for live and taped phone interviews with my students. And so via TV stations in Naples, Florida, and Lubbock, Texas, Suffolk students Heidi Walsh and Ashley Cullinane shared their stories with a wider audience.</p>
<p>That brings me to Lesson 1 from April’s events: Students are reporters for their outlet and for the audience at large. We as faculty should reach out to colleagues to provide experience for our students and coverage to their audiences.</p>
<p>As my Suffolk students teamed up to feed our Facebook beast with Tanis’s raw video of the explosions, and eventually a “here’s-what-we-know-now” report fronted by Jessica Bard, colleagues overseeing student newscasts across the country started calling. Richard Landesberg at Elon University wanted to know what we knew. Nancy Dupont at the University of Mississippi wanted to know what we had. Eventually, Bard was interviewed by Dupont’s NewsWatch student journalists. Lesson 2: We, the academic newsroom supervisors of many titles, are partners and often friends. We should act like a network, literally.</p>
<p>The requests for interviews continued as Lampariello’s photo shot around the globe. As the enormity of what he had been through caught up with him, I started acting as a shield for him. Eventually, I had to encourage him to talk with someone not in the news business to work through what he had witnessed. Lesson 3: We have to protect the well-being of our students above and beyond all else. Facts and sources and deadlines are important but not more so than education, safety, and health. Know when it’s time to slow down, pull back, and reach out to mental health professionals in moments of crisis.</p>
<p>In Lampariello’s stead early Tuesday morning, I put Dan McCarthy on the air live via satellite with British-based ITN (Independent Television News) and Bard live with Al Jazeera English. At both networks’ request, I stood alongside my students for those live talk-backs, done just feet away from where NBC News and FOX News professionals were doing their live shots. The interview requests continued, as telephone, Skype, and satellite interviews became part of our responsibility to report and share the story. Lesson 4: Do not forget that your students like and want to be on TV telling important stories. Look for those outlets, when and where appropriate. Accompany your students whenever possible. They want the exposure, but we have the responsibility to ensure professionalism.</p>
<p>As the week and the immediate investigation came to a close late Friday night and the weekend rolled around, I had time to think about what my “Suffolk U News” team did well and what we needed to do in preparation for the next breaking story in our backyard. Sharing the reporting responsibilities worked well.</p>
<p>Beginning with Tanis’s video capturing the explosions, we regularly put video clips and complete reports on our Facebook page. That proved to be a good plan; within a week’s time, the explosion video had a total reach on Facebook of more than 19,000. Bard’s first wrap report was seen by more than 8,000 Facebook users. Our reports on the Boston Common vigil held Tuesday night and the interfaith service that brought President Obama to Boston Thursday morning were posted quickly after their conclusions and seen by thousands as well. Lesson 5: Do not live by your regular delivery schedule. Viewers seek what they want on their own schedules. When you have a story ready to tell, get it out there.</p>
<p>More mundane perhaps, it is not enough to have names and numbers of your senior or capstone students in your cell phone. Any student who might have equipment at the scene of real news needs to be reachable. Load more numbers in your phone or certainly produce and circulate rosters of all students covering what could become the next “ground zero.” Phone chargers also have to become standard equipment all students carry with them at all times. The smartphone has become the gathering and disseminating piece of equipment of choice, chance, and necessity. Lesson 6: Know how to contact all team members and be sure they have the basic equipment necessary to communicate.</p>
<p>Finally, I have always told my students that breaking news means breaking rules. As the school days following Marathon Monday passed, I accepted “working on a story” as an excuse for missing class. That’s breaking a rule, for sure. My colleagues supported students on deadline pushing their students off editing computers, impressed with the dedication the reporting students were demonstrating. That’s breaking a rule, too. And I allowed students wrestling with the sights and sounds of explosions that killed three and injured nearly 300 to have extra time on class assignments. That just never happens in my classes, without grade penalties, that is. Lesson 7: Syllabi can never account for every reality.</p>
