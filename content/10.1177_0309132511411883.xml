<p>In her book <italic>Rural Identities</italic>, Sarah Neal analyses how ideas of the English countryside and rural nature shape narratives of ‘Englishness'. Rooted in her earlier work on rural geographical territories which argued for richer multiple narratives of rurality and for more critical analysis of vanishing Englishness in rural Britain, and drawing on books such as Michael <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309132511411883">Bell’s (1994)</xref> study of the village of Childerley, Paul <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309132511411883">Cloke’s (2003)</xref> work on country visions, or Jenkins' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309132511411883">1997</xref>) work on rethinking ethnicity, <italic>Rural Identities</italic> focuses specifically on the formations of rural social relations through which rural attachments and senses of rural belonging are shaped. Neal draws on a research project focusing on empirical data drawn from focus groups with the Women’s Institute and Young Farmers Clubs which provides rich qualitative information to illustrate why the concepts of community and ethnicity are key to understanding the contested status of the English countryside.</p>
<p>
<italic>Rural Identities</italic> is clearly structured and it is easy for the reader to follow the logic of Neal’s argument and to be drawn into the author’s in-depth analysis of ethnicity and community in the English countryside. Chapter 2 (‘Debating rurality’) focuses on the ways in which the categories of the countryside and rurality have been analytically approached and conceptualized, with specific emphasis on the cultural turn and how debates on rurality have become increasingly contested with regard to national representations, socio-economic change, social exclusion and disadvantage, and the controversial role of policy. Neal clearly highlights complex issues ranging from the rural as a place of apparent homogeneity, order and certainty, and rural spaces as heterogeneous, unstable and uncertain. Chapter 3 (‘Mapping rurality’) then examines the enduring and renewed interest in notions of ‘rural community’ from a geographical, anthropological and sociological perspective. Although Neal highlights the problems associated with notions of community, she also convincingly shows how the concept continues to be effective as an inclusive narrative of local belonging, especially as the ontological securities and local connections associated with ‘community’ continue to create conviviality and networks of social care.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 (‘Rethinking rurality’) focuses on the under-researched concept of ‘ethnicity’ in the countryside and the ways in which location and non-human actors are key to processes of ethnic identification. Using empirical data from the focus groups, the chapter particularly investigates what counts as markers of ethnic identity with a specific focus on the metaphor of ‘home’ and individual and collective aspects of ethnic formation. Chapter 5 (‘Making rurality’) further develops this argument by more closely analysing the relationship between ethnically invested rural spaces and notions of community. It discusses how structures of community feeling and belonging are produced, maintained and recreated in rural community settings, and how rural social organizations take a particular role in this process. Neal is particularly interested in processes that act as the ‘glue’ that hold rural communities together and how rural social organizations adapt to changing rural environments.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 (‘Competing ruralities') then extends the focus on practices of community-making by using concepts of order, regulation, freedom and liberty which all highlight the divergent interpretations of rurality at community level. Neal’s focus groups particularly highlight tensions and contradictions of the rural as both orderly and anti-orderly, as some citizens feel they are more included in community processes than others. Using actor-network theory as a framework, Chapter 7 (‘Connecting ruralities') picks up on this by returning to the notion of ethnicity, arguing that it can be viewed as assembled through composite mixes of human and non-human actors that highlight how national and local meanings are subjectively shaped by attachment and familiarity. The chapter argues, in particular, that formations of dominant ethnic identity (Englishness) combine the non-human and the social as a way of naturalizing and securing ethnicity, and – echoing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0309132511411883">Wilson (2007)</xref> – emphasizes the instabilities of ethnic formation and the hybridity and multifunctionality of rural spaces. Neal concludes that the ‘English rural’ must, therefore, be understood as a space that is relationally constituted, where ontological security is sought and reshaped, and that is subject to competing demands and interpretations.</p>
<p>
<italic>Rural Identities</italic> is a topical and theoretically and conceptually well-grounded book that will set an important baseline for future researchers of rural identity, ethnicity and community. Not only does Neal provide an excellent assessment of existing critical work on issues of rural identity, but I also particularly liked how qualitative data from focus groups is analysed and conceptualized in light of critical studies and thinking in the field. I have no doubt, therefore, that <italic>Rural Identities</italic> will form an important component of reading lists for various rural studies courses (both undergraduate and postgraduate), as well as being of great interest to policy-makers and practitioners working closely with rural communities.</p>
<p>The book is rather short (143 pages of text), and possibly more could have been said about non-white ethnic perceptions of the British countryside, as well as more analysis of how processes of ethnicity and community in the English countryside can inform both academic and practical thinking about other European, North American or Antipodean rural communities. One interesting question worth investigating would be a comparative analysis between English notions of rural identities and, say, French or German rural identities. Similarly, comparisons with New World rural communities may yield interesting insights into the importance of culture, memory and history for differentiated rural identity pathways. However, my main criticism of the book does not relate to its excellent and inspiring content and level of analysis, but with the presentation of the book, especially with regard to very poor editing. On almost every page some words are missing or redundant, and many references cited in the text do not appear in the bibliography (the often-cited Woods [2005] is just one of many glaring examples). Unfortunately, this distracts (and often annoys) the reader, overall reducing the quality of the book. Whether author or Ashgate book editor is to blame (or both) I do not know, but a much more thorough editing, final proof-reading, and bibliographical check would have substantially improved the presentation of the book.</p>
