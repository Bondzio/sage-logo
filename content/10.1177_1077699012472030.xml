<p>Here’s something to chew on: News is like food—you are what you eat.</p>
<p>“News stories, indeed most media messages, are designed to be as easy to swallow as warm honey,” media critic John McManus writes in the second edition of <italic>Detecting Bull</italic>. “The language is simple. Articles are short. So are sentences. Images are dramatic. Key points are trumpeted in headlines and lead paragraphs. Why would anyone need help to figure out the news? The simple answer is that a great deal of what looks like news and factual information on the Web, cable and broadcast TV, the radio, even in newspapers, really isn’t. Quality journalism is in more trouble than sobriety at a rugby party.”</p>
<p>McManus joins the scrum, showing how a diet high in Kardashians and low in fact checking and context is bad for individuals and democratic society. With this update of <italic>Detecting Bull</italic> and a new book titled <italic>Don’t Be Fooled</italic>, he offers a disturbing critique of today’s media landscape and a guide for seeking truth in a world of spin. Both books provide simple rules of thumb on how to detect BS (“bald sophistry”) in any medium—whether it’s face-to-face or Facebook, Fox or NPR, Daily Kos or the Drudge Report.</p>
<p>“Learning to think critically about news and information is essential,” McManus says, “because what James Madison wrote with a goose quill in 1822 is as true as if it were Tweeted today: ‘Knowledge will forever govern ignorance, and a people who mean to be their own governors, must arm themselves with the power knowledge gives.’”</p>
<p>This is familiar ground for McManus, a former journalist and professor. In 1994, he published <italic>Market-Driven Journalism: Let the Citizen Beware?</italic>, which won a research award from the Society of Professional Journalists. So did the first edition of <italic>Detecting Bull</italic> in 2009. In between, McManus won grants and laurels for establishing <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://GradeTheNews.org">GradeTheNews.org</ext-link>, a sort of <italic>Consumer Reports</italic> of news media in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
<p>His latest works are important additions in the field of media literacy because they combine theory and analysis with practical advice for news consumers and professionals. Along the way, McManus quotes from such disparate voices as Lord Northcliffe, A. J. Liebling, and David Carr.</p>
<p>Both books draw from the same material but present it differently. <italic>Detecting Bull</italic> is a textbook, with eleven scholarly but accessible chapters, each followed by exercises and discussion questions for students, plus extensive footnotes.</p>
<p>McManus begins with a chapter about the importance of “critical thinking about news and information.” He notes that as newsrooms have fired thousands of professional journalists, the web has exploded with often-bogus claims: “News has never been so contested, so up-for-grabs. As a consequence, it has never been so difficult to discern what’s reliable from the rest.”</p>
<p>McManus then explores the demise of mainstream news and the rise of “competing narratives” on issues such as climate change. While the scientific evidence of global warming is overwhelming, a growing number of Americans doubt the threat is real. McManus blames this in part on the fact that “for the first time in history, we can fashion our own news diet, not some neutral editor. If we wish, we can tailor the news to our own biases.”</p>
<p>The book then discusses “truthiness,” a send-up about truth by <italic>faux</italic> journalist Stephen Colbert. On TV, Colbert deadpans that while truth is for people who “think with the heads,” truthiness is for “those who know with their hearts.” McManus writes, “At the heart of Colbert’s humor lies the incongruity of someone dressed in the authority of a dark suit speaking complete nonsense with absolute conviction. But the joke is on us. We’ve all seen and heard more than enough guys and gals like that at work, in the marketplace, and in politics.”</p>
<p>The next chapters discuss the sources of personal bias and the “covert bias of institutions.” In the pursuit of profits, news organizations value sensationalism and titillation over investigative reporting and public-service coverage, McManus writes. “Currently, commercial bias represents a greater threat to democracy and liberal or conservative bias.”</p>
<p>Such biases shape news selection, he says, as gatekeepers filter out stories that might challenge the status quo. McManus issues his own challenge to journalism’s standard of objectivity. Often, “objectivity pushes journalists toward creating a false balance—equal time or space—when two or more sides do not have equal evidence for their positions,” as in the so-called debate over global warming. McManus argues that news “must be biased, but only in three ways: for the common good; for brevity; and for making what’s important interesting.”</p>
<p>To detect bull, McManus recommends that people apply his SMELL test: They should examine the <italic>source</italic> of the information; the source’s <italic>motivation</italic>; the <italic>evidence</italic> provided in the message; whether the evidence <italic>logically</italic> supports the claims being made; and whether relevant facts or context have been <italic>left</italic> out. To evaluate the source, McManus offers another mnemonic—the PIE chart. It’s a reminder to examine the source’s <italic>proximity</italic> to the information, the source’s <italic>independence</italic>, and the source’s <italic>expertise</italic> or <italic>experience</italic>.</p>
<p>McManus then discusses “detecting bias in images” (a challenge even before Photoshop) and “the spinmeister’s art.” Today, PR operatives far outnumber reporters, and are “growing bolder and more sophisticated” in pushing viewpoints as professional journalism atrophies, he says.</p>
<p><italic>Detecting Bull</italic> offers a set of “online tools for sniffing out bias,” including fact checkers and authoritative websites. McManus also says people should examine their own biases, such as racial prejudice and cultural blindness. “Making them visible is the first step toward easing their grip.” The book concludes with an appendix on how to evaluate the quality of news—explaining the scorecard and methodology used in the “Grade the News” project.</p>
<p><italic>Don’t Be Fooled</italic> is aimed at a more general audience. It includes the preface and eight chapters from <italic>Detecting Bull</italic>. It omits the more academic material (goodbye, Chomsky), as well as the chapter exercises, study questions, endnotes and appendix. Some of the omitted content is repackaged as a chapter on “the age of transformative information paradoxes.” One paradox: “While the Web spawns diverging versions of truth, it also provides powerful tools for discovering and sharing which claims rest on the strongest evidence. There’s a silver lining in the digital cloud.”</p>
<p>For the classroom, <italic>Detecting Bull</italic> is more appropriate than <italic>Don’t Be Fooled</italic>. This second edition of <italic>Detecting Bull</italic> is a significant rewrite, with examples from the 2012 presidential race. (A perhaps less-welcome change: The first edition began as a multimedia DVD and later was converted to print. For the new version, McManus said he scratched the digital format because of incompatibility problems with Adobe Flash and the cumbersome nature of digital rights management. Also, he said, “When I surveyed the two dozen faculty members using the e-book, only a few reported that the interactive features of the digital version were especially valuable.” As technology improves, McManus said, he hopes to revive a digital version. “I love the idea of embedding audio and video clips and being able to slice and dice TV news stories for analysis. And I like the ability to instantly go to references online.”)</p>
<p>Whatever format delivers the advice, McManus’s words are worth heeding.</p>
<p>“Nutritionists say you become what you eat: It’s healthy to vary your diet, but go easy on the junk food,” he writes. “I’d urge the same for your informational diet, and for the same reason. Diversify your news and information sources, but avoid the shouters on all sides.”</p>
