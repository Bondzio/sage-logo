<p>The Intensive Alternatives to Custody (IAC) pilot programme ran from April 2008 to March 2011 to test the use of intensive community orders in diverting offenders from short-term custodial sentences. This report summarizes the key findings of reconviction rated (proven re-offending) for offenders receiving IAC compared to a well-matched control group receiving Court Orders. Seven probation areas piloted the approach and had some flexibility with how it was implemented. </p>
<p>Those subject to IACs imposed in 2008 were not included because areas did not view their projects as operating at full level. Cases from 2009 were matched with a control group sentenced within the same three months, same index offence and number of previous convictions. Age, gender and ethnicity were also characteristics used to match the control group. </p>
<p>In 732 cases offenders started IAC Orders in 2009. Of these, 356 were matched with cases receiving Community Orders or Suspended Sentence Orders and 228 IAC cases were matched with those receiving 12 months or less custodial sentences within the same 30 day period. Proven re-offending within 12 months for IAC cases was 54.8 per cent compared to 50 per cent of the control group. And for those in the custodial comparison group, 56.1 per cent proven re-offending for IAC cases compared with 63.6 per cent for those receiving short custodial sentences. These figures show a lower level of re-offending in the IAC cases compared to the custodial sentences. The figures are not statistically significant at 5 per cent level, but they are statistically significant when calculated at a 10 per cent level. Results for 2010 data sets found 814 cases receiving IAC Orders. 353 were successful matched with COs and SSOs. The proven re-offending rates were 21.4 per cent for IAC cases and 20.7 per cent for CO and SSO cases. Statistics for custodial comparisons were not yet available.  </p>
<p>The results show that there was some reduction in offending for those receiving IAC in comparison to short custodial sentences, but little difference in re-offending rates compared to other community-based sentences. Other variables that could have been considered including age at first arrest, number of arrests and risk of re-offending information could impact on the results.  Repeat analysis, when further data sets become available, is planned and additional variables included in the matching and analysis of the risk of re-offending can impact on the likelihood of re-offending including risk of re-offending data. </p>
