<p>This book is a collection of seven essays that discuss the political and cultural history of Tsarist Russia. Two of the pieces appear in print for the first time, and the theme of the collection is made plain by the book’s subtitle: Engelstein argues that the Tsarist empire resisted liberalism throughout its existence and that it failed to embrace modernity. The essays deal with a variety of topics, ranging from widely-focused discussions of civil society and revolution to a more closely focused piece on the nineteenth-century painter Aleksandr Ivanov. Engelstein suggests that the Russian state clung to its traditional modes of thought and action, resisting anything that would aid the development of civil society, and promoting the virtues of the Orthodox Church and Russian nationalism.</p>
<p>The essay on ‘Revolution and the Theater of Public Life’ shows how opposition to the Tsarist state developed from the eighteenth century when the Cossack Pugachev led a mass rebellion against Catherine II and the intellectual Aleksandr Radishchev published his seditious book <italic>A Journey from St Petersburg to Moscow</italic>. For Engelstein, the roots of revolution were already in place by the time Alexander I came to the throne in 1801. She argues that the paradoxical attitudes of the state – on the one hand embracing European ideas of law while at the same time standing for autocracy and using all the powers that a repressive state had at its disposal – helped to promote a strand of public opinion that used the values of enlightenment to argue forcefully against the absolute monarchy and its social buttress of serfdom. During the nineteenth century the divisions between the state and sections of its subjects became more accentuated: both the conservatism of Nicholas I and the reforms of Alexander II served to stimulate opposition to the regime. Opposition was played out in the public sphere as trials and executions took place, but even the assassination of Alexander II and the public execution of his killers failed to transform this limited opposition into a mass popular movement. But, Engelstein suggests, the policies of economic development that the Tsarist state pursued in the 1880s and 1890s were instrumental in promoting social change on such a scale that Russian society came close to toppling the regime during the revolutionary year of 1905.</p>
<p>Tsarism survived the tremors of 1905, but the experience left its fate undecided: could Russia’s nascent civil society coalesce and press home its gains or would the Romanovs be able to curb the disaffection and restore their position? The title of Engelstein’s essay ‘The Dream of Civil Society’ makes it clear what her view is: civil society in Tsarist Russia was insecure, and lacked the legal consciousness that could support it and give society autonomy from the apparatus of the state. The Orthodox church looms large in Engelstein’s analysis of the failure of Tsarist Russia to engage with cultural modernity, even though there were clerics who tried to promote reform. War provided an important opportunity for Orthodoxy to assert itself and for Slavophilism to come to the fore, and Engelstein suggests that this gave religion a new impetus and allowed Orthodoxy to once again identify itself closely with Russian national identity.</p>
<p>Her final essay discusses the difficult problem posed by the Russian empire’s Jewish population, especially when the First World War brought the question of loyalty and national identity into sharp focus. There was little scope for neutrality on the Jewish question: powerful anti-Semitic traditions came into conflict with the need to conciliate the Rothschild banking empire and with modern concepts of religious tolerance.</p>
<p>Engelstein’s essays argue the ‘pessimistic’ view of the development of Russian Tsarism well, and she suggests that liberalism was doomed to failure in the autocratic state. The conservative Slavophilism of the imperial state succeeded in standing firm and was able to re-establish its position after the tremors of 1905, but there were still significant forces that were working against the traditional conservative ethos of the Tsarist state. Russian liberalism was pushed into the background by the radical politics that were to triumph in 1917. The Provisional Government proved itself unable to accomplish real change and the modernity that the Bolsheviks represented defeated both the traditional values of autocracy and the developing civil society that Russia’s liberals espoused. Modernization came to Russia after 1917, but in a very different form than had been envisaged by the liberal opposition.</p>
