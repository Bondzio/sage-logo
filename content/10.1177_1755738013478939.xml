<abstract>
<p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease characterised by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. It is considered to be widely underdiagnosed, with an estimated 2 million undiagnosed patients in the United Kingdom. In June 2010 the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) published guidelines regarding the primary and secondary care management of COPD in adults. This guideline detailed the steps that are needed to make a diagnosis of COPD and to distinguish it from its differential diagnoses, such as asthma. It is these guidelines that will form the basis of this article.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1755738013478939"><title>Definition of COPD</title>
<p>COPD is characterised by persistent airflow limitation that is usually progressive. The airflow limitation is caused by a mixture of small airway disease and parenchymal disease. ‘Small airway disease’ describes the structural changes and narrowing of small airways caused by chronic inflammation. In ‘parenchymal disease’ inflammation causes a loss of alveolar attachments to the small airways and decreased elastic recoil. This results in a reduced ability of the airways to remain open during expiration. Emphysema is the pathological term used to describe the breakdown of alveoli that is seen in patients with COPD. This breakdown leads to a reduced surface area for gas exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1755738013478939">Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1755738013478939"><title>Approach to diagnosis</title>
<p>COPD affects approximately 3 million people in the UK and accounts for approximately 30 000 deaths each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1755738013478939">NICE, 2010</xref>). Early, accurate diagnosis in primary care can have an important impact in managing the condition.</p>
<p>A diagnosis of COPD should be considered in any patient over the age of 35 years with exertional breathlessness, chronic cough, regular sputum production, frequent winter ‘bronchitis’ or wheeze and/or a history of risk factors for the disease. A combination of history, examination findings and spirometry is required for diagnosis and the diagnosis may need to be made over a number of consultations. Caution is needed when taking over the care of a patient with a label of COPD, as misdiagnosis is common – both in primary care and on hospital discharge summaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1755738013478939">Jones, Dickson-Spillmann, Mather, Marks and Shackell, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1755738013478939"><title>Medical history</title>
<p>A detailed history must be taken during the initial assessment of a patient with suspected COPD. This should include specific questioning on the five key symptoms of: cough, sputum production, dyspnoea, wheeze and winter exacerbations. Further to this, risk factors for developing COPD, co-morbidities and current impact on quality of life should be assessed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1755738013478939"><title>Symptoms</title>
<p>The most common symptoms experienced by patients with COPD are cough, sputum production and dyspnoea. It is, however, important to recognise that lack of these symptoms does not exclude diagnosis. In the early stages of COPD it is common to have minimal or no symptoms, and there may be great individual variability as the disease progresses.</p>
<p>Chronic cough is often the first symptom of COPD. It is important to ask about this specifically, as patients may attribute cough to lifestyle factors such as smoking or occupational environment. The cough pattern is often intermittent initially, progressing to more persistent in nature, with variable sputum production. As with all of the symptoms described, but perhaps particularly with cough, other important diagnoses (including potential malignancy) must be considered. Detailed enquiry about the nature of the cough including triggers, frequency, sputum type and volume and any history of haemoptysis should be taken.</p>
<p>Sputum production as a symptom can be difficult to evaluate. The majority of patients with COPD will raise a small amount of sputum with coughing. However, there is variability between individuals. The presence of purulent sputum may represent an infective exacerbation; further evaluation for infection may be needed in these cases. In patients producing large volumes of sputum, bronchiectasis should be considered as an alternative diagnosis.</p>
<p>Dyspnoea is usually the most disabling symptom of COPD. Characteristically patients describe breathlessness on exertion, gasping, air hunger or a sense of increased work to breathe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1755738013478939">GOLD, 2011</xref>). The impact of breathlessness can be further graded using the Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnoea scale (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1755738013478939">Table 1</xref>). Grading should preferably be carried out on initial assessment. The scale can be used to assist with treatment and is a useful prognostic indicator.

<p>The differential diagnosis for dyspnoea is wide and can be classified by the time course of the symptom (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1755738013478939">Table 2</xref>). COPD typically presents as chronic exertional dyspnoea, with exacerbations that have a more subacute presentation. Angina can also occasionally present as exertional dyspnoea without chest pain; thus this must always be considered within the differential diagnosis.

<p>Patients with COPD typically find that their symptoms flare up in the winter months. This may be described as prolonged ‘winter colds’ or ‘winter bronchitis’, which have often been happening for a number of years without seeking medical help. If a patient is noted to have repeated attendances with respiratory symptoms or chest infections this should prompt suspicion of a COPD diagnosis; it is worth looking back through patients’ records at previous attendances to actively look for this pattern of symptoms.</p>
<p>As well as the cardinal symptoms discussed above, additional features may be seen in those with more severe disease. These may include fatigue, anorexia, weight loss and features of cor pulmonale, including ankle swelling. It is important that these symptoms are explored during initial diagnostic assessment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1755738013478939"><title>Red flag symptoms</title>
<p>Although dyspnoea, cough and sputum production are common symptoms of COPD, they are not COPD-specific. It is important to keep a broad range of differential diagnoses in mind during first presentation. Common or important pathologies that present with similar symptoms include asthma, bronchiectasis, congestive cardiac failure and lung cancer. It is important to take a detailed history with specific questions to assess for the following red flag symptoms:
<list id="list2-1755738013478939" list-type="bullet">

<p>These symptoms are likely to require further investigation, with appropriate management and/or referral according to the underlying pathology.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1755738013478939">Box 1</xref> shows the current NICE guidelines for patients with symptoms that may suggest underlying lung cancer. It is important that practitioners are aware of these guidelines when assessing patients with suspected COPD, as the symptoms of both conditions can overlap and patients with COPD are also at increased risk of lung cancer.

<sec id="sec7-1755738013478939"><title>Risk factors</title>
<p>There is an increased prevalence of COPD amongst older populations, and it is rare to diagnose COPD in a person under the age of 35 years. There is still debate as to whether this is can be attributed to the ‘normal ageing’ process or to cumulative exposure to other risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1755738013478939">GOLD, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The most significant risk factor for COPD is cigarette smoking, with an increase in risk with increasing pack year history. Patients who continue to smoke after diagnosis have a greater annual rate of decline of FEV<sub>1</sub> compared to those who stop smoking. Cigar and pipe tobacco, marijuana and secondhand smoke all also increase the risk of COPD. A detailed smoking history should be taken and this may be used as an opportunity to discuss the benefits of smoking cessation.</p>
<p>Other risk factors include indoor air pollution (e.g. solid fuel used for cooking and heating), outdoor air pollution and occupational exposure to dusts and chemicals (vapours, irritants and fumes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1755738013478939">WHO, 2011</xref>). Specific enquiry about these factors should be made on initial assessment.</p>
<p>Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is an autosomal recessive condition that is an important but rare genetic cause of COPD. Alpha-1 antitrypsin is a serine protease inhibitor that is produced by hepatocytes. It opposes the action of neutrophil elastase within the lungs. In alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency the alpha-1 antitrypsin has an altered structure, preventing its release from hepatocytes. This results in increased elastase activity in the lungs, breaking down alveolar walls and leading to emphysema. The excess alpha-1 antitrypsin in the hepatocytes can also cause damage to the liver and clinical liver disease may be seen.</p>
<p>Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency should be especially considered in patients with early onset COPD, lack of significant smoking history or a family history of COPD. If suspected, specialist referral should be made for diagnostic workup. Counselling and screening is offered to first degree relatives of patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1755738013478939"><title>Co-morbidities</title>
<p>Co-morbidities are common amongst patients with COPD. This may be related to shared risk factors (e.g. smoking), a result of the disease itself or due to side effects of treatment (e.g. osteoporosis secondary to long term steroid use). Co-morbidities that may be seen include ischaemic heart disease, osteoporosis, muscle wasting, the metabolic syndrome, depression and anxiety. As previously stated, COPD is also considered an important risk factor for lung cancer – it is unclear as to whether this is due to common risk factors (smoking) or shared susceptibility genes. The presence of co-morbidities has an independent influence on mortality and hospitalisation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1755738013478939">GOLD, 2011</xref>). It is therefore important at the time of diagnosis to perform a detailed review of notes and specifically enquire about symptoms of depression and anxiety, as these are often overlooked.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1755738013478939"><title>Examination</title>
<p>The clinical signs of patients with COPD can be variable and examination alone is rarely diagnostic. An entirely normal examination is common in early COPD and it is often not until significant disease occurs that physical signs are seen.</p>
<p>Signs suggestive of COPD include tar staining of fingers, pursed lip breathing, cyanosis, hyperinflated chest, use of accessory muscles, wheeze or quiet breath sounds and cachectic appearance. In severe disease, there may also be features of cor pulmonale. These include raised jugular venous pressure, abnormal heart sounds and peripheral oedema.</p>
<p>Further to this, as per NICE guidance, all patients should have weight, height and body mass index (BMI) calculated on initial assessment. This is important, as patients who are overweight (BMI 25–30  kg/m<sup>2</sup>) or obese (BMI greater than 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) are likely to have a worse exercise tolerance. Also, a BMI of less than 20 kg/m<sup>2</sup> is associated with increased mortality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1755738013478939"><title>Spirometry</title>
<p>To make a diagnosis of COPD, airflow obstruction should be demonstrated. Spirometry is used for this, as it is the most reproducible and objective measurement of airflow limitation available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1755738013478939">GOLD, 2011</xref>). Peak flow measurements should not be used as they show much greater variability and have weak specificity for COPD. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1755738013478939">Box 2</xref> describes the basic principals of performing spirometry.

</table-wrap>
</p>
<p>Diagnostic spirometry for COPD should be performed when the patient is stable, i.e. at least 6 weeks after any exacerbation. Current NICE guidelines state that in the diagnostic assessment of COPD, spirometry should be performed post-bronchodilatation (20 minutes after inhalation of 400 mcg beta agonist). This is based upon limited evidence from a cross-sectional study and case series study, which demonstrated increased accuracy of diagnosis using post-bronchodilator spirometry in comparison with pre-bronchodilator (Calverly, Burge, Spencer, Anderson and Jones, 2003; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1755738013478939">Perez-Padilla et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>When performing spirometry in primary care the following measurements should be obtained:
<list id="list3-1755738013478939" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Forced expiratory volume (FEV<sub>1</sub>): the volume of air that can be forcibly exhaled in 1 second following maximal inspiration</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Forced vital capacity (FVC): the volume of air that can be forcibly exhaled to empty (residual volume) following maximal inspiration</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Slow vital capacity (SVC): the volume of air that is expired from maximal inspiration to empty by gradual exhalation</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>It is good practice to perform an initial slow vital capacity manoeuvre at the start of spirometry. This slow vital capacity (SVC) may be used instead of the FVC to calculate the FEV<sub>1</sub>:VC ratio if either the SVC is higher than the FVC or the person cannot perform a forced manoeuvre to full exhalation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1755738013478939">Levy et al., 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1755738013478939">Figure 1</xref> demonstrates a normal spirometry tracing and one typical of a patient with COPD.

<p>The current NICE COPD guidelines state that a diagnosis of airflow obstruction can be made if the post-bronchodilator spirometry FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio is less than 0.7. However, if a patient has a ratio of less than 0.7 but his or her FEV<sub>1</sub> is greater than or equal to 80% predicted normal, a diagnosis of COPD should only be made if he or she also has respiratory symptoms, such as breathlessness or cough (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1755738013478939">Table 3</xref>). Of note, these cutoff values have not been validated in black and Asian populations and they may also be less accurate in older populations, in whom they tend to lead to underdiagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1755738013478939">NICE, 2010</xref>).

<p>Spirometry can be helpful is assessing the severity of COPD. This has been a source of confusion in the past as differing scales of severity were used in different guidelines. However, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1755738013478939">NICE 2010</xref> guidelines are now in line with the GOLD guidelines, as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1755738013478939">Table 3</xref>. It is important to note that spirometry alone cannot give an adequate assessment of severity of disease. Other factors that may be considered within a severity assessment are body mass index (BMI), degree of breathlessness, features of cor pulmonale, exercise capacity and peripheral oxygen saturation The BODE index (incorporating a measure of <bold>B</bold>MI, airflow <bold>O</bold>bstruction, <bold>D</bold>ysponea and <bold>E</bold>xercise capacity) is a useful multidimensional index of disease severity and prognosis.</p>
<p>Any healthcare worker within the practice who has undergone appropriate training and who keeps his or her skills up to date can perform spirometry. It is important to ensure the quality of spirometry performed by supporting spirometry services with quality control processes. A useful source describing best practice spirometry in primary care is ‘Diagnostic Spirometry in Primary Care’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1755738013478939">Levy et al., 2009</xref>). If there is doubt about the quality of spirometry service available within the practice, referral to a community or hospital spirometry service may be required.</p>
<p>The use of spirometry to screen the asymptomatic general population and/or smoking population for COPD remains controversial. There is no clear data to indicate that screening spirometry is effective in directing management decisions or improving COPD outcome in asymptomatic patients. Therefore, although GPs should be proactive in identifying COPD in their patients, screening spirometry is currently not recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1755738013478939">GOLD, 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1755738013478939"><title>Asthma versus COPD</title>
<p>Asthma can present similarly to COPD, and differentiating between the two diseases can be a challenge. COPD was traditionally differentiated from asthma by demonstration of lack of reversibility with bronchodilators or corticosteroids. However, this is no longer recommended as the best method for distinguishing between the two, as evidence suggests that the results of reversibility tests performed on different occasions can be inconsistent and not reproducible; a single reversibility test may be misleading unless an FEV<sub>1</sub> change is greater than 400 ml. There is also little evidence to suggest that an acute reversibility test can predict response to long term therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1755738013478939">NICE, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>COPD and asthma should instead, where possible, be differentiated by the history at initial presentation. A key difference is the age of onset, with COPD symptoms rarely seen in patients under the age of 35 years, yet asthma commonly presents in this age group. The pattern of dyspnoea is also different, with more persistent and progressive dyspnoea in COPD, whilst asthma is associated with diurnal and day-to-day variability. Smoking history is important; nearly all COPD patients are found to be past or current smokers, but the history is more variable in asthmatics.</p>
<p>On occasions where diagnostic doubt remains, despite a thorough clinical history, one or more of the following strategies may be used:
<list id="list4-1755738013478939" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Reversibility testing: spirometry is performed pre- and post-bronchodilation or trial of oral steroid (30 mg oral prednisolone daily for 2 weeks); a diagnosis of asthma is more likely when there is a large (greater than 400 ml FEV<sub>1</sub>) response to either</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Serial domiciliary peak flow diary: a 20% or greater diurnal or day-to-day variability suggests asthma</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Commencement of medical therapy with early follow up: if the FEV<sub>1</sub> and FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio return to normal and/or there is dramatic improvement of symptoms a diagnosis of asthma is more likely</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>It is worth noting that there may be a small group of patients who have a COPD/asthma overlap syndrome. These patients may have a best FEV<sub>1</sub> of less than 80% predicted value, but still demonstrate significant reversibility. There are also patients who have longstanding asthma who may progress to develop COPD, even if they do not smoke. If there is uncertainty in diagnosis then a specialist referral should be considered, either to a community respiratory team (with specialist nurses, physiotherapists, GPs with a specialist interest in respiratory medicine and consultant respiratory physicians) or to a specialist hospital-based respiratory service, depending on local provision.</p>

<sec id="sec12-1755738013478939"><title>Additional investigations</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1755738013478939">NICE guidance (2010)</xref> states that, as a minimum, in addition to spirometry all patients must have a chest X-ray and full blood count at the point of diagnosis. A chest X-ray is principally performed to exclude other pathology, but features such as hyperinflation, hyperlucency of the lungs and bullae are suggestive of COPD and can assist in diagnosis. In cases where there is complicated pulmonary hypertension there may be prominence of hilar vascular shadows and right ventricular enlargement.</p>
<p>The full blood count is performed to investigate for anaemia or polycythaemia, both of which are seen more frequently in these patients. Other tests that may need to be considered during the diagnostic workup are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1755738013478939">Table 4</xref>.

<p>COPD is widely underdiagnosed in the UK. GPs should consider COPD in any patient over 35 years presenting with dyspnoea, cough, wheeze, regular sputum production and winter illness. Diagnosis requires an in-depth history and examination supported by post-bronchodilator spirometry. Spirometry should be performed at the time of diagnosis and can also be used to reconsider the diagnosis if a patient shows an unexpected response to treatment. The symptoms of COPD are non-specific and therefore there is often a wide differential diagnosis to be considered. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1755738013478939">NICE 2010</xref> guideline offers further guidance on how to make an effective COPD diagnosis in a primary care setting.</p>
