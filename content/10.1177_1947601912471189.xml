<abstract>
<p>The guanine nucleotide exchange factor C3G (RAPGEF1) regulates proliferation, migration, and differentiation of cells and is essential for mammalian embryonic development. The molecular effectors of C3G dependent functions are poorly understood. Here we report that C3G functions as a negative regulator of β-catenin, a major player in pathways known to be deregulated in human cancers. In mammalian cells, C3G is present in a complex with cellular β-catenin. The proline rich Crk binding region of C3G and residues 90-525 of β-catenin are sufficient for the interaction. Knockdown of cellular C3G stimulated, and its overexpression repressed, β-catenin/TCF transcription activity. C3G acts by destabilizing β-catenin protein and inhibiting its nuclear accumulation. Nuclear extracts of C3G overexpressing cells showed reduced binding to TCF consensus oligos. C3G exerts its effects independent of its function as an exchange factor. It also inhibits stability and activity of an N-terminal deletion construct of β-catenin that is not subject to GSK3β dependent phosphorylation, suggesting that C3G exerts its effect independent of GSK3β. β-catenin repression by C3G was not significantly altered in the presence of proteasome inhibitors, MG132 or lactacystin, suggesting that alternate mechanisms are engaged by C3G to cause β-catenin turnover. C3G expression represses β-catenin target gene expression, and stable clones of MCF-7 breast cancer cells expressing C3G showed reduced migration. Activation of cellular β-catenin or expression of constitutively active β-catenin resulted in reduced C3G expression, indicating that C3G gene expression is negatively regulated by β-catenin. Our results identify a novel property of C3G in functioning as a negative regulator of β-catenin signaling by promoting its degradation. In addition, we show that β-catenin inhibits C3G expression, forming a feedback loop.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>By virtue of its function as a component of cell-cell junctions and as a modulator of transcription, β-catenin is involved in regulating a variety of cellular properties. The pool of cytosolic β-catenin that is a component of the degradation complex consisting of Axin, APC, and GSK3β is under rapid turnover, being controlled by phosphorylation and the ubiquitin proteasome system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1947601912471189">1</xref></sup> CK1 and GSK3β phosphorylation sites, as well as ubiquitin sites targeted by β-TrCP, are present in the N-terminal of β-catenin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1947601912471189">2</xref></sup> In response to Wnt/TGF-β signaling or inactivation of the kinase GSK3β, β-catenin is stabilized and activated by nuclear translocation to regulate transcription of downstream targets by complexing with TCF/LEF. N-terminal deletion of β-catenin makes it refractory to phosphorylation and shows constitutive activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1947601912471189">3</xref></sup> Major targets are genes that regulate embryonic development, cell proliferation, survival, and migration like cyclin D1, matrilysin, cMyc, Id2, transferrin receptor (TfR), Akt, Cox2, and Survivin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1947601912471189">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1947601912471189"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1947601912471189">6</xref></sup> Therefore, aberrant β-catenin activation is associated with tumorigenesis and metastasis. Mutations in β-catenin or components of its degradation complex result in aberrant overexpression of β-catenin seen in a large number of human solid tumors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1947601912471189">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Regulation of gene expression by β-catenin has primarily been associated with transcriptional activation, but a few studies have shown that β-catenin can also repress target genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1947601912471189">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1947601912471189">9</xref></sup> β-catenin signaling is evolutionarily conserved and regulates embryonic development. Knockout mice show early embryonic lethality with embryos not developing beyond 6.5 to 7.5 days post coitum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1947601912471189">10</xref></sup> Transgenic mice with constitutively active β-catenin and tissue specific activation of β-catenin show embryonic lethality, indicating that maintaining optimal levels of β-catenin is essential for proper cell fate determination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1947601912471189">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1947601912471189">12</xref></sup> In adult cells, β-catenin regulates morphology, proliferation, and differentiation. Proteins interacting with β-catenin can modulate its stability and function. Some molecules like 14-3-3ζ are activators, and others like ICAT, Dickkopf, Axin, and HIF-1α are inhibitors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1947601912471189">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1947601912471189"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1947601912471189">15</xref></sup> β-catenin function can be repressed by several mechanisms, such as decrease in protein stability, inhibition of its nuclear translocation, inhibition of binding to TCF, enabling engagement with repressive factors, and exosome mediated release.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1947601912471189">16</xref></sup> Alternate mechanisms of β-catenin degradation, independent of GSK3β phosphorylation, also have been described. The p53 target Siah-1, which binds ubiquitin conjugating enzymes, has been shown to cause β-catenin degradation independent of GSK3β phosphorylation and β-TrCP mediated proteolysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1947601912471189">17</xref></sup> Understanding β-catenin regulation by cellular proteins belonging to various signaling pathways would help in delineating its functions related to development, cell fate determination, and tumor growth.</p>
<p>The guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) C3G is ubiquitously expressed and relays a variety of extracellular signals to regulate functions like cytoskeletal remodeling, adhesion, migration, proliferation, apoptosis, and transformation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1947601912471189">18</xref></sup> C3G is a multidomain protein and has functions dependent on its catalytic domain and protein interaction domains. It has been shown to function as an exchange factor for Ras family GTPases, Rap1, Rap2, R-Ras, and the Rho family GTPase, TC10.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1947601912471189">18</xref></sup> Proline rich sequences present in its central domain are responsible for interaction with SH3 domain containing proteins like Crk, Grb2, p130Cas, Hck, and c-Abl.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1947601912471189">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1947601912471189"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1947601912471189"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1947601912471189"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1947601912471189">23</xref></sup> More recently, this domain has been shown to interact with actin and TC-PTP, molecules lacking SH3 domains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1947601912471189">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1947601912471189">25</xref></sup> Sequences in the N-terminus are involved in its interaction with E-cadherin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1947601912471189">26</xref></sup> a molecule involved in maintenance of cell junctions.

We show that C3G physically and functionally interacts with β-catenin and plays a repressive role in its activation by enhancing degradation, independent of GSK3β mediated phosphorylation. In addition, we show that β-catenin activation results in repression of C3G mRNA and protein levels, suggesting reciprocal regulation between C3G and β-catenin.</p>

<title>C3G complexes with and inhibits transcriptional activity of β-catenin</title>
<p>A large number of cellular proteins that regulate β-catenin activity form complexes with β-catenin. We therefore investigated whether C3G could interact with cellular β-catenin by examining its co-precipitation with C3G from cell lysates. GFP-tagged full-length C3G and a deletion variant having only its proline-rich central Crk binding region (CBR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1947601912471189">Fig. 1a</xref>) were expressed in HEK 293T cells and lysates used for immunoprecipitation, followed by Western blotting. Cellular β-catenin co-precipitated with both C3G and CBR, indicating that the central domain of C3G was sufficient for the interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1947601912471189">Fig. 1b</xref>). A higher amount of β-catenin complexed with full-length C3G, suggesting that other domains of C3G may also aid in complex formation. Deletion constructs of β-catenin lacking the N-terminal regulatory domain or C-terminal transactivation domain could also form a complex with CBR, indicating that interaction was not dependent on N-terminal or C-terminal domains of β-catenin (Suppl. Fig. S1, b and d). The interaction between C3G and β-catenin was examined in an <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assay using purified recombinant GST-CBR fusion protein and cell lysates expressing ΔN β-catenin or ΔC 525 β-catenin. Both deletion proteins interacted with GST-CBR but not with GST (Suppl. Fig. S1, c and e).</p>

<p>To test the functional relevance of the interaction of C3G with β-catenin, we examined the possibility of C3G affecting β-catenin transcriptional activity. Assays using β-catenin/TCF-responsive luciferase reporter constructs were used, which is a well-established readout for β-catenin activity. Cells were transfected with either control or C3G plasmid along with reporter constructs and cellular β-catenin activation induced by LiCl, an inhibitor of GSK3β.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1947601912471189">40</xref></sup> C3G expression caused a dose-dependent decrease in TCF reporter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1947601912471189">Fig. 1c</xref>). Knockdown of cellular C3G levels using small hairpin RNA (ShRNA) enhanced LiCl induced cellular β-catenin activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1947601912471189">Fig. 1d</xref>). These results indicated that cellular C3G negatively regulates β-catenin activity. Crk binding region of C3G, which was sufficient for interaction with β-catenin, also showed repression of LiCl induced TCF promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1947601912471189">Fig. 1e</xref>). An increase in endogenous β-catenin in response to LiCl treatment was confirmed by Western blotting. These results indicated that the effect of C3G on β-catenin activity was independent of its exchange factor activity.</p>

<title>C3G reduces protein levels of β-catenin and its target genes</title>
<p>The mechanism involved in C3G mediated reduction in β-catenin activity was investigated by examining the effect of C3G expression on β-catenin protein levels and turnover. Myc-β-catenin was co-expressed with pcDNA, C3G-GFP, or GFP-CBR and 20 ng of GFP, and protein expression was examined. C3G as well as CBR caused a reduction in levels of ectopically expressed β-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1947601912471189">Fig. 2a</xref>). No effect was seen on GFP or on cellular actin. C3G expression also caused a reduction in cellular TfR levels, a target of β-catenin that has a role in malignancy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1947601912471189">41</xref></sup> To rule out the possibility of variable β-catenin plasmid transfection, the effect of C3G overexpression on endogenous β-catenin was examined in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.

<p>Cellular β-catenin protein is under constant turnover due to proteasome-mediated degradation. We examined whether C3G altered β-catenin protein stability by analyzing β-catenin protein levels in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX), an inhibitor of protein synthesis. Exogenously expressed β-catenin showed enhanced degradation in C3G expressing HEK 293T cells compared with control plasmid expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1947601912471189">Fig. 2c</xref>). C3G levels were not significantly altered during the course of CHX treatment. C3G expression did not alter exogenously expressed GFP levels, indicating that the effect of C3G was specific to β-catenin. Half-life of overexpressed β-catenin calculated from multiple experiments in C3G expressing cells was 2.1 hours compared with 4.9 hours seen in control cells. Expression of CBR decreased the stability of cellular β-catenin in MDA-MB-231 cells, indicating that C3G mediated its effect on β-catenin turnover independent of its catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1947601912471189">Fig. 2d</xref>). These results also indicated that C3G exerts its effects on β-catenin through a post-translational mechanism.</p>

<title>C3G represses β-catenin independent of GSK3β</title>
<p>C3G caused a repression in β-catenin activity induced by LiCl, suggesting that C3G induced effects on β-catenin were not mediated through altering GSK3β activity. LiCl treatment resulted in an increase in cellular β-catenin levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1947601912471189">Fig. 3b</xref>). Expression of C3G in HEK 293T cells reduced LiCl induced β-catenin protein to an extent similar to that seen in untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1947601912471189">Fig. 3b</xref>). When examined by indirect immunofluorescence, C3G expressing cells showed reduction in LiCl induced β-catenin staining in HEK 293T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1947601912471189">Fig. 3c</xref>) as well as MCF-7 breast cancer cells (Suppl. Fig. S2c). C3G induced reduction in endogenous β-catenin was seen in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. The effect of C3G on an N-terminal deletion mutant of β-catenin (ΔN β-catenin) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1947601912471189">Fig. 3a</xref>) that is refractory to GSK3β mediated regulation was examined. C3G repressed TCF promoter activity induced by β-catenin as well as ΔN β-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1947601912471189">Fig. 3e</xref>). A decrease in ΔN β-catenin protein observed upon coexpression of CBR in HEK 293T cells suggested that N-terminal regulatory domain of β-catenin is not necessary for C3G mediated destabilization of β-catenin protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1947601912471189">Fig. 3d</xref>). As expected, LiCl treatment had no effect on ΔN β-catenin levels, and CBR expression resulted in reduced ΔN β-catenin levels even in the presence of LiCl. These results indicated that C3G exerts its effects on β-catenin downstream of GSK3β.</p>

Transfection efficiency under our experimental conditions is about 50% in HEK 293T and 20% in MDA-MB-231 cells.

<title>β-catenin activation causes reduction in cellular C3G levels</title>
<p>Since C3G showed properties of negatively regulating β-catenin function, we examined the consequence of activating β-catenin signaling on cellular C3G levels. β-catenin signaling can be initiated either by GSK3β inhibition or by expressing constitutively active β-catenin mutants. LiCl treatment resulted in an increase in cellular β-catenin levels and a decrease in C3G levels in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1947601912471189">Fig. 7a</xref>). Reduction in C3G levels was also observed upon treatment of MCF-7 cells with another GSK3β inhibitor, BIO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1947601912471189">Fig. 7b</xref>). C3G levels in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments showed a decrease upon LiCl treatment in MDA-MB-231 cells (Suppl. Fig. S4). The decrease in C3G level was not due to proteasome dependent degradation, as treatment with MG132 did not reverse the effects of LiCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1947601912471189">Fig. 7c</xref>). We therefore tested whether LiCl effects on C3G were mediated at the transcription level. C3G gene expression was examined by semiquantitative RT-PCR in cells treated with or without LiCl. C3G transcript levels showed a decrease upon LiCl treatment in MCF7, MDA-MB-231, and HEK 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1947601912471189">Fig. 7d</xref>), indicating that cellular C3G levels are repressed at the transcriptional level upon stimulation of β-catenin signaling. To confirm that the effect on C3G transcription was mediated through activation of β-catenin, we examined cellular C3G levels upon expression of a constitutively active variant of β-catenin, ΔN β-catenin. HEK 293T cells expressing ΔN β-catenin showed a significant reduction in C3G protein levels, indicating that β-catenin negatively regulates C3G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1947601912471189">Fig. 7e</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Disruption of β-catenin signaling is a primary strategy for prevention of carcinomas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1947601912471189">45</xref></sup> Therefore, understanding how cellular β-catenin stability and function are regulated has been of key importance. Using ectopic expression and knockdown strategies, we reveal a role for the guanine nucleotide exchange factor C3G as a negative regulator of β-catenin. There were 6 principle findings indicating physical and functional interaction between C3G and β-catenin: (1) C3G and β-catenin co-precipitate from cell lysates; (2) C3G overexpression represses and its knockdown enhances β-catenin/TCF transcription activity; (3) C3G induced inhibition of β-catenin activity correlates with reduction in β-catenin/TCF target gene expression; (4) C3G expression decreases stability of overexpressed as well as endogenous β-catenin; (5) C3G expression decreases nuclear levels of β-catenin; and (6) nuclear extracts from C3G transfected cells show weaker interaction with TCF target sequences compared with untransfected extracts. As increase in cell migration is an important property of β-catenin, effects of C3G on β-catenin are reflected in the reduced motility of stable clones of MCF-7 cells expressing C3G.</p>
<p>Using immunoprecipitation assays, we show that cellular β-catenin forms a complex with C3G and that the central proline rich Crk binding region of C3G is sufficient for the interaction. The N-terminal regulatory sequences or C-terminal transactivation domain of β-catenin and the catalytic domain of C3G are not essential for the interaction. It therefore appears that the CBR domain of C3G can mediate interactions with molecules lacking an SH3 domain. The exact residues of β-catenin involved in the interaction are yet to be deciphered, but we could conclude that residues between 90 and 525 (which encompass ARM repeats 1 to 10) are sufficient. As a consequence of the interaction, C3G functionally regulates β-catenin dependent transcription independent of its catalytic activity as a GEF. ShRNA mediated knockdown of C3G resulted in enhanced LiCl induced promoter activity, suggesting that endogenous C3G, which shows predominant cytoplasmic localization similar to that of overexpressed protein, also functions to repress transcription activity of β-catenin.</p>
<p>Expression of C3G reduced cellular as well as overexpressed β-catenin protein without any effect on transcript levels, indicating that regulation was mediated at a post-translational level and not by affecting β-catenin transcription. C3G accelerates β-catenin protein degradation as seen by decreased half-life of exogenously expressed as well as endogenous β-catenin in C3G expressing cells. In accordance with its ability to interact with and affect β-catenin transcription activity, the CBR domain was sufficient for decreasing β-catenin stability. A role for C3G in limiting proliferation of neural precursor cells in response to FGF2 has been described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1947601912471189">36</xref></sup> Reduced C3G levels resulted in inhibition of GSK3β, leading to enhanced β-catenin levels. These events were shown to be dependent on Rap1 activation. It therefore appears that C3G can regulate β-catenin activity by engaging mechanisms dependent on its catalytic function as well as independent of its catalytic activity.</p>
<p>C3G mediated its effect on β-catenin independent of GSK3β activity, as it was observed that C3G or CBR could repress β-catenin protein as well as activity under conditions of treatment with an inhibitor of GSK3β. This was also evident from the fact that N-terminus of β-catenin, which enables its regulation by GSK3β and the proteasome, was dispensable for the inhibitory effect of C3G on β-catenin expression. Similar regulation has been shown with respect to other inhibitor molecules like En-1, Psoriasin, and Nur77.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1947601912471189">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1947601912471189"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1947601912471189">48</xref></sup> Modification by ubiquitination of lysines in the N-terminus of β-catenin has been the major mechanism involved in degradation of cellular β-catenin through the proteasome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1947601912471189">49</xref></sup> Coexpression of C3G enhanced β-catenin ubiquitination, but it was seen that C3G could cause β-catenin degradation even under conditions of proteasome inhibition. C3G could decrease levels of ΔN β-catenin, which lacks phosphorylation and ubiquitin sites for β-TrCP mediated degradation. This degradation was not rescued by proteasomal or lysosomal inhibitors, indicating that alternate mechanisms may be engaged by C3G. Although the proteases involved have not been defined, ubiquitinated targets degraded by proteasome independent pathways are known.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1947601912471189">50</xref></sup> As C3G primarily affected nuclear levels of β-catenin, it is possible that C3G enhances its nuclear export, or presently unknown mechanisms of protein degradation may be engaged by C3G in the nucleus. A decrease in nuclear but not cytoplasmic β-catenin levels upon curcumin treatment has been shown.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1947601912471189">51</xref></sup> Further work is required to understand the mechanism involved in reduction of cellular β-catenin levels by C3G.</p>
<p>Many proteins in signaling pathways are often subject to feedback regulation to either enhance or repress downstream effector functions. In our experiments, we observed reduction in cellular C3G levels under conditions of β-catenin activation and in cells that possess constitutively high β-catenin activity. Although the C3G protein has been studied extensively, its regulation at the transcriptional level is poorly understood. Our results suggest that C3G transcription is negatively regulated by β-catenin. β-catenin mediated signaling primarily involves activation of genes involved in cell proliferation and migration, but genes that inhibit these processes like IGFBP-6, E-cadherin, and 15PGDH are repressed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1947601912471189">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1947601912471189">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1947601912471189">52</xref></sup> Several studies have shown that in mammalian cells, C3G primarily functions to inhibit cell proliferation and migration. An important role for C3G in differentiation of various cell types has also been shown.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1947601912471189">18</xref></sup> Activation of β-catenin signaling to achieve cell proliferation can therefore keep C3G levels repressed, thereby preventing differentiation.</p>
<p>C3G can exert its effects as a negative regulator of cell proliferation through MAPK as well as β-catenin signaling. It can therefore be hypothesized that loss or downregulation of C3G seen in certain human cancers may be associated with deregulated β-catenin function. Although more work is needed to elucidate the mechanism involved in C3G mediated β-catenin degradation, our results suggest that C3G’s role in embryonic development, migration, and differentiation may be mediated through β-catenin.</p>
<p>The present study therefore provides evidence for a novel mechanism by which C3G can exert its effects as an inhibitor of cell proliferation, migration, and oncogene induced transformation independent of its catalytic activity. C3G as well as β-catenin is essential for embryonic development. Reciprocal regulation between them may aid in suppression of unscheduled proliferation of cells required for tissue differentiation during development. The repression of cellular C3G levels upon GSK3β inhibition not only will enable efficient accumulation of functional β-catenin but also may lower the threshold of signals required for activating the pathway, thereby aiding in sustained and amplified signaling.</p>

For wound healing assay, confluent monolayer of cells was scratched with a micropipette tip, and images of the wound were taken at an interval of 12 hours using the 10× objective of a Carl Zeiss Axiovert Live microscope. The average wound area at various time points was determined from 2 independent experiments conducted with at least 3 wounded areas.</p>

<title>Luciferase reporter assays</title>
<p>For luciferase reporter assay, HEK 293T cells were transfected with 50 ng of pCMV-SPORT-β-galactosidase, 150 ng of reporter construct (PGL3-OT or PGL3-OF), and other expression constructs. Reporter assay was performed using (Promega, Fitchburg, Wisconsin, USA) luciferase assay kit following the manufacturer’s instructions. Luciferase reporter activity is shown as mean ± SD of results from at least 3 experiments after normalization for corresponding β-galactosidase activity.</p>
