<p>The provision of flexible, high-quality, advanced education for healthcare professionals is an increasingly important consideration as widespread concern mounts about the extent of the problem of pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2049463712448582">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2049463712448582"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2049463712448582">3</xref></sup> The Declaration of Montreal in 2011, which stated that access to pain management is a fundamental human right, is a testament to this concern.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2049463712448582">4</xref></sup> Added to this is a recent survey that highlighted working healthcare professionals are lacking essential pain education, knowledge and skills.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2049463712448582">5</xref></sup> Helping to address this educational need is the growing number of fully online Master’s programmes in pain management.</p>
<p>In traditional university settings, however, where the focus is primarily on the delivery of on-campus education, there are a number of pedagogical distances to negotiate in the provision of high-quality graduate online distance education.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2049463712448582">6</xref></sup> Some are focused on the student population itself and the desire for engaging yet challenging learning experiences. Others are more closely associated with pragmatic concerns such as programme management and delivery, course costs and faculty involvement. This paper reports on how such pedagogical distances are being managed across two traditional universities (the University of Sydney, Australia, and the University of Edinburgh, UK), which have been working in partnership since 2005 to deliver an online Master’s programme in pain management. Using this experience as a case study, this paper reviews how structured e-learning activities can be designed to provide students with a rich, engaging and connected online experience.</p>
<p>To set the scene, the paper briefly reviews the growth of e-learning and the establishment of the partnership between the Universities of Sydney and Edinburgh. Then, drawing on the literature, the processes involved in developing e-learning capacity and self-regulated learning skills, while fostering student interaction and building understanding of course content, are explored, and some key conceptual frameworks for fostering student engagement online are introduced. Drawing on this discussion, four structured online discussion tasks are outlined and the affordances of these activities in alleviating pedagogical distances are discussed: how they enable student engagement and connectivity, develop specific knowledge and generic skills, build appreciation of alternative professional perspectives, aid student retention and accommodate needs of busy professionals. The implications for curriculum design, the importance of encouraging self-regulated learning and the provision of adequate student engagement online provide the concluding comments.</p>

<title>The growth of e-learning</title>
<p>Within education, particularly at a tertiary level, there has been a rapid increase in the number of students that are completing all or part of their education by ‘online distance learning’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2049463712448582">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2049463712448582">8</xref></sup> The reasons for this growth are varied and complicated but contain elements of organisational structure and change, revenue generation, internationalisation and the increased and rapid access to knowledge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2049463712448582">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2049463712448582"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2049463712448582">10</xref></sup> At the University of Edinburgh, as an example, there has been an increase of approximately 800% wholly online distance learning taught postgraduate programmes in less than 10 years. The University of Sydney has also experienced similar growth in its provision of online distance education at a graduate level. With the increase in the provision of online distance learning comes the navigation of new methods of teaching and learning as well as opportunities for increased international collaboration. Some of the key challenges encompass how to introduce and support students in the online learning environment, engage students in the learning process and encourage them to take responsibility for their learning.</p>

<sec id="section2-2049463712448582">
<title>Establishing the programme and the partnership with the University of Edinburgh</title>
<p>The Master’s in pain management programme was established at the University of Sydney in 1996, originally as a campus-based programme for a multidisciplinary target audience. Within a few years of its initial launch, student demand for the programme, nationally and internationally, prompted its redevelopment into an online format: making it one of the first programmes of its kind to be offered worldwide. This shift in the delivery mode has become an increasingly common approach to enable busy professionals access to advanced education, somewhat time and place independent.</p>
<p>Currently, the course is structured as a two-year Master’s programme, with entry and exit options at postgraduate certificate and diploma levels. All students are required to complete the four core units that comprise the postgraduate certificate. These units provide the foundational core, covering the fundamental knowledge and skills required by any health professional working in, or with an interest in, pain management (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2049463712448582">Table 1</xref>). The International Association for the Study of Pain core curriculum,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2049463712448582">11</xref></sup> as in other pain management Master’s programmes, underpins the course design. Students studying beyond the postgraduate certificate level undertake electives, providing them with opportunities to deepen understanding in specific areas and tailor their learning to meet specific professional needs and interests.</p>

<p>In 2005 a partnership was forged with the University of Edinburgh, via a licence agreement, allowing access to the course materials developed by the University of Sydney. Since this time, the University of Edinburgh has been delivering the Master’s programme within a defined geographical area (UK and European region) using its own infrastructure, administration and faculty. Effectively, this partnership has helped to improve the programme’s market reach and affordability. With the involvement of the University of Edinburgh, there is a closer connection to the student market in this region, at a much more affordable rate. Although beyond the scope of the current paper, the potential for institutional collaboration across both programmes offers many exciting possibilities for greater student interaction and engagement internationally. However, pragmatic issues (such as differences in semester timeframes), and university boundaries (such as enrolment requirements and copyright provisions) must be overcome if these possibilities are to be fully realised.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2049463712448582">12</xref></sup></p>

<title>Student engagement and self-regulation</title>
<p>Key to successful use of any learning activity is the concept of student engagement and self-regulation. Early work on engagement and interactive online environments by Stoney and Oliver<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2049463712448582">13</xref></sup> highlights that well-designed programmes led to increased learner engagement, as was exemplified by greater levels of higher-order thinking such as planning and strategy and predicting and imposing meaning. More recent work by Richardson and Newby<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2049463712448582">14</xref></sup> also suggests that as students gain experience with online learning, they begin to take increased responsibility for their own learning, again having implications for the design, structure and facilitation of online courses.</p>
<p>Research studies have shown that learner engagement is a key factor in both learning success<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2049463712448582">15</xref></sup> and student retention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2049463712448582">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2049463712448582"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2049463712448582">18</xref></sup> A number of definitions of engagement have been proposed, ranging from that by Krause and Coates,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2049463712448582">19</xref></sup> who identify that student engagement is related to the participation in sound educational strategies that lead to measureable outcomes, through to the Higher Education Funding Council for England’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2049463712448582">20</xref></sup> observation that ‘engagement and the shaping of the learning experience is supported by institutions making deliberate attempts to involve and empower students’.</p>
<p>In this paper we explore student engagement in a broad sense, encompassing both the academic and non-academic components of the student experience. We view engagement as ‘the mobilization of cognitive, affective and motivational strategies for interpretive transactions’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2049463712448582">21</xref></sup> that occur through interaction with others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2049463712448582">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Closely linked to this is the concept of self-regulation, which refers to a student who is regulating his or her own learning. Although there is variation in the specific theories of self-regulated learning, all focus on the central concept that cognitive, contextual and motivational factors influence the learning process and that self-regulated learners are able to set task-related goals, take responsibility for their own learning and maintain motivation through the use of various strategies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2049463712448582">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2049463712448582"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2049463712448582">24</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section4-2049463712448582">
<title>Conceptual frameworks for designing effective e-learning</title>
<p>There are a number of conceptual frameworks that have been developed to guide thinking about, and planning for, the provision of an effective and engaging student learning experience. From an e-learning perspective, three specific frameworks are often put forward as useful models: the five-stage model;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2049463712448582">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2049463712448582">26</xref></sup> the community of inquiry model;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2049463712448582">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2049463712448582">28</xref></sup> and Bloom’s digital taxonomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2049463712448582">29</xref></sup> Collectively, these models provide conceptual tools for progressively guiding the design of learning, from the introduction of students to the online environment through to the role of the teacher in this process and how this facilitates the development of students’ technical competence and content expertise.</p>
<p>The community of inquiry model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2049463712448582">27</xref></sup> provides a useful overarching framework. It suggests that deep and meaningful learning occurs within the online learning community through the interaction of three separate, yet interconnected, core elements:</p>
<list id="list1-2049463712448582" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>cognitive presence;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>social presence; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>teaching presence.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Here, each of the elements needs to be progressively developed and revisited as a course of study evolves. That is, social presence is concerned with how to promote effective and open communication as well as group cohesion; cognitive presence is concerned with how to develop knowledge collaboratively and reflectively; and teaching presence is concerned with the role the teacher plays in facilitating these processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2049463712448582">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Similarly, Bloom’s digital taxonomy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2049463712448582">29</xref></sup> also provides a useful, and somewhat more pragmatic, framework. This taxonomy, which builds on Bloom’s seminal work of the 1950s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2049463712448582">30</xref></sup> and Bloom’s revised taxonomy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2049463712448582">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2049463712448582">32</xref></sup> maps the various forms of online activities and communication tools that can be used to develop student understanding and skills, alongside the learning outcomes across lower- and higher-order thinking skills.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2049463712448582">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>Both Garisson et al.’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2049463712448582">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2049463712448582">28</xref></sup> and Churches’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2049463712448582">29</xref></sup> frameworks are useful for designing effective e-learning. Notwithstanding the merit of these two models, for the purpose of this paper, we have elected to use Salmon’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2049463712448582">26</xref></sup> five-stage model primarily because it offers an extremely workable approach and focus for scaffolding online discussion activities. Importantly, it provides a framework for the development of content knowledge, while building technical competence as the level of interaction and task engagement increases. The stages of Salmon’s model are:</p>
<list id="list2-2049463712448582" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>access and motivation;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>online socialisation;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>information exchange;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>knowledge construction; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>development.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Each stage of this model requires that participants master certain technical skills before proceeding to the next level of competence. With its dual emphasis on learning about and with technology, it provides a practical approach for developing online discussion activities while acknowledging the technical support and e-moderation requirements.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-2049463712448582">
<title>Engaging students via asynchronous discussion activities</title>
<p>With these theoretical frameworks in mind, in this section we outline four structured e-learning discussion activities. These activities are used as examples to illustrate the processes involved in the promotion of online socialisation, open communication and group cohesion, and the development of an understanding of, and skills in, multidisciplinary pain management practice. They also demonstrate how students are introduced to the online environment and then challenged to progressively take more responsibility for the learning process.</p>
<p>The use of discussion as a teaching strategy for facilitating learning has a longstanding history in university education.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2049463712448582">33</xref></sup> Not surprisingly, given the continuing advances in information and communication technologies, the use of online discussion forums have now become common practice for facilitating interactions that support the shared construction of knowledge among participants of a learning community.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2049463712448582">17</xref></sup> Two distinct modes of text-based communication – synchronous (real time) and asynchronous (delayed time) – have emerged within e-learning environments. Results of investigations have shown little evidence for the superiority of one mode over another;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2049463712448582">34</xref></sup> rather, they are used to facilitate different objectives and types of learning. In an online postgraduate pain education context – with a multidisciplinary audience who are generally studying part time and juggling multiple, time-consuming demands – the use of asynchronous discussion forums is a particularly useful strategy for engaging students in the learning process. The asynchronicity provides opportunities for student participation at a time and place of their choosing. It also enables opportunities for more considered thought and reflection (something that is not always possible in a classroom environment, particularly for quieter students), and the active process of shared knowledge production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2049463712448582">35</xref></sup> Asynchronicity is also a key benefit when engaging in discussion across international time zones, where synchronicity would be realistically unmanageable by students.</p>
<p>Using Salmon’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2049463712448582">26</xref></sup> five-stage model we now highlight how the four asynchronous online discussion activities outlined in this paper provide students with technical and motivational support, in addition to a structured and developmental approach to learning about pain.</p>
<p>First, it is important to identify that these discussion activities form an assessable component (20% of the total mark) that students must complete in order to pass a unit of study. While this clearly influences student motivation to participate, in our experience the majority of students are highly motivated to learn and keen to develop their understanding about pain management: some are already working in this specialty area, while others are interested in gaining employment in the field. Student engagement in each task is monitored and encouraged by the facilitator, and students are assessed according to the quality, quantity and relevance of their participation.</p>
<p>Another point of note is that each of these activities, which are constructively aligned with the content and objectives of the unit of study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2049463712448582">36</xref></sup> is structured over a 4- to 6-week timeframe, with the provision of student supports in the form of either online readings or activity instructions and guidelines. Typically, students complete each of the discussions progressively, moving through the four activities over a two-term timeframe. As the student completes each activity, the demands and complexity of the task increase in an attempt to encourage self-regulated learning. Importantly, the assessment of each task reflects this approach and students are progressively assessed on the development of content expertise and capacity to communicate and interact in an online format. Students are provided with specific assessment criteria for each online discussion and its associated tasks.</p>
<p>In the first term, the initial asynchronous discussion activity (in the Introduction to Pain Management unit) is divided into two tasks: in task 1, students consider various definitions of pain and discuss how these definitions fit within their own professional frames of reference; in task 2, students review and reflect on the current debate on pain management and human rights. This focus reflects the introductory content of the unit and provides students with a relatively non-threatening activity that principally draws on their personal professional experience. In the next unit (Pain Mechanisms and Contributors), students complete a case study activity with a focus on the mechanisms and contributors of pain. As with the previous unit, this activity is directly aligned with the content and structure of the unit, providing a relatively non-threatening and authentic discussion task. A key point for facilitators of these asynchronous discussions is that learners, particularly in the early stages of their course of study, may lack the learning strategies to participate in such discussions and, as such, both of these activities are closely moderated, with a skilled online facilitator who ensures that students are actively participating, remaining on task and extending the discussion. This focus on the importance of skilled online facilitation, with the provision of guidance and feedback, was highlighted some years ago by Harasim et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2049463712448582">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the second term the first discussion (in the unit Principles of Pain Treatment and Management) is an online debate activity in which students consider the statement ‘Pain is merely a symptom, not a disease’. Allocated into one of two teams of between 6 and 12 participants (depending on student numbers), students collaborate in small groups to develop a position paper and a rebuttal either for or against this statement. At the end of the activity students are asked to submit a self-assessment in the form of a written reflection about the debate topic and their role in the process of group collaboration. Students often report (anecdotally and via the written reflection) that this is a challenging task.</p>
<p>The debate is followed by another group activity in the next unit of study (Pain Conditions). Using a role-play approach, this activity is designed as a round table discussion in which a multidisciplinary team is meeting to discuss a patient case. Once again, students are allocated into small groups (usually four participants per group) and are asked to assume a specific role (often outside their own professional background). From this alternative role position, students review the case and then present their position about the treatment and management requirements, and participate in a multidisciplinary team meeting to determine the appropriate course of action. At the end of the activity, students are asked to provide a written reflection that reviews the multidisciplinary team process and reconsiders the treatment and management of this pain condition from the perspective of a paediatric rather than an adult patient.</p>
<p>Although these discussion activities provide the main focus for the online interaction for each unit of study, the facilitator’s role extends beyond the provision of support and guidance in these tasks. They also play an important role in troubleshooting technical issues, particularly in the initial stages, and responding to questions about course content. Importantly, as students gain confidence in the e-learning environment and build their skills in online communication, the focus of the interaction is predominately student to student. Effectively, the facilitator’s role progressively shifts from being ‘a sage on the stage’ and/or ‘a guide on the side’ to becoming ‘a ghost in the wings’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2049463712448582">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2049463712448582">39</xref></sup></p>

<title>Is good course design all that is needed?</title>
<p>In terms of designing and structuring a course curriculum, one cannot design activities without taking into consideration both the design of the specific online activities that structure learning and the online learning management ‘tool’ itself (e.g. Blackboard (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.blackboard.com">www.blackboard.com</ext-link>); Moodle (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://moodle.org/">http://moodle.org/</ext-link>)). The question of whether the online learning management tool itself can address pedagogy is ongoing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2049463712448582">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2049463712448582"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2049463712448582">42</xref></sup> and is outside the scope of the current paper; however, there are areas that are eligible for closer consideration by those designing and teaching online courses. Appropriate technical and student support and access to programme administrators all are important considerations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-2049463712448582">43</xref></sup> Motivational factors, sharing of professional perspectives, appropriate levels of feedback and facilitator presence,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-2049463712448582">44</xref></sup> and the use of a clear theoretical framework can aid course design and encourage student engagement. Further, acknowledging the student cohort as busy professionals who are often time poor, asynchronous discussion activities provide a sound pedagogical approach for the development of advanced knowledge in pain management while fostering a learning community that encourages interaction and collaboration.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As has been demonstrated, clear conceptual frameworks (such as Salmon’s five-stage model from 2004), can provide useful tools for scaffolding learning in key areas of pain management education. They enable students access to a staged approach to their learning in which the acquisition of knowledge about the subject area is matched not only to the development of the students’ technical skills, but also to the level of facilitator participation and input. With a skilled facilitator providing the support and encouragement that is needed, and the informed selection of suitable online learning management tools, students have the necessary supports they need to begin to engage in the process of learning. Add to this a clearly developed and logical curriculum that has been thoughtfully structured in line with a learning framework suitable for a digital environment, and the circumstances for student engagement are greatly enhanced. So, too, is the opportunity for developing self-regulated learners who are motivated to actively gain a deeper understanding about multidisciplinary pain management practice.</p>
