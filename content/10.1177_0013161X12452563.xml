<p><bold>Purpose:</bold> This article focuses on a specific model of teacher leadership in schools—the studio classroom. In answering the call for more targeted studies of teacher leadership, the study is designed to assist educational leaders in putting in place the organizational and social structures that allow teacher leaders to have the most positive impact on teachers. Research questions focused on perceptions, enactment, and impact of the studio classroom. <bold>Research Methods:</bold> The research took place over a 2-year period (2008-2010), with six teacher leader-participants from four school districts. Data collection included individual and group interviews and extensive on site observation, as well as administrator interviews. Analytic procedures were qualitative, grounded in the teacher leadership literature and a sociocultural teacher learning framework. <bold>Findings and Implications:</bold> Across sites, a diminished understanding and appreciation for the teacher learning process left no sanctioned space to learn from mistakes. Thus, logistical, social, and cultural barriers overwhelmed any studio classroom implementation attempts—and teacher leaders ultimately failed to open up their classroom doors as intended. Practical implications include a need to reexamine the term <italic>modeling</italic> as exhibiting qualities that encourage reflection on teaching rather than replication of teaching. Similarly, to stimulate learning from actual classroom practice, a new vision of teacher leadership needs to focus on improving rather than proving. Additionally, research on teaching will need to more strongly make the case that authentic teacher inquiry more strongly correlates with teacher and student learning than the importation and transmitting of “best practices.”</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the past 20 years, the focal point of educational reform efforts and teacher professional development has shifted from the conceptual to the practical. As decontextualized workshops and sessions were shown to be largely ineffective in changing teacher beliefs and practices (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013161X12452563">Lee, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013161X12452563">Richardson &amp; Placier, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013161X12452563">Wilson &amp; Berne, 1999</xref>), there has been a movement toward embedding teacher learning in the actual work of teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013161X12452563">City, Elmore, Fiarman, &amp; Teitel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013161X12452563">Morris &amp; Hiebert, 2011</xref>). Under this new conception, professional development is face-to-face, embedded in classroom contexts, and targeted—focusing on the “core of teaching” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013161X12452563">Morris &amp; Hiebert, 2011</xref>) as is experienced in realistic educational settings.</p>
<p>To further this more classroom-centered professional development, teacher leaders have been increasingly used as coaches, staff developers, and instructional leaders. Research has documented a proliferation of both formal and informal “distributed leadership” in schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0013161X12452563">Mayrowetz, Murphy, Louis, &amp; Smylie, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0013161X12452563">Spillane, Camburn, &amp; Pareja, 2007</xref>) in concert with increasing academic demands on students. Yet at the same time, confusion around these emergent roles abound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013161X12452563">Goldstein, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013161X12452563">Margolis &amp; Huggins, in press</xref>), as teacher leader positions are often created in advance of organizational capacity to use them wisely. Thus, although there has been some success in making teacher leader-facilitated professional development more connected to <italic>successful practice</italic>, models are less developed in terms of how to make their work <italic>practically successful</italic>. Relatedly, teacher leaders have long faced ongoing dilemmas related to poorly integrated professional cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013161X12452563">Kardos, Johnson, Heather, Kaufmann, &amp; Liu, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013161X12452563">Lortie, 1975</xref>), latent perceptions that teaming and collaborative work do not improve teaching and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013161X12452563">Conley, Fauske, &amp; Pounder, 2004</xref>), and larger school cultures that emphasize individual teacher “performance” over communal responsibility for student learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013161X12452563">Louis, Marks, &amp; Kruse, 1996</xref>).</p>

<title>Rationale for Study</title>
<p>For 5 years, we have looked at the dilemmas and prospects of teacher leadership through the lens of “hybrid teacher leaders” (HTLs). An HTL is <italic>a teacher whose responsibilities include both teaching K-12 students and leading teachers in some capacity</italic>. These hybrid positions were chosen as the unit of analysis because they typify proliferating efforts to bridge and balance teaching and leadership responsibilities so that larger reform policies can be more closely linked to classroom practice. One study looks specifically at teacher leader-teacher dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013161X12452563">Margolis, 2012</xref>) and how varied social and professional interactions increase or hinder HTL capacity to positively affect the professional development environment. A second study (Margolis &amp; Huggins, in press) more deeply examines HTL integration at the district level, including how specific organizational patterns and administrative actions/inaction affect teacher leader effectiveness. This article, while drawing from research related to professional interactions and administrative actions, explores one model of classroom-centered teacher professional development: the studio classroom. By focusing our research on a specific role (HTLs) and structure (the studio classroom), we intend to answer the call for more targeted studies of teacher leadership (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013161X12452563">Coburn &amp; Russell, 2008</xref>). The inquiry is designed to assist school and district leaders in putting in place the organizational and social structures that allow teacher leaders to have the most positive impact on teacher professional development.</p>
<p>Although “studio” or “lab” classrooms have been mythologized in schools as centers for student and teacher learning, research shows that they rarely materialize as planned (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013161X12452563">Reeves, 2009</xref>). In the four districts we studied, both teacher leaders and their administrators spoke to plans for teaching and leading that would directly connect through “modeling” with students present—in their own and others’ classrooms. Most of the participants, at some point, directly used the phrase “studio classroom” to describe how teaching and leading would work in synergy to support district and state goals for improving instruction and student achievement. With this backdrop, the following research questions were explored:</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>In the following sections, we explore terminology and current literature in relation to the studio classroom. First, we define Level 1 and Level 2 modeling and differentiate between the concepts of lesson study and the studio classroom. Next, we explore the benefits of the studio classroom model, and finally, we look at common obstacles that often prevent the implementation of the studio classroom.</p>
<sec id="section4-0013161X12452563">
<title>Definition of Terms</title>
<p>This article defines the studio classroom in relation to an emergent framework that examines different levels of teacher leader modeling in schools (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013161X12452563">Margolis, 2012</xref>). <italic>Level 1 modeling</italic> involves direct observation of teacher leader teaching-practice with students present. These students may be that of the teacher leader or of a colleague. When Level 1 modeling occurs on a regular basis in a teacher leader’s own classroom, that arena can be considered a “studio” or “lab” classroom. <italic>Level 2 modeling</italic> includes instances where teacher leaders share openly <italic>about</italic> their teaching. Specific examples might include the informal or formal sharing—in person or online—of student work, strategies, and lesson plans, as well as struggles and triumphs. Students are not present during Level 2 modeling.</p>

<sec id="section5-0013161X12452563">
<title>Lesson Study Versus Studio Classroom</title>
<p>Over the past 15 years, educational researchers and practitioners in the United States have become increasingly familiar with the Japanese lesson study model, which has spread rapidly in some American schools and districts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013161X12452563">Lewis, Perry, &amp; Murata, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013161X12452563">Lewis &amp; Tsuchida, 1998</xref>). The iterative process involves cycles “in which teachers collaborate to develop a lesson plan, teach and observe the lesson to collect data on student learning, and use their observations to refine their lesson” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0013161X12452563">Stepanek, Appel, Leong, Mangan, &amp; Mitchell, 2007</xref>, p. 2). Some have argued that lesson study can provide exactly the type of “existence proofs” that teachers need by maintaining a focus on learning about teaching more generally as well as how to improve the specific lesson being studied (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0013161X12452563">Perry, Hurd, &amp; Connell, 2006</xref>). At the same time, much of the lesson study research comes from a few individuals who have long been lesson study advocates; thus, the actual success of lesson study implementation and its extent of impact in schools remains much less clear.</p>
<p>Although lesson study and the studio classroom share similarities in embedding teacher learning in the classroom with students present, there are several notable differences. <italic>Lesson study is episodic</italic>, requiring coordinated plans for a specified amount of time (e.g., 2-4 weeks) during which the inquiry cycle usually completes. <italic>The studio classroom is a structural change</italic>, where a classroom is transformed from a space for teaching students to a place where teachers can learn about teaching students on a regular basis. Additionally, in lesson study, larger reform efforts are a backdrop to the lesson of focus, whereas the studio classroom highlights the reform, and individual lessons serve as snapshots and conversation-points for that reform-in-action.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0013161X12452563">
<title>The Benefits of the Studio Classroom</title>
<p>The educational research literature contains very few studies in which the studio classroom is explicitly explored. Indirectly, however, some research speaks to the potential benefits. For example, a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013161X12452563">Reeves (2009)</xref> of more than 300 teachers and administrators found that—of all the possible ways for teacher leaders to influence practice—“direct modeling by colleagues was the most powerful by far” (p. 85). Similarly, a recent study of reciprocal peer coaching by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0013161X12452563">Zwart, Wubbles, Bergen, and Bolhius (2009)</xref> confirms the power of direct modeling in encouraging experimentation with alternative teaching strategies—not only for the observer but the teacher being observed. Their research on professional development in The Netherlands found that “knowing that a colleague will come to observe you in your classroom . . . was reported to prompt the search for alternative teaching methods for experimentation . . . to model new teaching strategies for the coaching partner” (p. 251). Other research similarly concludes that abstract professional development courses/sessions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013161X12452563">Neuman &amp; Cunningham, 2009</xref>) or new curriculum components (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013161X12452563">Domitrovich et al., 2009</xref>)—without concurrent in-house, in-classroom support—fails to deliver the types of changes in teacher learning and practice that often comes with coaching in concrete, naturalistic learning situations where students are present (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013161X12452563">Anderson &amp; Herr, 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0013161X12452563">
<title>Obstacles to the Studio Classroom</title>
<p>Despite the potential benefits of the studio classroom model as inferred in the literature, the practice has remained difficult to actualize. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013161X12452563">Reeves (2009)</xref> explains that “many schools ignore the power of direct modeling by classroom teachers as the key to high-impact professional learning” (p. 85). Although the concept of “existence proofs” to link conceptual knowledge to practical knowledge seems compelling, Reeves offers one possible explanation for the dearth of the modeling/studio classroom practice, claiming that many potential teacher-leaders get stuck on the question, <italic>What if my model lessons are not very good?</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013161X12452563">Reeves, 2009</xref>). Thus, it seems that many teacher leaders view the observing and debriefing, which often accompany “studio lessons” as requiring perfect practice for later replication rather than as a venue to stimulate discussion of problems of practice to promote teacher learning. This fear is often reinforced by larger economic and political forces that have recently suppressed authentic inquiry into teaching practice in favor of the marketization of “evidence-based practices” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013161X12452563">Anderson &amp; Herr, 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0013161X12452563">
<title>Theoretical Framework: Sociocultural Teacher Learning Models</title>
<p>More than 20 years ago, new theories emerged that looked at teacher learning as being “situated” in social practice, not just in the individual educator’s mind (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013161X12452563">Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991</xref>). Rather than having concepts be “transmitted” to teachers for hopeful eventual implementation, situated theory sees learning as embodied and, therefore, emerging from action in relation to others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013161X12452563">Korthagen, 2010</xref>). This model necessitates teacher learning events that are, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013161X12452563">Korthagen (2010)</xref> concludes, “fruitful practical experiences . . . sufficient, suitable, and realistic” while also being rooted with peers in everyday classroom life (p. 104).</p>
<p>As pointed out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013161X12452563">City, Elmore, Fiarman, and Teitel (2009)</xref>, professions such as medicine have embedded their learning experiences in collaborative practice via “instructional rounds” for some time. Through specified processes and protocols, physicians work together to develop their <italic>knowledge of practice, in practice</italic>. The educational community, in recent years, has more intentionally borrowed these approaches to connect teacher professional development to “the actual work of teachers and students in classrooms” (p. 157). Oftentimes, these learning events are mediated by peer teacher “coaches” who engage colleagues in what has been called a “local proof route” to teacher learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013161X12452563">Lewis, Perry, &amp; Murata, 2006</xref>), focused on “small trials” where educators with shared problems can “learn from small mistakes rather than large ones” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013161X12452563">Morris &amp; Hiebert, 2011</xref>, p. 6). Such “job-embedded coaching” is often
<disp-quote>
<p>designed to build capacity among willing teachers and to create existence proofs that could be used to demonstrate high-quality practice to others . . . [using] local practice and individual learning to foster organizational learning, moving learning processes beyond abstractions into practical activities. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013161X12452563">Gallucci, 2008</xref>, pp. 555-565)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition to concretizing policy and theory of what <italic>should</italic> happen in what <italic>is</italic> happening, situated and social teacher learning allows teachers to learn from and with people who can not only say they have worked with students but are still working with students, seeking to improve instruction in actual classroom settings (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013161X12452563">Intrator &amp; Kunzman, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>This sociocultural framework helped us better examine the ways in which the HTLs brought the studio classroom to life (Research Question 1), as well as the obstacles to rooting teacher learning in peer collaborative practice (Research Question 2). Additionally, it provided a helpful lens through which to explore the potential impact of teacher leader “modeling” in naturalistic settings (Research Question 3) and whether, overall, a trial-and-error approach to teacher learning could be enhanced by localized HTL studio classroom activities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0013161X12452563" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>In light of the documented gaps between idealized visions of teacher leadership and the actual work of teacher leaders within schools, this study’s primary research questions examined studio classroom manifestations and impact, as well as the related supports and obstacles to HTLs. As such, it seeks to answer the call for “close in, fine grained studies” of teacher leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013161X12452563">Coburn &amp; Russell, 2008</xref>, p. 226) by focusing on one specific model of teacher leadership rather than the broad “distributed leadership” category. Our qualitative inquiry held the primary goal of understanding the beliefs and practices of HTLs and their administrators in relation to the studio classroom across schools and within districts. Participants, as well as data collection and analytic processes, are described below.</p>
<sec id="section10-0013161X12452563">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Over the 2 years of research, six HTLs were studied across four different school districts in one northwest U.S. state. These districts were selected to provide variety in size and socioeconomic status while also remaining representative of the larger state population. Selection was initiated by the principal investigator (PI) contacting school districts where HTLs were being systematically used. Names of potential participants were supplied, and the PI then followed up with the HTLs and their principals to secure participation. Efforts were made to ensure variety in <italic>geographic location, the type of HTL, subject area and grade level expertise</italic>, and <italic>gender</italic>. As a result, four female and two male participants were enrolled in the study, which represented the teacher populations within the schools. Year 1 participants were anchored within one school, whereas Year 2 participants had “caseloads” of teachers across multiple schools within Battleton School District (BSD). Additionally, the Year 1 participants were in a 50% teaching–50% leading split, whereas BSD participants were in a 20% teaching–80% leading arrangement. Despite these differences in role-structure, the analysis highlights patterns of studio classroom enactment that held across the 2 years of the study.</p>
<p>All participants and school districts were given pseudonyms. The three Year 1 HTL participants included Melissa (middle school Language Arts/Social Studies), Rob (middle school Math); and Karen (high school Language Arts/Social Studies). The three BSD HTLs spanned middle and high school, and included Sam (Math), Peggy (Social Studies), and Janet (Math). All six participants had been well-respected teachers within their respective disciplines and applied for the coaching positions when their districts moved toward the teacher leader-coaching model of professional development.</p>
<p>In addition to the six HTLs, four principals, one from each school district, and four district leaders—superintendent, assistant superintendent, executive director of curriculum, and union president—from the district with the three HTLs were included as participants. Inclusion of administrator interviews was designed to balance teacher perceptions, triangulate the data, and maintain a focus on the relationship between studio classroom activities as they were intended within the organization and how they actually played out in HTL practices.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0013161X12452563">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>This research took place over a 2-year period, covering the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 school years. In the first year of the study, three HTLs in separate school districts were each interviewed individually twice, once prior to the beginning of the academic year and once at the end of the academic year. Interviews were semistructured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013161X12452563">Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985</xref>) and were focused on understanding the HTLs’ perceptions of their roles, including explaining the ways in which they planned to directly connect their own classroom teaching to the learning of other teachers (to explore Research Question 2, studio classroom barriers and supports). Additionally, all three HTLs participated in a focus group in March 2009. In addition to interviews, each of the first-year participants were observed throughout the 2008-2009 academic year 10 or 11 times, including two or three observations of their own classroom teaching. Typical observations included participation in or facilitation of professional development events, visitations to other classrooms, leadership planning meetings, and teaching events with their own students (to investigate Research Question 1, studio classroom enactment). Additionally, participants were asked to let the researcher know in advance if their upcoming schedule included engaging in Level 1 modeling. To understand how leadership viewed the role of the first-year participants, interviews were conducted with all three of the HTLs’ principals. Observations of scheduled studio classroom events and administrator perceptions of their relationship to larger school reform efforts were included to more thoroughly investigate Research Question 3 (studio classroom impact).</p>
<p>In the second year of the study, three HTLs in one district were each interviewed individually twice, once prior to the beginning of the academic year and once at the end of the academic year. Additionally, all three HTLs participated in a focus group in April 2010, and five administrators/district leaders were interviewed throughout the year. In addition to interviews, each of the second-year participants were observed 10 times throughout the 2009-2010 academic year, including two or three classroom observations. Also, in both years of the study, multiple artifacts were collected including HTL calendars, professional development materials, meeting agendas, newspaper articles, classroom assignments, school brochures, and emails. Such document analysis helped account for the use of teacher leader time, as well as any discrepancies between the theories behind the creation of respective HTL roles and their actual manifestation in practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0013161X12452563">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Data analysis occurred both during and after data collection through a constant comparative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013161X12452563">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>) method, aiming to develop, refine, and link codes into categories. First, we developed initial descriptive codes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013161X12452563">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>) drawn from the literature and theoretical framework. Initial iterative passes through the data focused on the varied types of “modeling” the HTLs engaged in, different actor’s perceptions of the studio classroom, and observed organizational and social barriers and supports for studio classroom enactment.</p>
<p>After data collection was complete, both researchers again individually read and reread the data to find patterns and relationships between organizational plans for the studio classroom and actual enactment by HTLs. As categories became linked, analytic memos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0013161X12452563">Strauss, 1987</xref>) fostered the development of larger themes. Throughout data analysis, frequent meetings occurred between both researchers to discuss the emerging patterns. Eventually, codetermined themes were named and are presented in the Findings section.</p>

<sec id="section13-0013161X12452563">
<title>Limitations of Study</title>
<p>A limitation of this study involved one of the initial foci of the research—the tangible synergy between the HTL’s roles as “teacher” and “leader.” This synergy was less prevalent than planned, and therefore harder to document and analyze. One possible reason for this limitation was that the PI visited each HTL on 10 or 11 occasions, as it was not possible to visit all six HTLs every day throughout the school year. Although a good deal of field data were collected during these visits, it is highly plausible that additional valuable data were missed during the days when no observational field notes were taken. An additional reason for this shortcoming in the research process is that teacher-leader synergy existed much less than administrators and the HTLs themselves initially expected. Although this limitation made it more difficult to examine Research Question 1 and Research Question 3 (enactment and impact of studio classroom activities), it also allowed for deeper exploration of Research Question 2 (barriers to the studio classroom, and potential supports needed to facilitate its success).</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>In this section, we present this study’s findings related to perception and implementation of the studio classroom. We first look at administrators’ hopes and concerns about implementing studio classrooms, as well as the mixed and diluted messages they sent. Next, we contrast these findings to teachers’ largely positive reactions to the studio classroom concept. We then look at barriers that prevented HTLs from fully implementing the studio classroom, including HTLs objections to using their own classrooms as models and fears of creating collegial dependency. Finally, we look at structural and cultural barriers that prevented the studio classroom model from being used on a regular basis, which included lack of administrative direction, scheduling and funding issues, as well as pervasive fear of and resistance to “observations.”</p>

<title>Administrators’ Intentions</title>
<p>The data show that mixed messages from district and school administrators created an environment that allowed aspirations for HTLs’ to build a studio classroom to quickly fall away. For example, Melissa’s principal Karen was working with her entire building on formative assessments. She viewed Melissa’s classroom as a place for teachers “to go to see those strategies in action. . . . I want teachers to have an opportunity to watch somebody work in a studio classroom and Melissa’s comfortable with that and she has credibility with the staff.” Melissa herself felt that using her classroom as a studio was going to be an administrative expectation, saying that Karen “expects me to say, ‘I’ll try that in my classroom, come during your planning time.’” Similarly, Rob’s principal Layne assumed that he was “having [teachers] come in and watch him teach” and that they would do so because “he’s really got respect from the math department.” Each of these principals directly connected the success of Level 1 studio classroom modeling to the relationships that the HTLs had built with fellow teachers. These relationships were expected to create a comfortable and respectful environment needed to engage in classroom intervisitations to support larger school reform efforts.</p>
<p>In BSD, district-level administrators similarly envisioned professional development facilitated by Level 1 HTL modeling; however, each had a different conception of implementation. The Superintendent, although wanting to promote more classroom-centered coaching, was also concerned that the HTLs’ multiple roles left them little time for “doing demo lessons.” However Sharon, who was charged with overseeing the coaches, felt that the HTL’s flexible schedule permitted time for this, and described the HTLs as “people that I can logistically move from place to place and say ‘I really need somebody to go and model a lesson.’” However, she also indicated that the ones who taught less in their own classroom would be the ones who would be able to model more lessons. These administrative perspectives typified a more general sense across sites that the studio classroom was something that <italic>should</italic> happen, with little thought being given to how it <italic>would</italic> happen.</p>
<p>This lack of direction within BSD at the district level left the details to be worked out at the school level; yet principals demonstrated less support for teacher leader experimentation and Level 1 modeling. One BSD principal explained his concerns in the following way:
<disp-quote>
<p>If I’m that coach, I can try it out in my room almost as an experimental model and see if it works before we turn it loose to the entire district. And maybe it does, but maybe I also learned that it needs this modification or that. But the downside to that, cause there’s downsides and advantages to everything, is you would hate to turn your own classroom into, you know, a lab rat situation. You don’t want your kids to be lab rats, always trying out something that may or may not work and therefore your kids get sort of a haphazard, pretty disjointed education because you’re always trying out these new things . . . if it’s truly a studio for what they’re trying to figure out if it works, well, you have to admit there’s a chance that it doesn’t. Well, do those kids get another chance at it? Do they get another chance at a tried and true practice?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This BDS principal was clear that he was not as supportive as higher-level administrators of the studio classroom professional development model. To him, any potential gain from “experimenting” with new practices was not worth the risk that the students would be treated as “lab rats.” Instead, he believed every kid deserved a chance to experience teacher practices that had already been shown to be effective. Thus, when it came time to deal with additional logistical issues—such as how to pay for the teachers who got released from their own teaching to observe and whether visiting these studios would be voluntary or “forced” for those who needed it most—he had decided that it was not worth it to fight what he called “teacher resistance to opening up the profession.” This particular administrator expressed a willingness to reinforce a culture of privacy as long as teachers within their isolated classroom walls were using practices that had previously been shown to “work” with students.</p>
<p>Further complicating studio classroom implementation was local union issues, and a general lack of trust in the district. The chief administrator of the BSD Teachers Union said that the “skeptical climate” made the district not ready for the studio classroom. She added that “it needs to be funded . . . you can’t just ask a teacher to give up their prep period to go watch somebody else. That prep period is important—it’s there for a reason.” Thus, resistance came not only from administration but from those who represented teachers with administration.</p>
<p>Overall, there was more administrative support in words than in action for the studio classroom. Principals from Year 1 assumed that it would happen but left the details up to the HTL. In Year 2, district administrators assumed it would happen but left the details up to the principals. In both years, implementation became hamstrung by logistical issues and greater levels of distrust and privacy in the teaching culture than anyone had planned for. Ultimately, with no directive to overcome these obstacles, the studio classroom idea was passed over for less challenging professional development processes.</p>

<sec id="section16-0013161X12452563">
<title>Show Me the Way: Teachers and the Studio Classroom</title>
<p>In contrast to administrators, teachers across the sites were quite clear regarding how they felt about studio classroom activities: (a) they liked having approaches modeled for them and (b) they did not like being visited themselves.</p>
<p>There are repeated instances in the 2 years of field notes data of teachers expressing that “seeing other professionals in action” helped them to better understand both the “why” and “how” of schoolwide reform goals. For example, one school was working on using “powerful teaching and learning methods” via a list of indicators. After a “learning walk” to another teacher’s classroom with Karen, one visiting teacher commented, “I knew we did it, but now I see why . . . it helps to understand the indicators.” It is important to note, however, that this was not a studio classroom visit to an HTL’s classroom but a guided tour given by Karen.</p>
<p>Similarly, in an early year one-on-one coaching session, Melissa expressed the hopeful idea that “we can use each other’s classes as labs.” The teacher, however, pushed for Melissa to guest teach in his class—mentioning twice that it was the guest teaching in his classroom that he found to be the most helpful form of professional development the previous year. In another example, Sam was facilitating an after-school professional development session for teachers on new interactive math technologies. Here again, the teachers pressed for some version of the studio classroom to enhance their learning of this new approach, with one commenting, “It just helps to see it done with a real class.” Although Sam made a general comment that anyone was welcome to watch him teach at any time—a common refrain across the sites—specific invitations never followed.</p>
<p>The dynamics in these interactions indicates a desire from teachers to see new approaches modeled in order to integrate them more deeply into their teaching schemata. Yet at the same time, many of these same teachers avoided being visited by the HTLs and other teachers. The HTLs, similarly, preferred to visit other classrooms rather than being visited—for reasons explored in the next section.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0013161X12452563">
<title>HTL Barriers to the Studio Classroom</title>
<p>HTLs across the sites spoke about Level 1 studio classroom modeling as something that could and possibly should occur but only after certain conditions were met. Primarily, these conditions related to collegial dispositions toward the role of the HTL. For example, Melissa explained why she believed Level 1 modeling was neither the best approach nor use of teacher time. She claimed that it made some teachers too dependent on her, referencing one particular colleague who “just wanted her to come back and [teach his class] again and again.” Melissa was also concerned about guest teaching in other classes with the focus being solely on “instruction” and not relationships, adding that “those kids don’t know me.” As for having other teachers visiting her classroom via the studio model, she said that most teachers didn’t feel it was worth the time because
<disp-quote>
<p>there is a sense that if the [coach] is in the building, and I can get some materials, I can just figure it out. This happens even when it has been mandated to see others teach and there is really positive feedback about it. It’s because there’s also really negative feedback about time and timing and logistics. I have seen a few teachers come in here [to my class] and see something, but they drop it at the transfer. They just want the materials to get it done.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These concerns that studio classroom teaching events would create dependency among teachers and yield only superficial teacher learning were common among the HTLs. They believed, as Melissa expressed, that although an observed lesson might provide other teachers with an activity or teaching idea, it did not lead to any deep change in teacher thinking. Rob similarly expressed concern about both the motives behind teachers’ desires for the studio classroom as well as its impact:
<disp-quote>
<p>They get in this kind of mode where I need to help them. They get stuck, and it’s like: rescue, rescue, rescue … they are looking for help, but I am not sure my definition of help is their definition. Last year, they wanted me to deal with everything, give them a worksheet, tell them this is their math program. I want them to start thinking about how to teach math.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Here, Rob differentiates between a more prescriptive version of “help” that teachers might glean from watching him teach and the transformation in math instruction that he sought. He, like most of the HTLs, though that at some point studio classrooms would be more appropriate, adding that “once we get other pieces in place . . . books, standards, curriculum . . . then we can do some of that other stuff—going into other people’s classrooms.” Similarly, Melissa believed that because the teachers had not identified a focused need, “I don’t think we’re at that point yet” where teachers would see it being worth their time. Across the sites, there was a general sense from the HTLs that teachers were not ready for the studio classroom.</p>
<p>Thus, there existed a clear dissonance between observed teachers’ expectations and hopes for studio classroom activities from the HTLs and what the HTLs themselves believed was appropriate to advance professional development in their buildings. Although the teachers seemed to be asking for concrete examples of reforms-in-action, the HTLs perceived a lack of systemic readiness to facilitate teacher learning through the studio model.</p>
<sec id="section18-0013161X12452563">
<title>HTLs in their own classroom</title>
<p>One additional HTL impediment to manifestation of the studio classroom was evident across the sites—the HTLs’ own teaching. Each of the HTLs was observed teaching in their own classroom two or three times. In almost every instance, their lessons were typical of those you might see in any K-12 classrooms—filled with high points, low points, and occasionally some difficulties engaging students. Sometimes, they struggled with exactly the same reform implementation in which they were seeking to engage their colleagues.</p>
<p>In one illustrative example, Peggy explained how her district was rolling out new initiatives related to differentiated instruction and building students’ academic vocabulary. At an observed leadership workshop day for all teacher leaders and principals, the entire school was discussing the book <italic>The Differentiated School</italic> to learn how to better meet the needs of the district’s increasingly diverse learners. Days later, Peggy was observed teaching an 8th grade Social Studies lesson focused on academic vocabulary connected to “political parties” and “planks.” The lesson was designed to include a role play for students to think about which party they would choose as they were offered more and more items. Through much of the lesson, students did not listen to her directions nor did they focus on the task at hand. Clearly frustrated, Peggy threatened the students with “going back and just reading the book” if they did not cooperate. After the lesson, she ascribed some of the lessons shortcomings to the fact that one of the students in the room had Asperger’s syndrome.</p>
<p>The above is not a teacher-bashing anecdote. In fact, the observational data have several examples of HTLs directly addressing the researcher after a classroom observation to “explain” why a lesson did not go well—sometimes attributing it to particular kids, other times to their leadership positions, which made it more difficult to plan. What is important to note here is that in no case did an HTL see their own classroom—including struggles with their own teaching—as fodder for productive coaching discussions about the lived curriculum and how to make the larger reform efforts more viable. Instead, fear of judgments from visitors—whether the researcher or another teacher—led them to explain away rather than explore the difficulties of teaching. In the right environment and with the right supports, the teaching episode above could have been used as a centerpiece for a discussion of what makes teaching academic vocabulary through differentiated instruction challenging and how to do it better next time. Instead, it was quickly brushed aside—and with some degree of shame.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section19-0013161X12452563">
<title>Structural Barriers to the Studio Classroom</title>
<p>As indicated earlier, a number of structural issues also impeded the HTLs enacting the studio classroom. Lack of direction from administrators on expectations related to the focus and frequency of teacher leader modeling was one major obstacle. As Melissa commented, there would need to be a “clearly identified need” in order to make the “minutes, expectations, reflections, and time” of a true studio classroom palpably worth it for teachers. However, these larger structures were never set in place. Even when visiting other teacher’s classrooms was an administrative expectation, neither supports nor consequences were put in place to give the prospect any teeth.</p>
<p>Additional structural barriers included lack of compatibility of schedules for HTLs and the teachers with whom they worked. Karen noted that “the fewer classes I teach, the fewer opportunities for people to observe me teaching.” One additional structural barrier was funding, and the need to “cover” teachers’ classes so that they could observe Level 1 modeling.</p>
<p>A final but notable lack of structure became clear in the five examples of when a studio classroom event did occur: <italic>a lack of protocols to encourage learning from the teaching event</italic>. In one example, Melissa’s classroom was visited by a coach from another school to see how the “transition model” for special education students was working. When the visitor was asked what she was looking for during the observation, she said, “Nothing specific.” During the debrief of the lesson, Melissa asked the visiting coach if she had any questions, and the conversation meandered around general classroom and teaching issues for approximately 15 minutes. When Melissa pressed for more specific feedback, the visitor replied, “Nothing to say, it was great to see. . . . The kids are fun.”</p>
<p>In another example of lack of structured protocols, Rob modeled two lessons in two different teachers’ classrooms over the course of the year. During each lesson, Rob provided specific examples of pedagogical approaches targeted to the areas in which the teachers wanted to improve and gain more expertise. Yet in neither lesson was the teacher in a physical or mental position of learning. Instead of taking notes, observing, and asking questions about content and pedagogy, these teachers coached individual students on the tasks. There was no specific protocol for <italic>how</italic> these teachers were to get the most out of Rob’s Level 1 modeling and, for one period, to not teach but learn about teaching. In the absence of this structure for observing-to-learn, they did not appear to use the time to expand their teaching repertoire. For the most part, they watched and worked with particular students, with one even leaving the room for several minutes to help a student begin a separate project disconnected from Rob’s studio lesson.</p>
<p>Overall, there was little to no impact on larger school reform efforts or individual teacher learning when the HTLs did manage to enact some aspect of the studio classroom through Level 1 modeling. This appeared to be related to the fact that there was no process in place to link observations of HTL teaching to specified improvement goals through targeted description, analysis, and reflection by the observer(s).</p>

<title>School-Cultural Barriers to the Studio Classroom</title>
<p>HTLs not only faced structural hindrances but also obstacles imbedded within the culture of teaching. For example, across all sites, the HTLs were quite explicit that the word “observe” was never to be used in conjunction with classroom visitations. Peggy specifically said the word “observe” was “a dirty word.” Additionally, according to Sam and Janet, the evaluative connotations connected with classroom “observations” were reported to bring up “union issues” at several of the sites and violated the privacy that some teachers valued. In some instances, the situation was so severe that individual BSD HTLs decided to abandon any attempts to engage in classroom intervisitations. Janet said she decided she would wait until she was explicitly asked to do so by administrators to avoid being the object of a union grievance, and Sam explained how he had begun to do most of his coaching over e-mail. Sam’s engaging in primarily virtual Level 2 modeling symbolized a phenomenon that occurred across all six HTL participants—a gradual drift away from the situated, classroom-based professional development activities that were originally envisioned as integral to their roles.</p>
<p>In addition to the valuing of privacy, HTLs also faced teachers’ fear of judgment that they described as being very much a part of the culture of teaching—particularly in these politically charged times when “teacher quality” is under a microscope. Rob explained how the phenomenon of teacher insecurity affected his attempts to arrange intervisitations:
<disp-quote>
<p>There’s a lot of insecurity in teaching—to put it out there in front of other adults, man, this is tough. I see less problems with the younger teachers, most of them are willing. The older teachers, some of them are comfortable and don’t care, and some are a little reluctant. It could be me—maybe they just don’t know me that well.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Rob would add a few weeks later that he understood why teachers would delay responding to requests for intervisitations, as they perceive no direct benefit because “the mindset” is just not there. Often, he said, the “best way in” was to “just go ahead and [teach their class] himself.” This served as another example of how long-held sociocultural practices within the profession negatively affected the social learning that was ideally supposed to flow from HTL positions.</p>

<sec id="section21-0013161X12452563" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Across all sites and participants, there were three consistent and related barriers to enacting the studio classroom: (a) a covert and sometimes overt message that lessons were not for teachers to learn from but needed to “work” for students, (b) a lack of focus on an agreed-on “learning goal” for teachers within a district or school, and (c) a lack of trust among teachers, making them uncomfortable with classroom visitations. The common thread among these barriers is a diminished understanding and appreciation for the (teacher) learning process, despite extensive research documenting that learning from mistakes and missteps is fundamental to transforming beliefs and practices. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013161X12452563">Jensen (2005)</xref> explains, there are “two simple truths about the brain: (1) the brain rarely gets it right the first time, and (2) making mistakes is key to developing intelligence” (p. 52). Yet the rabid emphasis on ensuring that students’ brains were experiencing “best practices” to pass state exams had the countereffect of reducing opportunities for teachers to expand their pedagogical intelligence.</p>
<p>The pervasive collective lack of appreciation for learning from mistakes led to situations where logistical, social, and cultural barriers overwhelmed any studio classroom implementation attempts. This occurred even though many in the respective systems praised the abstract concept of studio lessons to promote teacher learning. In practice, this led to a <italic>passing of the observation buck</italic>. The HTLs were willing to visit other teachers but much less willing to be visited. Teachers wanted to watch the HTLs teach but not to be observed themselves. Meanwhile, administrators sent out mixed and diluted messages about the extent to which they expected professional learning to be rooted in classrooms.</p>
<p>Further complicating any attempts for teachers to learn from practice in classrooms were diffused reform efforts. Each of the districts in this study was engaged in multiple, sometimes contradictory, initiatives. In terms of what teachers were supposed to learn in a studio classroom, administrators could not provide a focus, or provided too many foci. As several of the HTLs indicated, it was difficult to know what should be “modeled” or “observed” when district and school goals were unclear and sometimes convoluted. To make teacher learning “concrete” became nearly impossible within ambiguous systemic goals.</p>
<p>In sum, the structural barriers (e.g., lack of time, money, as well as protocols and focus) facilitated the maintenance of school-cultural barriers (e.g., fear, distrust, and privacy) long-held within the teaching profession. Although it made sense hypothetically that an educator who was both teaching and leading teachers would link the two endeavors via some version of the studio classroom, the HTLs opened up their classroom doors no more than their colleagues. With little authority to institute the studio classroom, and a pervasive insecurity in both their own teaching and relationships with colleagues, the HTLs ultimately reverted back to traditional norms of teacher privacy and isolation—ironically, the norms their positions were initially designed to break down.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0013161X12452563" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusions and Recommendations</title>
<p>Clearly, the closed-door culture of teaching will not go gently into that good night. To counteract this, as this study indicates, a reexamining of the term <italic>modeling</italic> needs to take place. The word “model” typically infers exhibiting qualities for replication by the observers. However, what is needed to promote teacher learning of new concepts and approaches is a redefining of teacher-modeling as exhibiting qualities that encourage <italic>reflection on teaching</italic> rather than <italic>replication of teaching</italic>. This would require an acknowledgment that any lesson is to some degree an experiment; and that even a “best practice” will require much fine-tuning when manifested with particular students on a particular day in a particular classroom (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013161X12452563">Margolis, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, for teacher leaders, the message needs to be sent that leadership is in the learning, not in the perfection. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013161X12452563">Anderson and Herr (2011)</xref> insightfully explain, the importing of “best” or “evidenced-based” practices to classrooms is valuable only to the exporters who profit from these materials (e.g., publishing and testing companies) and disregards decades of scholarship on the importance of authentic teacher inquiry (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013161X12452563">Cochran-Smith &amp; Lytle, 2009</xref>). HTLs and other teacher leaders may be more willing to tackle structural and cultural obstacles to the studio classroom if there is a clear systemic message that the “model” is the one who learns the most from their teaching. In dismantling the search for the holy grail of the “perfect lesson,” a new vision of leadership can emerge where the teacher leader is the best teacher learner—the one who revises and improves their own teaching the most, as well as the one who provides the most appropriate feedback to others so they can learn from missteps. To aid in creating these types of environments, administrators would need to model the process of learning from mistakes themselves, making public their own thinking as they navigate through complex educational dilemmas.</p>
<p>To assist in this redefining of school leadership to improve teacher learning, we can draw from emergent theories on how to improve K-12 student learning. One of the strategies suggested by several authors (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013161X12452563">Jensen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013161X12452563">Schoenbach, Greenleaf, Cziko, &amp; Hurwitz, 1999</xref>) is to <italic>reward awareness of struggles</italic>—the more honest and thorough, the better. Extending this theory to teacher professional development around the implementation of curricular and pedagogical reforms would be an important and essential first-step in re-acculturating teaching. It would mean using data to improve rather prove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013161X12452563">Charalambous &amp; Silver, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013161X12452563">Nelson, Slavit, &amp; Deuel, 2012</xref>), drawing from classroom observations to learn rather than evaluate, and rewarding teachers for reflection rather than perfection. Specific strategies might include (a) designating targeted rewards for teachers who thoughtfully identify areas of struggle during specific lesson observations as well as annual reviews, (b) developing additional rewards structures for teachers who demonstrate action (e.g., research and professional development leading to revised lessons and curricula) as a result of thoughtful reflection on areas needing improving, and (c) associating career ladder opportunities (e.g., teacher leader-coaching positions) with the desired qualifications of demonstrating the following: a record of connecting reflection on teaching to the improvement of teaching and learning, an openness to classroom intervisitations and Level 1 modeling, and a capacity to connect individual teaching enhancements to larger school improvement goals.</p>
<p>Some of the new national standards for preservice teachers to achieve certification (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0013161X12452563">Teacher Performance Assessment Consortium, 2011</xref>) do call on teacher candidates to speak to where they would make adjustments based on documented learning events with students. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013161X12452563">National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (2011)</xref> similarly asks in-service candidates to speak to needed improvements in order to articulate their excellence. Yet in both of these high-profile teacher portfolios, the focus on improvement is subsidiary to an emphasis on proving impact on student learning. Moreover, these performance-based efforts are often overrun by larger forces in a contemporary political climate that places teaching under a microscope for judgment based primarily on student test scores.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this study neither refutes nor confirms prior research on the importance of teachers and teacher leaders owning curricular reforms through opportunities for structured practice and reflection. It does, however, illuminate the complicated web of factors that hinder classroom-centered professional development and provides some helpful guideposts for those who want to bring the studio classroom to life. To assist in making Level 1 modeling more widely accepted, research on teaching will need to more strongly make the case that documenting and analyzing mistakes (as well as successes) more strongly correlates with teacher and student learning than the importation and transmitting of “best practices.” In so doing, future studies might then seize more opportunities to document the impact of Level 1 modeling and the studio classroom on professional development and larger school reform efforts. This evidence might, at last, help create the social conditions within which teacher leaders can successfully work with colleagues to better connect what is ideally “said” in schools with the realities of what is “done” in classrooms.</p>
