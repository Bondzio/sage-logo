<abstract>
<p>This article builds on earlier research and argues that Vatican II and subsequent church teaching on the role of the laity lack the force to effect change in the deeply embedded subjectivization of the laity. It proposes that, in a vastly changed, pluralistic world, a new sense of being Catholic is emerging, requiring a new identity and direction for mission to be developed in the context of the current exodus of Catholics away from close involvement with Eucharistic rituals and other things ‘sacred’. This ‘exodus’ may represent a relocation of the People of God deep into the heart of the sacred world for whose transformation we are given to mission as church. In this sense, it may well turn out to be a blessing, and not a problem.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1030570X13488733" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>In 1967, Karl Rahner marked the end of what might be called the last remaining vestiges of Christendom, when he wrote that Catholics must re-learn how to live out their Catholicism as a ‘Christian diaspora’ in an increasingly secular and non-Christian world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1030570X13488733">1</xref></sup> No longer do Catholics inherit, almost ‘breathe in’, their Catholicism as part of a distinct and walled-around sub-culture. Now Catholics must work differently at being the people given to the mission to transform the world in Christ in this new pluralist, secular environment.</p>
<p>On the strength of Rahner’s view, I want to make two propositions and ask one question. The first proposition is that the people most available to fulfil this transformative mission are those who live in the midst of this postmodern world, mostly known as ‘laity’. The second proposition is that the vision for the laity in the Vatican II documents, intended to enable this mission, has not been fulfilled. In the light of these propositions, my question is this: what if the present dispersal of Catholics into that world, without close connections with what might loosely be called a ‘mainstream Catholic Community’, is not a disaster? What if it might just as well be seen as a Spirit-led opportunity for looking beyond internal concerns and engaging the world, in the name of the justice, compassion, peace and the ‘indiscriminate hospitality’ of God’s reign? What if we honoured this lifestyle shift with a distinct culture shift, a culture that reinterprets life in the light of a church given to the transformative Mission of God? Then we would need a dedicated approach to forming people for accepting and achieving their transformational roles. What we don't need is another ‘theology of the laity’. We already have one: its name is ‘ecclesiology’, the theology of the church as communion and community of disciples. We just need to interpret it with holistically, using different inclusive words to describe it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1030570X13488733"><title>Foundations</title>
<p>In 2002, I took up an Australian Catholic University invitation to present a paper on the topic of ‘Laity in the Church’ at its 40th Anniversary of Vatican II Conference. I called the paper: ‘Vatican II: End of a Clerical Church?’ Unashamedly, I borrowed my title from that of a book by a French Jesuit, Paul Guilmot, entitled <italic>Fin du un Eglise Clericale?</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1030570X13488733">2</xref></sup> Equally unashamedly, I put major emphasis on the question mark at the end of the title. My first conclusion was that laity had come a long way towards real ownership of, and participation in, the life of the church, following the publication of <italic>Apostolicam Actuositatem</italic>, and the 1987 Synod on the Laity with the subsequent papal encyclical of Pope John Paul II, <italic>Christifideles Laici</italic>. I identified 10 points of progress.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1030570X13488733">3</xref></sup> My second conclusion was that there was an amount of progress still to be made, and that these two documents were somewhat ambiguous; too much so to be the focus and driving force to make progress happen. In its main structural reality, the Catholic Church was still a clerical church 40 years after the Council that supposedly released the laity into full, active and conscious participation in the whole life of the church. Its decrees reputedly brought us in from the fringes to the centre of that life. Guilmot was already arguing in his 1969 work that the ambiguity of the documents was at the core of this inertia. He stressed the confusing ‘double-handedness’ of the church’s documents, especially those of Vatican II. Guilmot was one of the earliest writers to recognize the intertextuality of the Vatican II documents, arguing for their interpretation by considering all the documents as a whole, not working from the facile process of isolating ‘proof texts’ as convenient for a prevailing argument. In this sense, Guilmot wrote:<disp-quote>
<p>The Council swings back and forth between two positions: on the one hand, the major insight of ‘Lumen Gentium’ chapter two and of ‘Gaudium et Spes’ where the Church is an active presence of Christians in the world and for the world, and on the other, a clerical approach in which the layman is once again considered as a subordinate, a kind of subject of the hierarchy. This can be already seen in chapter four of ‘Lumen Gentium’ and becomes flagrant in the Decree on the Lay Apostolate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1030570X13488733">4</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>Reflection on these documents indicates that Guilmot’s analysis makes much sense. I tend to think the reality is even more complex than simply textual, and that the ambiguity of the documents in the light of historical forces simply drains the will of the church to see and do things differently in a timely fashion. Let me offer some historical considerations that add force to this debilitated will.</p>
<p>First, as a church historian, I believe we are, in part, still in transit from the powerful force of Pope Saint Pius X’s statement that the sole role of laity is very simply ‘to obey their Pastors in all docility’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1030570X13488733">5</xref></sup> Pius represents the long memory of a clerical church operated by the ordained for the salvation of the souls of the baptized. At least from the Council of Trent in the 16th century, the laity were considered as objects of the administration of the sacred into their profane lives by the ordained, and as subjects of the over-arching authority of those holding exclusive title to the sacred and to the arcane gnosis of divinity and its associated disciplines. Cultures so strong for so long are virtually impossible to change in short order.</p>
<p>Second, we are also, I believe, in the midst of a tension or dialectic similar to those that have been the catalyst for long-term post-conciliar renewal in the past.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1030570X13488733">6</xref></sup> The present tension is between the renewal that Vatican II saw as essential for a church in the modern world to proclaim the gospel effectively, and the need to maintain our essential connectivity with the living memory of the church, especially as expressed in prior magisterium. This tension, between discontinuity and continuity, I believe, reduces our energy to challenge out-dated disciplines and make something new. It is fraught with the fear of dragons! It needs significant and courageous dialogue to resolve it, a dialogue that seems not to be encouraged, nor provided with adequate instrumentalities to facilitate it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1030570X13488733">7</xref></sup> Even worse, many of our Catholic people have lost heart and simply walked away, repelled by the resumption of one-sided, top-down, imposed conversations that polarize people, rather than the creation of accessible avenues for respectful and open dialogue. Such dialogue is of the essence for the future of the Church in Mission. As a good friend, Paul Dalton, used to say, ‘renewal begins when an idea meets resistance from Rome’, because such events draw God’s people into dialogue. And if ‘Communio’ was the crucial concept of church underpinning the Vatican Council decrees, then ‘Dialogue’ was its great call to action. Indeed the call to dialogue represented a paradigm shift from pre-Vatican II ‘impose and sanction’ to post-conciliar ‘dialogue &amp; reconcile’.</p>
<p>The historian in me cannot resist delving into the memory of the church (and it can be a <italic>very</italic> long memory), into the wounds of former times when non-ordained elites had control over the church and even claimed the right to invest bishops, and veto papal elections. Apart from the infamous and debilitating ‘Investiture Scandal’ of the later medieval period and other problems of this type, a practical and comparatively more recent example presents itself. In 18th-century Recusant England, the landed gentry controlled the finances and infrastructure of the church as well as the practical disposition of clergy whom they housed, provided with chapels within which to celebrate Eucharist, and peasant congregations to attend it. On this basis, these gentry exercised, therefore, an administrative control considered insufferable by Ultramontane Vicars Apostolic such as Bishop John Milner (1752–1826), who condemned the period as one of ‘lay interference and domination in the ecclesiastical affairs of English Catholics’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1030570X13488733">8</xref></sup> For Milner and his fellow Ultramontanes, ‘ecclesiastical affairs’ were the sole prerogative of the clergy, under the central control of the Vatican. So they were for the Irish who dominated the Australian Church at its foundations and deep into the 20th century.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1030570X13488733">9</xref></sup> This was one of the memories that came with them. It was aided and abetted by the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith, by which the English Church was governed at the time, and to which the Australian Church remained beholden as a ‘Mission Territory’ from 1788 until 1976, well after Vatican II.</p>
<p>Such memories, deeply etched into the heart of a church like ours, leave lasting cultural barriers that hinder the full, active and conscious participation of a <italic>laos</italic> who are becoming ever more learned in the divine sciences of theology and its associated disciplines, as well as the incarnate skills of leadership, effective organization and sound decision-making. These modern laity have no wish to assume the right to invest Bishops, but they do ask for some transparent revival of the ancient papal principle: ‘He who is to preside over all, must be elected by all’, a principle applied to the choice of bishops by Pope Leo the Great (r. <sc>ad</sc> 440–461).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1030570X13488733">10</xref></sup> And most of all, they ask to be treated as truly co-responsible for the mission of the church, and if co-responsible, then also real participants in determining its direction and its decisions. What is being asked here is revival of the principle set by the medieval pope, Boniface VIII, ‘quod omnes tangit, ab omnibus tractari et approbari debet’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1030570X13488733">11</xref></sup> To argue for continuity with our tradition is to accept these expressions of it also, if we are to render its ‘hermeneutic’ fully authentic.</p>
<p>These and a number of other issues may well be behind hesitant attitudes of the hierarchical magisterium towards focusing attention on the concept and practicalities of a whole church (baptized and ordained) in mission together as equals, imaging the equality of persons in the Trinity, a relational community in which we are called to share with all of creation. In my view, any other concept is not an easily sustainable model of the church considered as a communion with the Triune God, and with each other, as declared in <italic>Lumen Gentium,</italic> Chapters 1 and 4, which seem much more in harmony with Rahner’s vision that:<disp-quote>
<p>The Church of the diaspora, if it is to remain alive at all, will be a Church of active members, a church of the laity; a laity conscious of itself as bearing the church in itself, as constituting her; and not simply being an object for her, i.e. for the clergy to look after. The laity will have ecclesiastical duties which they, as a matter of course carry out, and rights as they did in the early Church.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1030570X13488733">12</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>I would note here that the role of the clergy in this model, as well as that of laity, becomes even more substantial and meaningful, though perhaps different from our traditional expectations. In focusing on laity, I mean in no way to demean the role of clergy, rather to enhance it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1030570X13488733"><title>Issues for further progress</title>
<p>For the remainder of this article, I will look back to the issues I nominated in 2002 as crucial to this model, seeking to identify and celebrate progress made in the past 10 years, or to point out any of them still dormant or regressing. To be frank, I do not find much cause for celebration.</p>
<p>First, and regretfully, I do not see much progress towards removing the anomalous definition of laity accepted by Vatican II, as the baptized who are not ordained or vowed. This definition, or lack of definition, appears to assume that the basic membership of the church is Holy Order, not baptism. This is patently flawed ecclesiology. But still we struggle with the search for a name and a description for the baptized that tells us who we are, rather than who we are not, that recognizes and sustains the primacy of our mission at the face of the world, and that does not refer to us by a name commonly reserved for the untutored, the unaware, the subject, those on the edges. We need a name that draws us once again into the centre of the church’s life where we rightfully belong, and disposes us inspirationally towards our sacred mission of transformation.</p>
<p>Second, consequently, and most seriously of all, the relative meanings of ‘mission’ and ‘ministry’ are largely misconstrued. Mostly when people these days celebrate involvement by the laity in the life of the church, it is really ministry they are talking about. Even among the theologically advanced participants of the ACTA Conference of 2011,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1030570X13488733">13</xref></sup> lay theologian, Neil Ormerod, expressed dismay at the fact that discussions regarding laity always seemed to gravitate into questions of lay ministries (liturgical, pastoral, charitable, etc.). While the call to ministry experienced by many of the baptized is truly a grace, and the many ministries they take up are wonderful and living signs of life in the church, they are the supporting feature, not the main game. The main game remains, and always will remain (until the <italic>parousia</italic>), the transformation of the world in the light of the conditions of the ‘reign of God’, in which all being enters into communion with the loving Trinity, and the divine <italic>milieu</italic> of justice, peace, reconciliation, stewardship of the world and compassion for all being rules the earth. Ministry is the service that supports, informs and sustains this broad and truly wonderful mission for which all the baptized are called, located and gifted. Succeeding sections of this article regarding various ministries in which the baptized may become involved need to be read in this context.</p>
<p>There continues to be a lack of clarity surrounding the significance of the mission to which we are given. It is as if the innate human quest for the sacred can only be resolved by working close to the sanctuary, and that the sacramental and sacred work of transforming the world in Christ is mundane by comparison at best, and an unwanted distraction from the ‘real’ sacred at worst. Is it possible, in these days where the majority of Catholics are removing themselves from proximity to the sanctuary, that we have a Spirit-given opportunity to remedy this confusion about what is sacred, and call on the sacred missionary vocation of all Christians to change the world where they are located? Please do not mistake me here. The call to ministry for many baptized is real and essential for the life of the church. But not all are called to it. On the other hand, all of us <italic>are</italic> called and given to the mission of transformation in a world already made sacred by creation and incarnation. I sometimes think the Jansenist ‘gene’ of good spirit versus evil matter has mutated the designs of the Gospel.</p>
<p>Third, even when we do consider appropriate lay ministries, seemingly in response to this ‘rush’ of people into ministry, great, not to say almost obsessive, care has been taken to lay strict boundaries between the ontologically different priesthood of the ordained and the ‘common’ priesthood of the baptized.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1030570X13488733">14</xref></sup> Unfortunately, this is without significant redevelopment of a theology of either in the light of the renewed ecclesiology of <italic>communio</italic>, which re-establishes our continuity with the church of the first millennium of the Christian faith. This serious gap renders the tightened boundaries far less than useful, or indeed meaningful. In the past 10 years, we have seen the baptized systematically removed from close and ‘ordinary’ contact with the so-called ‘sacred ministry of priests’, especially in liturgy. I am not totally opposed to this, but am concerned about the linguistic impression that there are two ‘classes’ in the church. For example, the liturgical norms of <italic>Redemptionis Sacramentum</italic> treat the baptized as if we are second-class citizens as far as the sacred liturgy is concerned, rather than full, conscious and active participants in it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1030570X13488733">15</xref></sup> Later directives from the same Congregation for Divine Worship, in the best traditions of Jansenist dualism, seem to treat the baptized as too profane even to ‘wash up’ the sacred vessels after the communion of the Eucharistic sacrifice. This is the sole prerogative of the ‘sacred’ ordained priest, as if the baptized are somehow unworthy, unclean from contact with the world. A bishop with whom I spoke just after the publication of <italic>Redemptionis Sacramentum</italic> confided to me that his duty of proclaiming it to his diocese was one of the ‘most distasteful tasks of my Episcopate’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1030570X13488733">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>This claim of sacredness as exclusive to the altar and its cultic priesthood seems bizarre. Recently, two priests of the Sale Diocese raised a petition to be sent to the Holy Father requesting elimination of Communion in the hand and a return to the pre-Vatican II practice of Communion on the tongue. The response to publication of this event was interesting. For me it re-raised the sacred/profane duality that I had imagined Rahner’s vision of nature and grace and the Vatican II Pastoral Constitution, <italic>Gaudium et Spes</italic>, had long since eliminated. It ignores the sacredness of the work of those hands that made the bread and wine, elements that therefore may be considered as sacred before they come to the altar for consecration, and without which a valid Eucharist is not possible. It seems the most ancient of heresies with their dualisms are still alive in some way! Events such as these point even more powerfully to the need for a developed ‘communion for mission’-based ecclesiology of priesthood, not just as a sacral, cultic office, but as multiple sharing in the one Priesthood of Christ, transacted in the sanctuary, within the community of the faithful, and, most of all, on the sacred ‘altar of the world’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1030570X13488733">17</xref></sup> Eucharistic theology suggests strongly that the liturgical actions of the ontologically different priesthood lack authenticity if they do not represent the community and its mission in the world, because the whole Body of Christ is not present in its celebrations. As Montreal theologian Rémi Parent argued over 20 years ago: ‘our images of God, Christ, Church, Priesthood and Eucharist have rendered the Laity passive and the world profane, resulting in clericalisation of the Church’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1030570X13488733">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Fourth, on that issue, canonically as well as culturally, the church is still invested with clericalism in the most incongruous of ways. The most visible form of lay leadership ministry, the Pastoral Council, remains only an option for dioceses and parishes, despite the clear teaching of <italic>Christifideles Laici</italic>, and despite the fact that the Australian Catholic bishops have made recent and emphatic moves to express their support for every Australian parish to elect, and to provide proper formation for, parish pastoral councils. The flaws in the relevant canon are twofold. First, while a finance committee to assist parish priests is essential in Canon Law, the parish pastoral council, ostensibly a body concerned with supporting the real mission of the parish, is only recommended. Second, even if a parish priest does take up the option to appoint or elect the parish pastoral council, canonically its role is only advisory and not ‘deliberative’ (i.e. it has no decision-making role, except of course if an individual parish priest unofficially allows it to have one).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1030570X13488733">19</xref></sup> In parishes where potential members of parish councils are making life and death decisions of various kinds on a daily basis, and many are more skilled theologically than their parish priest, this ‘helping Father’ role can render the parish council a waste of everybody’s time and talent, and a severe frustration for those with the will and the capacity to serve the church effectively in authentic leadership roles. It is very often a frustration that prevents real involvement on the part of some very talented people. Further, many such talented people have walked away from any involvement with the institutional church, either because the world they live in demands more of their time as well as respecting their gifts, or they discern poor clerical leadership that draws the church ever deeper into irrelevance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1030570X13488733">20</xref></sup> Incidentally, where Canon Law, and sections 25 to 27 of Pope John Paul II’s <italic>Christifideles Laici</italic> indicate that the diocese should set an example for parish councils by establishing a diocesan pastoral council, it is interesting to note that there are still a number of Australian dioceses that have not done so. I find it interesting that fealty to the magisterium can be selective at the episcopal level as well as at the other levels often accused by them of such selectivity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1030570X13488733">21</xref></sup> Across Australia, the pattern of integrating all members of the Church into shared leadership is mixed, and remains dependent on individual interpretations of the documents, the arbitrary will of the individual bishop and parish priest and the adequacy of their resourcefulness to facilitate it.</p>
<p>The real test of co-responsibility in the church is, I believe, represented by two elements: first, full participation in the decisions that concern or affect us, as the sociological touchstone of fullness, consciousness and active status in the ecclesial communion; and, second, with this communion as a base, complete awareness of and commitment to our respective roles in our transformative mission to the world in which we are pilgrims.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1030570X13488733">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Fifth, leadership by the baptized is obviously capable of functioning at both these levels. However, Bishop David Walker’s attempts to introduce a lay leadership model into the Diocese of Broken Bay seem to have met with very mixed success. On 20 November 2010, one of his senior clergy, Doctor John Hill, issued an open letter in response to his bishop’s model for the pastoral future of the diocese.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1030570X13488733">23</xref></sup> The letter criticized the bishop’s plan as demeaning to the clergy, as if the ordained had some inalienable, divine right and charism of leadership given with the oils on their ordination day. The fact is that many, through no fault of their own, and despite their other considerable gifts, lack the necessary charism to fulfil the demands of effective Christian leadership in an increasingly complex society with advanced notions of organization. John Hill’s letter may also be symptomatic of a prevalent culture among clergy regarding laity and represent the discomfort that many of our priests feel when confronted with the possibility of partnership with the baptized in pastoral ministry, since it has ‘always been’ the prerogative of the clergy. In his open letter, John wrote about his perception of the bishop’s attempts to ‘laicise the pastoral care of the parishes’, objecting to it on the grounds that it was part of what he described as David Walker’s ‘constant vilification of the Priests of the Diocese’, as well as ‘an unnecessary abridgement of their role’. Without comment on the validity of either side of this tension, it is the language in which it is couched that concerns me. As Yves Congar once noted, it is not simply a matter of the clergy for the church and the baptized for the world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1030570X13488733">24</xref></sup> Gifts of the Spirit are given to both baptized and ordained for both ministry and the mission it sustains. At Vatican II, it was clearly stated that the baptized are called to serve both church and world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1030570X13488733">25</xref></sup> Given the appropriate boundaries, how we each serve must not be a question of traditional prerogatives, but rather of prayerful discernment of the respective charisms of the Spirit, and the needs those gifted with them might meet in our world and in our church.</p>
<p>Sixth, in all of this turmoil, women remain largely alienated. Very often, elderly male celibates pronounce in their name and in their regard. Loreto Sister Denise DesMarchelier, author of <italic>Voices of Women: Women and the Australian Catholic Church</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1030570X13488733">26</xref></sup> remarked to me once that the fate of laity in the church is intimately connected to the fate of women because ‘all of us are laity, none of us are ordained’. Without entering into the women’s ordination issue, solely because it’s a complex issue that deserves more focused treatment, I can discern, as a church historian, the clear disconnect between Jesus’ view of the equality of women and the systematic removal of any communities that valued and documented the leadership and prophetic roles of women in the early church. The followers of the ascetic reformer Montanus (the Montanists whom the lay theologian Tertullian joined c. <sc>ad</sc> 206), were among those so ousted. The <italic>Passion of Perpetua and Felicitas</italic>, edited by a Montanist writer in the early 3rd century, clearly attests to the leadership of women in the house churches of North Africa. Many feminist authors also see the progressive demonization of Mary Magdalene as the canon of sacred scripture and its surrounding theologies became established, as part of a deliberate movement to remove women from any significant role in Jesus’ and the Apostles’ ministries, and therefore in the church.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1030570X13488733">27</xref></sup> Women have had an ambiguous status in the church ever since. Modern biblical scholars and church historians are working to retrieve the place of women, especially in the roles of leadership, prophecy, <italic>diakonia</italic>, hospitality and evangelism, in the face of what looks very much like the intentional removal of women’s literature and voice during the first three to four centuries of the church’s life. This issue will not go away simply by denying the people of God the right to discuss it freely. Civic Australian society, in its own way and for different motives, is struggling to meet the example set by Jesus regarding the fundamental status of equality for both genders, while the church seems to continue to resist it resolutely. Vatican II’s ‘Pilgrim Church’ may need to open itself to the presence of the Spirit of God in the surrounding cultures through which it journeys towards <italic>parousia</italic>, opening itself to mutual transformation, one of the fundamental and desirable outcomes of authentic evangelization.</p>
<p>Finally, mechanisms for fulsome consultation with the whole church, ‘listening to the voice of the Holy Spirit in the People of God’, as Archbishop Francis Carroll named his broad consultative methodology in preparation for the 1989 Synod of the Archdiocese, seem to be very inconsistently available and/or inconsistently applied across the Australian Church. Indeed, many liturgists see the deconstruction of the new translation of the Eucharistic Liturgy from the 1998 consulted version into the 2010 imposed version, as representative of the non-consultative, centralist approach of the Vatican, not just towards the baptized, but towards the whole church, especially towards our bishops, whose autonomy as successors of the Apostles seems to be systematically and progressively dismantled in favour of central bureaucratic control by the Roman curia. Programmes within the Melbourne church such as <italic>Renew</italic> and <italic>Tomorrow’s Church</italic> were predicated on wholesome and fulsome consultations with the whole church to inform the church’s mission. A detailed survey of Melbourne Archdiocesan programmes, stretching back to the immediate post-Vatican II era, shows that these two highly valued consultations came at the end of a whole series. In 1996 they stopped, or were driven by pre-set hierarchical agendas that attracted more cynicism than hope.</p>
<p>The powerful voice of the Holy Spirit who lives within the whole church is still to be released with any sort of consistent intentionality. One of the lessons learned by corporate industry is that the voice of those at the forefront of the company’s business, the frontline staff, is a crucial voice, because they know best of all how things need to be done to ensure the effectiveness of the interchange between themselves and those whom they serve. <italic>A fortiori</italic>, in the interchange between church and world, the voice of we who are filled with the Holy Spirit and fully engaged in the front lines of the world must inform the life and direction of a church truly in mission. Constant, broad-ranging and respectful dialogue with us is not an option. It is an essential instrument for effective mission. To muzzle the voice of the Holy Spirit by ignoring the wisdom of the whole church is foolish at best, and structural sin at worst.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1030570X13488733"><title>So where do we go from here?</title>
<p>In the spring edition of <italic>Compass: Review of Topical Theology</italic>, Gideon Goosens concluded similarly that the promises regarding the laity made by Vatican II have not been fulfilled. He presented two points towards remedial action: changing the language by which we speak of church, mission and ministry; and establishing mechanisms for full participation by the whole church.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1030570X13488733">28</xref></sup> My own sense is that these two are fundamental among a string of other measures. As noted above, our language needs now to represent the paradigm shift from pre-Vatican II ‘impose and sanction’ to post-conciliar ‘dialogue, reconcile and renew’. In addition, mechanisms for fulsome consultation with the whole hurch, ‘listening to the voice of the Holy Spirit in the People of God’, need to be constructed across the Australian Church. We are poorly provided with ‘structures of participation’. We need to start building accessible and transparent structures for two-way conversations and shared decision making to occur at every level.</p>
<p>Third, we properly spend resources to form our clergy. But as Yves Congar argued, the task is now so great that we can only face it by awakening the priestly heart of the whole people of God.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1030570X13488733">29</xref></sup> Are we putting as much resource as we ought into this total effort by both ordained and baptized? It seems our leaders are either not conscious, or not really convinced of the importance of the mission of whole church. Those leaders that are <italic>laos</italic>-focused find it hard to integrate their convictions into their planning and practice, or treat the mission of the <italic>laos</italic> as an inferior priority to that of the clergy. As one US writer argued: ‘if the church wants to be effective in bringing the Gospel to the world, the single most important thing it can do is to re-focus its pastoral vision, planning and action towards that part of the Church that most directly connects with the world, that is, the Laity.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1030570X13488733">30</xref></sup> And the task is not getting them ‘back to Mass’ but conscientizing them where the Spirit has located them, where they should be – in the world.</p>
<p>Fourth, we must learn respect for what Avery Dulles called a basic teaching of Vatican II: ‘Regional and Local Variety’ in the Church.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1030570X13488733">31</xref></sup> Based on the social justice principle of subsidiarity we need to reform the present crippling centralisation of the church. Nothing disables the <italic>Laos</italic> more than slavish centralisation. Our mission requires us to discern how the gospel engages the world here and now. In communion with our brothers and sisters worldwide, we can add our special richness to the life of the universal church, and not be asked to sustain a model that is not viable here. In 1891 Pope Leo XIII wrote <italic>Rerum Novarum</italic>, arguing that governments should undertake only those initiatives that exceed the capacity of individuals or private groups acting independently. If a complex function is carried out at a local level just as effectively as on the national level, the local level should be the one to carry out the specified function. It seems to me the church must set an example in order to be authentic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1030570X13488733">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>We must also continuously re-commit ourselves to real solidarity with the poor as the ‘priority option’ of our commitment to social justice named by the Synod of Catholic Bishops in 1971, as a constitutive element of the mission of the church.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1030570X13488733"><title>Concluding comments</title>
<p>Does all this sound too pessimistic? Upon reflective re-reading of my reflections, I find perhaps it does. I seem to have highlighted just the continuing areas of concern, and somewhat less, the signs of hope that indeed are all around us. I hope, though, that it has presented something of a more fulsome ecclesiology from Vatican Council II, an ecclesiology that goes beyond what Yves Congar called ‘a virtual hierarchology’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1030570X13488733">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>To be fair and balanced, it must be acknowledged that there <italic>are</italic> signs of hope in the wonderful communities that evidence their co-responsibility for our shared mission; in the bishops and clergy who open-heartedly engage their people at all levels of the church’s life; in the remarkable people who persist in being there for the church in all its circumstances; in the people who persist in spite of the ‘dungeon fire and sword’ of scandals, and the irremediable damage done to many vulnerable people. Signs of hope are in the religious orders such as the Society of Jesus, and a number of women’s congregations who have defined their roles, or rather re-defined them, as providing wholehearted support for the mission of the whole church alive in the world. Hope is vibrant in the National Pastoral Plan formulated by the bishops of Papua New Guinea, after intense consultation with their people, resulting in their splendid vision, ‘We are the Church Alive in Christ’, driving the will to transform the society where they live, and empowering all their people to go ahead and do it. Most of all, the signs of hope are in the power of the gospel to transform lives, and in the trust that believes nothing is impossible for God’s people. A trust that there are many things that are just ‘not yet possible’, never impossible, a hope that, under the lead of the befriending Spirit, these too may be achieved in the fullness of time.</p>
<p>There is great hope too, in the bank of written works that we can draw upon to inspire us. Earlier writers and activists such as John Henry Newman, Yves Congar, Gerard Phillips, Joseph Cardijn, Karl Rahner, Leonard Doohan; and many recent authors such as Paul Lakeland, Neil Ormerod, Elizabeth Johnson, Ormond Rush, Steve Bevans, Gerard Mannion, Denis Edwards, and Richard Gaillardetz have given us rich food for reflection, dialogue and further action. Most of all, hope is in the hearts, minds and actions of those people who work to make their homes, their immediate street and neighbourhood, workplace, social circle, political environment, and global interchanges just a millimetre or two closer to proclaiming the in-breaking reign of God among us.</p>
<p>In my hopefulness, I am not anticipating miracles. I realize only too well that there needs to be a serious paradigm shift in the way we think about the Church as Mission. It is a shift I had thought Vatican II initiated. I still do. But such shifts do not come easily or quickly. The Council of Trent is said to have taken 150 years to be fully received. Instruments of wholesome and accessible dialogue are not easily established for a church whose official conversational traffic has been formally one-way for centuries. The seduction of the power implicit in the concentration of <italic>potestas jurisdictionis</italic> into the hands of those who also enjoy <italic>potestas ordinis</italic> is also difficult to resist and relinquish in favour of shared dialogue and participative co-responsibility. The establishment of accessible and realistic formation programmes to ‘form a people for mission’ with such a degree of difficulty and such far-reaching consequences, will take time and courageous effort, given that some adventurous examples have been previously eliminated or sidelined.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1030570X13488733">34</xref></sup> But we can, and I believe we must, make even a small start, perhaps just by naming and exploring the implications of a church given to mission, and re-orienting our thinking to work backwards from that mission to discover who we are, what we are about and how we might organize ourselves appropriately to be God’s mission in the world. That kind of conversation can begin immediately if we are all willing to participate and talk together towards a common end. And perhaps one day, as we work together towards that end, more and more people will simply rediscover the need to gather around a table to share their stories along with Jesus’ story, celebrate their lives in mission as a community, be renewed by the Paschal Mystery in which they share, indeed which they live in imitation of Jesus, and gain nourishment as well as encouragement for their continuing journey as they recognize each other in the ‘breaking of the bread’. Such is my hope.</p>

<fn id="fn3-1030570X13488733"><label>3</label><p>The 10 nominated points of progress were: 1. The growth of consultative structures in the church (Pastoral Councils); 2.

The development of a participative, active liturgy; 5. Growth of social justice teaching and commitment; 6. Growth of a formally educated laity in the theological and biblical disciplines; 7. Revision of the Code of Canon Law to spell out more effectively the rights of laity in the church; 8. The 1987 Synod on the Laity and the publication of <italic>Christifideles Laici;</italic> 9. The continuation and growth of lay movements in the church; and 10. The consultation and publication of <italic>Woman and Man: One in Christ Jesus,</italic> in the Australian Church and the establishment of the ACBC Office for Women. It is possible, unfortunately, to add to each of these a response arguing that restrictive boundaries and limitations continue the ‘second-class citizenship’ of laity in the church. One example often identified is the status of Parish Pastoral Councils as recommended and consultative only.</p></fn>

<fn id="fn6-1030570X13488733"><label>6</label><p>I am using the term dialectic in the ‘Hegelian’ sense of the contraposition of opposing ideas (that are not necessarily opposites), which by dialogue over time move towards a synthesis. In the church, the ‘rush to renewal’ and its accompanying hermeneutic immediately following the Second Vatican Council, has been met with a counter-position based on a ‘Hermeneutic of Continuity’, to restore connections with the traditional teachings and life of the church. Interestingly, both positions enjoy a validity that needs to be refined and developed by dialogue – a dialogue that unfortunately is met with refusal on one side and apathy on the other.</p></fn>

Milner had a strong reputation for extravagant expression. He was Vicar Apostolic of the Central District of England from 1803 to 1821. The hierarchy also opposed the so-called ‘Catholic Committee’ established by Catholic laypeople (mostly peers and landed gentry as well as some clergy and legal practitioners) to work towards Catholic emancipation. This group was largely ‘Cisalpine’ in its ecclesiology, seeking a degree of autonomy from Roman intervention in order to combat the English belief that Catholics in fact served a foreign power (the Vatican) over and above the English throne. On the other hand, the ‘Committee’ claimed that its influence and its cisalpine stance was responsible for the legal shifts in the status of Catholics in England from 1778, when the first Catholic Relief Act was passed by the British Parliament.</p></fn>
