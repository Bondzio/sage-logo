<abstract>
<p>During 2012, the labour market continued to show considerable diversity in outcomes for different labour market groups. Employment growth was slower and the number of employees searching for full-time work rose alongside falling participation rates compared with the previous year. Overall, the employment situation for men was not looking as strong as for women, although women continued to exhibit higher levels of labour underutilisation. Earnings indicators suggest increased wages in low-paid sectors, although this was coming off a low base and may be indicative of catch-up for slow growth in recent years. The relative value of the minimum wage is now at its lowest level in six years, suggesting some evidence of growing earnings inequality. Recent debates in the mass media about labour productivity and industrial relations regulation appear to have limited grounding in national accounting and labour market data.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0022185613480739" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>In this article, we review data on Australia's labour markets for 2012 and find that labour markets continued to show considerable diversity in outcome for different labour market groups. Drawing mainly on official employment and earnings statistics, we find that employment data show that growth was slower and the number of employees searching for full-time work rose alongside falling participation rates compared with the previous year. Earnings indicators suggest that there were increases in wages in low-paid sectors, although the relative value of the minimum wage is now at its lowest level in six years, suggesting some evidence of growing earnings inequality. We also consider recent debates in the mass media about concerns relating to labour productivity, which appear to have limited grounding in national accounting and labour market data.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0022185613480739"><title>Macroeconomic context 2012</title>
<p>The operation of Australian labour markets is embedded within the context of the demand for and supply of goods and services within the economy more generally. Selected macroeconomic indicators for 2012 (as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022185613480739">Table 1</xref>) suggest that specific areas of Australia's economic environment have changed considerably since 2011. Annual growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to June 2012 was considerably higher than at the same time in 2011, and areas of considerable upturn included motor vehicle sales and dwelling unit approvals. In contrast, business investment levels were relatively stable and retail turnover declined compared with 2011 levels. In addition to the indicators in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022185613480739">Table 1</xref>, it should be noted that until the final two weeks of 2012, the Commonwealth government maintained a public commitment to a budget surplus in 2013 and political considerations might be expected to constrain public expenditure for the foreseeable future. Further, the implications of international economic events remained difficult to predict. Subdued prices for Australia's export commodities, particularly falls in the prices of coking coal and iron ore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022185613480739">Reserve Bank of Australia, 2012a</xref>), together with continued uncertainty in European financial markets, have occurred alongside stabilising growth in the US and China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022185613480739">Reserve Bank of Australia, 2012b</xref>). The range of contrasting economic data was sufficient for the Reserve Bank to keep interest rates at 3.25% at the Board meeting in November 2012, despite widespread expectations that rates would be reduced in an effort to stimulate demand. By December 2012, it was felt that further easing in monetary policy was required and the cash rate was further reduced to 3.0%. The mixed outcomes evident in these key macroeconomic indicators are reflected in labour markets, with strongly contrasting outcomes for different industries and groups of employees.

<sec id="sec3-0022185613480739"><title>Employment outcomes – Australia 2012</title>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022185613480739">Table 2</xref>, across the labour force, aggregate employment statistics indicate a growth in full-time employment, steady rates of part-time employment and a decline of 0.6% in the participation rate. However, disaggregated estimates show contrasting changes in labour force status for males and females. Growth in male full-time employment of 0.6% is only half the rate of growth in female full-time employment at 1.2%, and the relatively small number of males in part-time employment declined while the number of female part-timers continued to grow. Thus, the number of males looking for full-time work increased by just over 10% in the year to October 2012, compared with an increase in the number of females of 1.2%. This was despite a relatively higher drop in the participation rate among males. These overall patterns of employment occurred despite some shifts away from female and part-time employment in specific industries, noted later with reference to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022185613480739">Table 4</xref>.

<p>National rates of unemployment of 5.4% for males and 5.3% for females conceal large differences in unemployment rates within specific states. These range from a low of 3.9% for males in Western Australia to a high of 6.8% for males and females in Tasmania (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022185613480739">Table 3</xref>). Female unemployment rates compare favourably with male rates in the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales and South Australia, while male unemployment is relatively lower in Western Australia and, to a lesser extent, in Victoria and the Northern Territory. Perhaps surprisingly, the resource-rich state of Queensland has relatively high rates of overall unemployment and comparable rates of unemployment among males and females.

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022185613480739">Table 4</xref> shows the number of males and females employed in major industry divisions at August 2012 and the shift between full-time and part-time employment for males and females within each industry since August 2011. It provides some insights into the relatively subdued rates of growth in male full-time employment noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022185613480739">Table 2</xref>. While the Mining industry had an increase of almost 20% in the size of its largely male workforce, its relatively small total employment numbers mean that this failed to translate into large favourable employment outcomes for the workforce generally. Similarly, an employment growth rate of almost 15% in the Information, media and telecommunications industry failed to translate into major employment gains at an aggregate level. In contrast, declining overall employment occurred in industries that employ large numbers of full-time males, including Construction and Transport, postal and warehousing. These industries also experienced a shift away from female part-time employment. The decline in construction employment occurred despite strong growth in dwelling approvals, and indicates a decline in non-residential construction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022185613480739">Reserve Bank of Australia, 2012b</xref>). There were also disproportionate reductions in male full-time employment in Wholesale trade, Professional, scientific and technical services and Other services. In contrast, while Public administration and safety also experienced a relatively large decline in employment numbers of almost 6.6%, this occurred alongside a shift towards male full-time employment in the industry. In a context of predicted further constraints on public expenditure, this may signal a future decline in part-time employment, especially among females.</p>
<p>The loss of male full-time employment in specific industries is consistent with Australian and international literature suggesting that men have disproportionately borne reduced employment opportunities following the global financial crisis (GFC) in 2008, sometimes referred to as a ‘mancession’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022185613480739">Hoynes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022185613480739">Moskos, 2012</xref>). Internationally, however, the immediate adverse effects on male employment seem to now be flowing on to specific feminised areas of employment that are particularly affected by reductions in public expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022185613480739">Elson, 2012</xref>). The Australian data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022185613480739">Table 4</xref> can be read as supporting both sets of analyses. There are clear areas of relatively large reductions in male full-time employment and others of reductions in female full-time and part-time employment.</p>
<p>Labour underutilisation refers to the extent to which available labour is underutilised through either unemployment or underemployment (willing and available to work additional hours) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022185613480739">Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), 2012h</xref>). The estimates in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0022185613480739">Table 5</xref> are based on the percentage of males and females in the labour force who wish to work more hours. Labour underutilisation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0022185613480739">Table 5</xref>) remains at relatively high levels, and still exceeds pre-GFC rates. Underutilisation among females has been hovering just below 15% since 2009 and exists alongside comparatively stable estimates for the average hours worked by female part-timers. The favourable indicators of labour force status for females noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022185613480739">Table 1</xref> appear to be coupled with relatively high levels of labour underutilisation among the large proportion of the labour force that is female and employed part-time. This contributes to an ongoing pattern of female labour force participants being underutilised rather than officially unemployed.

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0022185613480739">Table 6</xref> shows the change in average weekly ordinary time earnings (AWOTE) and average weekly total earnings (AWTE) for full-time employees by industry between May 2011 and May 2012.

As before, there may be compositional effects here, particularly if recent job losses in Public administration and safety (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022185613480739">Table 4</xref>) have been concentrated among skilled males and females.</p>
<p>Recent wage movements have not greatly affected the aggregate earnings relativities of men and women in the private and public sectors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0022185613480739">Table 7</xref>).

<p>An alternative indicator for understanding movements in the cost of labour is the Wage Price Index (WPI), which is constructed from a representative sample of employee jobs (as opposed to workers) within a sample of employing organisations. It is designed to be a ‘pure’ measure of labour cost changes; that is, unaffected by changes in the composition of the workforce, hours worked or characteristics of employees. The WPI focuses on hourly rates of pay but excludes various on-costs. Changes in the WPI indicate changes in wages rather than variations in more general labour costs.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0022185613480739">Table 8</xref> shows changes in the WPI between September 2011 and September 2012. Data for June 2011 to June 2012 are also reported, thus allowing a degree of comparison with the May wage data presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0022185613480739">Table 6</xref>. The overall annual earnings growth is equal to 4.0%. Slowest growth occurred in Retail trade (2.5%) and Accommodation and food services (3.1%). Industries with above-average WPI for the year to September 2012 include Mining, Wholesale trade, Professional, scientific and technical services and Public administration and safety. With the exception of Mining, these three other industries also experienced above industry average quarterly wage growth. Two other industries also experiencing above industry average quarterly wage growth between June and September 2012 were Health care and social assistance and Accommodation and food services. The observed wage movements in the Health care and social assistance sector are relatively difficult to reconcile with the changes in AWOTE and AWTE reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0022185613480739">Table 6</xref>. In Health care and social assistance, for example, male AWTE fell by 0.3% between May 2011 and May 2012. Among women, the deterioration in earnings was even greater, equal to 2.1%. In contrast, in the Accommodation and food services industry, growth in male AWTE between May 2011 and May 2012 was equal to 0.8%, while for females, the corresponding growth was equal to 5.6%. In the case of the latter (Accommodation and food services), the growth in AWTE and WPI may reflect wage catch-up pressures. Men in this sector are paid 36% less than the all-industry male average, while females in this sector receive 24% less than the all-industry female average. In the Health care and social assistance industry, males are paid 10% more than the all-industry male average, while females are paid 8% less than the all-industry female average. The above-average movement in the Health care and social assistance industry WPI in the June to September quarter may reflect impact of the February 2012 Fair Work Australia (FWA) decision on the Social and Community Sector Equal Remuneration Case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022185613480739">FWA, 2012a</xref>). In that landmark and historic decision, the tribunal awarded significant wage increases to social and community service workers to be phased in from 1 December 2012 and to be fully phased in by 1 December 2018.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0022185613480739"><title>Minimum wages 2012</title>
<p>From 1 July 2012, FWA increased the minimum wage in modern awards by 2.9%, well below the average growth in earnings for the year. For adult employees who are not covered by an award or agreement, the adult national minimum wage is now AU$606.40 or AU$15.96 per hour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022185613480739">FWA, 2012b</xref>). In relative terms, this means that an adult employee on minimum wages earns 42.0% of the male AWOTE (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0022185613480739">Table 9</xref>). Since 2006, when the minimum wage–AWOTE relativity was equal to 47.2%, the relative value of the minimum wage has declined and is now at its lowest level in recent decades. This provides further suggestion of markedly varied outcomes for different labour market groups.

<sec id="sec7-0022185613480739"><title>Labour markets, industrial relations and ‘the productivity debate’</title>
<p>Total national and industry productivity are, by definition, related to factors outside of the production per unit of labour input. When labour productivity is considered independently of other inputs, particularly capital, it is only partly affected by specific regulatory frameworks relevant to labour market operations and conditions of employment. Despite this, there has been significant public discussion of links between the Fair Work Act 2009 and subdued national productivity levels in Australia (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022185613480739">Sloan, 2012</xref>). We have included the following discussion with the goal of clarifying specific elements of the debate and evaluating whether changes in productivity are linked with Commonwealth legislation relevant to employment and working conditions.</p>
<p>Increasing a nation's overall productivity has long been regarded as the only reliable means of ensuring long-term increases in the standard of living (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022185613480739">Zheng, 2005</xref>: 2). However, despite Australia's relatively strong economy and record-high standard of living, Australia's measured national productivity has declined since 2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022185613480739">ABS, 2012k</xref>). One school of thought places the blame on the introduction of provisions under the Fair Work Act 2009, and claims that the legislation is associated with a lack of labour market flexibility that contributes to lower productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022185613480739">Bradley, 2011</xref>; Sloan, 2012; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022185613480739">Westacott, 2011</xref>). Others argue that falling productivity rates can be attributed to wider trends and developments in the economy, such as the need for innovation and decline in capital productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022185613480739">Productivity Commission of Australia, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>On 20 December 2011, the Workplace Relations Minister, Bill Shorten, announced a review of the Fair Work Act 2009 – a move welcomed by many business leaders and organisations, including Jennifer Westacott, the Chief Executive of the Business Council of Australia (BCA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022185613480739">Westacott, 2011</xref>). The BCA's position had been outlined a month prior to the review of the Fair Work Act, in an article in <italic>The Australian</italic>, entitled ‘Four ways in which the Fair Work Act is reducing productivity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022185613480739">Bradley, 2011</xref>). There has since been an ongoing debate linking relatively lower productivity estimates with the Fair Work Act 2009.</p>
<p>The assumed link between deregulated labour markets and the optimal allocation of resources within an economy is a major area of theoretical and policy debate, and there have been authoritative analyses produced elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022185613480739">Borland, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022185613480739">Hancock, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022185613480739">Peetz, 2012</xref>). There is little scope to canvas the issues in this short review of Australian labour markets in 2012. We point out, however, that even the most orthodox of introductory economics texts will remark that many markets can and do operate in a less than optimal manner and some forms of regulation may be required to achieve efficient and/or equitable outcomes (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022185613480739">McTaggart et al., 2010</xref>). When additional factors such as labour market institutions and relative negotiating power are taken into account, the need for some regulatory regime becomes even more apparent. Another implicit assumption in recent discussions about productivity, that WorkChoices 2006 represented labour market deregulation, is demonstrably not the case. While the WorkChoices legislation may have encouraged a decentralised approach to the negotiation of employment conditions, it also represented a detailed and comprehensive approach to regulating the actions of those involved in Australia's labour markets. The legislation may have facilitated decentralisation, but it was not a move towards deregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185613480739">Dabscheck, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Regardless of the implicit assumptions contained in the BCA's arguments and ongoing media commentary, the assertion remains that Australia's recent decline in productivity is linked to recent changes in the Commonwealth's legislative framework as it applies to regulating labour markets and conditions of employment. This argument largely neglects the nuances and challenges of estimating productivity and its contributory causes. The ABS has defined productivity and noted the difficulty of its measurement in the following terms:<disp-quote>
<p>the measurement of productivity is not straightforward. There are various complex issues involved in the measurement of output, input and other components used for deriving the MFP [multifactor productivity] estimates. In fact, the reliability of an aggregate MFP measure for the whole economy is determined by how well the aggregate output, capital and labour, and factor incomes are measured; these aggregates in turn depend on almost every aspect of the national accounts. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022185613480739">Zheng, 2005</xref>: 5)</p></disp-quote>The ABS produces estimates of MFP, capital productivity and labour productivity for Australia. In producing partial estimates of productivity for labour and capital, it notes that each measure includes effects from other factors. That is, the productivity of labour is not entirely separable from that of capital and other factors affecting production. Similarly, the productivity of capital is not entirely separable from that of labour and other factors.</p>
<p>Despite measurement challenges, the importance of links between productivity and improvement in living standards provides an imperative for measuring changes in productivity on an ongoing basis. Official estimates of Australia's labour, capital and MFP are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-0022185613480739">Table 10</xref>.

<p>Given the challenges of separating labour and capital productivity, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-0022185613480739">Table 10</xref>. However, it is possible to make some broad observations. First, the changes in labour productivity following the introduction of the WorkChoices 2006 legislation appear to be minor and smaller than the labour productivity estimates following the introduction of the Fair Work Act 2009. Second, the major shifts in productivity appear to be linked with variations in capital productivity, which has declined rapidly over the past decade. This partial productivity measure suggests that there are important factors unrelated to workplace legislation that are affecting the relationship between factor inputs and aggregate output in the Australian economy.</p>
<p>It is important to note, however, that yearly changes in MFP estimates are rarely viewed as definitive accounts of changes in the productivity of an economy. This is due to effects from temporary influences and the inclusion of underutilised inputs as measured inputs in the development of productivity estimates. Productivity is generally examined in cycles, with the ABS identifying the last complete productivity cycle being from 2003/2004 to 2007/2008. During this period, there was an annual decline in MFP of 0.3% per annum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022185613480739">Productivity Commission of Australia, 2011</xref>: 51; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022185613480739">Taylor et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Possible reasons underlying recent trends in capital productivity have been explored by Australia's Productivity Commission and are readily available in its annual report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022185613480739">Productivity Commission of Australia, 2011</xref>). The Commission estimated MFP in the market sector industries of Australia and identified three industries that had a disproportionately large effect on aggregate productivity estimates: Agriculture, forestry and fishing, Mining, and Electricity, gas, water and waste services (EGWW). It was noted that if these three industries were omitted from productivity estimates, then the remainder of the market sector had productivity growth of 0.5% per annum during the last productivity cycle. It was also noted that the three industries of Agriculture, forestry and fishing, Mining, and EGWW had particular characteristics affecting their productivity during this period. Agriculture, forestry and fishing had faced an extended period of drought, which had depressed output. EGWW had been through a period of substantial capital expansion coupled with low value-added growth. Mining had also been through a period of substantial capital investment that had not yet resulted in proportional increases in production due to the long lead terms of the capital development projects. Additionally, Mining is also affected by ‘yield depletion’, which means that during periods of high commodity prices, it becomes viable to bring once-marginal sites into production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022185613480739">Productivity Commission of Australia, 2011</xref>: 54–55).</p>
<p>The Productivity Commission's report also emphasises the need to consider industry-level estimates of productivity, and provides estimates of growth in MFP and the components used to develop the estimates – value added, labour and capital – for 12 market sectors in Australia for 2008/2009 and 2009/2010. The sector-based estimates demonstrate considerable variability between market industry sectors, suggesting that changes in productivity are not uniform and are unlikely to be attributable to one dominating effect across the economy.</p>
<p>Few studies have found that the removal of labour regulations has entirely positive outcomes on productivity or other labour market outcomes. Various studies have indicated that regulatory change associated with reduced job security is linked with a sharp decline in creative problem-solving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022185613480739">Probst et al., 2007</xref>); adverse implications for employee performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022185613480739">Reisel et al., 2007</xref>); downward pressure on wages; falling standards of living; and the breakdown of family cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022185613480739">Pocock et al., 2008</xref>). In short, extensive decentralisation of the labour market can have unintended negative consequences.</p>
<p>Finally, a focus on labour market regulation deflects attention from other important sources of potential productivity gains, such as technological and procedural innovation. A 2011 joint report by the ABS and the Productivity Commission identified a link between innovation (both in terms of goods and services, and operational processes) and productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022185613480739">Soames et al., 2011</xref>). Perhaps it can be concluded that ongoing improvements in productivity require nuanced approaches to innovation with local application to specific contexts.</p>
<p>The measurement of productivity is a complex and long-term project. The suggestion that major reforms to labour market regulation are required to address productivity concerns appears to lack substantial evidential underpinnings. In fact, proponents of changes to labour market regulations appear keen to dodge such an evidentiary burden: ‘The review must also not be limited by <italic>any arbitrary threshold of evidence that companies are having difficulties</italic> before it is accepted there are problems with the Act that need to be looked at’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022185613480739">Westacott, 2011</xref>, emphasis added).</p>
<p>Westacott seems to be asserting that reform should proceed unfettered, without any evidence that employment regulations are causally linked with current productivity levels. However, existing analysis suggests that there are a number of contributory causes to Australia's productivity slump that are not directly related to the labour market. There is little evidence that it is specifically related to industrial relations legislation.</p>

<sec id="sec8-0022185613480739" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In our review of 2011 labour markets, we noted that uncertainties in both international and domestic economic contexts had contributed to diverse outcomes across Australia's labour markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022185613480739">Jefferson and Preston, 2012</xref>). This is a situation that continued throughout 2012. Once again, full-time employment for men appears to be declining as a result of shifts towards part-time employment in Wholesale trade and Other services and continued declines in the Construction and Transport, postal and warehousing workforces. Despite less than favourable employment outcomes, however, there was relatively strong average earnings growth in Construction and for males in Transport, postal and warehousing. Despite women's relatively stable employment levels, labour underutilisation continues to be high and gender pay gaps remain persistent. The diverse outcomes, coupled with declining relativity between the federal minimum wage and male average earnings, suggest a context of diverging outcomes for labour force participants both across the economy and within particular industries. Arguments that Australia's mixed economic fortunes are directly related to the current labour market regulatory framework appear tenuous. We suggest that the diverse outcomes evident in Australia's labour market reflect complex causal factors related to the effects on different industries of exposure to international influences, such as the value of Australia's currency and uneven demand for goods and services across the domestic economy.</p>
