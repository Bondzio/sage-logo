<p>Dear Editor</p>
<p>We read with interest the letter of Szczesniak et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2047487313485514">1</xref></sup> regarding our recently published meta-analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2047487313485514">2</xref></sup> Szczesniak et al. raised concerns about our analysis, criticizing our methodology and our interpretation of results.</p>
<p>First of all, Szczesniak et al. claimed that one of the 10 studies of our analysis could have biased our results due to inadequate quality. However, the study of Xu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2047487313485514">3</xref></sup> was a prospective, parallel-controlled, multicentre trial, conducted at 12 large Chinese centres and monitored by the Center for Cardiovascular Disease Control and Prevention of the Chinese Ministry of Health. Endpoint definitions appeared fully comparable with those in the other studies included and, in particular, stent thrombosis was correctly defined according to the Academic Research Consortium definition.</p>
<p>Moreover, Szczesniak et al. argued that we omitted to show funnel plots and that our mortality funnel plot, according to their ‘eyeball’ inspection, would have also been asymmetrical, suggesting publication bias. Szczesniak et al. should be aware that the amount of publishable data is not infinite. We included only a mortality funnel plot but we also clearly reported that funnel plots had been constructed for all the study endpoints, without evidence to suggest publication bias. Moreover, we clearly underscored that Egger’s test, an operator-independent statistical method to assess the asymmetry of funnel plots, was also applied to each endpoint, again without evidence of publication bias.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Szczesniak et al. found difficult to reconcile our findings about late stent thrombosis with the long-term results of the LEADERS trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2047487313485514">4</xref></sup> and the results of other recently published meta-analyses. Szczesniak et al. should be aware that late stent thrombosis was only a secondary endpoint of the LEADERS trial and that LEADERS was clearly underpowered to draw definitive indications about late stent thrombosis. Emerging differences in such secondary endpoints with years of follow up, when the attrition bias become noteworthy, should be considered with the necessary caution as hypothesis-generating stimuli rather than compelling evidences. Furthermore, as clearly specified in our study, a post-hoc analysis including the 4-year follow up of LEADERS produced similar results to the main analysis.</p>
<p>The different results of our meta-analysis in comparison with the previously published ones is mainly explained by different selection criteria. Previous meta-analyses pooled together different types of biodegradable polymer drug-eluting stent (BP-DES) with very different technologies and included studies using prototype stents eluting paclitaxel from reservoirs in the stent struts sealed by a bioabsorbable polymer. These stents never reached a clinical use because they exhibited unacceptable late lumen loss and target lesion revascularization rates. Inclusion of such studies potentially biased previous analyses, underrating the benefits of BP-DES in terms of target lesion revascularization and overestimating the stent thrombosis results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2047487313485514">5</xref></sup> Conversely our meta-analysis included only the widespread-used kind of BP-DES, with a continuous film of polylactic acid covering the stent struts, and excluded other elution technologies. These selection criteria helped us to reduce heterogeneity, leading to more prudent positions about late stent thrombosis outcomes.</p>
<p>Finally, Szczesniak et al. stated that our conclusions on late thrombosis are merely speculative, given the limited number of events reported in the included studies. As a matter of fact, in our paper we also concluded cautiously that we could not demonstrate clear benefits from BP-DES regarding late stent thrombosis rates and discussed this issue thoroughly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2047487313485514">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>In conclusion, we firmly believe that criticism about methodology or clinical meaningfulness of a meta-analysis should be based upon specific clinical knowledge of the topic, specific experience in the meta-analysis field, and, above all, careful reading of the criticized study. In the absence of these prerequisites, facets and nuances of a complex analyses can easily be missed or misunderstood. We would like to thank our Polish colleagues for their interest in our work and for the opportunity they gave us to disclose potential doubts about our paper.</p>
