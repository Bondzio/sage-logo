<p>The series in which this volume appears shows what is gained when biblical commentaries are written by those who are expert in the related field of theology. In this case the author is also learned not only in biblical studies but also (and primarily) in English literature. The resulting volume thus combines expert knowledge of the usual grist in the commentator’s mill with other helpful disciplines. As befits a contributor to the series, he knows well the exegetical and expository history of the interpretation of Luke. This area is not necessarily exclusively theological in the sense of doctrinal theology, nor is it purely historical, restricting its attention to past centuries (especially the patristic period, mediaeval exegesis, the Reformation period and some more modern writers (such as Spurgeon and Girard). The author also makes good use of contemporary commentators (although he has missed F. Bovon, surely the most helpful for <italic>Wirkungsgeschichte</italic>). The theological coverage is broad, with most attention paid to Ambrose, Augustine, Bede, Bonaventure, Calvin, Chrysostom, Cyril of Alexandria, Eusebius and Gregory the Great. But in addition to all this there is the bonus of Jeffrey’s specialty in literary studies. The outcome is a surprisingly comprehensive approach to the text which pays attention to matters of literary structure that are theologically relevant. The central concern is twofold: the theology of Luke as understood by later theologians and the influence of Luke on later theologians. The historical problems raised by modern commentators were largely not perceived or tackled in earlier centuries and accordingly they do not figure in this volume to any extent. There is not space for detailed discussions, but some tricky areas, such as the destination of the dying thief and of subsequent dying saints, get fuller attention. The hesitant purchaser or reader may find it helpful and encouraging to savour the brief Epilogue to get a taste of the author’s enthusiasm for this Gospel; and the scale of the book at some 300 pp. with scarcely any footnotes will appeal to the preacher who wants to get straight to the point of the biblical narratives on Saturday evening without getting bogged down in (for him or her) irrelevant technicalities.</p>
