<abstract>
<p>Over the course of a decade, the Joint Oxford-Field Museum Expedition to Kish recovered artifacts and skeletal remains from one of the most influential city-states in ancient Mesopotamia. We focus here on the process of commemoration of the dead as evidenced in the graves excavated from Kish’s ‘A Cemetery’. We use skeletal remains, fieldnotes, and artifactual evidence to situate these individuals within their biological and mortuary contexts and to explore elements of living, dying, and remembering at Kish. The repetitive actions involved in burying the dead in the ruins of a razed palace suggest the construction of social memory aimed at creating communal cohesion and reinforcing local norms. The details afforded each individual and their grave suggest that burials functioned both to engage a new political landscape and to create spaces in which the bereaved commemorated individual lives.</p>

<body>
<p>The grave is a space where communities commemorate the dead, and both those who buried the dead and the deceased themselves inform the style and substance of that commemoration. In the moment of memorialization, groups construct social identities that tie the dead to the living and to the memory of the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1469605312439972">Joyce, 2001</xref>: 12). Here we explore commemoration and representation at one Mesopotamian burial place. In doing so, we build on a foundation laid originally by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1469605312439972">Binford (1971)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1469605312439972">Saxe (1970)</xref> and expanded in ensuing decades. These perspectives on the moment of burial, its regularities, and its variability demonstrate the importance of considering the social context in mortuary archaeology. We explore these themes via an analysis of skeletal remains and mortuary assemblages at Kish’s ‘A Cemetery’. Kish was one of the most powerful political entities in Early Dynastic Mesopotamia until its incorporation into the Akkadian Empire between<italic> c</italic>. 2350 and 2150 BC. During this brief period of transition, some of the city’s inhabitants constructed new homes in which they ultimately buried their dead on what we know as the ‘A Cemetery’ or Mound A. The residents, however, knew this place as the burnt remains of an expansive palace. The people who lived and died during this time built their homes and conducted their mortuary rituals over these ruins, creating a social memory of tradition and cohesion despite disruption.</p>
<sec id="sec1-1469605312439972"><title>Commemorating the dead</title>
<disp-quote>
<p>… mortuary rituals provide a sensuous arena in which the dead are mourned, social memories are created and (re)asserted, social bonds are renewed, forged, or broken, and individuals make claims for individual identities and group memberships. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1469605312439972">Chesson, 2001a</xref>: 1)</p></disp-quote>
<p>In this article we focus on commemoration of the dead and the creation of social memory, defined as ‘the construction of a collective notion (not an individual belief) about the way things were in the past’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1469605312439972">Van Dyke and Alcock, 2003</xref>: 2). Commemorative ceremonies, of which the funeral rite is a pre-eminent example, combine general representations of a real or imagined community with the more specific memory of the individual. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1469605312439972">Meskell (2003: 36)</xref> elegantly writes, ‘What may superficially appear to reflect continuity and memorialization might instead represent a palimpsest of meanings’. While communities often seek to standardize the actions and behaviors for their treatment of the dead, the time surrounding burial is also a moment when the multiplicity of social identities expressed by an individual – gender, age, social roles, communities – are overlain on traditional, structured, and orderly disposal of the dead.</p>
<p>Social memory often finds expression in funerary practices. While this type of memory is neither permanent nor immutable, its construction during commemorative events reconstitutes the past. In his seminal work, <italic>How Societies Remember</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1469605312439972">Connerton (1989: 72–73)</xref> separates inscribed memory (monuments and representations) from incorporated memory (bodily practices). Critics have suggested that this is a false dichotomy (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1469605312439972">Hamilakis, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1469605312439972">Roddick and Hastorf, 2010</xref>), particularly given that bodily practices can have material outcomes and the gestures of the mortuary ritual may produce concrete memorials. Ultimately, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1469605312439972">Robb (2007: 293)</xref> argues, ‘Funerary ritual is first and foremost cultural action’ and as such can be manipulated and used to enforce social norms. Much as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1469605312439972">Connerton (1989: 45)</xref> characterizes the repetition that is part of commemorative ceremonies as an inherent form of recollection, we argue that the repetitive rites enacted for burial at Mound A following the Akkadian takeover contributed to the construction of social memory. The placement of these burials over the ruins of a palace of the old order not only highlights the importance of social memory at this time but also the possibility that mortuary ceremonies allowed for specific kinds of forgetting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1469605312439972">Hamilakis, 2010</xref>) and ultimately facilitated the creation of new social memories.</p>
<p>More than simply a political platform for negotiating memory, however, the grave is also a locus for the emotions of the mourners and society. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1469605312439972">Joyce (2001: 14)</xref>, in her powerful treatment of burial at the central Mexican site of Tlatilco, writes that
<disp-quote>
<p>We must consider not only regularities but also variation: the general practices whose conformity suggests intent by the living to bury in the manner of Tlatilco, as well as the distinctive actions that testify that each burial was itself an act of structuration through which social memory was formed and reformed.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>As such, the death of each individual also created an iterative space for memory construction. Among the many ways to analyze variability in the grave, we focus on it as a result of the actions of the living and the ideas they maintained about each individual as expressed through the funerary rites and the act of interment. In this way, burial can function in much the same way that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1469605312439972">Tarlow (2000: 218)</xref> argues the modern cemetery functions: as ‘an aesthetic and sentimental landscape of remembering’. By exploring variability in Mound A’s graves in relation to differences between the people themselves, as well as among the offerings and style of each tomb, we can better understand the use of mortuary practice to construct and reinforce social memory and the presentation of identity.</p>
<p>Exploring the act of burial as a commemorative ceremony that carries great significance for a community, we hope to understand the creation of social memory and social identities at Mound A. By focusing on regularities in burial we hope to make visible the construction of both inscribed memory – which can be seen in elements such as tomb structure, burial position, and acceptable contents – and incorporated memory, including the act of dressing the dead and, ultimately, of laying the body in the tomb. In addition, our focus on the grave’s details provides an opportunity to glimpse an individual’s life, multiple social identities, and memorialization. Our investigation of commemoration and memory at Mound A recontextualizes the ways the ancient people of Kish commemorated individual lives in the grave, and how doing so brought the community together following the Akkadian conquest.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1469605312439972"><title>The expedition and contemporary work on the collections</title>
<p>The archaeological site of Kish lies approximately 80 km south of modern Baghdad on the floodplain of the Euphrates River (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1469605312439972">Figure 1</xref>). Kish occupies 24 km<sup>2</sup>, divided into eastern and western portions by the ancient course of the Euphrates. Overall, the site includes 40 different mounds. The Ingharra series (Mounds D and E) dominates the eastern complex while the Ziggurat of Uhaimir (Mounds Z, T, and X) marks the city’s western remains. In 1921, Stephen Langdon of the University of Oxford began conversations with Berthold Laufer of Chicago’s Field Museum of Natural History about excavating in the Near East (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1469605312439972">Pestle et al., 2006</xref>). This dialogue produced the Joint Oxford-Field Museum Expedition to Kish (JOFME). Under permit from the British Mandate, the JOFME excavated on 17 mounds over the course of a decade in enormous and occasionally haphazard excavations. The excavation uncovered evidence of nearly 5000 years of occupation, including substantial palaces and ziggurats from the Early Dynastic Period, a large Neo-Babylonian temple, and over 700 burials from the Early Dynastic through Achaemenid periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1469605312439972">Buxton, 1924</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1469605312439972">Buxton and Rice, 1931</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1469605312439972">Field, 1946</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1469605312439972">Langdon, 1924</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1469605312439972">Mackay, 1925</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1469605312439972">1929</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1469605312439972">1931</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1469605312439972">Watelin, 1930</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1469605312439972">1934</xref>).

<p>The generally poor quality of excavation and the early deaths of the excavation’s directors left behind only patchy interim reports, although a second generation of Kish scholars made great advances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1469605312439972">Algaze, 1983–4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469605312439972">Gibson, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1469605312439972">Lloyd, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1469605312439972">Moorey, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1469605312439972">Rathbun, 1975</xref>). In the ensuing decades, information was lost and the then standard policy of distributing artifacts between participating institutions complicated further study. Project rules dictated the Iraq Museum receive half of the artifacts and all one-of-a-kind pieces while the excavating institutions divided the remainder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1469605312439972">Pestle et al., 2006</xref>). Given the predilections of the academic staffs, this did not play out as planned. Of relevance here, nearly all of the skeletal remains retained by the JOFME were sent to the Field Museum. Unfortunately, documentation, as with many other elements of the expedition, was not of the highest quality and over the years many of the material remains became decontextualized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1469605312439972">Lloyd, 1969</xref>: 48).</p>
<p>Since 2005 we have formed part of a large team working towards recontextualization of Kish’s material remains, employing field notes, archival records, and museum catalogues from the Ashmolean and Field Museums. In the Kish Osteology Project, we have employed a contextualized bioarchaeological approach (<italic>sensu </italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1469605312439972">Buikstra, 1977</xref>) that considers the grave and the people themselves as a means of exploring the history of the city and its people. Here, we focus on one burial place that was in use for little more than a century to explore the commemoration of the dead and the construction of social memory.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1469605312439972"><title>Kish in the late 3rd and early 2nd millennia BC</title>
<p>Kish developed into a large city-state during the Jemdet Nasr Period (3200–2900 BC) and ultimately gained significant political standing during the subsequent Early Dynastic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1469605312439972">Postgate, 1992</xref>: 24–28). During the Early Dynastic III Period (EDIII), the kings of Mesopotamian city-states competed for control of fertile lands and trade routes close to Kish, especially along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1469605312439972">Van de Mieroop, 2004</xref>). Gaining the upper hand, the King of Kish gradually led the city to power over neighboring polities, and ultimately the entire region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1469605312439972">Postgate, 1992</xref>: 22). This dominance proved short lived, however, as after Lugalzagesi’s conquest of the city and Sargon’s restoration thereof (EDIII/Akkadian Period, 2350–2150 BC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1469605312439972">Cooper, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1469605312439972">Sinopoli, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1469605312439972">Yoffee, 1995</xref>), the capital of the nascent Akkadian Empire shifted to Agade/Akkad. Kish, however, continued to occupy a favored position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1469605312439972">Weiss, 1975</xref>).</p>
<p>Kish’s inhabitants in the late 3rd and early 2nd millennia lived in a period of pronounced and significant change for the site and the region’s political, ethnic, and social constitution. Nevertheless, a general theme of cultural continuity harkening back to the earlier portion of the Early Dynastic seems to have prevailed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1469605312439972">Nissen, 1993</xref>). As we explore elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1469605312439972">Pestle et al., in press a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1469605312439972">in press b</xref>), mortuary practice at Kish’s various mounds (particularly in the diachronic swath represented by the Ingharra burials) is constant, although subtle stylistic variation in grave goods appears over time (variation that is swamped by substantive differences in grave wealth). Burial practice throughout the region was similarly standardized and long standing as exemplified by sites like Abu Salabikh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1469605312439972">Postgate, 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1469605312439972">1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1469605312439972">Postgate and Moorey, 1976</xref>), Fara (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1469605312439972">Heinrich, 1931</xref>), Khafajah (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1469605312439972">Delougaz et al., 1967</xref>), and even at Ur if the Royal Tombs are set aside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1469605312439972">Moorey, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1469605312439972">Woolley, 1934</xref>).</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1469605312439972">Pollock (1999: 215)</xref> notes, ‘burial participates in the construction of a pan-Mesopotamian tradition of common mortuary customs through similarities in body treatment, placement, and many kinds of grave goods’. Throughout the region, intra-mural burial and inhumation dominate, grave shafts without notable surface embellishment are most common, coffins are absent until centuries, if not millennia, later, and while some children were buried in ceramic vessels, wrappings of cloth or matting were usually the only barrier between the body and the earth. Moreover, the body’s orientation could vary widely, although positioning the hands as if bringing a cup (often present) to the face was commonplace. Finally, while some individuals were buried without embellishment, most adults had grave goods (admittedly with wild variation).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1469605312439972"><title>The ‘A Cemetery’</title>
<p>The low tell known as Mound A is in eastern Kish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1469605312439972">Figure 2</xref>). Over three years of work, the JOFME excavated 154 graves from A, the largest number of graves recovered from any portion of the site save Ingharra. Ernst Mackay conducted the Mound A excavations, and his diligence produced detailed contextual data for most of its graves. While scholars have debated the chronology of Mound A’s burials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469605312439972">Gibson, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1469605312439972">Hrouda and Karstens, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1469605312439972">Moorey, 1970</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1469605312439972">1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1469605312439972">Whelan, 1978</xref>), consensus holds that, excepting a few late burials (A0, A41, A44, A111, and A114), the remaining 150 graves are from a brief period of time. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1469605312439972">Moorey (1970</xref>: 104, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1469605312439972">1978</xref>: 74) cogently argued that they represent the time when Kish was being consolidated by Akkadian forces during the late EDIII or early Akkadian Period (2350–2150 BC). All together, these 150 EDIII/Akkadian Period graves, the ‘A Cemetery’, appear to have contained the remains of 162 individuals.
<fig id="fig2-1469605312439972" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Kish site map (image courtesy Field Museum).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1469605312439972-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Our analysis of individuals and their mortuary context is based on the notes, annotated field cards and publications left by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1469605312439972">Mackay (1925</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1469605312439972">1929</xref>), together with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1469605312439972">Moorey’s (1970</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1469605312439972">1978)</xref> recontextualization of the dispersed material. In addition, we employ bioarchaeological data from our recent reanalysis of the extant skeletal material from Kish. Of the 150 EDIII/Akkadian graves excavated from Mound A, we were able to associate the skeletal remains of 63 individuals with their burial place.</p>
<p>The graves at Mound A were dug down from the floors of buildings or houses overlaying the remnants of a structure known as the ‘A Palace’. This palace, which featured elegant friezes depicting offerings and captives being borne to the city’s king, was built early in EDIII, at the height of Kish’s political dominance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1469605312439972">Figure 3</xref>). It was twice expanded and ultimately destroyed later in that same period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469605312439972">Gibson, 1972</xref>: 79–80; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1469605312439972">Mackay, 1929</xref>: 76; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1469605312439972">Moorey, 1970</xref>: 64–65). Following its destruction (perhaps by the forces of Sargon during their conquest of the city late in EDIIIb), Mound A became a residential sector and burial place, as residents built modest houses made largely from bricks scavenged from the razed palace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1469605312439972">Moorey, 1970</xref>: 92). The ‘A Cemetery’ burials were made from within these homes, demonstrated by their orientation parallel to house walls. The lack of superposition of walls over grave cuts indicates their contemporaneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1469605312439972">Mackay, 1925</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1469605312439972">Moorey, 1970</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1469605312439972">1978</xref>).

<p>The intra-mural or residential placement of Mound A burials is similar to contemporary examples found at Khafajah (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1469605312439972">Delougaz et al., 1967</xref>), Abu Salabikh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1469605312439972">Postgate, 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1469605312439972">1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1469605312439972">Postgate and Moorey, 1976</xref>), and in the Early House Stratum at Ingharra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1469605312439972">Algaze, 1983–4</xref>). Although failing to conform to modern norms defining cemeteries as removed places used exclusively for disposing of the dead, the ‘A Cemetery’s’ residential burials, made in such close proximity to living spaces, would have served to extend and strengthen ties between the living and the dead. They likely further increased the socio-political potency of mortuary practice and commemoration in the creation of social memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1469605312439972">Adams and King, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1469605312439972">Brück, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1469605312439972">McAnany, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>As mentioned above, these residential burials were not, however, dug in virgin soil, but instead intruded upon the recently razed ‘A Palace’. It is unlikely that this was happenstance, especially when one considers the short time that elapsed between the palace’s destruction and the new constructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1469605312439972">Moorey, 1978</xref>). The choice to live and die atop the ruins of the ‘A Palace’ was most likely a conscious one, and one that had no small amount of symbolic intent. Depending on who lived in the homes of Mound A (Sumerians of Lugalzagesi’s conquering army? Akkadians in the retinue of Sargon? Nonpartisans of Kish?), the act of living and dying in that place was intended to shape and send a message. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1469605312439972">Brück (2004: 310)</xref> writes, ‘The careful placement of burials allowed links with the ancestral dead to be constructed, creating historical narratives that depended on the drawing of contrasts and comparisons between the newly deceased and previous interments.’ As such, Mound A is an ideal space to explore social memory construction. Despite significant biological difference between individuals in the earliest and latest graves from Mound A, explored more fully elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1469605312439972">Pestle et al., in press a</xref>), the overall cultural/mortuary homogeneity of the burials appears to have been intended to foster a common social memory.</p>

<sec id="sec6-1469605312439972"><title>Death and memorialization at Kish</title>
<p>We argue that the people of Kish during the EDIII/Akkadian Period connected burial at Mound A to the memorialization of individuals and their social ties as well as to the construction of collective social memory. Both the burial ground as a whole and the individual graves served as sites where the living commemorated the dead in the fashion appropriate to their place and time. Moreover, the tomb functioned as a space wherein varied social identities could be displayed and each person could be memorialized. Together, those who carried out the burial could construct a social memory – an idea of what it meant to be a citizen of Kish.</p>
<p>While it has been argued that regularity in burial customs erases the variability sought after in mortuary analyses, it does provide some perspective on collective social memory. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1469605312439972">Scott (2011: 75)</xref> writes, ‘For the living, these shared practices constituted one of the ways in which they created and maintained their local community’. Sumerian texts similarly suggest that interment rites included a set series of events and fostered a collective manner of burial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1469605312439972">Katz, 2007</xref>). There is a startling homogeneity to the Mound A burials in grave structure, body placement, and the mortuary assemblage that we contend likely reflects the <italic>intentional</italic> construction of group social memory. The way of burial seen in Mound A may also stand as evidence for ‘collective experiences that conferred communal, emblematic social memories to the participants’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1469605312439972">Roddick and Hastorf, 2010</xref>: 172).</p>
<p>Typical burials in Mound A contained single individuals placed directly into a plain rectangular grave cut with a suite of goods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1469605312439972">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1469605312439972">Mackay, 1925</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1469605312439972">1929</xref>). Children, men and women were interred in this fashion and demographic variables did not generally affect the layout and nature of burial. Eighteen of the graves contained children, including one infant. With the notable exception of the infant (A36) discussed below, individuals were most commonly placed on their side in a semi-flexed position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1469605312439972">Mackay, 1925</xref>). It appears that neither the orientation nor the side on which a body was placed followed any type of rigid rules. These broad patterns suggest loose yet noticeable site-wide norms for burial in Mound A, reflecting the structure of the Kish burial rite.
<fig id="fig4-1469605312439972" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Grave A19, Mound A. Note individual lying on their left side in a semi-flexed position with grave goods distributed around the body (Negative number 52797, image courtesy Field Museum).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1469605312439972-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Field records and other data also suggest that the mortuary assemblages had some community-wide patterning (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1469605312439972">Table 1</xref>). Some of the A graves had been disturbed prior to their excavation, yet evidence suggests that, in general, the grave good assemblage was substantial in both number and quality. A standard element in the mortuary assemblage, pottery accompanied over 90 percent of burials. This pattern holds for other sites in the ancient Near East including Abu Salabikh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1469605312439972">Postgate, 1980</xref>), Ur and Khafajah (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1469605312439972">Pollock, 1999</xref>), and Umm el-Marra where ‘scores of vessels’ adorned all undisturbed graves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1469605312439972">Schwartz, 2007</xref>: 49). At Mound A, ceramic vessels often surrounded the individual in the grave, although they varied in shape and number (A106, for example, was interred with 21 pots). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1469605312439972">Katz (2007: 172)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1469605312439972">Schwartz (2007: 49)</xref> argue, it was important in ancient Mesopotamia to provide for the deceased in the afterlife and offer gifts for the deities. The proliferation of ceramic vessels may therefore reflect mourners, ceremonies, and rituals surrounding burial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1469605312439972">Pollock, 1999</xref>: 211). While pottery proved most ubiquitous, people were frequently interred with items of personal adornment and goods that communicated individual characteristics. Most graves included beads, pins, pigment shells, jewelry, and weapons or tools. More broadly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1469605312439972">Brück (2004)</xref> suggests the possibility that instead of being direct representations of the deceased, such items may be gifts from mourners or reflect a mode of dress that was specific to the act of burial.

<p>This brief perusal indicates the presence of a somewhat normative canon of interment practices and grave provisioning that speaks to the construction of social memory, a particularly notable phenomenon in this period of cultural change. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1469605312439972">Pollock (2007: 213)</xref> argues that there was ‘an underlying “standard” Early Dynastic interment ritual’, albeit stronger earlier in the period, which may also be evident at Mound A. The burial patterns found across the Mound reflect a normalizing element, a manner in which all members of the community represented their group membership and perhaps crafted a communal social memory. Funeral rituals involving similar actions bring to the fore the ways that the recreation of an event can be used to craft social memory, which in turn can highlight or obscure elements of a common past. The construction of a social memory through commemorative ceremonies emphasizing cohesion and prosperity is interesting given that the Akkadian takeover probably created a fraught cultural climate. Burial practices recalled the earlier Early Dynastic and underscored cultural continuity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1469605312439972">Nissen, 1993</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1469605312439972">Connerton (1989: 6)</xref> stresses that ‘All beginnings contain an element of recollection’. A similar idea may have played out as the people of Kish attempted to begin again and may have sought to maintain long-standing traditions of burial instead of representing a new era. The repeated actions of carving a grave along the walls of Mound A’s homes and placing the deceased and an array of goods into this while enacting necessary rites functioned as commemorative ceremonies. It is worth noting that these same actions may have served as a means of forgetting and creating what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1469605312439972">Hamilakis (2010: 196)</xref> calls ‘a positively valued negative space’ that would ‘allow new remembering to be generated’. Burials are a way to stress the social memory of the group, and perhaps in the case of Mound A, where the dead were placed in palace ruins, of forgetting conflict, conquest, and the complexities of imperial control.</p>
<p>The same kind of mortuary regularity (if not the same elements) holds true for other sites in the ancient Near East and eastern Mediterranean (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1469605312439972">Katz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1469605312439972">Schwartz, 2007</xref>). For example, Sumerian texts describe consistency in the different elements of burial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1469605312439972">Katz, 2007</xref>: 169). Bab edh-Dhra, Jordan, shows evidence of ‘a particular set of standards in their mortuary rites, forging a sense of similarity between people in this region, as well as nurturing a sense of tradition in the treatment of their dead’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469605312439972">Chesson, 2001b</xref>: 110). Unlike the rigid patterns documented in Christian burials (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1469605312439972">Scott, 2011</xref>), these regularities are not overwhelming, in that a high degree of variability is woven into normative burial. Burial at Mound A, while serving as a locus for the construction of social memory, was not, as we argue below, the result of an unyielding structure that obliterated individual variation. The overlapping forces at play in each interment at Mound A commemorated the multiple group and individual identities that intersected in each person.</p>
<sec id="sec7-1469605312439972"><title>Memorializing the dead</title>
<p>While the preceding discussion gives some idea of how Kish’s people were generally treated in death, larger patterns that serve to represent a collective manner of remembering and commemorating the dead did not obscure the more varied qualities of interment. The variability in graves, which perhaps served as a way to memorialize the dead as distinct individuals and as members of particular social groups internal to Kish society, allows us to see a different set of details and finer representations of social identities than those seen in the overall burial space. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1469605312439972">Joyce (2001: 13)</xref> notes that ‘traditional archaeological practice treats the particularity of burials as noise to be filtered out in pursuit of regularities’; however, it is precisely these particularities that may reflect an individual’s life. While archaeologists working in the ancient Near East have occasionally focused on individual variation (e.g. the Royal Cemetery at Ur), in the main, examination of mortuary behaviors is generally focused on canons rather than group or individual-level variation. We argue that individuals buried at Mound A retained significant markers of the multiple identities they bore in life in addition to being buried in ways that marked their membership in an archaeologically visible community. Here we explore some of the different identities represented and the varied ways such identities were or were not commemorated in the grave, by considering burial over the lifecourse, sex differences, social standing, and differential access to valuable resources. In each of these areas we take care to describe individual burials to demonstrate the construction of social memory, presentation of distinct social identities, and particular elements of the grave that stand out as unique.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1469605312439972"><title>Burial over the lifecourse</title>
<p>While physical characteristics change over the course of one’s life, some shifts in physical form are accompanied by shifts in social identity. Consequently, we consider first the notion of childhood as seen in the burials of the young (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1469605312439972">Figure 5</xref>). The JOFME uncovered the remains of 18 juveniles at A.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1469605312439972">1</xref></sup> It is unclear if these were the only children interred here, or if skeletal fragility resulted in the erasure of others from the archaeological record. While an underrepresentation of those who died before adulthood, these children’s graves provide us with a glimpse of funerary treatment of the young at Kish.
<fig id="fig5-1469605312439972" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Excavation photograph of infant in an urn from Kish, unknown mound (Negative number 58503<italic>, </italic>image courtesy Field Museum).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1469605312439972-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469605312439972">Gibson (1972)</xref> refers to one individual, A36, as an infant in an urn. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1469605312439972">Mackay (1929: 129)</xref> writes that burials A147–A154 were also infants in pottery; however, no skeletal elements remain to confirm this. The nine other juveniles from the mound appear to have been older children or adolescents, something we successfully corroborated for those three individuals for whom we have skeletal remains (A3, A45, and A101). A36, unlike other juveniles interred at Mound A, appears to have received notably different burial treatment from that afforded the Mound’s adults. A36 was buried with only what the excavators described as baked clay animal toys and a single barrel-shaped bead. Beads are a common feature of A’s mortuary assemblages, although the placement of a single large bead with this infant may be a gift from the bereaved instead of a piece of jewelry worn in life. The toys from A36 were unique among all A graves. Perhaps these stand as symbols of a form of emic, culturally constructed childhood for the very young as argued by others studying children’s mortuary rituals (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1469605312439972">Baxter, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1469605312439972">Borič and Stefanovič, 2004</xref>). Epigraphic data for the period shows cultural differentiation between child/adult and young/old, but also divisions within early childhood such as fetus (ša libbiša), newborn (ina mêšu), baby (šerru), nursing baby (tur.gaba or lakû), and weaned child (pirsu) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1469605312439972">Harris, 2000</xref>: 6–10). A36’s distinct mortuary treatment may reflect an understanding of infancy as separate from other moments in childhood. Finally, the placement of the toys and bead in this grave may have been specific to this infant and a manifestation of bereavement.</p>
<p>In contrast to A36, several older juveniles (ranging from 6–16yo) seem to have been memorialized similarly to adults in burial. In content and layout, their graves parallel those of adults, including, for example, the metal dagger buried with A3. The bereaved typically paid attention to adorning the deceased’s body, perhaps reflecting elements of the collective funerary rite. A100, like other older children and adults, was interred with beads, bracelets, rings, earrings and a nose ornament. Surprisingly, A100 was interred without any ceramics but with a cylinder seal. Seals had primarily administrative functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1469605312439972">Charvát, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1469605312439972">Noveck and Gorelick, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1469605312439972">Porada, 1993</xref>), making it an unusual object for a child’s grave. However, at Mound A we see cylinder seals, occasionally in groups of two or three, with several older children as well as with adult males and females. It is worth considering, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1469605312439972">Noveck and Gorelick (1975: 16)</xref> have argued, that these may have functioned as amulets or offerings. It is possible that mourners placed them in the grave and that, like jewelry, they may have been an element of variability tied to the emotions and rituals surrounding burial. Similarly, they could be interpreted as markers of crossing a threshold into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1469605312439972">Gilchrist, 2007</xref>: 151). Regardless, its presence in this grave serves as an intriguing piece of evidence suggesting that older children may have been incorporated into adult social life at Kish.</p>
<p>Burial context indicates that the graves of older juveniles reflect multiple social identities and the collective social memory of Kish. Ultimately, the particularity of the lone infant burial may tell us more about the grief surrounding that infant’s death, while more standard burial treatment of older children may suggest that they occupied a similar space in the construction of social memory as adults.</p>
<p>The mortuary assemblages that accompanied adults, like those accompanying children, show idiosyncratic variation within the collective form of burial. The excavators, particularly during the first season, believed they saw radical distinctions in the assemblages of males and females. The differences that they perceived in the distribution of objects were often used to assign sex to individuals, identifying men as those individuals interred with daggers and axes and women as those with toilet kits. Vestiges of this are seen in an excavation photograph caption (Oxford Negative 166): 
<disp-quote>
<p>A Sumerian burial in the palace showing the large pots with handles and the champagne vase, both new discoveries in Mesopotamian pottery. Each man was buried with a water jar, a drinking cup, and a dish for food. His weapons of copper and his seal lay beside him. In the case of women, their jewels and hairpins were found.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Many gendered associations of material culture crumble when sex is osteologically determined. While the nature of the collection did not allow us to determine adult age ranges with sufficient detail to consider here, we are able to discuss some variation in treatment related to sex. In our reanalysis, we used the sexually dimorphic features of the skull and pelvis to assign sex whenever possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1469605312439972">Buikstra and Ubelaker, 1994</xref>). Of the 41 adults for whom we could estimate a sex, we could determine burial number and context for 33. While we concurred in many of the male assessments, we identified a number of females that had previously been classed as males. In part, we assume this is an artifact of reliance on grooming objects to determine sex, since it appears that pins and toilet kits were less female-specific than originally believed.</p>
<p>Our analysis showed that while two of the 11 women we identified were interred with knives and one with a dagger, this type of weapon was indeed more common among male burials. Interestingly, however, no toilet kits were found with identified females, while six were found with the 22 males. Beads, pottery, seals, and pigment shells were evenly distributed between the sexes. While bracelets were more common among the burials of females, earrings, rings, and pins were shared between the sexes. It appears that each individual possessed (in death, if not also in life) a personal suite of goods and adornments. People were dressed for the grave with items that may have been specific to their habits or to those who interred them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1469605312439972">Brück, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1469605312439972">Sayer, 2010</xref>). We note that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1469605312439972">Brück (2004: 326)</xref> has argued that ‘mortuary practices into which objects were drawn allowed mourners to express and to cope with the social impact of death’. Considering this, it would seem that both the regularities of collective burial structure and the variability between graves speak to both the group and the individual.</p>
<p>Individual A23 (As.13–23/13), whom <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1469605312439972">Moorey singles out as a ‘richly equipped female burial’ (1970: 91)</xref>, was confirmed by us as female osteologically. She was buried with five ceramic vessels, two metal bowls, a silver disk, two pigment shells, three cylinder seals, a metal adze, a shell spindle whorl, and one weapon – a metal knife. Additionally, she wore a suite of jewelry including a silver bracelet, a metal pin, one shell and multiple silver rings. Male mortuary assemblages were similarly varied. The male buried in A77 (As.13–23/1) had seven pottery vessels, all of different types, and a wide array of beads made of copper, carnelian, jasper, and faience. Like the woman in A23, he also had pigment shells, cylinder seals, and pins. In his case, the pins were both metal, but one had a faience head. While not accompanied by a toilet kit, he did have a razor and wore three silver rings and a silver fillet. Through this we can see both the variability in adult burial accoutrements and the overlap between sexes.</p>
<p>In sum, our analysis of the adult mortuary assemblages showed no strong sex-based patterns. Interestingly, however, our assessment of skeletal indicators of nutrition and disease at Mound A shows that female health was worse in three indicators of childhood health and resource access (cranial porosities and dental enamel hypoplasia) and in indications of lifestyle (caries rate) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1469605312439972">Larsen, 1997</xref>). This is consistent with patterns at Kish throughout time and may not be specific to Mound A or the Akkadian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1469605312439972">Pestle et al., in press b</xref>). While some bio-cultural elements (including diet) likely signaled gender identity at Kish, observed gender differences are not pronounced within the graves’ mortuary contents. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1469605312439972">Schwartz (2007: 48)</xref> sees something similar at Umm el-Marra where ‘there is little or no gender-specificity with respect to objects and their association with bodies of different sexes. Almost every object type is associated with individuals of either sex’. The tendencies we note among grave goods may fall in line with gendered belongings if we consider the fact that some objects in the grave may have been tied to particular funerary rites or to the identities of a gifter. However, we have probably lost some more clearly gendered elements (particularly clothing) to the vagaries of preservation. The act of readying the body for burial involved the selection of clothes and jewelry as well as more intimate preparations of the corpse (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1469605312439972">Brück, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469605312439972">Chesson, 2001b</xref>) and contributed to the construction of individual identities and social memory for the group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1469605312439972"><title>Considering social standing</title>
<p>There is no shortage of richly furnished burials at Mound A, as at other burial places of the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1469605312439972">Pollock, 1999</xref>). However, we would like to move beyond a simplistic assessment rooted in counts of objects and a Saxe/Binford focus on rank in order to consider some other elements associated with wealth, patterns of health, and resource access. For each individual buried at Mound A, certain items were thought worthy of inclusion in the burial space, perhaps as personal possessions. Stone bowls, likely imports, and ostrich-egg cups stand out as rare items in A Cemetery tombs. Nine stone vessels were found in A graves, including graves of great affluence like that of the adult male in A104 (discussed below). Individuals found with ostrich-eggshell cups (3 males, 1 female, 3 adults of indeterminate sex, and 1 child) generally had a larger mortuary assemblage, potentially suggesting enhanced resource access. In some cases, as in the mother-of-pearl inlaid vessel found with A128 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1469605312439972">Figure 6</xref>), these ostrich-eggshell cups are finely decorated. An ostrich-egg was interred with A120, a seemingly elite child found with a silver medallion, a handled metal bowl, and beads of inlaid carnelian gold, shell, and onyx. This could coincide with the notion that adults and older children shared a similar social space or could support an argument that class trumped age.
<fig id="fig6-1469605312439972" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Decorated ostrich eggshell cup interred with A128 (FM156984, image courtesy Field Museum).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1469605312439972-fig6.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>In addition to stone bowls, it would appear that other materials traveled great distances to be interred in Mound A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1469605312439972">Rapp, 2009</xref>), although no sourcing studies have been conducted to confirm this. Many beads, among the most common grave inclusions at A, probably arrived there through long-distance trade relationships. Lapis lazuli likely came from northern Afghanistan, carnelian from Iran, and in the specific case of carnelian inlaid with white from as far as the Indus Valley. This last material is found in 11 graves, and never without other beads made of carnelian, lapis, faience, gold, shell, porphyry, or onyx. Such beads are found with males and females, children and adults. The extent of the social relationship that their procurement required implies something about the individuals buried with them, since they, their kin, or a participant in the funerary rites seemingly had the necessary knowledge of and access to extralocal social groups. The possession of exotic goods, and frequently jewelry, has been understood as a consequence of an ability to tap into a widely dispersed network of peers, goods, and information, any and all of which may be required to build or maintain differential social status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1469605312439972">Blanton et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1469605312439972">Helms, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1469605312439972">Schwartz, 2007</xref>). The wearing or gifting of these small but potentially valuable goods may be tied to social standing. They might also have carried emotional resonance, as suggested by the lone bead in A36.</p>
<p>While not rare, some of the daggers found in 23 Mound A graves could be considered elite artifacts. The copper bladed, iron bladed, silver hilted, gold hilted, ivory handled, wooden handled, calcite handled, and sheathed daggers are so varied in construction they could indicate some level of personalization and may also suggest display value. One would certainly consider the iron bladed, gold hilted, and ivory handled dagger found with A104 an object of great rarity and value.</p>
<p>The materials and crafting skills evident in many of the objects found in Mound A graves indicate the overall affluence interred there. On the other side of this spectrum, some evidence suggests that not everyone was buried with great wealth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1469605312439972">2</xref></sup> Preservation may have erased some differences and exacerbated others, notwithstanding problems with excavation quality. Excavators do note three undisturbed individuals interred with no preserved goods at all (A35, A37, A145). Skeletal remains from A145 (FM192751), an adult male buried with no goods, show no indication of systemic stress in the form of cranial porosities or of interrupted growth in the form of dental enamel hypoplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1469605312439972">Larsen, 1997</xref>). In fact, he shows no evidence of dental pathology and no arthropathy. These skeletal indicators suggest that while his grave was left without a mortuary assemblage, there were no health effects indicative of deprivation or heavy body use. Aside from these three individuals, five other adults and four children were interred without pottery. However, this absence would not appear to be tied to low socio-economic standing as, for example, A130 is interred with beads of inlaid carnelian, a metal pin, pigment shells, and earrings, while A100 (the aforementioned juvenile with a cylinder seal) is also among those without ceramics.</p>
<p>This exploration of the mortuary assemblage suggests a range of social standing at the cemetery, but perhaps a narrow one, a fact that might result from the burial of a particular and limited group of people over a short period of time. Or, conversely, that burial was a time when opulence was considered appropriate. Nevertheless, the mortuary assemblages reflect tremendous variation in quantity and style of goods suggesting that the particular deceased individual was commemorated within the collective way of burial.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1469605312439972"><title>The death of a man</title>
<p>We would like to conclude this discussion of life and death at Mound A with a closer look at one person in order to better consider the intersection of social memory and individual social identities in the grave. Individual A104 (As.13–23/5) is notable among the Mound A dead in that he was one of the older individuals in his community (probably in his mid to late 40s) and, judging by his grave wealth, among the more affluent. All that remains of his body now is his cranium, which bears no signs of pathology or violence that would differentiate it from the other males in this generally healthy population. In keeping with tradition, he was buried alone in a simple earthen tomb. He was laid into this pit on his side in a semi-extended fashion, with his body oriented from east to west. One hand was placed over his face while the other lay along the side of his body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1469605312439972">Breniquet, 1984</xref>: 22). The normativity of these burial practices is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1469605312439972">Sayer’s (2010: 63)</xref> comment that, ‘the community, family and kin groups that survived the deceased … contributed to a collectively remembered past and funeral events would have been arranged based on the previous funerals they participated in’. In the case of A104, no effort was made to distinguish his tomb from others in terms of structural embellishment or distinctive placement. He was interred following the patterns that formed part of inscribed memory in the city, in other words, he was interred as befitted a man from Kish.</p>
<p>Although the poor preservation of organic materials does not allow us to glimpse his clothes, it is clear from the surviving materials that A104’s body was richly prepared for the grave and the life beyond (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1469605312439972">Table 2</xref>). Moreover, several of the objects that accompanied him in death were probably intimately tied to his body. The metal toilet kit, an item that was not particularly common in this burial place, suggests specific concern for grooming. A104 wore a number of pieces of metal jewelry including multiple earrings, two bracelets, and a small silver medallion. His beads, made of porphyry, lapis lazuli, carnelian, and one of inlaid carnelian, included some materials that had traveled great distances to adorn his body. His clothes, or perhaps his hair, were held in place with long pins, one plain and two with small animal heads<italic>. </italic>Based on the multiplicity of adornment and dress items interred with A104, it would appear that those who buried him took great care in the incorporated memory or bodily practices surrounding his death. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1469605312439972">Brück (2004: 318)</xref> has suggested that these types of items might be vestiges of preparing the body for the funerary rite and that ‘the careful deposition next to the body of the tools used to prepare and dress it for the funeral rite would have highlighted the identity of those who undertook this intimate task’. These actions would have served to commemorate him, his mourners, and those in charge of preparing the mortuary space while also serving as a means of constructing social memory for the group.

<p>Five ceramic vessels along with somewhat unusual items such as metal bowls and cymbals surrounded his body in the grave. Also following Mound A patterns, particularly for males, he was buried with two metal daggers and an axe. Perhaps in keeping with his specific social role, he was also accompanied by three cylinder seals, which are suggestive of administrative activities. Two other rare objects, a stone bowl and an ostrich-egg cup, stand out from A104’s abundant mortuary assemblage.</p>
<p>Although conforming to the overall way in which the dead were treated at Kish, the number of A104’s grave goods laden with symbols suggesting high standing indicates that the mortuary environment could be highly personalized. His individual identity and personal connections, which seemingly stretched to distant lands, also appear to have been memorialized. One of the daggers in his grave (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1469605312439972">Figure 7</xref>; FM236415) boasts a blade made of cold hammered iron (of either terrestrial or meteoric origin), a gold hilt, and an ivory handle – all non-local goods offering a visible sign of his access to unique resources. His beads likely came from as far as Afghanistan and the Indus Valley. One of his pins and one of the five pots from his grave were among the few objects at Mound A that were tied to the new Akkadian Empire, implying a relationship that wasn’t particularly antagonistic between A104 and this polity or, indeed, that he may have been more closely tied to the Akkadian Empire than others buried here. As such, while the interment of A104 reflects the practices of the time in that he was not accorded a special burial space or tomb structure, we argue that he was also demarcated through grave furnishings in a manner suited to his specific social identities within the group.

<sec id="sec11-1469605312439972" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our analysis of mortuary practices at Mound A helps to elucidate the changes occurring at the time of the Akkadian conquest. Given Kish’s importance as one of the first seats of regional empire and as a city with influence throughout Mesopotamia, their reaction to foreign invasion stands as a significant element of the city’s history. The patterns we explore in Mound A burials provide a means of seeing how mortuary practices might contribute to the construction of a collective social memory that allowed Kish’s people to move forward after conquest. This may fall in line with the idea that Kish occupied a favored space in the empire. What we see suggests that, after the tumult associated with the Akkadian takeover, the groups who made their lives there attempted to pull together and create a social order, an effort manifest in the generally homogenous burial rituals at Mound A. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469605312439972">Chesson (2001b: 100)</xref> has argued, ‘commemorative ceremonies set into motion richly textured interactions in which individuals and groups can assert identities, craft social memories, and repair the social fabric of the community’. In this case, with a palace of tremendous grandeur stripped and burned, the need for this sort of repair and for strengthening of community was likely profound, especially given Kish’s ongoing relationship with Akkad.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1469605312439972">Arnold (2001: 215)</xref> finds that ‘The patterned disposal of the dead was one of the ways Early Iron Age populations in the west Hallstatt area naturalized, organized, categorized and interpreted their world in order to make it appear timeless, universal and inevitable’. The regularized elements of the burial ritual at Kish may have functioned in the same fashion, allowing the community to move beyond the conflict that resulted in the razing of the A Palace and towards a recollection of past eras. In this way, burial, an important commemorative ceremony for any population, was structured to (re)present social memory for the inhabitants of Mound A.</p>
<p>Beyond the group, the graves show possible evidence of individuals and the bereaved. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1469605312439972">Tarlow (2000)</xref> has asserted, burial creates an emotional landscape. We argue that this is visible in the care with which individuals were interred and in small elements such as the toys and bead interred with the infant in A36. The act of mourning individuals and preparing their bodies for the grave was not only the domain of the bereaved, the (social) body of the deceased had impact in these actions as did the community at large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1469605312439972">Arnold, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1469605312439972">Brück, 2004</xref>). It was not the case that the grave served the sole function of representing one idea or one identity, rather it was space wherein different elements of the individual life were expressed, elements that ranged from personal details to group identities to the larger patterns that symbolized their community.</p>
<p>The graves excavated at Mound A reflect the crafting of social memory at Kish, a confluence of normative, perhaps ideal, burial practice, and signs of the individual life. To come back to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1469605312439972">Connerton (1989: 39)</xref>, our analyses of burial at Mound A allow us ‘to emphasise the fact that to study the social formation of memory is to study those acts of transfer that make remembering it in common possible’. Here, we suggest that these elements of standardization were not immutable social proscriptions, nor did they serve as overwhelming practices, but rather complemented the personal burial rituals enacted at Mound A. It would seem that the vast majority of the graves at A were constructed in the general fashion of burial at Kish, but intended to commemorate individual lives. At Mound A, multiple identities intertwined in memorializing the dead and constructing personal and social memory. The specific place and time in which these people were interred speaks to the need to create a social memory following the Akkadian takeover, one focused on remembering or possibly even forgetting the destruction of the A Palace. The ways in which Mound A functioned as a burial place ultimately speak to the importance of the grave and the act of burial in the construction of social memory during times of great change.</p>
