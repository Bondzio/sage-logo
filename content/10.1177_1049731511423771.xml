<p>In their edited book, <italic>Substance Abuse Treatment for Youth and Adults: Clinician’s Guide to Evidence-Based Practice</italic>, David Springer and Allen Rubin deliver a detailed how-to guide for implementing evidence-based substance abuse interventions within clinical practice. Interspersed with case examples, clinical vignettes, and excerpts of client–clinician dialogue, this text addresses the real-world needs of practitioners with a thorough and comprehensive account of six empirically supported treatments.</p>
<p>The editors of this text aptly note in the preface that some practitioners become heavily burdened by other lengthy and confusing research materials. This book, however, focuses on the concrete <italic>how</italic>’<italic>s</italic> and <italic>why</italic>’<italic>s</italic> of the practical application of tested interventions instead of only on the interventions' empirical support. While relevant research is referenced (the full citation for which can be found at the end of every chapter), the text reads more as a series of practice manuals or guidelines. It provides clinicians with theoretical overviews and instructions on how precisely to begin intervention utilization within current practice.</p>
<p>Second in the series of clinician’s guides, this book is divided into four parts: <italic>Engaging Clients in Treatment, Adolescents, Families,</italic> and <italic>Adults</italic> and contains six chapters—written by different practitioners—each corresponding to one clinical intervention approach. All of the chapters begin with overviews that contain the theoretical underpinnings, principles, indications, and contradictions. They continue by offering considerably easy-to-follow implementation guidelines including session structure and format, treatment topics, and therapeutic procedures. Adaptations with other populations, training requirements, and resources are presented when appropriate. Additionally, the book’s editors have appended two useful sources of information; one pertaining to the referenced empirical support and the other is a practitioner’s guide to the evidenced-based practice process, which details clear step-by-step implementation strategies.</p>
<p>The first section, consisting of only Chapter 1, begins by examining the groundwork for motivational interviewing (MI) in terms of its theoretical backing and four guiding principles. The authors discuss the “spirit” of MI as collaborative and supportive where the client and counselor work jointly to build a climate conducive to change. Specific attention is paid to the counseling strategies required to engender such an environment, and concrete illustrations of case examples and client–clinician excerpts designed to illuminate various clinical techniques are replete. Enhancing its utilitarian value, they offer an eight-step implementation guide for adapting the intervention with groups as well as propose, describe, and explain the use of several therapeutic exercises.</p>
<p>Two empirically supported clinical interventions designed for adolescents are explored in the second section of the book. Chapter 2 looks at a problem-solving and social skills training approach to substance abuse treatment and introduces the guided adolescent problem solving (GAPS) program as a remediation-of-deficits model. Focus is placed heavily on detailing topics covered in each of the five intensely structured therapeutic sessions. Vibrant case examples and meticulous descriptions of various worksheets and tools help bring implementation guidelines to life. Chapter 3 continues to review interventions used with adolescents, transitioning from a problem solving to a community-reinforcement approach (A-CRA). Beginning with a description of the intervention’s historical context and background, session overview, format, and general session guidelines are discussed. Placing specific attention on describing several of the therapeutic procedures, the authors explain the use of the functional analysis of substance abuse, sobriety sampling, and communication skills training tools. Lengthy and in-depth case examples are cleverly utilized to illustrate when, how, and why to implement specific procedures in practice.</p>
<p>The origins and conceptualizations of family behavior therapy (FBT) comprise the focus of Part III, Chapter 4. Describing in great detail the assessment process, the authors provide comprehensive assessment instructions along with all of the appropriate tools. From here, various treatment components of FBT are reviewed. The authors keenly highlight the importance of evaluating ancillary needs in conjunction with substance abuse services and conclude with methods for enhancing client participation in treatment.</p>
<p>The fourth and final part of this text explores adult substance abuse and outlines two empirically supported interventions for use in practice. Chapter 5 elucidates a cognitive–behavioral coping skills therapy approach and begins with a lengthy overview of its history, theory, and principles. The author discusses the components of coping skills therapy including reinforcement, modeling, conditioned responding, and cognitive factors. Several of the intervention’s 17-session topics are presented and case examples are supplied to illuminate the use of these topics. <italic>Seeking Safety</italic>, the appropriately named last chapter, presents and describes a treatment approach originally designed for clients with cooccurring posttraumatic stress and substance abuse disorders. Written in conjunction with this intervention’s manual, it provides supplemental information on various treatment characteristics such as clinician training, client selection, and session format. The author explains exactly how to adapt the intervention to a wide range of populations as well as gifts readers with a detailed list of web-based resources and implementation materials.</p>
<p>The purpose of this text is not to burden one with research, but to provide clinicians with a practical resource guide for intervention implementation. It aims to underscore the need for evidence-based practices and introduces six different intervention approaches. Initiation of treatments within current practice is explored and supporting evidence is cited.</p>
<p>For social workers and other practitioners involved in the treatment of substance abuse, this book offers a surprising depth of information without overwhelming its reader. The text succeeds in enumerating the importance of evidence-based practices and providing comprehensive implementation instructions, while avoiding sounding overly academic or mechanistic. Its most notable strengths are its ability to address a sundry of practical issues including adapting interventions to different populations and anticipating resistant clients. The inclusion and description of various therapeutic worksheets also serve to enhance the book’s practical applicability. Perhaps, one of the most appealing characteristics is the authors' use of vivid case examples and vignettes throughout the entire text to illuminate and accompany the informational material. Although the book in its entirety is very well organized and ordered, it may not be intended to be read as one cohesive text. The six targeted interventions are unrelated and overt attempts are not made to unnecessarily connect them. Chapters can be read individually and in a relatively short amount of time, adding further to its ease of use in clinical settings. Clinicians interested in implementing one of the six included evidence-based practices may find this book particularly attractive due to its ability to address the applied needs of everyday practice and its straightforward manner in which it approaches intervention initiation.</p>
