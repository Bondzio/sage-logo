<abstract>
<p>Leaders make vital contributions to the survival and success of civic associations, but they vary widely in levels of commitment to those groups. Why are some leaders more committed than others? We draw from scholarship on civic participation, volunteering, social movements, and team management to develop an original explanation. Although theory suggests individual and organizational factors may explain differences, most prior empirical studies examine only individual-level hypotheses. We use data collected from 1,616 Sierra Club volunteer leaders and the 368 chapters and groups they led to conduct multilevel analyses of the determinants of behavioral commitment among leaders. At the individual level, we find that leaders with more applicable skills, available time, and aligned motivations are more committed to the organization. At the organizational level, we find that leaders whose organizations are more complex, and who are on teams that operate more interdependently, share work more equally, and devote smaller shares of time to meetings, are more committed. These findings have implications for scholars of leadership and commitment and for organizations seeking more committed leaders.</p>

<p>Leaders make vital contributions to the survival and success of civic associations. Organization leaders deliberate over and select group structures, strategies, and tactics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0003122413489877">Ganz 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0003122413489877">Morris 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0003122413489877">Polletta 2002</xref>), shape collective action frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0003122413489877">Morris and Staggenborg 2003</xref>), and identify opportunities and mobilize resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0003122413489877">Zald and McCarthy 1987</xref>). They do the work required to launch and sustain programs, engage active participants, and expand recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0003122413489877">Andrews et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0003122413489877">Robnett 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0003122413489877">Rothenberg 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0003122413489877">Skocpol, Ganz, and Munson 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0003122413489877">Smith, Carson, and Alexander 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the critical roles leaders play, it is not surprising that variation in leader commitment has important implications for associations. For example, in a study of anti–drunk-driving associations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0003122413489877">McCarthy and Wolfson (1996)</xref> found that the time leaders committed predicted a group’s ability to recruit members and raise funds. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0003122413489877">Ganz (2009)</xref> highlighted the crucial role that leader commitment played in the United Farm Workers’ (UFW) ability to out-compete established unions and defeat California’s agriculture industry. As he noted, “a key difference between the UFW’s leaders and those of the Teamsters and the AFL-CIO was in the depth of each team’s collective commitment to the enterprise” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0003122413489877">Ganz 2009</xref>:13). Studies like these demonstrate that commitment varies substantially across leaders and that leader commitment affects important outcomes.</p>
<p>Despite the importance of leader commitment for organizational outcomes, we know little about why some leaders are more committed than others (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0003122413489877">Dorius and McCarthy 2011</xref>). Although scholars have called for increased theoretical and empirical attention to leadership, scholarship remains sparse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0003122413489877">Aminzade, Goldstone, and Perry 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0003122413489877">Barker, Johnson, and Lavalette 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0003122413489877">Morris and Staggenborg 2003</xref>). We can, at best, draw analogies between research on participation among rank-and-file members and leader commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0003122413489877">Musick and Wilson 2008</xref>). This approach suggests individual-level factors, like time availability or skill development, play a role in determining leader commitment. It misses, however, the possible roles of organizational and interactional factors. Ordinary members and volunteers, for example, are often provided with structured opportunities to engage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003122413489877">Eliasoph 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0003122413489877">Lichterman 2006</xref>); leaders, on the other hand, hold meetings, debate alternatives, and do administrative and technical work to create and maintain those opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0003122413489877">Baggetta et al. 2012</xref>). As such, leader commitment may vary with the demands of the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0003122413489877">Dorius and McCarthy 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0003122413489877">Oliver and Marwell 1992</xref>) and with the nature of interactions among members of the leadership team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0003122413489877">Hackman 2002</xref>). On these points, the current literature on associational leaders is nearly silent.</p>
<p>Our question, then, is the following: Why are some leaders more behaviorally committed to their associations than others? Our answer draws on several streams of scholarship. We begin with established theories of participation and volunteering. This research focuses on individual-level factors driving participation, although some scholars note that organizational structures and practices can also shape member involvement and commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0003122413489877">Knoke 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0003122413489877">Musick and Wilson 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0003122413489877">Wilson 1973</xref>). We thus draw on studies of political, civic, and movement organizations and social-psychological research on work teams to develop expectations for organization-level explanations of commitment.</p>
<p>In what is, to the best of our knowledge, the first effort to integrate these approaches, we simultaneously assess the organizational, interactional, and individual factors that shape behavioral commitment among leaders. Using data on 1,616 volunteer leaders of the Sierra Club and the hundreds of state chapters and local groups they led, we employed multilevel analyses to elucidate the factors that facilitate behavioral commitment. Specifically, we examined the demands placed on leaders by an organization’s complexity, the degree to which leaders worked interdependently and shared work equitably, and the extent to which meetings dominated the leadership experience as possible organization-level drivers of leaders’ behavioral commitment. We found that individual factors play a role, but at least as important are characteristics of the organization and interactions of the leadership team. These findings imply that association researchers need to consider organization and interactional effects. Moreover, organizations seeking more committed leaders would be better served by getting current leaders to act as an interdependent, fair, and balanced team than by seeking out new, more intrinsically motivated leaders.</p>
<sec id="section1-0003122413489877">
<title>Theory</title>
<p>Historically, many social scientists have studied commitment, especially as it relates to organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0003122413489877">Klein, Becker, and Meyer 2009</xref>). Given the complex, multidimensional nature of commitment, many definitions of the construct have been used. Some definitions focus on the psychological dimensions of commitment; others focus more on its behavioral implications, particularly when studying commitment in voluntary associations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0003122413489877">Becker (1960</xref>:33) developed an early formulation of behavioral commitment as engaging in “consistent lines of activity.” Following Becker, scholars of voluntary action regularly conceptualize and measure commitment behaviorally—by what people do, rather than what they say (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0003122413489877">Musick and Wilson 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0003122413489877">Snow and Soule 2010</xref>). This approach differs from the psychological measures used by organizational behavior scholars studying commitment in for-profit settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0003122413489877">Klein et al. 2009</xref>). Where employers prescribe relevant behaviors (like hours spent on the job) and can sanction employees financially, assessing variation in mindsets may be more appropriate. A behavioral approach makes more sense for unpaid volunteers with greater choice about how (and how much) to act.</p>
<p>Throughout this article, we focus specifically on behavioral commitment, using the terms “commitment” or “committed” to refer to the behavioral dimensions of commitment. Although distinct, the behavioral and psychological dimensions of commitment are linked, especially in voluntary settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0003122413489877">Knoke and Wood 1981</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0003122413489877">Kanter (1972</xref>:66–67) describes it, “When a person is committed, what he wants to do (through internal feeling) is the same as what he has to do (according to external demands), and thus he gives to the group what it needs to maintain itself at the same time that he gets what he needs to nourish his own sense of self.” Integrating several prior formulations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0003122413489877">Musick and Wilson (2008</xref>:424) define behavioral commitment in voluntary settings as<disp-quote>
<p>the strength of a person’s ties to a particular organization or a particular volunteer role. . . . A highly committed volunteer is loyal to the organization, willing to work long hours, to put the volunteer role and its demands first. . . . A highly committed volunteer is the last to leave.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In voluntary associations generally, and social movement organizations especially, the more committed member is one who takes on greater risks and costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0003122413489877">Snow and Soule 2010</xref>), which can include devoting more time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0003122413489877">Dorius and McCarthy 2011</xref>), enduring physical or emotional hardship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0003122413489877">Hirsch 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0003122413489877">McAdam 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0003122413489877">Wiltfang and McAdam 1991</xref>), forgoing future opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0003122413489877">Mische 2001</xref>), persisting for longer periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0003122413489877">Downton and Wehr 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0003122413489877">Nepstad 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0003122413489877">Passy and Giugni 2000</xref>), and doing more of the work necessary to see organizations survive and succeed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0003122413489877">Andrews et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0003122413489877">Kanter 1972</xref>).</p>
<p>From this behavioral perspective, variations in commitment have important sociological consequences for individuals and organizations. For individuals, commitment shapes the arrangement of other life activities. More commitment to a voluntary association can reduce engagement with family, friends, education, employment, recreation, and other alternative activities, thereby shaping life trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0003122413489877">Corrigall-Brown 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0003122413489877">Hirsch 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0003122413489877">McAdam 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0003122413489877">Mische 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0003122413489877">Nepstad 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0003122413489877">Passy and Giugni 2000</xref>). For organizations, the pool of available leader commitment shapes groups’ endurance, scope, and effectiveness of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0003122413489877">Andrews et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0003122413489877">Ganz 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0003122413489877">Kanter 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0003122413489877">McCarthy and Wolfson 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0003122413489877">Oliver and Marwell 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0003122413489877">Smith et al. 1984</xref>). Even substantial numbers of less-committed members may not provide enough day-to-day effort to keep an association going. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0003122413489877">Kanter (1972</xref>:62) notes, an association cannot last if it fails to solve the problem of “who takes out the garbage?” Organizational maintenance depends on people committed enough to take out the trash every day—and organizational progress requires commitment far deeper than that.</p>
<p>Most research on commitment in associations focuses on the rank-and-file (referred to variously as members, participants, activists, or volunteers). Studies typically explain the choice to join or volunteer by focusing on individual attributes that make joining more likely (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0003122413489877">Musick and Wilson 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0003122413489877">Verba, Schlozman, and Brady 1995</xref>). These same individual-level factors may also explain the depth and persistence of participation among people who join (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0003122413489877">Beyerlein and Hipp 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0003122413489877">Corrigall-Brown 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0003122413489877">Klandermans and Oegema 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0003122413489877">Schussman and Soule 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0003122413489877">Wilson and Musick 1999</xref>), but recent work suggests organization-level factors like the structure and management of organized volunteer opportunities may matter more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003122413489877">Eliasoph 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0003122413489877">Musick and Wilson 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies of the rank-and-file miss leaders’ unique situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0003122413489877">Morris and Staggenborg 2003</xref>). Leadership differs from rank-and-file participation because leaders take responsibility for achieving organizational outcomes in ways the rank-and-file do not. Leaders seek opportunities and design chances for the rank-and-file to participate. Given the open-ended and relatively autonomous nature of leadership activity, we cannot assume that explanations of commitment among the rank-and-file will hold for leaders.</p>
<p>Why, then, are some association leaders more behaviorally committed to their associations than others? Several primary literatures inform our understanding of leader commitment. First, civic participation and volunteering scholars specify key individual-level factors that influence the decision to join, which may also influence leader commitment. Next, we draw on insights about resource mobilization in social movements, arguing that larger organizations may demand more commitment from leaders. Finally, we pull from team management theory to consider how leadership team interactions can encourage or undermine commitment among team members.</p>
<sec id="section2-0003122413489877">
<title>Individual Level: Civic Participation and Volunteering</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0003122413489877">Verba and colleagues’ (1995)</xref> Civic Voluntarism Model dominates individual-level explanations of civic participation. This model conceptualizes socioeconomic, demographic, and network characteristics as civic resources that reduce the costs of civic and political activity. Verba and colleagues studied a large national sample that primarily captured rank-and-file participants, but their insights regarding civic resources like skills, time, and motivation may explain leader behavior as well.</p>
<p>Verba and colleagues argue that political participation demands proficiency with civic skills like leading meetings, writing letters, and making speeches. Often, individuals with more education, regular employment, and other learning opportunities are better able to develop these skills and thus have lower barriers to political participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0003122413489877">Verba et al. 1995</xref>) and a greater likelihood of volunteering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0003122413489877">Musick and Wilson 2008</xref>). Because civic association leadership demands more skill than does ordinary participation or volunteering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0003122413489877">Ganz 2010</xref>), organization leaders tend to have higher levels of education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0003122413489877">Morris and Staggenborg 2003</xref>). We expect prior skill development opportunities will facilitate greater behavioral commitment.</p>
<p>Time is another resource that can facilitate participation. Time in paid employment competes with time available for volunteering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0003122413489877">Musick and Wilson 2008</xref>); discretionary time (or greater flexibility) allows some people to participate more than others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0003122413489877">De Hart and Dekker 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0003122413489877">Verba et al. 1995</xref>). A similar concept from social movement studies—biographical availability—highlights characteristics that may encourage or constrain participation. Empirical research on the effect of time constraints on participation is mixed. Analyses of political participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0003122413489877">Verba et al. 1995</xref>), Freedom Summer volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0003122413489877">McAdam 1988</xref>), Sanctuary Movement activists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0003122413489877">Wiltfang and McAdam 1991</xref>), and peace movement members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0003122413489877">Downton and Wehr 1997</xref>) found that available free time increases participation. Other studies, however, found no effect of free time on volunteering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0003122413489877">Robinson and Godbey 1997</xref>), and individuals who are employed, married, and have children—factors that may reduce available time—are no less likely to participate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0003122413489877">Schussman and Soule 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0003122413489877">Nepstad and Smith (1999</xref>:33) suggested that activists in the Central American Solidarity movement with the most demanding work schedules developed “constraint management skills,” allowing them to successfully negotiate competing obligations and engage in more demanding forms of activism. Nevertheless, we expect leaders with fewer time constraints will commit more to their organizations.</p>
<p>Prior motivations may also shape behavioral commitment to associations. Scholars in several traditions point to social-psychological factors that further behavioral commitment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0003122413489877">Downton and Wehr (1997</xref>:36) describe how prior experiences and beliefs create “attitudinal availability” that allows individuals to commit to activism. Frame theorists suggest that individuals whose views align with an organization’s are more likely to join and contribute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0003122413489877">Benford and Snow 2000</xref>). Individuals who see themselves as part of communities with shared characteristics or beliefs are more likely to volunteer for, with, or on behalf of those groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0003122413489877">Omoto and Snyder 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0003122413489877">Polletta and Jasper 2001</xref>). Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0003122413489877">Verba and colleagues (1995)</xref> focus attention on political interest and public concern among potential participants. Whether conceptualized as attitudes, frames, identities, communities, or interests, social-psychological motivations influence forms and levels of engagement. Leaders who are more motivated and whose goals align well with an organization should be more behaviorally committed to leadership activity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0003122413489877">
<title>Organization Level: Resource Mobilization and Team Management</title>
<p>Social interactions, peer expectations, and an organization’s formal characteristics are also likely to shape leadership commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0003122413489877">Hirsch 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0003122413489877">Knoke and Wood 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0003122413489877">Oliver, Marwell, and Teixeira 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0003122413489877">Wilson 1973</xref>). We begin with core personnel resources: leaders and staff. In associations with more leaders and paid staff, leaders may display less behavioral commitment because work is distributed over more individuals. Association leaders, however, have more possible tasks to undertake than they could ever accomplish. We thus expect adding leaders or staff does not affect any particular leader’s commitment. Greater staff resources or additional leaders may prompt a leader to shift her attention to other tasks. Leader commitment may be sustained by additional support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0003122413489877">Staggenborg 1988</xref>) but not enhanced or undermined by it.</p>
<p>Members and money constitute a second set of organizational resources for associations. Larger organizations with more members or financial resources are generally more complex and invest substantial effort in organizational maintenance and program activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0003122413489877">Staggenborg 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0003122413489877">Zald and McCarthy 1987</xref>). Because regular activities like producing newsletters, lobbying policymakers, or conducting research require specialized knowledge and focused effort, they are better accomplished by individuals who commit the time needed to becoming experts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0003122413489877">Oliver and Marwell 1992</xref>). Larger organizations with more specialized work thus demand more behavioral commitment from each leader. In addition, leaders in organizations with greater resources can launch more ambitious projects, furthering the demand for commitment.</p>
<p>Looking beyond resources, organizational theory and research examine the characteristics of leadership teams that encourage or undermine commitment. Organization scholars have long studied whether collaborative work practices are more or less productive than individualistic ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0003122413489877">Blau 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0003122413489877">Miller and Hamblin 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0003122413489877">Thomas 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0003122413489877">Thompson 1967</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0003122413489877">Hackman (2002)</xref>, a leading scholar of team management, argues that teams with stronger collective identity, clear goals, interdependent work, and supportive environments are more likely to accomplish goals and enhance commitment. Most research investigating whether group characteristics facilitate member commitment relies on laboratory experiments or field surveys in for-profit corporations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0003122413489877">Hackman 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0003122413489877">Van der Vegt and Janssen 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0003122413489877">Woolley et al. 2008</xref>). These studies have not investigated voluntary time commitment as an outcome. Because time volunteered is highly salient in civic associations, we extend theoretical expectations regarding commitment from the team management literature (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0003122413489877">Hackman 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Team interdependence is a central focus in contemporary team scholarship. Social psychology and organization studies have examined interdependence since the 1950s. A team works interdependently when work is divided among individuals but the success of any one person’s effort depends on other team members’ simultaneous efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0003122413489877">Hackman 2002</xref>). Many scholars argue that interdependence develops from structural characteristics such as authority arrangements, technology, or task design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0003122413489877">Guzzo and Dickson 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0003122413489877">Ilgen et al. 2005</xref>) as well as team members’ values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0003122413489877">Wageman and Gordon 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Research shows that team interdependence produces several attitudinal and behavioral outcomes, including learning, productivity, effort, innovation, and satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0003122413489877">Mesch, Johnson, and Johnson 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0003122413489877">Van der Vegt, Emans, and van de Vliert 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0003122413489877">Van der Vegt and Janssen 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0003122413489877">Woolley et al. 2008</xref>). Multiple mechanisms may underlie the relationship between interdependence and commitment in voluntary settings as well. Interdependence may increase feelings of solidarity, collective identity, accountability, or efficacy among team members. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0003122413489877">Hirsch (1990)</xref> described how activists’ collective consciousness-raising, empowerment, and decision-making increased movement participants’ commitment. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0003122413489877">Corrigall-Brown (2012)</xref> found that UFW leaders who lived and worked communally participated in inclusive decision-making processes and applied their skills across multiple contexts. This interdependency led people to devote long hours for extended periods of time. We expect leadership teams that structure work interdependently will increase team members’ behavioral commitment.</p>
<p>Leadership teams also vary in how they distribute effort. Teams with greater inequality may undermine members’ behavioral commitment because inequality may undermine solidarity and reinforce oligarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0003122413489877">Freeman 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0003122413489877">Osterman 2006</xref>). High contributors may think others cannot be relied on—that “if you don’t do it, nobody else will” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0003122413489877">Oliver 1984</xref>). Inequality can demobilize some initially high contributors who burn out. Inequality may also demotivate individuals who make small time contributions because their efforts are undervalued. On the other hand, greater equality may inspire behavioral commitment from team members. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0003122413489877">Corrigall-Brown (2012)</xref> describes how UFW leaders regularly interacted, directly observing the consistent effort put forth. As one of her UFW interviewees reported: “Seeing the commitment of the other volunteers made you realize what you could do yourself. You see other people who are giving up everything and it makes you feel like you can continue to give up everything yourself for the cause too” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0003122413489877">Corrigall-Brown 2012</xref>:96). Shared effort among leaders may thus inspire greater behavioral commitment.</p>
<p>Finally, leadership teams that focus disproportionately on organizational maintenance may diminish behavioral commitment. Organizational maintenance activities are necessary for group survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0003122413489877">Kanter 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0003122413489877">Oliver and Marwell 1992</xref>) but are less likely to reinforce the purposive motivations that underpin commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0003122413489877">Hildreth 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0003122413489877">Wilson 1973</xref>). Without an adequate balance of administrative and substantive activity, leaders may lose a sense of efficacy and disengage from the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0003122413489877">Ganz 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0003122413489877">Polletta 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Meetings are central to organizational maintenance activity but are rarely studied in voluntary associations. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0003122413489877">Schwartzman’s (1989)</xref> anthropological examination, recent studies in workplaces suggest that satisfaction with meetings is a distinct component of employee job satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0003122413489877">Rogelberg et al. 2010</xref>). Employees perceive meetings as disruptions of productive work time. More frequent meetings lead to lower reported levels of employee well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0003122413489877">Luong and Rogelberg 2005</xref>), although longer meetings do not affect employee satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0003122413489877">Rogelberg et al. 2006</xref>). In voluntary settings, we know that leaders spend substantial time in meetings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0003122413489877">Baggetta et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0003122413489877">McCarthy and Wolfson 1996</xref>), but little is known about how that time affects leaders.</p>
<p>Under ideal circumstances, meetings can be important venues where coordination, creative strategizing, and community building activities facilitate civic skill development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0003122413489877">Ganz 2009</xref>). Many association meetings, however, devolve into long, poorly structured debates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0003122413489877">Polletta 2002</xref>) where relatively little learning occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0003122413489877">Baggetta et al. 2012</xref>). In such conditions, meetings are less likely to provide solidary incentives (by enhancing camaraderie) or purposive incentives (by demonstrating progress toward goals) and instead may frustrate leaders, reducing their commitment.</p>
<p>In summary, literatures on civic participation, volunteering, social movements, and team management suggest individual and organizational factors shape the behavioral commitment of association leaders. One of our main contributions is synthesizing these research traditions to generate a more comprehensive, multilevel explanation of behavioral commitment. Leaders with greater civic skills, more available time, and stronger motivations should be more committed. Greater organizational resources may increase commitment by demanding more of leaders. Finally, team contexts in which leaders work interdependently, share work equitably, and balance their activities well may foster greater commitment to the group.</p>

<title>Research Design and Data</title>
<p>Examining both the organizational and individual factors that shape leaders’ commitment requires a multilevel design with a large sample of organizations and leaders nested within them. Most quantitative studies of participation in voluntary associations sample individuals and ask them about their experiences (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0003122413489877">Verba et al. 1995</xref>), or sample organizations and either survey one key informant (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0003122413489877">Walker 1991</xref>) or collect data from organizational records and secondary sources (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0003122413489877">Skocpol 2003</xref>). A research design that blends these approaches can better assess the simultaneous effects of individual and organizational characteristics on leader outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0003122413489877">Knoke 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0003122413489877">Stolle 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>We used data from the National Purpose, Local Action (NPLA) project—a major study of the Sierra Club, one of the oldest and largest environmental groups in the United States. The Sierra Club is a broad-based membership association whose mission is to “explore, enjoy, and protect the wild places of the earth, practice and promote the responsible use of the earth’s ecosystem and resources, [and] educate and enlist humanity to protect and restore the . . . environment” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0003122413489877">Sierra Club 1981</xref>). Headquartered in San Francisco, the Sierra Club is a federated organization with 63 chapters (one per state, plus 13 regional chapters in California) and 343 local groups. Most Sierra Club members join through direct mail solicitation conducted by the national headquarters, but once signed-on, individuals are assigned to the group and chapter whose boundaries encompass their homes. Executive Committees (ExComs) elected annually by members govern groups and chapters. ExCom members and other committee leaders organize the political and recreational activities undertaken by the group or chapter. Some chapters (62 percent) have paid staff who contribute to advocacy, organizing, and member engagement. Groups, by rule, do not have staff. The national board dictates minimum standards for chapters and groups (e.g., each must have an ExCom chairperson and a treasurer; elections must take place annually), but these subnational entities have autonomy in how they structure activity, how they operate, and what they choose to do.</p>
<p>The NPLA project collected data on the Sierra Club from three main sources: organizational surveys, individual leader surveys, and secondary data on each organization’s structure and resources. In fall 2003, we conducted telephone surveys with ExCom chairpersons from groups and chapters. The 40-minute survey asked about a variety of organizational characteristics, including organizational structure, practices, resources, culture, activities, and effectiveness. Of 63 possible chapters, 60 participated in the survey (95.2 percent), and 308 of 343 groups participated (89.9 percent). In the fall and winter of 2003 to 2004, individual ExCom members completed 15-page surveys asking about their personal pathway into leadership in the organization, their assessments of the functioning of their leadership teams, and their personal demographic characteristics. We collected 1,616 surveys from the 3,184 Sierra Club ExCom members for a response rate of 51 percent. The Sierra Club also provided extensive data on membership, budgets, staff, and other characteristics for all chapters and groups. Using these data, we completed extensive response bias analyses for the organizational and leader surveys, finding high levels of representativeness of our samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0003122413489877">Andrews et al. 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The Sierra Club provides an excellent case study for understanding leaders of national civic associations, but we address three concerns regarding its possible limitations. First, in relation to the environmental movement, the Sierra Club is distinctive in terms of its age and prominence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0003122413489877">Bosso 2005</xref>). Its chapters and groups, however, are quite similar to other local environmental groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0003122413489877">Andrews and Edwards 2005</xref>). Second, the Sierra Club’s focus on environmental issues distinguishes it from associations with other substantive concerns. Still, its federated structure is similar to that of many other important organizations, ranging from the National Rifle Association to the American Bowling Congress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0003122413489877">McCarthy 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0003122413489877">Skocpol 2003</xref>), and the internal structures of its local units are comparable to those found in peace movement organizations, anti–drunk-driving groups, and even community choirs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0003122413489877">Baggetta 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0003122413489877">1</xref></sup> Third, Sierra Club leaders have relatively elite sociodemographic backgrounds. This is similar, however, to other social movement leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0003122413489877">Morris and Staggenborg 2003</xref>), and Sierra Club leadership experiences resemble those studied in other organizational contexts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0003122413489877">Barkan 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0003122413489877">McCarthy and Wolfson 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0003122413489877">Tannenbaum 1961</xref>). These features may distinguish the Sierra Club from any other particular organization, but we expect our major analytical claims extend to other associational settings and provide a benchmark for future work on the organizational and individual determinants of commitment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0003122413489877">2</xref></sup></p>

<title>Measures and Hypotheses</title>
<sec id="section6-0003122413489877">
<title>Dependent Variable: Commitment as Hours Contributed</title>
<p>To measure behavioral commitment, we documented the time leaders voluntarily contributed to their leadership position. Our measure of hours contributed is based on questions from our written survey of ExCom members. We began by asking respondents the following question:<disp-quote>
<p>On average, how many hours per month have you devoted to Sierra Club work for your Group or Chapter over the past year? (Note: Think specifically about the work that you did for the Group or Chapter that you will be discussing during your ExCom Self-Assessment, especially if you hold multiple leadership positions at different levels of the Sierra Club.)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Time has strong intuitive appeal as a behavioral indicator of commitment; a leader devoting 50 hours per month certainly appears more committed than a leader working one hour. Using time as an indicator of commitment is also consistent with past scholarship on volunteering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0003122413489877">Dorius and McCarthy 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0003122413489877">Musick and Wilson 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite its face validity, a potential conceptual concern exists. Hours volunteered could be influenced not just by a leader’s commitment to the association but also by her task efficiency. If association leaders have a finite number of tasks to accomplish, individuals who can complete those tasks more efficiently will spend less time than their less efficient counterparts. This concern is likely valid for rank-and-file volunteers. When all the onions are chopped for the soup kitchen’s upcoming meal, the volunteer can go home; when the annual awards committee members have read nomination letters and chosen a winner, their work is done. In such circumstances, time is given voluntarily but the work to be accomplished is essentially piece-work (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003122413489877">Eliasoph 2011</xref>). Increasing the piece-rate will decrease the time contributed regardless of level of commitment.</p>
<p>When examining leaders, however, we argue that this is a minimal concern because the work is open-ended and ambiguous. Leaders of self-governing voluntary associations like the Sierra Club face an essentially unlimited set of possible tasks to undertake. Like business executives, entrepreneurs, artists, and academics, the universe of tasks an association leader could undertake far exceeds any individual’s capacity to complete them—especially because one of the core demands of leadership is scanning the environment for opportunities and developing creative new tasks to exploit them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0003122413489877">Aminzade et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0003122413489877">Ganz 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0003122413489877">Morris and Staggenborg 2003</xref>). Efficiency may influence how many tasks an individual accomplishes, but completing a task merely opens the opportunity to take on (or invent) another. Research on high-earning managers and other professionals suggests that highly competent individuals in these open-ended jobs contribute extreme amounts of time not because they are inefficient but because they are committed to the occupation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0003122413489877">Hewlett and Luce 2006</xref>). The same is likely true for voluntary association leaders; the total time they contribute reflects their commitment. As such, we use the time contributed by Sierra Club leaders to measure behavioral commitment.</p>
<p>Important measurement questions are also related to this dependent variable. Social scientists have used self-reported time estimates in a wide range of subfields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0003122413489877">Tijdens and Dragsta 2007</xref>). Much of this work is driven by demographic questions for which accurate point estimates are the primary goal. Key examples include the Current Population Survey’s (CPS) question about the amount of time worked in the prior week and research on the gender-based division of household labor. Open-ended questions about time use make significant demands on a respondent’s ability to supply accurate estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0003122413489877">Bianchi, Robinson, and Milkie 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0003122413489877">Robinson and Godbey 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite this concern, methodological research suggests that self-reported time measures are robust when used as dependent variables. Time diaries that allow respondents to document a wide range of activities are generally the gold standard for time-use studies. Although comparisons of time diaries and self-reported measures are rare, some evidence suggests self-reports lead to exaggerated estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0003122413489877">Chase and Godbey 1983</xref>). In our analysis, the major threat is systematic sources of bias rather than random error. On this issue, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0003122413489877">Jacobs (1998)</xref> compared the standard CPS self-report of hours worked with a calculated workweek estimate. Using regression analyses, Jacobs tested whether social-psychological factors (e.g., stress), work (e.g., nonstandard schedules), or demographic attributes (e.g., gender or education) explained variation in the discrepancy between self-reports and calculated work. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0003122413489877">Jacobs’s (1998</xref>:50) analyses “revealed random rather than systematic errors” (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0003122413489877">Kan and Pudney 2008</xref>). Taken together, past scholarship provides support for our use of self-reported time as a dependent variable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0003122413489877">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless, given possible recall and social desirability biases, we conducted supplementary analyses. Methodological research on volunteering surveys finds that longer, more detailed batteries of questions about volunteering—including items focused on domains of behavior and particular activities—produce more accurate results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0003122413489877">Rooney, Steinberg, and Schervish 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0003122413489877">Steinberg, Rooney, and Chin 2002</xref>). This format yields larger time estimates, but the estimates are closer to those found using a detailed time diary method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0003122413489877">Havens and Schervish 2001</xref>). Our survey included two additional batteries of questions asking leaders to categorize their average monthly time commitments into specific types of activities (e.g., working on newsletters, fundraising, participating in meetings, and community outreach) and broader domains of activity (e.g., conservation, politics, outdoors activities, and organization building) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0003122413489877">Table A1</xref> in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0003122413489877">Appendix</xref> for a complete list). The total number of reported hours across all three question formats was quite consistent within individuals. Pearson correlations across reports range from .83 to .89. Discrepancies appear to be randomly distributed across reports (no measure is systematically higher or lower than the others) and across value ranges (low time commitment responses seem no more or less likely to be discrepantly reported than high estimates).</p>
<p>Additionally, the phone survey asked ExCom chairpersons to self-report their amount of time commitment (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0003122413489877">Table A1</xref> in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0003122413489877">Appendix</xref> for wording). These surveys took place at different times and in a different format than the written leader survey and focused primarily on characteristics of the particular organization (not the chairperson). Despite the time lag between responses and differences in format, chairpersons’ overall estimates were correlated at .85. Again, discrepancies in reports are randomly distributed over the range of values and are not consistently higher or lower in either response format. Supplementary analyses of related measures within the same survey and the same measure across different surveys increase confidence in our analysis.</p>
<p>Survey nonresponse is an additional concern because leaders who responded to the survey may differ systematically in their time contributions from leaders who did not. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003122413489877">Abraham, Helms, and Presser (2009)</xref> note that volunteering and volunteer time contribution estimates may be biased because volunteering and survey response may be driven by the same personality characteristics. They found that respondents to surveys of the general population volunteer at higher rates and for more hours than do survey nonrespondents. They show, however, that <italic>among volunteers</italic>, those who do respond to surveys and those who do not are indistinguishable in terms of the number of hours they volunteer. Because our sample includes only volunteers, there is little reason to believe respondents contributed hours differently compared to nonrespondents. That said, even if respondents’ time reports are biased, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003122413489877">Abraham and colleagues (2009)</xref> demonstrate that inferences drawn from multivariate analyses of time contributed do not differ between respondents and nonrespondents.</p>
<p>Taken together, our supplementary methodological tests and the broader literature provide confidence in our multivariate analyses. Given the multiple question formats, detailed response batteries, and consistency of reports by individuals within and across survey instruments and contexts, we have substantial confidence in the validity of our point estimates of time contribution. In our analyses we used the sum of responses for time contributed in different categories of activity (e.g., newsletters, fundraising, and events), the most detailed set of time reports collected.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0003122413489877">
<title>Independent Variables: Individual Level</title>
<p>The literatures reviewed earlier suggest three sets of individual characteristics that might influence leaders’ behavioral commitment—skills, time, and motivation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0003122413489877">4</xref></sup> These factors influence who joins, volunteers, and participates, and in some cases how much individuals do. We expect similar patterns for time contributions of Sierra Club leaders (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0003122413489877">Table A2</xref> in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0003122413489877">Appendix</xref> for data sources and question wording for all measures). Leaders who have more opportunities to practice civic skills through formal education and Sierra Club specific trainings should contribute more time. We measured formal education categorically as having less than a bachelor’s degree (reference category), a bachelor’s degree, or an advanced degree. We also included a measure of the number of Sierra Club trainings a leader attended.</p>
<p>Leaders with fewer time constraints should have more time available and contribute more hours. Time constraints include formal employment (full-time and part-time; not currently employed is the reference category), having a child under the age of 18 living at home (dummy), and the amount of time contributed to other voluntary organizations (the sum of hours spent in any of 24 types of associations in which respondents reported being a member or leader at the time of the survey).</p>
<p>Motivational factors, such as a personal connection to the cause or a closer match between individual identity and organizational aims, should increase behavioral commitment. The Sierra Club should better align with individuals who have stronger interests in environmental protection. We used attitudinal and behavioral measures to assess environmental alignment. The attitudinal measure is a scale constructed from items regarding political change motivations for participating in the Sierra Club.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0003122413489877">5</xref></sup> Respondents were asked to rate the importance of various factors to their participation, such as “influencing public policy” or “protect the quality of the environment.” Behavioral measures are indicators of whether a respondent had ever been a member of another local, state, or national environmental group and whether a respondent had ever been a leader in such a group. Because we control for the amount of time currently spent in any other organization (including other environmental groups), membership and leadership in other environmental groups demonstrates additional identification with the environmental movement apart from any time competition between associations. We expect all three measures to be positively related to Sierra Club leadership time contributions.</p>
<p>Because the Sierra Club is not only an advocacy organization but also facilitates community engagement and improvement through activities like outings and clean-ups, individuals with stronger civic or community orientations should contribute more time. Two variables indicate having ever been a member or leader in any nonenvironmental association; these parallel the measures of environmental involvement. Both variables should have positive effects on the hours a leader contributes.</p>
<p>In addition, we included individual-level control variables for age, household income, gender, marital status, and the length of time an individual had been an activist within the Sierra Club. We also included indicator variables for the four different types of leadership positions in our sample: group ExCom members, group chairpersons, chapter ExCom members, and chapter chairpersons (group ExCom members are the reference category). As a robustness check, we ran one model including a control for the total number of other Sierra Club positions a leader held, as self-reported by leaders in the written survey.</p>

<title>Independent Variables: Organization Level</title>
<p>We examined two related sets of organization-level factors that may contribute to leaders’ behavioral commitment: organizational resources and the leader interaction context. We included four variables to measure organizational resources: leaders, staff, members, and revenue. Although some might expect organizations with more volunteer leaders (as measured by the size of the ExCom) and more paid staff will demand less time from each individual leader because work can be divided among more people, we expect these factors will have no effect on commitment (because leaders with additional support simply move on to additional tasks). Larger organizations or those with greater resources, however, will likely demand more time from their leaders, who must complete activities that require specialized knowledge and enduring attention. We measured size by the number of members. Sierra Club entities have two primary revenue streams: funds collected by the national organization that are transferred to lower-level units and locally raised funds. Because local fundraising could be influenced by leader commitment, we only include transfer funds to measure financial resources.</p>
<p>We focused on three components of the leader interaction context: (1) the extent to which a team operated interdependently, (2) the extent to which work was balanced among leaders, and (3) the proportion of time spent in meetings. We modeled the first scale on Hackman’s Team Diagnostic Survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0003122413489877">Wageman, Hackman, and Lehman 2005</xref>), which has been used to measure the performance of work teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0003122413489877">Hackman 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0003122413489877">Wageman 1995</xref>). We combined two items adopted from the Hackman survey, both of which were scored from 1 (never) to 5 (almost always): “A lot of communication and coordination is necessary with other members to generate outcomes” and “I depend heavily on other members to get the work done.” We expect teams with greater interdependence will stimulate greater time contribution from leaders. We measured this variable using a scale that combines the items of the entire ExCom; the measure thus represents the team’s assessment of its ability to work interdependently.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0003122413489877">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The second dimension is the extent to which work was balanced among leaders. We expect leaders will contribute more time when work is spread more evenly across the whole leadership team. To measure inequality we created a GINI index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0003122413489877">Hao and Naiman 2010</xref>) for each leadership team using the self-reported time measure (described earlier). The index runs from 0 to 1 with higher values indicating more inequality.</p>
<p>The third dimension measures the proportion of time leaders spent in meetings. We expect leaders in ExComs that focus a greater share of their time on meetings will be less behaviorally committed. We derived an organization-level measure of the proportion of all leader hours spent in meetings for each ExCom using the time measure (described earlier). We divided the total reported time spent in meetings by all ExCom members by the total time for all activities by all members of that ExCom.</p>
<p>As a robustness check, we also estimated one model including a control for program activity. We measured programs with an additive scale, in which chairpersons were asked whether their group or chapter regularly, sometimes, rarely, or never engaged in 35 different types of activities. Groups and chapters were given one point for each activity they reported doing regularly or sometimes and the total number of activities was summed.</p>

<title>Results: Explaining Behavioral Commitment Among Leaders</title>
<p>Before turning to our multivariate analysis, we describe the leaders and their organizations (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0003122413489877">Table 1</xref> for descriptive statistics for all variables). The median Sierra Club leader spent 17 hours per month on leadership activities (the average leader spent 27.5 hours), although the range stretches from less than an hour to more than 100 hours per month. The average Sierra Club ExCom chairperson contributed 45 hours per month. As a benchmark, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0003122413489877">McCarthy and Wolfson’s (1996)</xref> study of anti–drunk-driving leaders found that chapter vice presidents spent 29 hours per month on leadership activities and chapter presidents devoted nearly 62 hours per month.</p>

<p>Sierra Club leaders are highly educated: 88 percent had a college education and more than half attained an advanced degree. The average leader was in her mid-50s, worked full-time for pay, and was unlikely to have a child living at home (15 percent). About 43 percent were women, 63 percent were married, and the median leader had been an active member for nine years. Nearly four-fifths of leaders had been members of another environmental group and nearly a third had led another environmental group; 88 percent of leaders had been members of nonenvironmental groups (more than half had been leaders). The Sierra Club was leaders’ primary associational commitment and the median leader held one position within the Sierra Club. Despite their other affiliations, the median Sierra Club leader spent less than half an hour per month participating in other groups. The average leader had strong attitudinal motivations for political change on environmental issues (mean score of 4.08 on a five-point scale).</p>
<p>Turning to organizational context, 31 percent of respondents were chapter-level leaders (the other 69 percent led local groups). The median leader served on an ExCom with eight other individuals (although this ranged from 3 to 27) and had no staff support.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0003122413489877">7</xref></sup> The median entity received transfer revenue of less than $1,500 and had about 1,700 members (with significant variation among groups and chapters). The typical leader experienced a modest level of team interdependency (3.4 of a possible 5) and inequality of time contributions across team members (GINI = .37) with a wide range of experiences across entities. Typical leaders spent about one-fifth of their time in meetings, although some ExComs spent fully half of their time meeting.</p>
<p>Why are some leaders more behaviorally committed to their associations than others? <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0003122413489877">Table 2</xref> shows results of regression analyses addressing this question. Model 1 is a fixed-effect linear regression model with robust standard errors. Models 2, 3, and 4 are GLS multilevel random-effects models including variables at the organizational level of analysis.</p>

<p>Civic skills, especially Sierra Club-specific skills, matter a great deal. Individuals who received more formal training from the Sierra Club contributed significantly more hours. This likely represents two complementary mechanisms. First, trainings give individuals the tools they need to feel competent in their work. Second, going through training can increase organizational identification.</p>
<p>Our findings on the relationship between formal education and commitment are less intuitive. Individuals with a college degree contributed fewer hours than did individuals with less than a college education, and individuals with advanced degrees contributed fewer still. Most prior work finds a positive effect of education on other forms of civic engagement (e.g., joining an association or voting) among rank-and-file members. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0003122413489877">Musick and Wilson (2008)</xref>, however, found that education does not have a positive relationship to the number of volunteer hours except among people who volunteer around youth development issues. Our finding is robust to alternative specifications of the education variable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0003122413489877">8</xref></sup> It is also consistent with examination of the relationship between education and voluntary hours in other datasets.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0003122413489877">9</xref></sup> Recent longitudinal research on volunteering in the Netherlands shows that although higher levels of education were once positively correlated with hours volunteered, that relationship is now reversed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0003122413489877">van Ingen and Dekker 2011</xref>). Several possible mechanisms could explain this negative relationship. People with more education could face higher opportunity costs in devoting time to unpaid volunteer work or may be reluctant to embrace lower status forms of voluntary activity. Or, more educated people may prefer making contributions related to their own skill sets, thus indirectly constraining the amount of time they devote. Given that our data are not well-suited to identifying the specific mechanisms underlying this finding, we refrain from speculating further and note that more research on the role of formal education among association leaders is needed.</p>
<p>In addition, we find that available time is an important personal resource. Employment, especially full-time employment, substantially reduces the amount of time leaders contribute. As expected, the coefficient for having a child at home is negative, but given the sample’s limited number of leaders with children, the relationship does not reach conventional standards of statistical significance. The estimated effect of hours spent in other groups is small and not statistically significant.</p>
<p>Motivations shape hours contributed to a group. Individuals with stronger political change motivations devote more hours. Similarly, leadership in other environmental groups (now or in the past) is also positively related to additional Sierra Club leadership time. Motivational effects, however, appear to be limited to the environmental domain. Membership or leadership in other types of civic associations had no impact on behavioral commitment to the Sierra Club.</p>
<p>Turning to organizational resources, the number of members matters but the number of volunteer leaders, the number of paid staff, and the amount of transfer revenue do not.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0003122413489877">10</xref></sup> As expected, a greater number of leaders does not reduce demands on individual leaders. Organizations that are larger in terms of membership, however, demand more time from leaders.</p>
<p>In terms of leader interaction context, team interdependence emerges as an important factor. Leaders on ExComs that operated as interdependent teams contributed more time to leadership activities. We suspect individuals on interdependent teams experience greater trust in other leaders, greater confidence that their efforts will succeed, and greater solidarity with their peers. Interdependence may enhance a sense of mutual obligation and reduce free-riding. By working interdependently, leadership teams can generate greater time contributions from leaders.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0003122413489877">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>We also find that the way leaders distribute work matters. Greater inequality of time contribution between leaders decreases individuals’ behavioral commitment. We argue that two factors contribute to this pattern. First, some individuals may work long hours to support their own goals with little to no engagement of others on the leadership team. This approach may demobilize other leaders who are not self-starters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0003122413489877">Oliver 1984</xref>). Second, inequality among leaders could be due to internal factionalism. Without successful conflict resolution, some individuals may disengage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0003122413489877">Polletta 2002</xref>). If so, time inequality is conceptually related to our finding on leadership team interdependence. We see this finding as providing a basis for further investigation to determine the mechanisms underlying this relationship.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0003122413489877">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally, we find that leaders contributed fewer hours when their leadership teams devoted a greater proportion of their time to meetings. As currently practiced, meetings fail to reinforce purposive and solidary incentives that undergird strong forms of behavioral commitment and hence do not capitalize on the motivations that activists bring to the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0003122413489877">Leighley 1996</xref>). Meetings may thus demobilize individuals who find their efforts wasted in lengthy debates or listening to mundane reports with little meaningful decision-making.</p>
<p>Looking briefly at the control variables, age and income have small and statistically insignificant effects on the amount of time leaders contributed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0003122413489877">13</xref></sup> Women committed more time than men.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0003122413489877">14</xref></sup> There was no difference between married and unmarried leaders. Activist tenure shows no effect. Group and chapter chairpersons committed substantially more time.</p>
<p>To verify the robustness of our findings against alternate specifications, we also present a model including controls for the number of other Sierra Club positions a leader held and the total number of program activities a chapter or group undertook. Model 4 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0003122413489877">Table 2</xref> shows that inclusion of these variables does not substantively change the effects of other variables. Holding other leadership positions within the Sierra Club could constrain the amount of time a leader has, leading to a negative relationship with the dependent variable. Instead, we find a statistically significant, positive relationship between holding more leadership positions and commitment. This finding reinforces our overall argument that the number of hours a person spends is an indication of their commitment. In voluntary associations like the Sierra Club, leaders face an unbounded set of tasks they can undertake and consequently an open-ended amount of time they can spend. The more committed people are, the more likely they are to undertake more leadership positions within the Club and to spend more time on their group or chapter ExCom. We also find a statistically significant, positive relationship between program activity and the number of hours leaders spend. Groups and chapters that undertake more program activities require more time from their leaders.</p>
<p>Both of these controls raise complicated questions about causality. Are leaders more committed and spend more hours on Sierra Club work because they run more programs, or do they run more programs because they are more committed? Do people hold more positions because they are more committed, or are they more committed because they hold more positions? Including these variables does not change the main substantive effects in our model, so we excluded them from further analyses.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0003122413489877">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the relative magnitudes of these effects. The figure displays the predicted change in the number of hours committed to Sierra Club activity for a typical leader if we took that leader and moved each characteristic (independently) from its mean to the 90th percentile of the observed distribution (or from zero to one for dichotomous measures), holding all other characteristics constant (using Model 3 from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0003122413489877">Table 2</xref>; only statistically significant relationships are graphed). For example, based on this analysis, a typical Sierra Club leader is predicted to commit 18 hours per month. If we took that leader and increased the number of Sierra Club trainings he participated in from the mean (one training) to the 90th percentile (three trainings), his predicted time commitment would increase 6.8 hours to nearly 25 hours per month.</p>

<p>Looking first to individual-level effects, we see that although social-psychological motivations are important, the size of their effect is substantially smaller than that of other civic resources. The number of trainings received by a leader (a measure of skills) has the largest effect on behavioral commitment, followed closely by employment status (a measure of time availability). As noted earlier, an average leader moving to the 90th percentile in trainings adds 6.8 hours per month. A leader who is employed full-time is predicted to contribute more than five hours a month less to Sierra Club activity relative to their nonemployed colleagues. None of the motivation indicators show an increase of more than 3.3 hours with a shift from mean levels of motivation to the 90th percentile.</p>
<p>Turning to the organization-level variables, organizational resources show a substantial effect. Moving a leader from an entity operating with the mean number of members to an entity at the 90th percentile would increase that leader’s time contribution by more than five hours. The three indicators of leader interaction context also show substantial effects. Leadership interdependence increases an individual leader’s time contribution by about 2.3 hours per month as interdependency rises to the 90th percentile. Increasingly unequal time sharing reduces time commitment by more than 1.7 hours per month. And leaders who spend 29 percent of their time in meetings (the 90th percentile) are likely to spend more than four hours less on Sierra Club activities each month compared to leaders who spend only 19 percent (the mean) of their time in meetings.</p>
<p>It is particularly instructive to consider three of the variables with large predicted effects: the number of Sierra Club trainings an individual attended, whether that person was employed full-time, and the proportion of time spent in meetings. Employment status is a clearly influential individual characteristic and likely one beyond the association’s control. The other two factors are organizational. Leaders could modify the time an ExCom devotes to meetings. Trainings, which can be an indicator of individual civic skills, also suggest the extent to which the organization invests in building its leaders’ civic and motivational capacities. Given the similar sizes of their effects, this means that providing additional leader trainings or restructuring ExCom time usage can have as much—or even more—influence on a leader’s time commitment as leaving full-time paid employment.</p>
<p>Similarly, organizations that work interdependently and equitably can have an effect on behavioral commitment comparable to recruiting leaders at the 90th percentile of motivation. Put another way, increasing the typical leader’s political motivation level from average to the 90th percentile is comparable to moving that same typical leader from a leadership team with average levels of interdependence to one at the 90th percentile of this interaction context. This finding is a striking statement on the potential effect of organizational design on leaders’ commitment.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0003122413489877">Table 3</xref> underscores the significance of organizational factors for leaders’ behavioral commitment. The table shows the predicted hours per month for leaders who vary along two dimensions: the extent to which their individual characteristics predispose them to being committed and whether they work in organizations likely to foster greater commitment. The boxes on the off-diagonal show the relative impact of individual versus organizational factors on leadership time. The top right-hand box shows predicted hours for leaders with the most favorable individual characteristics (e.g., a leader who was retired, had extensive Sierra Club training, and was highly motivated by political change) working in organizations with the least favorable characteristics (e.g., one with low team interdependence, proportionally more time in meetings, and relatively inequitable distribution of leader time). The bottom left-hand box, in contrast, shows leaders with the least favorable individual characteristics working in the most favorable organizations. The difference is stark. Leaders with unfavorable individual characteristics working in strong organizations are predicted to spend more than five times more hours on Sierra Club activities than leaders with favorable individual characteristics working in weak organizations.</p>

<p>The final, multilevel model explains 32 percent of the overall variance of the data. Only 26 percent of within-group variance is explained, but at the organization level, the model explains almost 42 percent of between-organization variance. Individual-level factors like time availability and political change motivation are important, but the organizational context plays a major explanatory role as well. These significant organizational effects are noteworthy given how little research has considered organizational factors in explanations of voluntarism and association leadership.</p>
<p>Possible concerns about the causal direction of our analyses exist. Like much influential research on associational participation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003122413489877">Almond and Verba 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0003122413489877">Knoke 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0003122413489877">Verba et al. 1995</xref>), our study uses a cross-sectional design, posing challenges for causal interpretations. In our case, most of the demographic variables (e.g., education) raise little concern because they are temporally prior to the decision to contribute time. Most of our organizational factors (e.g., number of members and transfer revenue) are similarly unproblematic because they are unlikely to be influenced by a particular leader’s increased time contribution (members are primarily recruited via national mass mailings and then allotted to entities by zip code; transfer revenues are independent of locally raised funds). Our measures of skills and motivation, however, are more debatable. One could argue that individuals who commit more hours become more likely to participate in Sierra Club trainings (because they seek out training opportunities or because they are sought out by the organization). Given the question format, in which time is estimated for the prior year, we suspect that most training occurred before the period for which time contribution was reported, increasing the likelihood of our causal interpretation. Similarly, individuals who spend more time leading the group could develop higher levels of motivation through their activity. While this may be the case for individuals at low levels of time contribution, we find it more likely that individuals contributing substantial amounts of time—and experiencing the opportunity costs—would not do so in the absence of some reasonably strong level of motivation that aligns with organizational opportunities to act upon it. We recognize the possibility for reverse (or, more likely, bidirectional) causality regarding these relationships, but we contend that the observed effects are most plausibly interpreted in the direction we suggest.</p>

<title>Conclusions and Implications</title>
<p>In this study we make two central contributions to the study of leadership and civic associations. Theoretically, we developed a synthetic model that draws on scholarship on civic participation, volunteering, social movements, and team management to explain behavioral commitment among leaders. Empirically, we tested these claims using a multilevel study of associations and their leaders. Given the importance of leader commitment to the survival and success of associations, we hope our extension of these theories to new empirical terrain will motivate further research along these lines.</p>
<p>The preceding findings suggest several conclusions. First, leaders’ behavioral commitment to civic associations is patterned along important individual-level characteristics. Although some standard demographic traits (e.g., age, income, and marital status) do not offer much leverage in explaining leader commitment, variations across individuals in terms of skills, time availability, and motivation are important in understanding why some leaders are more behaviorally committed than others. Second, there are important and currently underappreciated organizational stories here. Individuals who participate in more trainings contribute more time. Furthermore, ExComs that structure themselves as interdependent teams—working together to accomplish common goals, sharing work more evenly among team members, and allocating ExCom hours to fulfilling, productive uses—elicit far more time from leaders. In short, the answer to the question “why are some leaders more behaviorally committed than others?” is two-pronged: individuals with certain personal characteristics are more committed, but individuals embedded in the right organizational contexts are as well.</p>
<p>We highlight two main implications of this study that motivate new directions for theory and research. First, our work demonstrates the analytic importance of distinguishing between members and leaders, and between the process of joining and the process of volunteering. We noted that most prior research examines the contributions of rank-and-file members rather than leaders. At the individual level, our findings suggest some factors that explain participation, such as resources and skills, are also related to leadership, while others, such as income and marital status, are not. Moreover, our reading of these data suggests that resources, skills, and time provide less leverage in differentiating among the select group of people that become leaders than they might in distinguishing leaders from members. A stronger test of this perspective will require data that compare members and leaders directly, but our results suggest this is an important analysis to undertake. We suspect some of the organizational factors we point to as influencing leaders could also account for differences in members’ and volunteers’ contributions. For example, participation structured to reinforce social solidarity should generate greater behavioral commitment from members too.</p>
<p>Second, our findings regarding the importance of team dynamics in shaping individual voluntary actions have substantial implications for theory and research on leaders, volunteers, and associations. For example, we find that meetings undermine leader commitment—but organizations need mechanisms for information-sharing, coordination, and decision-making. We suspect well-run meetings could foster greater interdependence and more equitable time distribution among leaders. This raises the question of what makes for a well-run meeting in a civic association. Popular treatments of what makes a good business meeting abound (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0003122413489877">Doyle and Strauss 1993</xref>), but even the most systematic investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0003122413489877">Tropman 2003</xref>) provide limited empirical evidence. We need new research that investigates how civic association meetings vary and why some are more effective than others. In addition, we find that interdependent teams generate more behavioral commitment among leaders. Several mechanisms may explain this finding, including the possibility that working interdependently makes it harder for individuals to free-ride, that interdependence generates greater trust, or that interdependence strengthens the relational bonds between team members. Our research highlights the importance of better understanding team interdependence and points to exploration of these mechanisms as an avenue for further study.</p>
<p>More generally, scholars have long recognized the importance of thinking about the organizational side of recruitment in voluntary associations and social movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0003122413489877">Zald and McCarthy 1987</xref>). Our results demonstrate the need for more carefully specified models explaining commitment beyond the initial decision to join—models that must consider organizational contexts and mechanisms that structure individuals’ experiences inside associations. We examined one set of organizational factors that influence behavioral commitment among leaders, and others may exist, including factors that account for variation in the socio-political context within which these organizations work. To test these and other hypotheses, we need studies that nest individuals within particular organizational contexts. Conventional surveys provide limited leverage regarding the way organizations shape participation and leadership. Alternatively, most organization studies provide only aggregate characteristics of members or leaders and lack data on how leaders interact and the consequences of their participation. Only by connecting these levels of analysis can we empirically trace the important effects of organizational context on individual outcomes.</p>
<p>Of course, as noted earlier, the multilevel analysis conducted here is based on cross-sectional data. We argued that our interpretations are more causally probable than the reverse and leveraged the advantages of multilevel analyses to buttress our claims. For instance, increased commitment on the part of any one leader can affect the quality of organizational practices such as meetings only indirectly, because effects of individual actions are nested within the organizational context. Nonetheless, longitudinal data would provide a more rigorous test of causal claims. Conducting research similar to ours with a panel design would allow one to track changes in organizational features (e.g., the leader interaction context or achievement of organizational goals), individual factors (e.g., transitions from employment to retirement), and even broader local or national contextual factors (e.g., the rise of an issue on policy agendas) that might influence commitment.</p>
<p>This study could be extended in two other important ways: to examine other dimensions of commitment, especially psychological ones, and to study other associational settings. Commitment is a complex, multidimensional construct that has multiple psychological and behavioral dimensions. Because our measure of commitment focused solely on hours volunteered, our study examined the individual and organizational precursors of only one type of behavioral commitment. More research is needed to understand if organizational factors similarly shape the psychological states that underlie commitment and other indicators of behavioral commitment. In addition, extension of the study design to other associational settings would allow for identification of patterns common to all associations as well as those unique to certain groups’ particular substantive and demographic characteristics.</p>
<p>More broadly, scholars should give much greater attention to organizational structures and practices in our efforts to understand who participates and who leads—and how much they do of each. Associations that invest in current leaders by promoting skill development and strong leadership teams stand to benefit in important ways. Insights of the team management perspective should be incorporated into the study of association leaders and, potentially, volunteering more generally. Well-functioning teams may not only generate commitment but could also produce better organizational outcomes as well. Purely individual-level explanations of volunteer time contributions lead to an atomized understanding of the process of engagement and commitment. Leaders’ and volunteers’ work is always nested in organizational contexts that channel the amount and kinds of work individuals do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0003122413489877">Musick and Wilson 2008</xref>). Adopting a team approach leads us to reconceptualize individual contributions not as the final output of interest but rather as a byproduct of group processes. When collectives act, patterns of behavior among participants—emerging from group-level interactions—shift in new directions. To understand and influence individuals’ actions, we should adjust our theory and research to examine what groups do, how that varies, and the consequences for leaders and their organizations.</p>
<p>Finally, these results carry a practical implication as well. Organizers seeking greater commitment from leaders can choose how to address that need. Recruiting new leaders with more free time or more intrinsic motivation is one approach. Our work shows, however, that organizers may have more success generating commitment if they instead focus on training the leaders they already have, both in the individual skills needed to complete tasks and in the collective skills needed to work as a highly effective leadership team.</p>

<p>To ensure that the inequality finding was not an artifact of how the dependent variable was constructed, we trichotomized our dataset by the average number of hours per ExCom. We estimated the model on each subset of data. The inequality variable remained negative and statistically significant across all three subsets.

<p><bold>Matthew Baggetta</bold> is Assistant Professor of Public &amp; Environmental Affairs at Indiana University-Bloomington. His research focuses on civil society, civic engagement, voluntary associations, and social movements. In particular, he seeks to identify the causal impacts associations may have on participants. He is developing a new project examining the civic development of youth in campus-based associations. His work has appeared in <italic>American Journal of Sociology, Social Forces</italic>, and <italic>Perspectives on Politics</italic>, and he is a contributing editor at <italic>Mobilizing Ideas</italic>, a scholarly blog sponsored by the Center for the Study of Social Movements at the University of Notre Dame.</p>
<p><bold>Hahrie Han</bold> is Associate Professor of Political Science at Wellesley College. Her research focuses on how citizens connect to politics. Her first book, <italic>Moved to Action: Motivation, Participation, and Inequality in American Politics</italic> (Stanford University Press 2009), examines the way people become motivated to participate in politics, looking particularly at how to engage underprivileged populations in political action. A recent project examining the strategies that political organizations (e.g., civic associations, parties, and campaigns) can use to motivate participation and develop political leaders was conducted while a Robert Wood Johnson Scholar in Health Policy (2009 to 2011, Harvard).</p>
<p><bold>Kenneth T. Andrews</bold> is Professor of Sociology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. His research examines social movements, political institutions, and social change. In past research he has examined the diffusion of protest, media attention, and the consequences of movements.
