<p><bold>Reviewed by:</bold> Maggie Jackson, <italic>Teesside University, England</italic></p>
<p>This book, now in a third edition, covers a very broad range of areas concerned with working with children. It is divided into four parts, these being: an ecological-developmental framework for helping children; the process of helping children; different methods of helping children; and helping children in special circumstances.</p>
<p>The sections are worth dipping into although they do seem to cover the same ground if read from front to back. The first section provides some worthwhile reading. Chapter two provides a quick overview of child development, the importance of working with parents and ethical conduct, and is a helpful summary for beginning social workers or students. The short section on the ‘rescue fantasy’ (p. 35) and also the following section called ‘competing and triangulating with the parents’ (p. 35) pick up important pitfalls for students and briefly offer advice in a clear and simple way.</p>
<p>Throughout we are offered case studies as examples which illustrate the methods and issues being presented. We are also taken back to the case studies to further illustrate certain points as the chapters move on, which is also useful.</p>
<p>The second section covers relevant issues relating to working in multi-agency settings and considers the purpose of assessment which Webb suggests is ‘to point to needs that require intervention’ (p. 99), a helpful comment to keep in mind when overwhelmed with information gathering. We are taken through this process and offered examples of tools that may be helpful in recording information. These pro-formas come with copyright permissions.</p>
<p>Sections three and four cover particular ways of intervening with children. Part three covers working with the family, individual play therapy, group work and school-based work. Part four is about ‘special’ circumstances which include, foster placements, bullying, illness and death and divorced and blended families. I think the title of this section may be poorly chosen as it would seem that these circumstances are far from ‘special’ in the remit of most social workers, nonetheless there is some useful and worthwhile material to read here. The section on loss is nice, showing that loss is relevant in many situations and an awareness of its impact can be key to successful intervention and if no other section is read then this one is worth having a look at.</p>
<p>The most problematic aspect of this book is that it is written for an American audience and so all of the cultural references are ‘amero-centric’ as is all of the legislation. This need not detract from the some of the content but may cause the reader to want to skim over certain sections where the focus does not apply outside the US. This is also noticeable in the many references to the use of DSM-IV-TR. This is where cultural differences with the role of the social worker and their education and training in the USA may not align with those who trained and work in Britain.</p>
<p>The use of government statistics to discuss problem issues – how many children live in poverty and so on, again is inevitably based on American figures – and perhaps more worryingly for its intended audience, these statistics often seem to be outdated – some from the 1990s, despite this being a third revision. It would seem that the statistics ought to be revised to show current trends. The appendices are all American and refer only to US agencies but we are given the website addresses which may provide useful support.</p>
<p>Take this book off the shelf and dip into it; you will find some interesting sections.</p>
