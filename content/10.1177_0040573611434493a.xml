<p><italic>Mark</italic></p>
<p>William C. Placher</p>
<p>Louisville: Westminster John Knox, 2010. xiii + 272 pp. $30.00</p>
<p>This book is a first and a last. It is one of the inaugural releases in what will be a 36-volume series named <italic>Belief: A Theological Commentary on the Bible</italic>, and it is the final literary gift Bill Placher gave the Christian church before his sudden death in 2008. The book stands at other thresholds, too, as a commentary determined to chip away at disciplinary boundaries that have arisen between systematic theologians, like Placher, and biblical scholars, who in recent generations have made nearly a bailiwick of the biblical commentary genre. Fittingly, the subject of investigation itself deals with the notion of boundaries transgressed: the Gospel of Mark, a story of God’s disruptive incursion into human society through the ministry, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Without belaboring a literary or historical argument for doing so, Placher reads Mark as a document meant to bring good news to persecuted Christians during the Jewish–Roman War. Equally informing this reading is Placher’s assumption that his twenty-first-century readers want to discover how Mark continues to nurture faith. The commentary moves smoothly—and laudably—between treating the Gospel’s first-century context and addressing the theological questions it may provoke for readers now. The smoothness avoids both shallowness and sentimentality. Mark has a way of keeping its interpreters honest, as seen in sentences like these: “We modern readers are fooling ourselves if we think that we, by contrast [to the frightened Gerasenes in Mark 5], would have liked having Jesus around. We do not understand Mark’s picture of him unless we recognize that he is terrifying” (81).</p>
<p>Like most, this commentary follows Mark’s narrative sequence, from 1:1 to 16:8. Initial comments about a biblical passage transition quickly into discussion of the text’s theological implications or related theological themes. For example, in two pages commenting on the man with an unclean spirit (Mark 1:21–28), the author touches a number of topics: highlighting the incongruity of encountering an “unclean” entity in a synagogue, noting that today Christians often try to keep disruptive people from upsetting our orderly church services, and explaining that demons might recognize Jesus’ true identity, but not rightly “believe” in him (an explanation propelled by quotations from the Book of James, Augustine, Calvin, and the Heidelberg Catechism to expound the nature of authentic faith). Readers may gain more insight into how demonic forces relate to Jesus in Mark, but they might also lose track of the particular fact that this pericope includes no mention of “faith/belief.” Similarly, the treatment of the Transfiguration launches a sustained discussion about the nature of eternity (a topic perhaps more interesting to us than to Mark), drawing insights from Kathryn Tanner, Jürgen Moltmann, and Wolfhart Pannenberg. Placher converses with a wide array of ancient and modern theologians, usually by means of short quotations on theological topics. Augustine, John Calvin, and Karl Barth make the most frequent appearances.</p>
<p>Historical and literary analyses of Mark cooperate effectively in Placher’s exegesis. He gives deserved attention to the significance of geographical references in the Gospel and occasionally considers the political implications that must permeate a story about a Jew crucified in Roman Judea during the mid-first century. Most of the theological topics Placher chooses for sustained consideration in separate sections of “further reflections” match what one would expect from any Markan commentary: demons, miracles, purity, Messiah, the Holy Spirit, and others. These sections enhance the book’s ability to instruct a general audience; more importantly, they are, like most of Placher’s prose, crisp and thoughtful. However, since specific scenes or the appearance of particular terms in Mark prompt them, these extended discussions occasionally risk diminishing the whole Gospel’s ability to inform our theological understandings. For example, Jesus’ mention of his life as a “ransom” (Mark 10:45) initiates a three-page overview of classical atonement theories. By contrast, his statement about rulers who overpower and tyrannize others (Mark 10:42) receives hardly a mention. Readers can easily miss how Jesus’ characterization of abusive power informs the path he chooses to follow and the specific kind of domination he must suffer for this “ransom” to occur.</p>
<p>Placher may not say much about Mark that breaks new exegetical ground, but neither was this his intention. Rather, his manner of treating the Gospel makes the commentary a welcome gift to many pastors, students, and congregations who seek to engage Scripture in meaningful conversations about the nature of our lives and the God we encounter through Jesus Christ. Placher knew how important it is to experience the story of Jesus as a story that matters for us.</p>
