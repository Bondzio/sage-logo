<p>John Donaldson explores the relation between economic growth and poverty reduction through a within-country comparison of two of China’s poorest and most remote provinces: Yunnan and Guizhou. The main puzzle he aims to resolve is why rapid investment in economic growth has not led to much poverty alleviation in Yunnan, whereas a policy of slower and smaller-scale growth has brought about a much better result on the poverty front in Guizhou. Obviously, especially in a still state-dominated economy such as China’s, government policy will play a key role, even in the era of market reform. But there are a range of choices that the state (and this might mean at the central level, or as power in China decentralizes, at the provincial level or below) can make and strategies it can try to implement, and there is no guarantee that they will achieve their goals. What is clear to him from the outset is that investment in fast growth alone will not do the trick, and that rather than resolving inequality through redistributive measures, a slower-paced strategy working on a small scale at the grassroots will work better on all fronts. The clever pun of the title is the giveaway: small works do work.</p>
<p>Guizhou and Yunnan share a number of features: both are far from the coast; they have substantial numbers of minority ethnic groups; they are scenically gorgeous but as this is the result of very mountainous and rocky terrain, transportation and infrastructure are major challenges; and they have large reserves of natural resources. They were in a rather similar state of underdevelopment at the start of the post-Mao reforms in 1979.</p>
<p>Donaldson employs a multi-method research design to try to understand the different forms of interaction between state and market in these two provinces: facilitating, altering, or replacing the market. In addition to utilizing official data, he conducted extensive fieldwork from 2003 to 2004, with repeat annual visits until 2010.</p>
<p>After an overview chapter introducing the two provinces, he speculates as to why places which seem so similar chose different strategies. These include policies from the center, which may constrain or encourage local experimentation; the initial conditions in each province; and provincial leaders—their origins, career trajectories, and prospects. A figure central to Guizhou’s focus on poverty reduction was Hu Jintao, who in 2002 became China’s top leader, and brought to Beijing the philosophy he developed while serving in Guizhou, known as Scientific Development. This embraces what Donaldson calls “the spirit of the micro-oriented state” (p. 59).</p>
<p>The core of the book examines four elements Donaldson deems central to the differing development paths of Yunnan and Guizhou: road building, migration, tourism, and coal mining. All four were important to each province, but the variation in their implementation is crucial to understanding their differing impact on growth or poverty reduction. On roads: Yunnan invested in highways which stimulated exports and tourism, while Guizhou focused on roads to provide market access to poor, isolated rural areas. On migration: many Guizhou folk took advantage of the opportunities to go East for work, remitting money back to their families. Fewer Yunnanese migrated, which Donaldson calls a “missed opportunity” (p. 101).</p>
<p>The book really comes alive with the discussion of tourism in each province. Yunnan and Guizhou have striking scenery as well as a wealth of minority cultures. Yunnan invested in non-poor areas, little concerned with poverty reduction per se, while Guizhou did encourage small-scale tourist spots, including home stays with farmers. The final study looks at the coal industry. There are state-owned, township and village-owned, and micro private mines, with different impacts on growth and poverty alleviation.</p>
<p>Overall, Donaldson concludes, Yunnan’s authorities employed a market-altering approach, focusing on growth, investing in large key industries and urbanization. Guizhou does not easily fit into any category, as its leaders were more willing to experiment with different market strategies, but the key factor in the leaders’ thinking was small-scale, poverty reduction. The main policy implication is for leaders in any country to consider alternative routes to poverty alleviation, especially through micro-oriented policies. In other words, small is beautiful.</p>
<p>The author carefully considers alternative explanations for policy choices, their outcomes, and possible other explanations for the different strategies and their outcomes. He clearly favors the small-scale approach of Guizhou, and he convinced me as well. I did, however, note several rather glaring absences from the presentation. For instance, there was no discussion of gender, either in terms of migration or market activity, or especially in the tourism industry. As several scholars have noted, sex tourism is rampant in this region. For a book trumpeting micro development, I was surprised to see no mention of microfinance or of Muhammed Yunus’s Grameen Bank model, which has been implemented in some parts of rural China, focusing on women micro-entrepreneurs. I would have liked to see some discussion of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals and how Yunnan and Guizhou stack up on a global scale. Finally, there was no discussion of non-governmental organizations, domestic or (particularly) international, which are active in these provinces, especially in fields such as HIV/AIDS, and environmental protection.</p>
<p>As luck would have it, I read this book just prior to a trip to Guizhou. Energized by Donaldson’s “small is beautiful” mantra, I was stunned to see that Guizhou has now done an about turn: there was large-scale industry, rapid urban development, the construction of super highways and bridges across the province, and a push into large-scale tourism. It left me wondering if micro-development should be seen as a stage creating a strong base for a “take-off” to rapid growth, rather than an end in itself.</p>
