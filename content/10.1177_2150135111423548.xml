<abstract><p>The 2011 symposium opened with a consideration of the challenges in the management of children undergoing the Fontan operation. Management options for patients with congenitally corrected transposition were then discussed, using several illustrative case examples and a review of the results from the Texas Children’s Hospital. There was a session dedicated to borderline hypoplastic left heart syndrome, concluding with a review of the results of the Single Ventricle Reconstruction (SVR) Trial in North America. Results of pediatric mechanical circulatory support were considered in the context of surgery for anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery after a more general overview of pediatric applications of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and ventricular assist devices. Problems of monitoring in the intensive care unit, quality assurance, feeding algorithms for children, and morbidity associated with mechanical ventilation occupied most of the second day’s sessions. Results of the arterial switch operation for transposition, issues related to neonatal brain protection during open cardiac procedures, and, finally, training paradigms for congenital heart surgeons concluded the symposium’s talks.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Walter Sisulu Paediatric Cardiac Centre for Africa (WSPCCA) was opened by national patron Mr Nelson Mandela on November 7, 2003. Its core mission is based on service, training, and research. As part of its teaching and research culture, an international symposium has been held annually, starting four years ago. The 2011 symposium featured Dr Charles D. Fraser of Texas Children’s Hospital and Dr Peter Laussen of Children’s Hospital Boston as guest speakers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2150135111423548">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Typically, each year’s symposium focuses on problematic areas in the Centre’s experience which are pertinent to that year. The 2011 symposium highlighted challenges in the management of children undergoing the Fontan operation, management options for patients with congenitally corrected transposition, treatment options for the child with hypoplastic left heart complex, and results of pediatric mechanical circulatory support in the context of anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (PA). Patient monitoring in the intensive care unit (ICU), quality assurance, feeding algorithms for children, and morbidity associated with mechanical ventilation were other areas of intense debate.</p>

<title>Proceedings Summary</title>
<sec id="section4-2150135111423548">
<title>Functionally Univentricular Circulations</title>
<p>The WSPCCA team considered Fontan conversions in patients with failure of the Fontan circulation following classical (atriopulmonary) procedures with complications including dysrhythmias, ventricular dysfunction, and pleural effusions or protein losing enteropathy. It was debated whether prophylactic conversion was indicated simply for the anatomical substrate of a dilated right atrium. There are interesting variations pertaining to the failure of a Glenn (superior cavopulmonary) anastomosis. Persistent cyanosis early postoperatively can sometimes be addressed with the addition of a small left-sided modified Blalock–Taussig shunt (delayed pulsatile Glenn). A case presentation described an instance of extraordinary reversal of Fontan “operability,” which had been experienced at the Centre. A five-month-old patient underwent creation of a superior cavopulmonary anastomosis (bidirectional Glenn) and exhibited prohibitively high superior vena cava pressure postoperatively. At the time of takedown, of the Glenn anastomosis, a central aortopulmonary shunt was constructed. Eighteen months later, after catheter confirmation of “operable hemodynamics,” a Fontan procedure was successfully performed. Twelve years later, she is well and asymptomatic. This case illustrated the principle that estimation of PA pressure and resistance within a range that is generally considered as criteria for operability by cavopulmonary connection does not always guarantee a successful Glenn/Fontan circulation. Postoperative management should be aimed at judicious control of preload and afterload, maintenance of atrioventricular synchrony, and early achievement of spontaneous ventilation whenever possible. Failure of cavopulmonary shunt physiology under one set of conditions at one point in time does not necessarily preclude the possibility of successful cavopulmonary connection or Fontan completion at another point in time under different circumstances.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-2150135111423548">
<title>Congenitally Corrected Transposition</title>
<p>For congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries, the surgical options of classical repair, atrial switch combined with Rastelli, double switch operation, tricuspid repair/replacement, Fontan operation, and 1½ ventricle repair were reviewed by Dr Fraser and the WSPCCA team. An atrial switch combined with a Rastelli procedure is used in patients with congenitally corrected transposition, ventricular septal defect, and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. For patients without left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, who are being considered for anatomical repair, left ventricular training (PA band) is important but was considered unlikely to be successful after 15 years of age. Good results can be anticipated with a “classical” repair, provided there is no right ventricular (RV) and/or tricuspid valve dysfunction. Both RV and tricuspid valve dysfunctions can improve remarkably after a double switch or 1½ ventricle repair.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-2150135111423548">
<title>Hypoplastic Left Heart Complex</title>
<p>In managing neonates with borderline hypoplastic left heart structures (hypoplastic left heart complex),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135111423548">1</xref></sup> the WSPCCA team noted that a strategy which includes relief of critical left heart obstructions together with patiently promoting left ventricular filling, maintaining left ventricular after load, and minimizing myocardial oxygen consumption may be associated with remarkable promotion of left ventricular growth. So, “when is a hypoplast a hypoplast?” is a legitimate question that applies to some (carefully selected) cases. The WSPCCA team presented a case summary of a 2.7-kg twin with a mitral valve diameter of 5.1 mm; aortic valve diameter of 4.5 mm, and aortic arch diameter of 2.0 mm. Only the aortic arch was widened at operation. Despite episodes of postoperative pulmonary edema requiring prolonged ventilator support, four months later the baby has cardiac dimensions and development similar to his unaffected twin.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-2150135111423548">
<title>Single Ventricle Reconstruction Trial</title>
<p>Dr Laussen reported that in the Single Ventricle Reconstruction (SVR) Trial conducted in North America under the auspices of the Pediatric Heart Network, transplant-free survival at 12 months is better with the RV-PA shunt than with a modified Blalock–Taussig shunt. There is however concern with later morbidities of the RV-PA shunt group. Discussion turned to the role of hybrid (combined surgical and catheter directed) management, with the recommendation that the choice of therapeutic strategy should probably be tailored to anatomy and patient factors (size, maturity, and hemodynamic burden).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-2150135111423548">
<title>Mechanical Circulatory Support</title>
<p>Data presented by Dr Fraser showed that The Texas Children’s Hospital has a 55% ten-year survival rate following heart transplantation. Several ventricular assist devices either recently introduced into clinical use (eg, Berlin Heart EXCOR) or currently under development have potential applications for both temporary and more long-term mechanical circulatory support. These devices are generally indicated for patients with a low cardiac output despite optimal medical management, chronic heart failure, and as a bridge to transplantation. Where possible, a ventricular assist device is preferred to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), when the need for prolonged support is anticipated.</p>
<p>The encouraging results of short-term left ventricular assist device (LVAD) application in pediatric cardiac surgery were brought into focus by the WSPCCA team with respect to the management of children with anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA). In the discussion of analysis of predictors of LVAD implantation following ALCAPA repair (including several extreme examples from Africa), it appeared that the left ventricular fractional shortening less than 20% combined with a prolonged aortic cross-clamp time significantly predict LVAD implantation after the repair.</p>
<p>In concluding the session on mechanical circulatory support, the WSPCCA group presented reports of the cases of two infants with severe biventricular dysfunction with barely discernible contractility after cardiopulmonary bypass. The first was a two-month-old infant weighing 3.4 kg who had Down syndrome and underwent repair of complete atrioventricular septal defect and closure of a patent ductus arteriosus. The second was a six-month-old infant weighing 5 kg with a perimembranous ventricular septal defect and reversible pulmonary arterial hypertension. The first infant developed intractable supraventricular tachyarrhythmia immediately postoperatively with severe biventricular dysfunction that persisted into the 12th postoperative hour. The second infant developed acute unexplained myocardial failure after nine hours of fairly stable hemodynamics in the ICU. Both were supported postoperatively with ECMO and the ventricular function recovered completely but only after three to four days. The first patient survived; the other patient died as a result of hypoxic brain injury. The mechanisms underlying the profound ventricular failure and the subsequent recovery were much debated. No clear consensus emerged.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-2150135111423548">
<title>Neonatal Repair of Truncus Arteriosus</title>
<p>The WSPCCA team presented the cases of three neonates who underwent repair of truncus arteriosus without the use of a valved conduit, utilizing variations of techniques previously reported by others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135111423548">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150135111423548">3</xref></sup> One of these patients is now 13 years old and in New York Heart Association functional Class 1. The procedures included removal of the pulmonary arteries from the common arterial trunk together with a large cuff of truncal tissue. The aorta (truncus) was reconstituted with a large pericardial patch. Valveless RV outflow tract continuity was achieved using a direct RV-PA connection augmented with the left atrial appendage posteriorly and a pericardial patch anteriorly. A LeCompte maneuver was necessary in one patient. Considering the limited durability of conduits implanted in neonates, valveless RV-PA connection may be the preferred approach.</p>
<p>The subject of RV-PA conduits was further explored by the WSPCCA team with a description of a unique technique for the challenging removal of a heavily calcified RV-PA conduit. This involves transection of the aorta to facilitate removal of the conduit under clear surgical visualization. The technique allows expeditious replacement of the conduit, simplifying the otherwise difficult anastomosis to the pulmonary artery behind the intact aorta. Following the anastomosis of the distal end of the conduit to the branch pulmonary arteries, the aorta is usually elongated with a tubular Gore-Tex graft to prevent compression of the new conduit.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-2150135111423548">
<title>Surgery for Transposition of the Great Arteries</title>
<p>Dr Fraser noted that in the management of the neonate/infant with transposition, atrial switch procedures historically have achieved satisfactory long-term results in some patients. The arterial switch operation (ASO) offers the possibility of even better long-term results. Concerns with the ASO relate to long-term coronary artery and pulmonary artery stenoses as well as the long-term function of the neoaortic valve and root. The trap door technique for coronary artery reimplantation is intended to alter slightly the plane of attachment, minimizing the likelihood of tension or torsion of the transferred coronary artery. Circulatory arrest is avoided even when repair of aortic arch hypoplasia is required. A unique ascending aorta—arch aortoplasty is used for arch hypoplasia, with coronary artery reimplantation into the dilated neoaortic root, which is sutured to the open concavity of the ascending aorta and arch. Dr Fraser presented the case of a 760-g neonate who underwent a successful ASO. In considering management strategies for patients undergoing ASO, emphasis was placed on balloon atrial septostomy when necessary, preoperative extubation, a left atrial line to avoid overdistension of the left ventricle, and placement of a peritoneal dialysis catheter for peritoneal drainage and dialysis when necessary. A holistic, postoperative team approach is strongly advocated.</p>
<p>The WSPCCA team described six cases of late ASO for transposition of the great arteries with intact ventricular septum in patients up to ten weeks of age; two patients required LVAD but all survived.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135111423548">4</xref></sup> Just how late can the ASO be performed (with LVAD backup) and what is the current role, if any, of retraining the left ventricle? It was noted that other teams around the world are similarly exploring the age limits for performing the ASO for transposition with intact ventricular septum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135111423548">5</xref></sup>

<title>Congenital Isolation of the Aortic Arch Arteries</title>
<p>Congenital isolation can affect any of the branches of the aortic arch. This occurs when there is congenital absence of continuity between the aorta and the arch vessel with a persistent connection to the ipsilateral pulmonary artery through a patent or nonpatent ductus arteriosus. Following the previous year’s report on isolation of the subclavian artery, the WSPCCA team embarked on a review of cases of isolation involving all the branches of the aortic arch. The results were based on an extensive literature search of the major indexing databases and indicated that isolation occurs with a right aortic arch four times as often as with a left aortic arch. Reimplantation of the isolated vessel was considered superior to simple ligation of the connecting ductus to prevent the occurrence of vertebrobasilar insufficiency in adulthood.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-2150135111423548">
<title>Intracardiac Mass Lesions in Children</title>
<p>Four cases of intracardiac mass lesions of fungal and thrombotic etiology in children admitted to the ICU were presented by the WSPCCA team. Central venous lines are often implicated. A large proportion of such masses may go unnoticed because of lack of symptoms. Large fungal masses tend to be obstructive and require surgical intervention despite prolonged antifungal therapy. Thrombotic masses usually regress with the use of heparin-based therapy. The associated central venous line must be removed. In the discussion that followed, Dr Laussen emphasized that running small doses of heparin through in-dwelling central venous lines is practiced at many centers and thought to be an effective prophylactic measure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-2150135111423548">
<title>Quality Assurance in the ICU</title>
<p>Focusing on ICU problems, Dr Laussen noted that the quality of ICU care is more important than sheer volumes of patients treated. The contribution of quality care to overall results was illustrated with experience from Children’s Hospital Boston. With appropriate processes of care in place, overall survival to discharge following cardiac arrest in that center was 81.4% and 63% following the use of ECMO.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-2150135111423548">
<title>Prolonged Mechanical Ventilation in the ICU</title>
<p>Some neonates and infants require prolonged mechanical ventilation in the postoperative period. This may have major pathological consequences involving various portions of the upper airway—sinus, supraglottic, glottic, subglottic, and tracheal levels. When one considers the costs and potential morbidities associated with prolonged tracheal intubation and mechanical intubation (including ventilator-associated pneumonia), timely and safe extubation becomes a priority. The use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in mechanical ventilation may add to the morbidity (barotrauma). However, PEEP has many beneficial effects, including maintenance of functional residual capacity to improve oxygenation, redistribution of lung water, increased RV afterload while decreasing LV afterload, and increasing pulmonary vascular resistance when desirable. In the concluding section of the ensuing discussion, both Dr Laussen and the WSPCCA team concurred that every attempt should be made to expedite extubation promptly in the postoperative period.</p>

<title>The 2012 Symposium</title>
<p>The next symposium will be held in March 2012 at the same venue, but this time toward the end of the third week instead of the usual midweek schedule. We hope to benefit from the participation of two or three international speakers as visiting faculty.</p>
