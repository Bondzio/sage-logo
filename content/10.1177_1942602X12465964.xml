<abstract>
<p>School nurses should be engaging in evidence-based practice (EBP) in their health room settings as supported by the initiatives of the Institute of Medicine. EBP is a set of skills that health professionals can use in order to ensure high quality and current clinical care is provided. School nurses are faced with a diverse and complex population of children and often work in isolation from nursing peers, which can lead to limited professional peer discussions about recent changes or outdated clinical practices. EBP combines the use of evidence from the literature, expert guidelines, clinician expertise, and client preferences in order to provide optimum care. This article leads the school nurse through the process and use of EBP in the school setting.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Evidence-based practice (EBP) has replaced the traditional model of authority-based decision making in health care over the last couple of decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1942602X12465964">Oh et al., 2010</xref>). All health professionals are being held to the standard of using scientific knowledge found in the research literature. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) identifies the use of EBP as one of their core competencies for health care professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1942602X12465964">Greiner &amp; Knebel, 2003</xref>), including school nurses. Just as teachers and school administrators are being held accountable for improved student performance with regard to academics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1942602X12465964">Powers, Bowen, &amp; Bowen, 2011</xref>), school nurses, as health professionals, are held to the IOM’s standard of health care. The increasingly diverse and complex population of children that the school nurse encounters makes EBP even more important in order to deliver high quality care in an effective way in the school health room (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1942602X12465964">Adams &amp; Barron, 2010</xref>). This article will guide the school nurse through the process and use of EBP in the school setting.</p>
<sec id="section2-1942602X12465964">
<title>What Is Evidence-Based Practice?</title>
<p>EBP is a learned set of skills that uses a problem-solving method in order to provide quality clinical care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1942602X12465964">Oh et al., 2010</xref>). It uses a three-pronged approach involving the use of current best evidence, the clinical expertise of the health care professional, and consideration of patient preferences and values. EBP is not strictly the use of science from research evidence but rather requires the health care provider to merge current science with clinical expertise in a context of caring that recognizes and respects the uniqueness of patient preferences and culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1942602X12465964">Melnyk &amp; Fineout-Overholt, 2011</xref>). This process promotes optimum, high-quality outcomes for the recipients of nursing care. Health professionals may initially fear that EBP could limit their decision making in practice; however, the use of current scientific evidence often leads to increased options and confidence for the health professional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1942602X12465964">Taylor, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>With the rapidly changing science of health care, usual practices steeped in tradition can quickly become outdated and obsolete. The phrase “because we have always done it that way” is no longer accepted as valid reasoning. Science and technology are constantly evolving, which requires the health professional to continually evaluate outcomes and effectiveness of the care provided rather than relying on practices that are based in habit instead of research. Payer sources, credentialing agencies, health care organizations, recipients of care, and even health care providers themselves want and demand care be both based on and supported by evidence. Sound and supported practices lead to reduced costs, improved productivity, reduced variation in care, empowered health care providers, and improved provider satisfaction with the care administered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1942602X12465964">Melnyk &amp; Fineout-Overholt, 2011</xref>). School nurses, like all health care providers, are facing the pressures of demonstrating improved productivity and quality care with limited resources such as time and money (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1942602X12465964">Manning, 2011</xref>). Additionally, school nurses often work in isolation or in nontraditional settings and, therefore, may have limited access to peer-to-peer professional discussions related to recent changes in guidelines and updated best practice information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1942602X12465964">Adams &amp; Barron, 2010</xref>). Integrating EBP into the school nurse’s practice and health room environment is of increasing importance.</p>

<title>Using EBP in the School Health Room</title>
<sec id="section4-1942602X12465964">
<title>Developing the Spirit of Inquiry</title>
<p>Using EBP in the school health room starts with a spirit of inquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1942602X12465964">Fineout-Overholt &amp; Stillwell, 2011</xref>). By adopting a questioning approach toward nursing practice and the population served, school nurses can often identify many clinical questions. These questions may be related to student care issues, current practices, or even challenging old practices within the health room. Evaluating the health room log book is a method school nurses can use to identify questions for evidence-based projects. Understanding the high frequency, high volume trends of the health room helps school nurses focus on the most important issues in their practice. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1942602X12465964">Figure 1</xref> provides a list of questions to help the school nurse identify and develop clinical questions for further evaluation. When multiple practice questions are identified, the school nurse should prioritize by choosing clinical questions that either have the most important consequences or questions that occur with increased frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1942602X12465964">Fineout-Overholt &amp; Stillwell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1942602X12465964">Taylor, 2012</xref>). Collaboration with other nurses in the district or surrounding area may also help identify priority clinical or practice questions.</p>

<title>Developing a Researchable Question</title>
<p>Once the school nurse has identified the issue or area of concern, the next step is formulating the clinical question. Careful articulation of the question will help yield an effective and efficient literature search of the most relevant information. The PICOT (population, intervention or issue, comparison group, outcome, and time frame) question format is a highly effective way of developing a clinical question that is focused, specific, searchable, and limits the amount of irrelevant information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1942602X12465964">Fineout-Overholt &amp; Stillwell, 2011</xref>)</p>
<p>Developing a PICOT question is a simple process. The five different types of questions that can be developed include</p>
<list id="list1-1942602X12465964" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>intervention questions that target effective outcome identification,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>prediction questions that ascertain associated risks for an outcome,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>diagnostic questions that probe for mechanisms related to accurate diagnosis,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>etiology questions that examine conditions highly associated with an outcome, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>meaning questions that ask how an experience influences an outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1942602X12465964">Fineout-Overholt &amp; Stillwell, 2011</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1942602X12465964">Table 1</xref> provides a template for adapting a clinical question into the PICOT format. The question is crafted by plugging in the appropriate population, intervention or issue, comparison group when applicable, outcome of interest, and time frame if applicable. As noted, the population, intervention or issue, and outcome of interest are always used but comparison group and time frame may not.</p>

<title>Evaluating the Evidence</title>
<p>The central idea behind evaluating the evidence is to understand that just because something makes logical sense does not necessarily mean it works. The purpose of clinical research is to test interventions in order to evaluate whether or not a clinical practice is effective, makes no difference, or is harmful. For example, a common practice had been to require students with pediculosis to be free of nits before returning to school. Such “no nit” policies are not based on sound evidence. In reality, exclusion from school for prolong periods of time can be detrimental to students’ academic progress and does not necessarily reduce pediculosis transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1942602X12465964">Pontius &amp; Teskey, 2011</xref>). This example illustrates the need for use and evaluation of the evidence in everyday practices.</p>
<p>Not all research is of equal significance. The certainty by which a nurse can put a given intervention into practice is based upon the quality of the research. Research studies fall into a simple hierarchical order of high, intermediate, and low levels of evidence.</p>
<p>High-level evidence is supported by large, multi-centered, randomized controlled trials. Meta-analysis is a process by which the results of multiple clinical trials are pooled to add strength to the findings. The highest levels of evidence for practice are those that are supported by meta-analysis or multiple multi-centered randomized controlled trials. The evidence from high-level research is recommended for clinical practice.</p>
<p>Intermediate-level evidence includes support from high-quality prospective studies from a single center or studies that did not randomly assign subjects to treatment groups. Observational studies that do not include data collection at multiple points in time and case reports are also considered intermediate level evidence. The results of intermediate-level studies are limited in their power to be applied into general practice. Therefore, evidence from intermediate-level research is implemented cautiously.</p>
<p>Evidence is judged as low level when there is limited scientific support. This may mean that a small number of studies have been conducted or that a small number of subjects have been evaluated. Sometimes the literature search reveals multiple studies with conflicting results. In this case, further research must be done before a practice change can be widely adopted because it is unknown whether an intervention works or not. If no clinical research is available, nurses must rely on expert opinion or group consensus; this is considered low-level evidence. Low-level evidence is not adequate to support a practice change.</p>
<p>Searching for high-quality literature is possible even if the school nurse does not have access to medical libraries or university databases. It is also helpful to subscribe to high-quality, peer-reviewed nursing journals. Many journal subscriptions include online resources for subscribers. Also, many public databases can be accessed using the Internet. A list of available resources for searching a topic of clinical significance is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1942602X12465964">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>The use of expert guidelines is another option for busy clinicians looking for clinical recommendations that are based in evidence. Expert guidelines are recommendations that are systematically developed through synthesis of the current evidence by experts in the related field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1942602X12465964">Grinspun, Melnyk, &amp; Fineout-Overholt, 2011</xref>). Many specialty groups have developed expert guidelines in order to facilitate the busy practitioner’s use of current and relevant science or clinical recommendations. In particular, NASN has begun the work of evaluating research to establish best practice guidelines that are relevant and important for the school nurse. NASN has identified pertinent research studies and provides school nurses with position statements on topics, which are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1942602X12465964">Table 3</xref>. Best practice guidelines are also available through the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1942602X12465964">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (2012)</xref> and may be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.guideline.gov">www.guideline.gov</ext-link>.

<title>Planning and Implementing a Change in Practice</title>
<p>After the school nurse has identified and synthesized the best evidence from the literature and practice guidelines, the nurse should then evaluate the evidence in relation to the student population and clinical experiences of the nurse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1942602X12465964">Melnyk &amp; Fineout-Overholt, 2011</xref>). A change in practice may or may not be warranted after evaluation of the evidence. Even when the scientific evidence or literature identifies a potential change in practice, the nurse should still consider both clinical expertise and the preferences of the population or students affected to determine if an actual practice change should occur.</p>
<p>A compelling reason may exist that does not support a change in practice. For example, new guidelines or recommendations may exist for medication administration; however, a district policy or state law may prohibit a change in practice at that particular time. In cases such as this, the school nurse may not be able to make that practice change until policies or laws support the change. Another example is when a school nurse identifies a student with a body mass index in an unhealthy range. The recommendation is to notify the parent of this finding. The nurse may need to adapt the process of this notification based on their clinical expertise or experiences with children and families in their district. Both of these examples require the nurse to consider policies, laws, and experiences before making a change in practice. The empirical evidence alone should not be the sole determinant in changing nursing practice because the nurse remains important in the clinical decision-making process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1942602X12465964">Taylor, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>If the school nurse has determined that evidence does support a change in practice, planning and developing a protocol for the change is next. The school nurse will need to determine if the practice change is within the scope of the state’s nurse practice act and if the change will conflict with any school policies or state laws. If a conflict arises, consultation with district administration or attorneys, lead nurses, and/or medical consultants regarding the proposed practice change is necessary. The nurse should be prepared to provide the evidence supporting the proposed change.</p>
<sec id="section8-1942602X12465964">
<title>The Difference Between EBP and Clinical Research</title>
<p>Clinical research is the discovery or development of new science that involves testing and evaluating outcomes of interventions on human subjects. Clinical research requires a review and approval from an Institutional Review Board (IRB) (see sidebar). EBP differs from clinical research in that EBP is the use of prior research findings that are already known to produce positive outcomes in high-level research studies such as randomized controlled trials or meta-analyses. Additionally, EBP is applied to the population of individuals that the clinician serves, unlike clinical research, which uses a representative sample of a specific population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1942602X12465964">O’Mathuna, 2011</xref>). The focus of EBP is to improve the quality of care by providing practices that are known to be beneficial, as opposed to clinical research, which is designed to produce new findings that can be generalized to a broader population of individuals. Therefore, implementing a change based on evidence does not always require IRB approval. However, the school nurse should discuss any evidence-based changes with administrators and medical consultants to safeguard against breeches in ethical conduct when a change in practice is considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1942602X12465964">Taylor, 2012</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1942602X12465964">
<title>Evaluating the Outcomes</title>
<p>The final step involves evaluating the outcome after the change in practice has occurred. It is essential to evaluate both the positive and negative effects of the changes made. Because each school environment is dynamic and different from one another, changes may not always be effective or targeted toward the desired goal.</p>
<p>Evaluating the change can be done in a variety of ways, but comparing the outcomes before and after the change is the easiest. One way to compare the outcomes is to ask the same question that led to the development of the original PICOT question. This technique can help evaluate the prechange data with the postchange outcomes and evaluate the extent to which the change resulted in the desired outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1942602X12465964">Worral, Levin, &amp; Arsenault, 2009</xref>). For example, if the nurse implemented a recess-then-lunch schedule in order to reduce the number of early afternoon stomachache-related health room visits, simply comparing the entries in the health room logbook of afternoon-related stomachache visits may be sufficient to evaluate the change. The school nurse can also compare their experience and impact of the change in their setting with the effects on patient outcomes described in the literature. A third method to help evaluate the impact of the change is to ask the question “How well did it work?” because that may also yield information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1942602X12465964">Worral et al., 2009</xref>). It should be clear, however, that the school nurse cannot ask individuals, such as students, teachers, or parents, to complete pre- and post-evaluations of the change. This type of evaluation would be considered human subjects research and require IRB approval, informed consent from the individuals, and a need to protect the individuals’ rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1942602X12465964">O’Mathuna, 2011</xref>). If it is determined that the change resulted in positive results, outcomes should continue to be monitored longitudinally to ensure continued quality care.</p>
<p>Sharing outcomes and results with colleagues is encouraged and beneficial. Colleagues can learn much from the experience of others. Sharing experiences and results related to changes in practice can encourage others to implement changes, bring about other improvements in quality care, or even identify additional questions for the nurse to consider. Presenting the project to peers can be simple and concise. The nurse should include the PICOT question, a quick summary of the evidence, the setting of the project, information related to evaluating the change, and a reference list of the scientific evidence used to support the project. Remember that results from an EBP change cannot and should not be misrepresented as a research project because the data cannot be generalized to a population unless an actual research protocol and IRB approval was obtained.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>School nurses should be engaging in EBP in their health room settings as supported by the IOM. EBP ensures that best practices are used and that students receive high-quality care. Clinical questions can be developed through evaluation of the types and frequency of health room visits and related to the nurse’s daily clinical practice. Evidence in the literature, appropriate expert guidelines, clinician expertise, and client preferences should all be used in determining if a change in practice is warranted. If a change is warranted, the school nurse should then develop a protocol for the change. Practice changes that occur should be evaluated to ensure that expected outcomes were achieved. It is important to note that school nurses should discuss any EBP changes they want to make with administrators and medical consultants to ensure that students, staff, and families are protected with regard to ethical standards. Lastly, results of changes made in practice should be shared with colleagues to promote a spirit in inquiry among health professionals. The NASN Research Committee has additional articles planned to further explore several of the research topics introduced in this overview.■</p>

<title>Institutional Review Board</title>
<p>An Institutional Review Board (IRB) is an ethics committee that reviews and monitors human subjects research (and other scientific research) in order to protect the welfare of participants. A research study that involves the systematic collection of data with the goal of generalizing the findings to a group of individuals requires IRB approval prior to the enrollment of subjects. IRBs are regulated by the federal government and have strict codes and guidelines. The purpose of the IRB is not to evaluate the overall quality of the research question but rather to evaluate the research protocol itself to ensure that the rights of the research participant have been protected. Most academic institutions of higher education and school districts have either an affiliation with an IRB or have their own IRB. Private IRBs also exist for individuals who want to undertake research but do not have an IRB affiliation.</p>
