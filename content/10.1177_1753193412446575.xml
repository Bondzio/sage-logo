<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Brachial neuritis, or Parsonage–Turner syndrome, is manifested by a constellation of symptoms resulting from inflammation of the brachial plexus. Heralded by an episode of acute pain, onset of symptoms can be immediate or delayed. Motor deficits are ubiquitous, and sensory impairment is also found in up to 80% of patients. Pain transitions over weeks to progressive weakness and sensory abnormalities that typically involve the shoulder and proximal upper limb. The variability in location and severity of symptoms is dependent upon which peripheral nerves are affected and to what extent.</p>
<p>The condition is not well understood, but has been noted to occur following surgical procedures, and is associated with immunologic disease, neoplasm, vaccinations, immunosuppressive medications, and infections. Bilateral neuritis is believed to occur more commonly in a proximal location; however, the symptoms may be subclinical. Bilateral presentation and recurrent attacks have been described, although in only one-quarter of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412446575">van Alfen and van Engelen, 2006</xref>). When the condition occurs distally, the presentation is more likely unilateral and localized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412446575">van Alfen and van Engelen, 2006</xref>). Unilateral, isolated involvement of the anterior interosseus nerve (AIN) is rare and bilateral AIN neuropathy is only anecdotally reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412446575">Squintani et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412446575">van Alfen and van Engelen, 2006</xref>). We present the unique case of delayed AIN palsy, 13 years following an identical event in the opposite extremity.</p>
<p>A 49-year old right-hand-dominant male presented with a three-month history of progressive weakness of flexion of the interphalangeal (IP) joint of his right thumb, consistent with partial AIN palsy. His symptoms began shortly after an episode of right-sided forearm pain, which had since abated. At three months, electromyography (EMG) demonstrated fibrillations in the muscle body of the flexor pollicis longus (FPL). Interestingly, he had previously presented with paralysis of the left index and long finger flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) muscle bodies 13 years prior, which was treated surgically with tendon transfers with eventual full motor recovery. He endorsed a recent history of recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis, also thought to be owing to neuritis. Surgical history included a left ulnar nerve transposition at the elbow.</p>
<p>On examination, he exhibited no flexion of the IP joint of the right thumb. Median nerve function and testing in the left arm was normal. Pinch strength was reduced on the right (right: 4 kg; left: 11 kg); grip strength was found to be equal between both extremities (right: 54 kg; left: 56 kg). Sensation was normal in both median and ulnar distributions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed increased T2 signal intensity and oedema within the pronator quadratus muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412446575">Figure 1</xref>). As the EMG demonstrated fibrillations but presence of motor unit potentials, the decision was made to conservatively monitor and obtain repeat studies at two months.</p>

<p>At two months follow-up he had improved dramatically. Pinch strength was near equal to the unaffected side (right: 8 kg; left: 10 kg), grip strength was maintained (right: 52 kg; left: 55 kg). He demonstrated strong flexion at the IP joint of the thumb, indicating reinnervation of the FPL muscle, and strong FDP flexion of the index finger. He was referred to a musculoskeletal neurologist to follow his recovery, and was advised to remain vigilant for return of similar weakness, as steroids may be efficacious in reducing symptom duration.</p>
<p>Acute brachial neuritis was first reported by Spillane in 1943, but it was not until a series of 136 cases was described by Parsonage and Turner in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412446575">1948</xref> that the syndrome was recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412446575">Parsonage and Turner, 1948</xref>). When this happens in the post-operative period it presents a diagnostic challenge, as the symptoms may initially be attributed to poor surgical positioning or post-anaesthetic nerve dysfunction.</p>
<p>There are other conditions besides neuritis that can result in nerve dysfunction. Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is characterized by recurrent neuropathy in a single nerve beginning in adolescence. The diagnosis of HNPP imparts recurrent focal compression neuropathies, often with a family history of similar recurrent neuropathies. Nerve conduction velocity may be delayed at the site of compression; however, EMG should not demonstrate fibrillations. While we feel this case fits the clinical picture of acute neuritis rather than HNPP, it is difficult to differentiate between the conditions.</p>
<p>Electrophysiology, including nerve conduction studies and EMG, may assist in determining the lesion type (axonal versus demyelinating) and the distribution affected. In assessing nerve dysfunction in the forearm, it is important to consider the variable innervation pattern of the FDP muscles. Classical description of FDP innervation involves the median nerve innervating the FDP muscles of the second and third digits, and the ulnar nerve innervating the FDP muscles of the fourth and fifth digits. Recent studies have shown the second FDP innervated by the median only, and the third, fourth, and fifth FDPs are dual-innervated by both the ulnar and median (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412446575">Oh et al., 2009</xref>). Discrepancy between true anatomic innervation and presumptive EMG classifications can lead to incorrect analysis of EMG test results in neuropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412446575">Oh et al., 2009</xref>). Isolated neuritis of the AIN can be confused with FPL tendon rupture. This can be discerned on examination by applying pressure over the FPL tendon proximal to the wrist. With an intact musculotendinous unit, flexion of the IP joint of the thumb will occur.</p>
<p>Treatment includes supportive care, physical therapy, and pharmacologic pain management. Serum antibodies and activation products of complement in the acute phase suggest an immune-mediated process; however, immunosuppressive and steroid therapies have little evidence to support efficacy. Antiviral medications should be considered in cases presenting with a classic shingles rash or when post-herpetic neuralgia is suspected. Prognosis is usually positive, although mild discomfort and paresis may persist in two-thirds of patients.</p>
<p>After extensive review of the literature we found no reported cases of non-simultaneous bilateral anterior interosseous neuritis. This report of a rare condition should suggest that practitioners be aware of the condition in any patient with unexplained pain or nerve dysfunction. While early intervention may reduce the severity and duration of the symptoms, conservative management in patients with delayed presentation may yield acceptable recovery.</p>
