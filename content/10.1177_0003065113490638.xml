<body>
<p>Outcome research in psychotherapy has proceeded remarkably, and that the effects of psychotherapy are statistically and clinically significant is empirically well founded. But “much more research needs to be conducted before the exact relationship between the process of the therapy and its outcome will be known” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0003065113490638">Lambert and Ogles 2004</xref>, p. 181). For that reason, the focus of psychotherapy research has shifted from investigating outcome to a process-outcome approach. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0003065113490638">Laurenceau, Hayes, and Feldman (2007)</xref>, process-outcome research addresses three sets of questions: For whom and under what conditions does change occur? (moderators of change); What is the shape of change? (trajectories of change); and Why and how is change occurring? (mediators of change).</p>
<p>The present study focuses on the examination of moderators of change. A moderator is “a characteristic that influences the direction or magnitude of the relationship between an independent and a dependent variable” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0003065113490638">Kazdin 2007</xref>, p. 3). Moderators precede treatment and are not correlated with it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0003065113490638">Kraemer et al. 2002</xref>). Identifying them helps in the prognosis of a course of therapy and in matching different patients to treatments. We included as putative moderators (1) treatment parameters (treatment modality, dose [session frequency x duration], therapeutic alliance), (2) sociodemographic variables (age, sex, partnership status), and (3) clinical patients’ characteristics (diagnosis of personality disorder, emotional lability, and extraversion).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section2-0003065113490638">
<title>Study design</title>
<p>The empirical basis of the process-outcome study is the Munich Psychotherapy Study (MPS), a prospective, comparative process-outcome study that evaluates the effectiveness and course of three different long-term psychotherapies: psychoanalytic (PA), psychodynamic (PD), and cognitive-behavioral (CBT) for a diagnostically homogenous sample of depressed patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0003065113490638">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Patients seeking treatment for unipolar depression, single-episode or recurrent, and meeting the inclusion criterion were asked to participate in the study. The inclusion criterion was a primary diagnosis of a moderate or severe episode of major depressive disorder (ICD-10 F 32.1/2 or DSM-IV 296.22/23); a recurrent depressive disorder, current episode moderate or severe, without psychotic symptoms (ICD-10 F 33.1/2 or DSM-IV 296.32/33); or a double depression. Because financial resources were limited, randomized allocation started with psychoanalytic and psychodynamic therapy and included cognitive-behavioral therapy only later. Hence, there was simultaneous randomized allocation to only two of the three therapy arms. Thirty-five patients were assigned to PA, 31 to PD, and 34 to CBT.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0003065113490638">
<title>Assessments and measures</title>
<p>Outcome measurements were multidimensional (symptomatic, interpersonal, and intrapsychic) and came from three different sources: self-ratings by patients and observer ratings by therapists and by external investigators. External investigators were blinded for treatment modalities to control for memory and expectancy effects. Measurement points were at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and follow-up measurement at one, two, and three years after termination of treatment. For this study, the outcome measure battery included the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003065113490638">Beck et al.1961</xref>) on a symptomatic level, the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0003065113490638">Horowitz et al. 2000</xref>) on an interpersonal level, and the Scales of Psychological Capacities (SPC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0003065113490638">Wallerstein et al. 1989</xref>) on an intrapsychic level. Outcome measurement points were pre-treatment and post-treatment. The following independent variables considered as putative moderators were assessed at pre-treatment: age, sex, partnership status, duration of depressive disorder since onset, and prior therapies, as well as observer-rated motivation and diagnosis of personality disorder during a clinical intake interview. Also included were the patient-rated Emotional Lability and Extroversion scale of the Freiburg Personality Inventory (FPI) and the therapist-rated subscale HAQ2: satisfaction with therapeutic relationship of the Helping Alliance Questionnaire (HAQ).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0003065113490638">
<title>Treatments and therapists</title>
<p>The study therapists were thoroughly trained and highly experienced. Treatments were not formally manualized, with neither supervision nor competence checks. Fourteen therapists delivered both psychoanalytic and psychodynamic therapy, and seven delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy. There was no significant difference in training, expertise, or experience between the therapists.</p>
<p>Psychoanalytic therapy (PA) was operationalized as a therapy with a usual duration of 240 sessions and a session frequency of three times a week, with the patient lying on the couch.</p>
<p>Psychodynamic therapy (PD) was operationalized as a therapy with a usual duration of 80 sessions, one session a week, in a face-to-face setting.</p>
<p>Cognitive<italic>-</italic>behavioral therapy (CBT) was operationalized as a therapy with an average duration between 45 and 60 sessions, one session a week.</p>
<p>The mean duration of PA was 39 months (range 3–91) or 234 sessions (range 17–370). Mean duration of PD was 34 months (range 3–108) or 88 sessions (range 12–313), and mean duration of CBT was 26 months (range 2–78) or 45 sessions (range 7–100). Treatment fidelity was assessed with expert-rated measures applying the ideal process prototypes of the Psychotherapy Process Q-set (PQS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003065113490638">Ablon and Jones 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0003065113490638">Jones 2000</xref>). Independent raters found the three treatments to be different in terms of important process parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0003065113490638">Huber et al. 2012</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0003065113490638">
<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>To show that the independent variables listed above are moderators of treatment effects, data of the independent variables were entered into a stepwise logistic regression analysis. Treatment modality (PA, PD, CBT) was included as the first step. The analysis was repeated with the dependent variables BDI, IIP, and SPC. The treatment effect was assessed as “clinical significance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0003065113490638">Jacobson and Truax 1991</xref>). The results are presented as odds ratios (ORs).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0003065113490638" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Stepwise logistic regression analysis yielded that the Emotional Lability scale of the FPI (OR = 0.68) and diagnosis of a personality disorder (OR = 3.52) both negatively predicted outcome in the BDI. Partnership status (OR = 0.28), dose (OR = 1.02) and satisfaction with therapeutic relationship (OR = 3.58) predicted positive outcome when assessed with the IIP. Only PA positively predicted outcome (OR = 4.1) when structural change (SPC) was the target variable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0003065113490638" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Symptom improvement was negatively predicted by both self- and observer-rated personality impairment. Treatment parameters were the predominant predictors of positive outcome beyond symptoms. When structural change was the target variable, only PA predicted positive outcome. These findings lend support to the hypothesis that the more intense and time-consuming therapies are needed to accomplish benefits on the interpersonal and intrapsychic level.</p>
