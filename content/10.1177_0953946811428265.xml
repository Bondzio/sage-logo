<abstract>
<p>A Christian theology that is orientated towards understanding incarnation must be interested in the nature of embodiment. As the experience of those involved in sports centres on the body and its attunement to the situation and environment in which it finds itself, so we can compare the states of immersion in the material world in the athlete’s experience and the experience of Christian piety. This essay offers a comparative phenomenology of two forms of embodiment: the athlete’s entry into ‘the zone’ and the contemplative’s centring of the embodied soul in Christ. In doing so it opens up areas of both similarity and difference that are coming to be explored by neuropsychology and neurophysiology. and points to the development of a radical account of incarnation that takes embodiment and affectivity seriously.</p>

<body>
<p>Why should theology be at all interested in sport? Are not some of the goals of sporting activity—competition, triumphing, the idolisation of the one who is victorious, the pursuit of human excellence—actually at odds with the virtues of the Christian kingdom like humility? Is not the recognition of the vulnerability and the fragility of being human at the heart of dependence upon God and the operation of grace? When we bring sport and theology together are we not setting up Prometheus against Christ? These questions do not receive a definitive answer in the essay that follows, but the perennial enjoyment of and involvement in sporting activity, the fact that it is a universal human phenomenon, means that the question of sport has to be brought into theological enquiry; for belief in a Creator God who became human demands we have some account of this disposition to play, to compete and to excel athletically. In what follows I wish to explore one aspect that will necessarily be central to such a theological account: the nature of embodiment itself, the experience of embodiment, which is fundamental for any anthropology—theological or otherwise. The exploration will take the form of a comparison between the experience of embodiment in participating in a sport<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0953946811428265">1</xref></sup> and the experience of embodiment in participating in a spiritual activity, such as prayer. Of course, the division between the two forms of embodiment is heuristic and somewhat reductive in being so: there are people who are both athletes and Christians. But the point of the comparison is to facilitate approaches to the questions I outline above and to sharpen some of the ethical aspects of those questions.</p>
<sec id="section1-0953946811428265">
<title>The Intensification of Embodiment</title>
<p>What has always interested me as a theologian about those who actively engaged in sports, or dance for that matter, is their focused attunement to the body; the ownership of their corporeality. There are of course reasons for this: to compete well as an amateur or to earn one’s living through such athletic activity, the body has to become an instrument. So, like the craftsman or the musician, they must ensure the optimum maintenance of the tools with which they work. Only, unlike the craftsman, the body as the means whereby they labour productively is no prosthesis. We can perhaps get at what I am pointing to more accurately here by considering Hegel’s analysis of the tool in his 1804 unfinished reflections on ethical life, <italic>System der Sittlichkeit</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0953946811428265">2</xref></sup> For Hegel, the making and handling of tools is the first human step away from the natural condition; the first entry into an alienation from oneself and into the dialectical process where the in-itself moves towards a greater recognition and participation in <italic>Geist</italic>, Spirit or Mind. In the step, made in and through the making and wielding of the tool, the individual surrenders something of his or her singularity in order to move towards the universal. Now the tool, fashioned and handled by the individual, can be employed by anyone. It can even be manufactured for general use. Not only can its idea no longer by owned by an individual, and so remain tied to the particular, it becomes a material expression in the world of that which is universal. But with the sports person or the dancer, there is no moment of alienation in honing the body fit for purpose—and potentially fit for a professional life. The intimacy with one’s corporeality militates against any alienation, at least in the first instance. I say in the first instance because other instrumentalities can colonise that body—especially when the sports person or the dancer enters a public forum and paid employment through and because of the bodies they have and the work they have been engaged upon with the body as its object. Film stars talk about their sense of ownership by agents and film companies, who are commercialising their good looks; sports people talk about the pressures of gaining and retaining corporate sponsorship. Damage to limbs can be insured against. An alienation is then all too possible as a development of their careers and the move from amateur to professional status; an alienation deepened with any sense of exploitation. But in that first and in the last instance (the achievement) there is no alienation—because to participate corporally requires that that prior attention to the body is now fully focused upon the task at hand: the competition, the performance. Rather than becoming universal, the body of the athlete or the dancer is intensely singular.</p>
<p>It is at this point that we begin an ethical enquiry, because, in an Hegelian schema, such an intense concern with the physical is amoral: the ethical can only begin with the move beyond the in-itself of the individual. For him, this amorality is a refusal to rise above the level of animals and the refusal to enter <italic>self</italic>-consciousness which lies at the origins of community consciousness, national consciousness and, ultimately, absolute consciousness. And, of course, psychologically as well as ethically, there are dangers here in such intense attention to the self, to the body: the dangers of a certain autism; the development of a set of dissociative symptoms found in addiction and obsessions; the dangers inherent in the fantasies of Narcissus; the dangers of a concentration on the cultivation of the ego. So Hegel, and later Freud, would see a refusal to grow up, to become a mature and reflective adult, in the intense preoccupations of the sports person or the dancer with his or her body. No doubt they would allow a difference between involvement in the sport or the dance and the more fundamental care of self required for such involvement. It is not physical investment for its own sake and, in competing and in particularly being a team player, the sports person must necessary move beyond themselves and enter the game; the dancer must become integral to the performance. The game, the performance, is paramount. And the game, or the performance, in being circumscribed by rules prescribes a certain behavioural code of values. Above and beyond these rules there is also an ethics of teamship. There is nothing in the rules of football that prevents a centre forward keeping the ball to himself or herself throughout a mid-field dash to score. But he or she would be regarded as selfish if they consciously ignored passing the ball to another player on his or her side in a different part of the field who was unmarked and had a much better opportunity of scoring that goal. When the telos of scoring takes second place to the glorification of an individual player, then both the manager and the public pass a moral judgement. And the same ethical conditions apply in the single athlete with respect to fellow competitors: winning the 100 metres freestyle and gaining the adulation of the crowd at the expense of fair competition among all players—the advantage of a steroid supplement—would also receive condemnation. So, in playing, in performance, there is an entry into the ethical that even Hegel would have to acknowledge. But what is ethical is only defined by regulations beyond the individual competitor or performer; more fundamental is the fixed concentration on individual ‘fitness’ (which is an interesting word and a synonym of what I first called ‘attunement’ to the body) that enables the very best playing or performance. Part of the argument of this essay is that this ‘fittingness’ or ‘attunement’ of the body is a possible entry into a deeper form of the ethical, which I will call ‘ethical life’ as distinct from moral codes, implicit or explicit—such as the moral codes governing competing as a professional.</p>

<sec id="section2-0953946811428265">
<title>A Phenomenology of Athletic Experience</title>
<p>So let me try to examine that more fundamental and intense operation upon one’s corporeality in the sports person or dancer. I’d like to call this a phenomenology of athletic experience, after Heidegger’s early phenomenology of religious experience<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0953946811428265">3</xref></sup>—but that may be tenuous. I would like to call it this because my overall aim is to disclose the relations between the form of radical embodiment that is necessary to become a better sports person or dancer and what I will call radical incarnation—that immersion into the very depths of the material and the particular, in Christ, in order to ‘hear’, ‘recognise’ (these are both metaphors, you understand) the groaning of all creation for its creator, or what Paul in the same passage refers to as that which we most desire ‘the redemption of the body’ (Rom. 8.23). Recently Iain McGilchrist, in his monumental book <italic>The Master and his Emissary: The Divided Brain and the Making of the Western World</italic>, has pointed out how in the increasing trend towards left hemisphere dominance, which privileges cognitive analysis over the intuitive, phenomenology acted as a critical intervention with its insistence upon the <italic>Lebenswelt</italic> and embodiment. My own thinking, with respect to embodiment and incarnationalism, can be understood as a similar form of resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0953946811428265">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The body is a barometer. That is the finding, over the last twenty-five years of evolutionary psychologists, cognitive scientists, neurophysiologists and those working in affect theory. The mind is embodied and all its operations are mediated via the body. It is profoundly affected by the emotions and the emotions are inextricable from the body. Although each body is individualised it is also immersed in a particular environment and participates in the life of other bodies, organic and inorganic, animal and vegetable. Therefore the examination of the body as an isolated entity, while necessary for certain forms of treatment (medical treatment, for example), is a necessary fiction. It is immersed and continually both receptive (to what is happening around it) and acquisitive (exposed and reaching out to calibrate the circumstances in which it is situated). Feeling is both that which happens to us (passively) and that which we seek (we are actively engaged in seeking and seizing information). It is this basic and primordial condition of embodiment that has enabled us to survive, reproduce and develop. And it is not divorced from thinking. Feeling is older than thinking, in evolutionary terms. Thinking, memory, appraisal of feelings, emotions with intentional content and the will to act are all associated with operations in the neocortex. But these operations require the reception and acquisition of sensation that is related to the autonomic system of response (breathing, heart-beat, blood pressure, sweating etc.) and the right amygdala, hypothalamus and precuneus, that constitute the limbic and paralimbic structures of the brain. ‘The [lived experience of] body as such is a right hemisphere entity.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0953946811428265">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>So much for the neurobiology—to which, of course, we have no direct access because its processes are prior to those of, and cannot be accessed by, the frontal lobes of the neocortex. But, together, the work of the autonomic system, the thalamic sensory inputs, the limbic realm, the hippocampus and cingulated regions that allows for control of emotional responses and the neocortex generates, first in the right hemisphere of the brain and then, by translation, in the left hemisphere, what has been called emotional intelligence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0953946811428265">6</xref></sup> This intelligence is pre-eminently embodied: the right hemisphere is more directly linked with the limbic area than the left. And although, the will to get ahead, to beat, to be the champion, to be competitive is mainly a left hemisphere function, certain forms of emotional intelligence and levels of intuition are considerably developed by those regularly involved in sporting activities or dance. I once called this the body’s knowledge<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0953946811428265">7</xref></sup>; cognitive scientists use the term ‘body maps’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0953946811428265">8</xref></sup> The sporting person, recognising the body as a barometer, learns how to read his or her embodiment and how to make adjustments within and upon it to maintain ‘fitness’ or a fittingness (between the body, its environment and the situation it finds itself within—a race, reaction to a serve or volley, a rhythm etc.). These people learn how to read other bodies in that environment and condition as well as their own, and through memory (and the disciplines associated with a memory that operate beneath consciousness—which is mainly concerned with short-term memory) anticipate and adjust for optimum control within the environment and control of the situation the body finds itself in.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0953946811428265">9</xref></sup> This discipline is fundamental for both an accurate reading of the body as barometer and the ability to respond appropriately—that is, instinctively. Instinctive response is much quicker than cognitive deliberation. Let me take a specific example from swimming.</p>
<p>The swimmer knows every morning through his or her workout the condition of the body. From an ache in the muscles not registered in previous workouts; from a sluggishness that recognises the stroke is not as precise, not executed as well; from the ways the water flows around his or her body; from the body’s position with respect to other swimmers—whether slower or faster; from a rhythm and a breathing that is not quite synchronised: the swimmer knows just how well he or she slept last night, how yesterday’s food and drink was digested, how alert or distracted, focused or unfocused the embodied mind is. There is no need for a clock, a thermometer or any other external measuring mechanics. It is the internal disposition with respect to the environment and the body’s present conditions that give the swimmer all he or she needs to know. A bad dream, half-recalled, from the night before, an unexpected bill that landed on the doormat that morning, a telephone call that didn’t go well, a drink too much, the lack of a certain vitamin—any or all of these can impact upon the body and diminish its fittingness or attunement. There are a range of three responses to the knowledge that the body is under-performing in a certain environment and situation. The first is just to continue the workout as a discipline—get the 5000 metres over and done with—making the mental note to drink less, pay the bill, resolve the communication issue, whatever. A trainer will frequently say ‘Just get on with it. Some personal best records have been made despite what you think you feel.’ The second is to cut the workout short and just put it down to not a good time, tomorrow will be different. The third is to overcome the knowledge of the body’s state; not to let it dominate; to push the body further; to dig deeper. I want to just explore that third possible response. It is a response found particularly in the situation of a competition in which mind-games play probably the most important part. We can observe that all three responses are different mental adjustments to a condition; adjustments that concern that balance between self-awareness and self-knowledge that is so crucial to self-confidence. I can’t do it. I give up. I cut my losses for today—dispositions and judgements that leads to response one or two—can be replaced by I can do it, I will do it, that leads to the third response. The ability to compete rests fundamentally on not just the body’s condition and the sports person’s keen awareness of it, but also the thin yellow line of self-confidence that if cut, brings on defeat. So let me return then to that third response and, particularly, that phrase ‘to dig deeper’—which is not a metaphor, as any sports person will inform you.</p>
<p>When the body’s knowledge recognises limit, then to push beyond that limit is to encounter pain. I don’t mean necessarily stabbing pain, wracking pain, I mean more like a strong sense of discomfort. Says the cyclist Ron Kiefel, one-time captain of the Motorola team: ‘Your body hurts, your lungs hurt, you’re breathing as hard as you can, you don’t feel you can squeeze any more power out of your legs, and you’re just trying to settle down and get into a good rhythm.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0953946811428265">10</xref></sup> It is pushing beyond the pain threshold to the ‘good rhythm’ that constitutes digging deeper. It is probably most evident in the final efforts needed in a competition to finish: the 50 yard sprint, for example. This is where the body can surprise itself. Sports people often refer to this as entering ‘the zone’ or, after the developed sporting psychology of Mihály Csikszentmihályi, the ‘flow’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0953946811428265">11</xref></sup> This is a form of motivation so focused the athlete loses him or herself in the activity. Witness Aryton Senna’s remark on winning the Monaco Grand Prix in 1988: ‘Suddenly I realised that I was no longer driving the car consciously. I was kind of driving by instinct, only I was in a different dimension. I was way over the limit, but still I was able to find even more. It frightened me because I realised I was well beyond my conscious understanding.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0953946811428265">12</xref></sup> And this is Simon, a racing cyclist interviewed by Csikszentmihályi:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I was totally absorbed, 110 % that was all that mattered in the whole existence. It just amazed me how I could maintain such high concentration for three hours. I’m used to having my mind wander, especially under pressure. My body felt great. Nothing, you feel like just nothing can go wrong and there’s nothing that will be able to stop you or get in your way. And you’re ready to tackle anything, and you don’t fear any possibility happening, and it’s just exhilarating. Afterward, I couldn’t come down, I was on a high. I felt like I wanted to go ride, ride up that hill again.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0953946811428265">13</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is a recognised pinnacle of achievement. A number of studies of this phenomenon have been available since the early 1990s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0953946811428265">14</xref></sup> It is a state that is often of a short duration and non-voluntary. Its characteristics include: a sense of control, low anxiety, alertness, being energised whilst being totally calm, and optimistic. Mind and body seem to be in unparalleled association. Such a state can lead to surprising wins where the other competitors are forgotten and one is racing against oneself. This digging deeper and pushing beyond left hemisphere knowledge to right hemisphere instinct absolutely rests upon discipline—although a more primeval emotion imprinted upon the amygdala’s capacity to remember is fear and flight in fear can be just as surprising to the body’s knowledge. Then let me emphasise that while there may be some recognition of digging deeper that we associate with will and determination, the digging deeper that is more profound is a reactionary response that discipline over long periods of time makes possible. As I said, the most primitive of somatic responses in the autonomic system—responses of pulse rate, hormonal secretion, blood flows, heart-beat, breathing that are unconscious adjustments to the environment taking place at speeds far quicker than thought can assess. The fear kicks in at a much lower level of emotional feedback, triggers the autonomic response of flight and it is the subsequent evaluation of the flight and the object from which one is fleeing that then constitutes the feeling of fear. The discipline needed for being a competitor impacts upon that autonomic system. To enter the ‘zone’ is to allow the body to take over from any mental assessment of the environment, the condition of the body or even the situation; pain or physical discomfort is not registered. One enters one’s body more deeply; eased into it such that there is a new level of relaxation and composure. The takeover by the body concerns breathing—that is, the control of oxygen to the brain and through the brain to the blood, the glands releasing chemicals like adrenaline, adrenal steroids, peptides and glucose into the bloodstream, the viscera, muscles and skin. Digging deeper is finding another rhythm, such that even though moving more quickly the heart-beat and pulse rate is slower and a new rhythm is struck beyond the normal rhythms that the sports person is accustomed to when performing. So, for example, in a 400 metres free-style swim, in which the rhythm is maintained through breathing first on the left and then on the right, keeping the head as low as possible with respect to the water line, pace is calculated according to ‘splits’. If a record 400 metres takes under four minutes, then the ideal split is under 60 seconds per length of the pool. But the best split shows the last 50 metres to be much quicker and, in proportion, the three previous splits would be lower: 54:57:57:50. To accomplish the perfect split takes training, but it also requires, under competitive pressure, finding another domain, open within oneself; another more primitive (in evolutionary terms) somatic level when arm, leg, head movement, breathing and water line are in total attunement.</p>
<p>Entering the zone is frequently described as an experience of transcendence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0953946811428265">15</xref></sup> As the cognitive scientist Andrew Newberg and his colleagues have shown, the ‘brain possesses a neurological mechanism for self-transcendence’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0953946811428265">16</xref></sup> But self-transcendence as a concept needs some further elaboration; for the body is still my body, its knowledge my knowledge, its consciousness my consciousness. In investigating the empirical data with respect to the activities of prayer and contemplation, all that Newberg or Mario Beauregard can show is that they display observable brain functions; that they engage a ‘significant alteration of the electro-chemical functioning’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0953946811428265">17</xref></sup> The propulsion under which this action is accomplished is <italic>my</italic> propulsion insofar as it cannot be determined scientifically that there is a propulsion from elsewhere. At a mental level we can call this propulsion drive or desire (a right hemisphere phenomenon) rather than will (a left hemisphere phenomenon—I <italic>want</italic> to win the race). But, in dropping into another somatic level, then desire’s more evolutionary primitive form is appetite. Here motivation becomes automatic if not autonomic: I <italic>need to win the race</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0953946811428265">18</xref></sup> But I have also transcended myself if by that we mean that I have transcended present knowledge, prevailing conditions, consciousness, and I have participated in the environment and in the situation at a more profound level; discovered another level of attunement or fittingness in which the conscious individual is just a part. A heightened level of participation and absorption has been entered in one’s immersion in the world.</p>
<p>With the question of transcendence we turn to relationship between this immersion and spirituality. To return to the biochemistry of the body, let me add two important points that follow from Newberg’s research. First, there could well be a chemical difference between the state of consciousness found in profound meditation and the athlete’s entering the ‘zone’. Newberg doesn’t make the comparison; he treats only Buddhist and Christian forms of contemplation. But those scholars researching into the biology of sports speak of important endocrine secretions of stress hormones such as adrenalin and norepinephrine. Newberg found surprising releases of serotonin and dopamine in meditative states that induce calm, rather than stress. Secondly, as Newberg points out, SPECT scans and other data cannot determine whether these experiences are self-induced or coming from outside the self altogether. For athletes entering the ‘zone’, the state is self-generated, ego-centred and it often takes them considerable time to recover equanimity.</p>
<p>To facilitate a theological turn in my examination let me cite a comment made recently on work of Edith Stein: ‘interiority does not close off the world but allows the world to penetrate us more deeply’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0953946811428265">19</xref></sup> Then let me quickly follow this by emphasising that I am not saying the immersion in the materiality of one’s own somatic condition and its attunement to the environment in which it is situated is in itself a religious experience. In part, this attunement could be associated with a pantheistic appreciation of being part of an ecological whole. There are certain forms of ‘attunement’ or fittingness which are purely natural phenomenon: the recognition of an evolutionary adaptation as human creatures to our environment. There is nothing necessarily religious about this recognition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0953946811428265">20</xref></sup> The self-transcendence I pointed to immersion in the ‘zone’ might also be called a self-forgetfulness; a getting beyond the dominance of the ego (a left hemisphere phenomenon). So ‘transcendence’ is not bearing necessarily either a spiritual or an ethical charge; though the recognition of participation in an environmental complexity in which the individual body is only a part surely impacts in terms of understanding an ecology of values. The experience of such fittingness might be better compared with that holy grail sought by certain phenomenologists like Jean-Luc Marion, who in performing their <italic>epochē</italic> wish to arrive at experience itself—some pure form of givenness which the intentional gaze structures; Husserl’s <italic>Lebenswelt</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0953946811428265">21</xref></sup> The exercise of a discipline facilitates and is facilitated by techniques which, in sport or in dance, have an instrumental function—unlike, for example, the disciplined techniques of meditation and prayer which in and of themselves cannot elicit grace in the same way that an instrument can facilitate a performance. In Christian terms, such instrumentalism would be Pelagianism. What I am claiming is that sporting activity, like sexual activity and possibly musical activity, constitute our most intense forms of being embodied. These intense forms of embodiment are forays into the mystery of being human, being a creature amidst all that has been created. As such, Christian theologians, for whom the doctrine of incarnation is central to understanding both the nature of being human and belonging to all that God has created, can gain theological insights from these forays. And it is those insights which I wish to pursue here.</p>
<p>As is clear from above, the corporeal attunement with the world that I am describing is a fittingness with a particular environment and situation. With the swimmer this would be the water in a stadium pool and the race in which they are competing. The environment in relation to the body defines the nature of what is experienced. The environment would also include cultural context. By that I mean the consciousness of what is being done, why it is being done and the consciousness of the experience itself take specific colouring, values and motivation from the ideas learnt and memories of what has already been received. For example, the swimmer’s cultural context that constitutes an important aspect of the environment will be informed by what the coach has said, what other swimmers have said, and what magazines about swimming and fitness have said. It is the same when we come to the environments of piety; they are specific to each faith tradition. We are examining the experience of highly specific sets of actions, circumstances, situations, locations and ideologies in which the body is participating and responding.</p>

<title>The Theo-logic of the Incarnation</title>
<p>If we take seriously the opening of John’s Gospel then all things were created in and through Christ. It is not then that Christ cannot cross the divide between the uncreated and the created; nor that creation is absolutely divorced from the Godhead. The finitude of creaturely existence participates in the sempiteternity of intratrinitarian relations. As such the creation <italic>ex nihilo</italic> is not one event, like Newton’s grand mechanic who forms the world from nothing and then kick starts its innermost immanent law of process and regulation. Creation <italic>ex nihilo</italic> is an ongoing activity, and so it is in this way that creation is not itself eternal. It dwells within the purposes of God, sustained by the operation of God’s grace. Because of this participation, this continual involvement of the Godhead in creation, that the coming of Christ, the assumption of the human into the divine, was always a theological possible. If you like, the coming of Christ is the perfect realisation of God’s participation in creation. Just as the imprint of the artist is recognised in whatever form the artist produces, so the imprint of Christ, through whom all things were made, is evident in all things. The incarnation is the revelation of the artist within the artist’s own production; God in Christ presents a self-portrait, an <italic>eikōn</italic> of the Godhead. This <italic>eikōn</italic> of the divine is not unrelated to human beings made in the image of God. In fact, the relation between them points to something that pertains in the Godhead of what is human; and something that pertains to being human that is intimately divine. In the Godhead what pertains to the human condition persists in the Son–the Father contemplates and receives all that is human from the foundation of the world in and through the Son.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0953946811428265">22</xref></sup> As the Letter to the Ephesians states: ‘he [God the Father] chose us in him [God the Son] before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him. He destined us in his love to be his sons through Jesus Christ’ (Eph. 1:4-5). It is in this way that sanctification in Christ is deification—although, since the relation is created and maintained in Christ and human beings participate in it by grace, then the relation is not a property that human beings possess outside of Christ. Three corollaries follow from this, theologically. First, the depths of what is human are ultimately hidden in Christ. That is, the mystery of our very natures as embodied creatures forever eludes what we can know and claim about ourselves. We can, of course, shut out the call upon us spoken from those depths—which is always a call to service. We can live our lives as if they were our own; and we the sole claimant upon them. But the Christic mystery within us remains; we persist in a being that subsists in Being itself. Secondly, a certain anthropomorphism in our conscious relations with God is inevitable. To put this another way: following Feuerbach’s critique of religion in terms of anthropomorphic projection—a critique developed by Marx, Nietzsche and Freud in particular; a critique accepted by theologians like Karl Barth who saw the critique as an ineradicable safeguard against idolatry—anthropomorphism with respect to God-talk has become highly suspect. But if, following the Gospel of John, Christ is in us and we in Christ and Christ in God, then we have to ask what is wrong with anthropomorphism or rather accept that a certain anthropomorphism is not our psychological projection at all, but a reflection of the relation that pertains in Christ between the Godhead and being human. The Christ revealed to us in the world is the Christ most intimately associated with our being at all. Thirdly, that being human, being embodied creatures participating in the life and grace of God is good; we should not try and escape that condition (by trying to become angels, by trying to purify ourselves of all that belongs to our materiality), but rather respect that condition.</p>
<p>There are two moments in the nature of the incarnation, upon which any incarnational theology must build. There is the coming and reception of the Word of God as word—that is, a mental representation and concept—and there is the coming and reception of the Word of God as flesh—that is the materiality of Christ’s body in our bodies. In God, these two aspects cannot be distinguished: creation in and through Christ is, by His Word spoken into the nothingness, also the fabrication of the world. The Word spoken is a ‘let it be’ that has a material effect. For we human creatures also the two moments of the incarnation cohere. Prayer is governed by the same ‘let it be’ (which is why Mary’s assent to the proclamation of the angel is so significant for the foundation of the church): it is both conceptually received and somatically affective. We are at the core of the meaning of liturgy here—divine liturgy, which serves kenotically in Christ, the creation and redemption of the world and ecclesial liturgy which serves the same end through its participation in and as the body of Christ. These two co-inherent liturgical operations constitute the backbone of the mass: the Word of God read from the Scriptures and preached and the Eucharistic consecration and consumption. These two moments can never be separated except, pragmatically, to aid an understanding of them. For the Word received as mental representation and concept is formed in the mouth and carved from breath by the tongue, the teeth and palate and the larynx. To speak is a physiological process and the sounds produced resonate through the whole body. They are spoken with a tone and the tone is emotionally inflected. This inflection in turn operates upon the autonomic system and the viscera such that words spoken in anger accelerate the blood flood which ‘speaks’ to the muscles, biochemical production and circulation, and ‘gut feelings’; words spoken in love have a similar affect (though a dissimilar set of corporeal responses). And, from the other side, the Word as flesh not only affects our flesh, in its consumption, but that flesh is, as we have seen, inseparable from emotional and mental impact. What we consume, either mentally or physically, is processed through our souls and bodies. Hence there is not just spiritual life, but both mental and corporeal life in Paul’s injunction: ‘Whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent and praiseworthy—think [log…zesqe] about such things’ (Phil. 4:8). To think here, log…zomai is related to the mind of Christ spoken of by Paul—for it is an activity located and participating in the Logos. So to think here is to pray.</p>
<p>There is much more that could be said here, of course; but here are the lineaments of a theological anthropology. Here also we might glimpse what is most valuable about the insights into embodiment that people involved in sports or dance offer to us. Let me just develop the theological anthropology a little further before we return to the question of sport. As I said, we can as human beings with a free will, shut out the Christic call upon us in our depths. But alternatively, we can begin to listen to that call, enter into a dialogue with it, cultivate its vocation and subsequently mission. We do this through prayer. Prayer is not the means of transcending the material but of entering the materiality of our condition more profoundly; it is the total embrace of our embodiment. We might then compare what I named earlier as a phenomenology of athletic activity with a phenomenology of prayer, and seek the relation between the two embodied attunements, the two fittingnesses. Prayer is an experience; grace perfects, it does not by-pass nature, that is, physicality. Prayer is integrated with our cognitive and emotional lives. So what happens to the body as a barometer in prayer?</p>
<sec id="section4-0953946811428265">
<title>A Phenomenology of Prayer</title>
<p>First, it recognises its immersion in the world. Anselm, in his preparations for prayer, talks about entering ‘the inner chamber of thy mind; shut[ting] out all thoughts save that of God’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0953946811428265">23</xref></sup> and, in neuropyschological terms, this means closing down short-term memory. This would involve surrendering oneself to a more corporeal understanding of the world; capitulating to an emotional intelligence and the body’s knowledge. Closing the eyes normally assists in this surrender because it suppresses the inputs and acquisitions of one sensory thalamus. The world becomes more auditory—traffic passing, birds singing—more tactile—the room temperature, one’s posture with respect to the floor or the kneeler—and more olfactory—the scent of old candles, the flower arrangement. The registration of prayer upon the body has also affects that are probably not consciously acknowledged: as muscle tone relaxes, breathing slows, blood pressure declines, perspiration drops, serotonin and dopamine are produced. An attunement between the body, the environment and the situation emerges that is a socio-psychological form of the body’s own homeostasis. This is a state that is active and passive, responsible and responsive. The environment and situation are, to use an older appreciation of the word, ‘suffered’—that is, allowed to be whatever they are. If, to return to what I said above, our human condition is to exist in Christ and Christ in us, then this state of prayer is already intercession: we are bringing the world as it is and it affects us into God.</p>
<p>The second point I would make is that to pray is to situate oneself in a field and circulation of desire. I use the word ‘field’ here because desire is fundamental to human living, but it is not just one desire that operates within that living. Of course, the more ego-centred one is the more desire is monological; and a sport person’s desire to win, to achieve, has that impulsive power that saturates the will (the left hemisphere’s form of urgency) with a single desire. But I would suggest to attain this level of ego-focus requires suppressing an operation in the field of desire in which any single desire functions. I am not the single author of my own desires. Desire is elicited, for example, by an object desired—but conditions have operated upon that object such that it has become desirable to me. Did I ever know that I desired an iPad before Apple created the iPad and manufactured it in such a way that I found it to be desirable? Similarly, I have absorbed the desires of others and these desires have shaped my desire, orientated my desiring. My grandmother was passionate, and sacrificial in that passion, that I should stay on at school, be educated and go to university. Her desire informed my desire. A coach’s or a parent’s or a spouse’s desire even inform the sports person’s desire. Even that desire is not as single-minded as one might believe. As Friedrich Schleiermacher pointed out in one of his earliest essays: desire is characterised by ‘not being absolutely determinable by any one object’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0953946811428265">24</xref></sup> where object might be another person. In fact, I doubt, as Schleiermacher did, that we can ever begin to map the field of desires in which our own desiring takes place. This is more so with respect to prayer: for my desire to pray is an expression of my desire to be intimate with God and this accords with God’s desire towards me—that I am intimate with God’s love and its movements in and upon my life. This is what I mean by a field and circulation of desire. And there is a biochemistry and physiology of love, as lovers know. There is also a practice, a discipline and a technology (the employment of techniques—like breathing, for example) in prayer, as there are to achieving higher levels of performance in a sport. One of the astonishing finds in neurophysiology is that the brain is very plastic; it changes according to use. Newberg found that Buddhist monks and Catholic nuns developed a larger thalamus than is usual; so were open to sensations from outside. To pray is finally to give oneself over to God’s desire and to persist in a patient vigil upon the calling that comes to us from elsewhere. Unlike the surrender to the body in an athletic activity, this is a surrender to a primordial dialogue between the exteriorising of God (in incarnation) and an interiorising by human beings participating in that incarnation.</p>
<p>As I have often remarked, recent phenomenology has focused on the economy of the gift—what is given, how it is given. But the more fundamental economy in prayer is reception. God gives continually, without abatement. The question is not whether and how the gift is given—but whether and how we can receive that gift. To receive, which is a corporeal as well as spiritual and psychological activity, is to enter more deeply into prayer and into the mystery of what it is to be human. And since we are ourselves gifted, to receive the gift is to receive ourselves as gift.</p>
<p>To receive is to move more deeply into one’s embodiment through a surrender to that embodiment such that there is a response to the appetite for the call that is made within one’s life. In this move a new attunement is arrived at. Attunement here, I suggest, issues from that centring within oneself in which all things meet: the body, the soul, the world in which that body and soul dwell, and God. Though there is an interiorisation here, in prayer it is not the self that is grasped, necessarily, unless that prayer is inspired by a confession of sin, an appeal for forgiveness and and a desire for repentance. But, otherwise, this interiorisation grasps nothing. Rather it experiences a resonance in which the self abides; a place where the breath within is able to blow away so much of the busyness and white noise that preoccupies us, to hear the wind without that enfolds that breathing within its own spirations. Because the soul is not effaced in this experience, it does indeed experience and recognise in this experience not only its own resting place, but its home, its true condition—the at-one-ment that sin disturbs and de-centred preoccupations of the world, in the world, obfuscates. And sin here is simply wanting to dominate, wanting to be in control, refusing the calling towards that centring, that pull towards the gyrations of the Spirit that draws the soul to itself, into a sweet submission of itself.</p>
<p>There is a finding in this; there is a seeking: the soul is not passive even in the reception and response to the divine that enfolds it; even within the divine that enfolds it. But the <italic>energia</italic> behind this finding and seeking and dwelling is not the will (although the will is involved at earlier stages, for it is the will that engages in the discipline of prayer, that determines setting aside time and space for such prayer). Then that which, in the silence, turns and in turning drags all things towards its centre, takes what is deeper than the self-determinations of the will, the whispering intimations of intimacy that permeates the will, and draws desire into its own desiring.</p>
<p>It is from this centring that all things are ordered and organised. Not in a static determination but a dynamic emergence and re-emergence: the body, its ceaseless perceiving, the stirrings of affection, the understanding and recognition of the relations, the analogical relations, that pertain in the interpenetration of self and world and Christ. Attunement is both the source and goal of discipleship. It can be pictured, as it is the Gospels, as a movement through the trees that flank Mount Carmel to the site of the Transfiguration, the place where Christ is manifested and recognised in His glory, in the midst of the prophets (Elijah) and the law-givers (Moses) and to lie prostrate with the other three disciples in adoration. Adoration is a continual outpouring and sacrifice of oneself into the reception of the continual outpouring and sacrifice of Christ for us. There is a restlessness in rest, but it is dispersed energies of wandering aimlessly, thrashing about for meaning and enjoyment. This is a restlessness found in the endless circulations of divine loving; the restlessness of the cosmic gyrations of divine creativity. This is the immersion of the world in Christ that we must suffer if we and the world with which we are to participate in that transfiguration. It is in the immersion that we are to discover again and again that attunement that is the source and end of all our ethical living.</p>
<p>The interiorisation <italic>is</italic> a withdrawal from the world, in the sense that the world’s frenetic activities have found their true place within the attunement; but, in another sense (that returns us to the observation on Edith Stein) it is an absorption in the world and one’s embodiment within it. We bear this absorption in the world to Christ, in Christ, in our seeking and finding; we submit this absorbed world to Christ in our adoration.</p>
<p>As Jesus responds to Satan in the wilderness: ‘man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God’ (Matt. 4:4). This word is, of course, nothing but God himself. In fact, in this apostrophe Christ speaks of Christ to Christ through Christ; it is only tangentially addressed to the Tempter himself. To enter into this spoken Word of God is to enter the zone of self-abandonment, a self-transcendence that does not go beyond the human, and the spirit of what is human, but perfects what the bodies, souls and spirit of human being were created for in the first place. This is not just the self-forgetfulness we noted in the athlete pushed beyond limits that he or she has determined for himself or herself (limits the body can overcome at certain times). This transcendence is a self-realisation. For, as von Balthasar reminds us: ‘we have been created in this world, and so it contains our entire truth, the whole concept of each of us.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0953946811428265">25</xref></sup> Immersed in the mystery of our embodiment we encounter the embodiment of God—in the world, in the body of Christ (as church and eucharist). It becomes flesh of our flesh, as Mary shared her own flesh with Christ’s. Of course, I have said nothing here of the very prerequisite for such praying—faith itself; that is, faith in God—the athlete’s faith is in himself or herself.</p>
<p>If, at this point, I break off, it is because I have reached the limits of my own experience. I could certainly develop my phenomenology to this point, but going further would be to wander into an imaginary landscape, a fantasy. If I were to go further, and there is much further to go (the very eternity of God’s intratrinitarian life), then I would have to rely upon the accounts of those who have dug deeper into themselves and into God than I: the saints, the mystics, the practitioners in prayer who are far more advanced than I. The point is that the process we are uncovering in and through prayer concerns sanctification, which exceeds any exertions on behalf of sporting excellence. If there is a coda to be added to what I have already said, it is that the process of sanctification is not just a spiritual but an affective one. This is dramatically, and poetically, captured in Ezekiel (36:26-27): ‘A new heart also I will give you, and a new spirit will I put within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgements, and do them.’ The reception of God’s Holy Spirit within the human spirit turns a heart of stone into a heart of flesh. The corporeality of this transformation cannot be marginalised. In fact, it can be examined in terms of the relations of the affections generally to any change that happens within it. What is suggested by the heart of flesh is a heart that is capable of responding like flesh to the environment and situations in which it finds itself. There is a sensitising that occurs through sanctification; a new openness to the world and a new ‘suffering’ that such an openness entails. Sanctification is physiological as well as spiritual; and because it is physiological it is also cognitive (related no doubt to the ‘new mind’ that Paul encourages us to put on in Christ [Phil. 2:1]). This sensitisation requires a deeper appreciation of our embodiment, the sensitisation we have been tracing throughout this lecture in terms of the body being a barometer not just of our physical condition but of our psychological and emotional condition as well. The sports person, the dancer—they appreciate their embodiment, that’s why we can learn something from their experience. I would also add, those at the opposite end of the fitness spectrum—the sick, the physically impaired—they too are acutely aware of their embodiment. In pain, in being physically challenged, as I have said elsewhere the soul becomes keenly conscious of its inseparability from the materiality of the body. Here too there are also—and possibly not dissimilar from those of the athlete—experiences of embodiment from which an incarnational theology can learn.</p>

<p>I am riding rough-shod over definitions of what a sport is throughout this essay. Certain characteristics of a sport distinguish it from ‘taking exercise’, for example: there is an element not only of physical exertion but competition with respect to a countering physical exertion. So I would not view either chess or tiddlywinks as sports. But my definition of a sport remains loose and under-defined.</p>

Flow is optimal experience of what Csikszentmihályi calls ‘psychic negentropy’: ‘it obtains when all the contents of consciousness are in harmony with each other, and with the goals that define the person’s self. These are the subjective conditions we call pleasure, happiness, satisfaction, enjoyment.
