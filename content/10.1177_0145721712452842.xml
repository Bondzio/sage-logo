<p>This year’s Annual Meeting and Exhibition will take place in Indianapolis, Indiana, from August 1 through August 4, 2012. The theme, Power of Partnership, is sure to provide diabetes educators with information to expand their roles and create new dimensions for diabetes education. As Sandi Burke stated in the President’s Message, many sessions at this year’s annual meeting will highlight the collaborations that occur every day in our workplaces. Whether we interact with fellow educators, local physicians, community health workers, or health care consultants, we all need to work together to better serve patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721712452842">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Partnerships mean different things to different people. AADE12 calls for partnerships that include not only educators, clinicians, researchers, but also individuals with diabetes. Successful partnerships reflect the collaboration as a whole among members of the health team, realizing one can do more than any of its individual parts (partners).</p>
<p>This year’s General Sessions will be each morning, Wednesday (August 1) through Saturday (August 4). On Friday, August 3, the keynote speaker is Dr Brian Wansink. His talk, “From Mindless Eating to Healthy Eating,” is based on his research and years as Executive Director of the US Dietary Guidelines. Dr Wansink will discuss the myths of mindless eating, illustrated with compelling videos, and speak of small consistent changes in eating each of us can make. On Saturday, August 4, the keynote speaker is Jane Pauley. Her talk, “Your Life Calling,” speaks to how people have reinvented the way they work and live. As a respected journalist for more than 30 years, Jane Pauley (a native of Indianapolis) is a member of the Board of Directors of the Children’s Health Fund and The Mind Trust. She is likewise the author of the <italic>New York Times</italic> bestseller, <italic>Skywriting: A Life Out Of the Blue</italic>.</p>
<p>This year the American Association of Diabetes Educators (AADE) is excited about offering a new series of educational workshops. Each session provides 2 continuing education credits (CEs) and includes education topics through various learning formats (interactive, panel discussion), including worksite wellness initiatives, national standards for diabetes self-management education, diabetes and minority populations, health information technology, mobile health technology, and migrant/transitional care.</p>
<p>Concurrent breakout sessions are 90-minute presentations on selected topics being offered Wednesday morning through Saturday afternoon. Culinary demonstrations will demonstrate healthy cooking options and share healthy recipe secrets. Product theatre sessions will present research findings on products, offer demonstrations, and highlight new products. All sessions are solely informational to gather more industry knowledge.</p>
<p>As always, the Annual Meeting promises to be an exciting opportunity to expand your knowledge, update your knowledge of products and technologies, network and share ideas with colleagues, and renew old friendships and make new ones. Advancing our knowledge means building on foundations of the past and partnering with others to build the future. See you in Indy.</p>
