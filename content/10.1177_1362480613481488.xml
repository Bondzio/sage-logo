<p>Recent interest in the securitization of immigration has highlighted a significant shift in immigration enforcement, from border regulation to the control of territorially present populations. Emphasis has focused on the production of migrant illegality and strategies that criminalize undocumented workers. In this article, we shift the focus of analysis to examine how legal residents convicted of non-immigration-related criminal offences are also actively produced as deportable subjects. Drawing on research examining records of appeal cases involving Jamaican nationals in removal proceedings consequent to a criminal conviction, we illustrate how deportability is produced by the deportation process itself, through legal practices that assert migrant criminality and alienage. We suggest ‘criminality’ not only comes to represent migrant subjectivity, at the expense of other forms of subjectivity based on belonging and territorial presences, but acts as affirmation of alienage.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>For some time crime scholars have been documenting a growing punitiveness in US crime control as states have responded to the rehabilitative failure of social welfare and neo-liberal responsibilization by incarcerating and incapacitating increasing numbers of ‘undesirable’ subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1362480613481488">Feeley and Simon, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1362480613481488">Garland, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1362480613481488">Wacquant, 2009</xref>). Following a sequence of reforms in US immigration law since the mid-1990s and a series of institutional transformations governing immigration enforcement, immigration agencies now appear to draw upon and extend this ‘new penology’ to the control of populations marked as ‘undesirable’ by virtue of their immigrant status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1362480613481488">Aas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1362480613481488">Bosworth, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1362480613481488">Bosworth and Kaufman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1362480613481488">Simon, 1998</xref>). New prison-like immigration detention centres have become key instruments in this new regime of immigration enforcement but it is deportation—or removal—that has emerged as the definitive mechanism for the punishment and incapacitation of non-citizens that violate US laws. Deportation, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1362480613481488">Kanstroom (2007</xref>: 20) points out, ‘renders the offender not simply a foreigner, but an expelled, banished, criminal foreigner—as complete an outcast as one can imagine’.</p>
<p>Recent interest in what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1362480613481488">Weber and Bowling (2008)</xref> refer to as the ‘crime-and-mobility-control-nexus’, suggests that as US immigration control has become more punitive it has also become less discriminate in its application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1362480613481488">Kanstroom, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1362480613481488">Sweeney, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1362480613481488">Welch, 2002</xref>). Contemporary immigration control appears to approach undocumented workers, asylum seekers and ‘criminal aliens’ equally unsparingly as an undifferentiated category of ‘foreigners for whom criminally punitive treatment and removal are uniformly appropriate and urgently necessary’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1362480613481488">Miller, 2005</xref>: 114). However, while the effects of immigration control give the appearance of ‘the ascendancy of deportation as an ever more pervasive and increasingly standardized instrument of statecraft’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1362480613481488">De Genova and Peutz, 2010</xref>: 3), immigration enforcement in the USA has simultaneously become a more refined and precise instrument.</p>
<p>Different immigrant populations are subjected to the logic of deportation through an increasingly sophisticated, expansive and complex suite of programmes, legislative changes and swollen institutional frameworks that, while effectively controlling diverse populations with similar punitiveness, target particular groups in very specific ways. In her study of mass deportations by the Israeli state after 2000, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1362480613481488">Willen (2010)</xref> illustrates how different ‘others’—legal migrant workers, illegal migrants, Palestinians within Israel and Palestinians in the occupied territories—have been variously and unevenly imagined in relation to Israel’s biopolitics of inclusion and exclusion. While noting that many of these ‘others’ now experience a shared threat of expulsion, her work highlights the contrasting legal, social, political and cultural practices through which differently situated populations are variably made subject to comparable expulsion (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1362480613481488">Wicker, 2010</xref> and the 2007 special collection of <italic>International Migration</italic> volume 45(5)). Similar interrogations of US deportation regimes are limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1362480613481488">Talavera et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Much of the recent scholarship on deportation from the USA in anthropology, geography, political science and sociology has focused on how the punitive practices associated with detention and deportation <italic>criminalize</italic> those found guilty of immigration-related offences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1362480613481488">Aas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1362480613481488">Allegro, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1362480613481488">Coleman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1362480613481488">Coutin, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1362480613481488">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1362480613481488">De Genova, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1362480613481488">Gilbert, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1362480613481488">Gleeson and Gonzales, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1362480613481488">Holmes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1362480613481488">Kanstroom, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1362480613481488">Varsanyi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1362480613481488">Welch, 2003</xref>). This work illustrates how undocumented migrants, in particular, have become acutely visible in recent years as ‘law-breakers’ for whom removal is to be expected as an inevitable consequence of their ‘illegal’ mobility. Beyond the legal scholarship on immigration law, very little attention in the USA context has focused on the practices through which other immigrant categories, such as non-citizens convicted of non-immigration crimes, are equally produced as deportable subjects (for exceptions see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1362480613481488">Coutin, 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1362480613481488">Zilberg, 2011</xref>). Indeed, in much of the contemporary social science literature, non-citizens convicted of non-immigration crimes—‘criminal aliens’—appear as an unambiguously deportable category of subjects to which the more ambivalently undesirable undocumented worker has recently been added via their criminalization. While highlighting how contemporary immigration control ‘lump[s] together’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1362480613481488">Bosworth and Guild, 2008</xref>: 703) undocumented migrants with ‘criminal aliens’ in a single category of deportable immigrants, the focus on the criminalization of the unauthorized provides little insight into the specific practices through which non-citizens with criminal convictions are also actively produced as deportable subjects.</p>
<p>In this article, we aim to extend emerging scholarship on the ‘criminology of mobility’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1362480613481488">Bosworth, 2012</xref>: 124) by contributing to an enriched understanding of how different immigrant groups are made variably subject to new and increasingly punitive forms of control. Drawing on an analysis of 84 reported appeal cases,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1362480613481488">1</xref></sup> heard in judicial courts between 1996 and 2011, involving Jamaican nationals targeted for deportation as a consequence of a criminal conviction, we examine how the legal management of convictions contributes towards the intelligibility of the individuals as deportable subjects. Individuals identified for removal on criminal grounds, unlike those <italic>criminalized</italic> for immigration violations, enter immigration removal proceedings from the criminal justice system, sometimes following release but increasingly via administrative detention. Records of their criminal convictions and imposed penalties determine their encounters with immigration enforcement and differentiate their experiences from those in violation of immigration laws.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1362480613481488">2</xref></sup> However, convictions and imposed penalties are much more than legal ‘triggers’ initiating the removal of those whose deportability is otherwise taken as self-evident. Rather, as convictions are repeatedly mapped onto migrant bodies through the court process, specific crime events—often minor and sometimes long-past—substitute for broader, more inclusive understandings of non-citizen subjectivity based on territorial presence, legal immigrant status and embeddedness in the national community. The individuals involved in the cases we examine entered criminal justice and immigration enforcement systems possessed of rich and complex narratives of entanglement and belonging in the United States. Sixty-eight of the cases involved individuals who were ‘Green Card’ holders at the time of their conviction. Yet, they emerge as determinatively criminal outsiders whose containment via removal is considered vital to collective security.</p>
<p>Non-immigration-related convictions are the primary grounds for removal among Jamaican nationals from the USA. In 2010, 78.6 per cent (1169) of deportations to Jamaica were the consequence of a criminal conviction compared with just 46.5 per cent (128,396) of those removed to Mexico, the leading country of origin of removals from the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1362480613481488">DHS, 2011b</xref>). Understanding how crime and mobility control are knitted together through the appeals process is thus also significant for understanding how the statecraft of crime and mobility control variably impact different racial, cultural and ethnic communities within the USA. In the next section, we situate our analysis in the context of changes in US immigration enforcement practices before moving on to consider how removability is secured through the appeals process. Using specific examples from the cases we examined, we illustrate how the legal management of convictions and sentences within the deportation process is actively implicated in the construction of deportable non-citizens as outsiders—both as ‘criminals’ and ‘aliens’—whose banishment is both legitimate and necessary.</p>

<title>Security, immigration control and the deportable ‘criminal alien’</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1362480613481488">Kanstroom (2007)</xref> usefully distinguishes between two bodies of deportation law: extended border control and post-entry social control laws. Extended border control laws perform the traditional role associated with the plenary power of federal government to regulate the condition of entry and residency of non-citizens. These laws typically operate on the border through embassies, passport control, visa issue and border surveillance, but have increasingly been decentralized and domesticated through the devolvement of immigration powers to local and state governments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1362480613481488">Coleman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1362480613481488">Varsanyi, 2008</xref>). Post-entry social control laws, in contrast, are those that act to govern conduct following the time of admission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1362480613481488">Kanstroom, 2007</xref>: 6). Detached from initial conditions of entry, post-entry control laws are powerful disciplinary instruments that can be reconfigured at any time to render deportable individuals who engage in activities, behaviours and affiliations deemed threatening to the national population. Historically, such laws have been variably deployed in relation to prostitution, organized crime and drug trafficking, as well as against individuals categorized as political and ideological ‘subversives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1362480613481488">Walters, 2002</xref>). Post-entry social control laws operate away from the border and, while they outwardly target specific groups and activities, their potential to apply to any non-citizen at any time in the future means they also operate indiscriminately on lawful and long-term resident non-citizens. For this reason, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1362480613481488">Kanstroom (2007)</xref> likens post-entry social control laws to a model of ‘eternal probation’.</p>
<p>The legal right to deport certain classes of ‘criminals’ has a long history, but for much of the 20th century non-citizen offenders were only subject to deportation in exceptional circumstances and most were, like national offenders, released after time served (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1362480613481488">Walters, 2002</xref>). Border control laws can be used to prevent individuals with criminal convictions from entering the USA or from naturalizing as US citizens, but recent immigration reforms have extended the focus of enforcement inward, away from the border, and towards a more direct and aggressive post-entry policing of criminalized immigrant bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1362480613481488">Podgorny, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1362480613481488">Stumpf, 2006</xref>). The ‘criminal alien’ only became visible in immigration law in 1988 when the Anti-Drug Abuse Act created a category of deportable criminal offences called ‘aggravated felonies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1362480613481488">Miller, 2003</xref>). Yet, it has come to represent a category of non-citizens whose removal is widely considered vital to public safety and national security. Even the Obama administration, which took office with a promise to defend immigrant rights and undo what many refer to as a ‘dragnet’ approach to deportation, has made clear the need to distinguish between, on the one hand, ‘violent offenders and people convicted of crimes’ and, on the other, ‘families … folks who are just looking to scrape together an income’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1362480613481488">Obama, 2011</xref>). Between 2000 and 2010, non-citizen removals from the USA more than doubled, increasing from 188,467 to 387,242 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1362480613481488">DHS, 2011a</xref>). While the majority of these removals, 63 per cent on average across the period, are associated with unauthorized and undocumented entry, the sharpest increase, particularly in recent years, has been in removals consequent to non-immigration-related convictions. Removals on criminal grounds have increased 134 per cent since 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1362480613481488">DHS, 2011a</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1362480613481488">Weber and Bowling (2008</xref>: 367), noting similar trends in the UK, suggest in contexts where ‘the immigrant-conceived-as-criminal’ is emerging as an embodiment of insecurity to be contained, we might expect ‘the immigrant who is actually convicted of a criminal offense to be doubly targeted for exclusion’.</p>
<p>The 1996 Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) and the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) introduced a number of measures aimed at managing and ‘securing’ the risk posed by ‘criminal aliens’. The acts expanded the criminal grounds for deportation while limiting access to opportunities to apply for relief from removal. When it was first introduced, the ‘aggravated felony’ category referred to a limited range of crimes; namely, weapons and drug trafficking, and murder. Immigration reform extended this list to include a range of less violent and more loosely defined offences. The reform acts also expanded the range of offences triggering deportation by reducing the qualifying sentence component for a crime to be considered an ‘aggravated felony’ from five years to a one-year requirement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1362480613481488">Sweeney, 2010</xref>). IIRIRA, controversially, permitted the reclassification of crimes to apply retroactively, thus also extending the temporal reach of immigration control to permit the policing of past criminal acts. The result was that after 1996, non-citizens could be served with removal orders consequent to convictions for minor drug possession, shop-lifting and theft, as well as past offences that were not qualified as deportable at the time of their conviction. Because IIRIRA amended the definition of imprisonment ‘to include the period of incarceration or confinement ordered by a court of law regardless of any suspension’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1362480613481488">Trinh, 2004–2005</xref>: 552), deportation could also be triggered by offences receiving no actual jail time.</p>
<p>Prior to the passage of AEDPA and IIRIRA, lawful permanent residents with a criminal conviction had a range of discretionary relief from deportation available to them which, in some cases, allowed legal consideration of their territorial presence. Among those, section 212(c) of the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) was available to those who had resided in the USA for at least seven consecutive years and had not served five years or more in prison due to an aggravated felony conviction. IIRIRA replaced section 212(c) with section 240(A)(a), called ‘cancellation of removal’, which erased the relevance of the alien’s own hardship and limited relief only to cases where the alien’s removal would result in ‘exceptional and extremely unusual hardship’ to US citizen or legal permanent resident family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1362480613481488">Podgorny, 2009</xref>: 297); the continuous residency requirement was also increased to 10 years. The reforms denied these provisions to lawful residents convicted of an aggravated felony and, as we discuss in the next section, also placed limits on judicial review of administrative decisions of immigration judges regarding deportation orders.</p>
<p>Legal reforms have been accompanied by new institutional arrangements, particularly post-9/11, which are designed to extend police powers and track convicted non-citizens across distinct but connected enforcement systems. Initiatives have focused on information sharing and enhanced reporting procedures to enable early identification of deportable individuals, prevent post-sentence release and expedite and secure removal. This has involved reconfiguration of the relationships between differently scaled jurisdictions in US immigration enforcement. For instance, immigration enforcement has been devolved through a variety of strategies now gathered under Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)’s Agreements of Co-operation in Communities to Enhance Safety and Security (ACCESS), to allow interested state and local government agencies to perform select federal immigration enforcement activities. The budget for these activities increased from US$5 million in 2006 to US$68 million in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1362480613481488">US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 2011</xref>). The ACCESS initiative also includes ICE’s Criminal Alien Programme, designed to identify ‘criminal aliens’ within federal, state and local prison systems in order to initiate removal proceedings and prevent release into the general public. Novel connections have also been established between the differently purposed systems of crime and immigration control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1362480613481488">Legomsky, 2007</xref>), enabled through initiatives such as the Secure Communities programme that ensures criminal record checks made by arresting local and state law enforcement officers are automatically forwarded from the FBI to ICE for checks against immigration databases.</p>
<p>Civil rights era legislation extended to non-citizens a range of positive rights, not dissimilar to those enjoyed by citizens, such as rights to welfare and education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1362480613481488">Sassen, 2002</xref>). These rights reflected the legal personhood of individuals, regardless of their immigrant status, and gave legal recognition to the territorial presence of immigrant populations, including those unauthorized and those convicted of criminal offences. The 1996 acts, along with welfare reform, marked a retrenchment and subversion of such inclusionary policies. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1362480613481488">Miller (2003</xref>: 647) puts it, ‘social liberal governing strategies’ have been displaced by a neo-liberal strategy of risk aversion that ‘weeds out certain undesirable non-citizens (and increasingly, citizens) through surveillance, fear, commodification and incarceration’. While immigrants can still benefit from equal due process rights in criminal court proceedings, initiatives such as the Criminal Alien Programme and the ICE ACCESS initiative, ensure they no longer move through the criminal justice system free from visibility in terms of their alienage. Non-citizen inmates are subject to additional surveillance and reporting requirements and, if convicted of an ‘aggravated felony’, exclusively detained at the conclusion of their sentence until deportation papers are secured. The management of criminal convictions in appeal cases also asserts alienage and, as a consequence, engages the judicial courts in these new practices for regulating membership and belonging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1362480613481488">Varsanyi, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Post-entry social control laws, then, do much more than differentiate between ‘criminal aliens’ and ‘good’, hardworking and law-abiding non-citizens. They also distinguish between failed and undeserving immigrants and the broader national community, of which they are not presumed to be part. The ‘criminal alien’ appears in deportation logic as an outsider, with few social ties to the deporting nation; they are represented as morally corrupt enemies of public good, purveyors of external threats to national values, and as self-evidently beyond assimilation and rehabilitation. They are problematized as ‘predators’ who use their mobility to ‘<italic>come to</italic> the United States to prey upon our neighbors and communities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1362480613481488">Morton, 2010</xref>, emphasis added). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1362480613481488">Morton (2010)</xref>, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), suggests such individuals are a threat to ‘a compassionate nation with a proud history of immigration … a nation governed by laws specifically designed to protect its citizens and residents’. Yet, such binary imaginaries, as they distinguish between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ immigrants, citizens and non-citizens, negate the possibility that non-citizens convicted of crimes, even violent offenders, also belong to families, many of them law-abiding and just looking to scrape together an income; they are parents, friends, colleagues and even children of citizens; they may have been employed and contributed productively to their families, communities and the national economy.</p>
<p>Indeed, contrary to the rhetoric justifying the prioritization of foreign criminal removals, many non-citizens with deportable convictions are often both long-term and legal US residents prior to their deportation triggering offence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1362480613481488">Hagan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1362480613481488">Human Rights Watch, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1362480613481488">TRAC, 2010</xref>). Over time, long-term residents build up social ties and engage in a range of lawful behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1362480613481488">Coutin, 2010a</xref>) that suggest ‘criminal aliens’ are not self-evidently and singularly criminal outsiders but rather produced as such, in part, we suggest, through the series of court hearings constituting the deportation process. Cases we cite in this article provide only glimpses into the diverse lived experiences of the individuals involved (c.f. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1362480613481488">Bosworth, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1362480613481488">Brotherton and Barrios, 2011</xref>). However, they offer concrete examples of how the legal management of convictions and sentences within the deportation process is actively implicated in erasing ties and constructing deportable non-citizens as outsiders (both as ‘criminals’ and ‘aliens’).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1362480613481488">
<title>Constructing ‘criminal alien’ deportability in appeals against removal</title>
<p>Despite the constraints, non-citizens with criminal convictions have continued to view the judiciary as a legal space in which to contest the application of post-entry social control laws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1362480613481488">Welch, 2003</xref>). The singularity of the appeals process in US immigration law is that it changes the space of discussion of deportation cases from immigration (administrative) bodies to the judiciary. Non-citizens charged by the DHS with removability on criminal grounds must initially appear in front of an immigration judge, who is expected to set out the grounds of removability and the availability of relief from removal. Conviction of an offence classified as an aggravated felony denies lawful permanent residents access to discretionary forms of relief. However, while the 1996 immigration reforms limited the grounds for judicial review, the 2005 REAL ID Act returned to courts of appeal the jurisdiction to review questions of law, including the Board of Immigration Appeals’ (BIA) application of law to facts, and constitutional violations in immigration cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1362480613481488">Kanstroom, 2006</xref>). Non-citizens wishing to appeal a decision of an immigration judge must first file an Administrative Appeal with the BIA, and this process must be exhausted before a case can be considered for judicial review. Appeal courts cannot overturn any decisions made in immigration courts, they may only grant a ‘petition for review’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1362480613481488">Kanstroom, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Sixty-three of the cases we analyzed involved crimes and criminal convictions categorized by the DHS as aggravated felonies, and thus the individuals involved as ineligible for any form of discretionary relief; 13 cases involved controlled substance convictions, the remaining eight were for firearms convictions and crimes of moral turpitude. The aggravated felony category masks a wide variety of offences. For example, in our cases, drug convictions were by far the most common crime classified as an aggravated felony but the category also includes, indiscriminately, certain theft crimes, murder, endangering child welfare and manslaughter. The vast majority of cases (77) were pursuant to crimes involving sentences that were less than five years, many of which were not considered deportable convictions prior to 1996. Several individuals in these cases had already served a criminal sentence and resumed lives back in the national community, often lawfully, before immigration law reconfigured their past criminal act(s) as indicators of enduring criminality and potential threat to collective security.</p>
<p>Sixty-eight of the 84 cases involved individuals who were legal permanent residents at the time of their conviction. In the 58 cases in which dates of entry to the USA were provided, the average time of residence between entry and the date of conviction for a deportable offence was 12 years; 35 individuals had been resident for over 10 years at the time of their deportable conviction; adding time for sentence served and lags in the deportation process itself, most had been resident for much longer by the time of their appeal hearing. Passing references in hearing documents to US citizen parents, children and spouses, provide glimpses of the sorts of citizen-like attachments these individuals established as a result of their territorial presence. Case records indicate that of those lawfully resident for more than 10 years, at least 16 had family ties in the USA, including citizen family members, and nine of them were less than 10 years old when they entered the USA. That individuals with such biographies of presence and attachment actively contest their removal should come as little surprise. However, what is striking about these cases is how such significant indicators of insiderness are so effectively negated and rendered invisible.</p>
<p>That removal orders are persistently tested and contested suggests that the punitive power produced by the ‘crime and mobility control nexus’ is not without limits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1362480613481488">Ellermann, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1362480613481488">Paoletti, 2010</xref>). Measures that exist in some registers as automatic penalties and policies of zero-tolerance appear in others as negotiable and dependent practices. However, participation in the appeal process does have significant implications for the way individuals are required to construct themselves as subjects of the law. While the appeal process is an important space to challenge deportation, the evidence we examined suggests that the legal process through which non-citizens must travel in order to negotiate their removal constructs their deportability by asserting their enduring criminality and alienage over other forms of subjectivity based on belonging.</p>
<sec id="section4-1362480613481488">
<title>Constructing enduring criminality</title>
<p>One of the key techniques through which criminality is attached to non-citizens with criminal convictions is the adoption, in 1996, of a categorical approach to the evaluation of crimes as grounds for deportation. Although the categorical approach is intended to expedite removal, restricting the need for discretionary consideration by limiting the entry of individuating circumstances into deportation proceedings, the classification of aggravated felonies has been particularly vulnerable to appeal. ‘Aggravated felony’ only exists in immigration law and federal criminal statutes, not in state statutes. As a result, enforcement of deportation on criminal grounds has involved mapping convictions and penalties based in different state-level criminal statutes onto the federal-level felony category. Determination is based solely on the interpretation of conviction records in relation to relevant statutes. As appellate courts have jurisdiction to consider the interpretation of the law, they can review the immigration bodies’ determination of whether or not a crime constitutes an ‘aggravated felony’.</p>
<p>Of the 63 cases we examined involving aggravated felonies, the two most common grounds for appeal were the characterization of the crime as an aggravated felony (20 cases) and the denial of access to relief from deportation under 212(c) of the INA as a result of crimes convicted prior to 1996 being retroactively reclassified as aggravated felonies (15 cases). Denial of access to relief due to the reclassification of crimes was also the most common grounds for appeal among those being deported for controlled substance convictions. Given that convictions and penalties imposed in the criminal courts have become the determinative factor in the removal process, and that judicial courts are largely limited to considering points of law and procedure, contesting the classification of crimes is an obvious strategy for achieving a result that might allow individuals to sustain their social ties and family relations. For a legal permanent resident, continually present for 10 years, a successful challenge to the classification of a conviction undermines their conclusive deportability.</p>
<p>However, while deportation is an immigration power, the nature of the cross-contamination of criminal and immigration enforcement is such that in order to enter into this negotiation, potential deportees must necessarily contest their removal on the grounds of their criminality, rather than their relation to their immigration status, citizenship or territorial belonging. In other words, because the law only permits consideration of matters relating to their conviction, their legal subjectivity is persistently and exclusively reconstructed and self-constructed in terms of their criminality rather than their legal migrant status.</p>
<p>In our sample, the courts remanded one-third of cases involving challenges to the classification of a conviction as a deportable aggravated felony. In some cases, this was based on a view that the BIA and charging immigration judges were in error in their categorization of state convictions. In a 2010 case, for instance, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals held against the immigration courts in ruling that a lawful permanent resident’s two misdemeanour convictions under New York Penal Law § 221.40 for the criminal sale of marijuana did not constitute aggravated felonies (<italic>Thomas v. Attorney General</italic>, 2010). The petitioner in the case was first arrested in 1996 for the suspected sale of $20 marijuana, nine years after entering the USA, aged 13, as a lawful permanent resident; he was similarly arrested in 1997 for the sale of $5 of marijuana to an undercover police officer. He had pled guilty on both counts and was sentenced to three days of community service for the first offence. In 2007, an immigration judge charged the petitioner with removability on the grounds that he sold marijuana for remuneration, a crime that constituted a federal felony under the Controlled Substances Act. The circuit judge, however, remanded the case on the grounds that the immigration judge had failed to adhere to the categorical approach by consulting a police officer’s written statement, which was not present in conviction documents. The circuit judge determined that the original guilty plea, the only permissible record, did not admit to the sale or exchange of marijuana, the only two grounds for concluding that a conviction constitutes a federal felony. The case of <italic>Scarlett v. US Department of Homeland Security, ICE</italic> (2009) was remanded on similar grounds. In this case the BIA relied on a forensics report to decide whether the drugs in the initial possession charge contained cocaine base in sufficient quantities to qualify the conviction as an aggravated felony. The judge charged that the BIA ‘should not have looked to [the] forensics report … since [the] report was not within class of documents constituting alien’s record of conviction’ (<italic>Scarlett v. US Department of Homeland Security, ICE</italic>, 2009).</p>
<p>Documentation, or rather the lack of it, has been identified as a key instrument prohibiting ‘illegal’ immigrants’ eligibility for services and access to certain legal protections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1362480613481488">Coutin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1362480613481488">De Genova, 2002</xref>). Without key documents, ‘illegal’ immigrants are unable to prove their territorial presence and are rendered ‘legally absent’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1362480613481488">Coutin, 2000</xref>: 28). In the case of non-citizens facing deportation as a result of non-immigration-related offences, documentation, in the form of conviction records, permits their legal recognition and, on occasion, as the cases above illustrate, their successful appeal. However, regardless of how such documents are mobilized—whether to contest or reinforce a deportation order—they assert a particular form of visibility and legal subjectivity. While the space of the judiciary has been widely used by non-citizens to challenge the categorical approach, the process assures that their legal presence is contained by what is recorded in conviction documents.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the exclusive focus on conviction documents means judicial courts are not permitted to take account of the facts of the criminal case itself. For instance, conviction records documenting a 121-month sentence for marijuana possession fulfils the government’s burden to prove conviction for possession of more than 30 grams of marijuana, and therefore eligibility for deportation. The specific details of the crime convicted have no legal significance, only that the 121-month sentence is well above 60 months, the normal cap for possession of 30 grams or less of marijuana (e.g. <italic>McCarthy v. Mukasey</italic>, 2009). A criminal conviction is the only reason lawful permanent residents in our study were placed in deportation proceedings, yet the specific contexts of their offences are entirely erased. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1362480613481488">Human Rights Watch (2009)</xref> notes similarly that US immigration authorities recorded no crime data for 94.7 per cent of the 87,844 Green Card holders deported solely on criminal grounds between 1997 and 2007. The personal conduct of the offender or the danger which that conduct poses to the USA is not considered relevant ‘but is satisfied by evidence of the past act alone’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1362480613481488">Sweeney, 2010</xref>: 69).</p>
<p>The categorical approach also ensures that there is no legal space to acknowledge any evidence of rehabilitation. The exclusive reference to the conviction focuses decision making on a single moment in time: ‘It frames out any post-crime circumstances, conduct, experiences, or relationships that tell a different story about the individual, closing off the potential for redemption and disregarding the collateral effects on the people and communities surrounding the noncitizen’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1362480613481488">Stumpf, 2011</xref>: 1711). Time and territorial presence are collapsed into a decontextualized crime event and the circumstances of the offence, what happened before conviction or, in many cases, after release, are legally erased. The courts’ management of convictions and penalties thus ensures that what remains, as a marker of non-citizen subjectivity, is simply the criminal act. Absent any counterbalancing evidence or concern for rehabilitation, conviction documents are effectively used to ‘diagnose’ an enduring criminal condition and, therefore, likely recidivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1362480613481488">Coutin, 2005</xref>). This is also indicated in the discursive shift in the legal term used to refer to non-citizens with convictions from ‘convicted’ to ‘criminal’ aliens. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1362480613481488">Miller (2003</xref>: 652) suggests the latter is not only ‘more pejorative’ but, by moving attention away from the contextual limits of a particular act, it also ‘implies that the subject has an enduring criminal nature’.</p>
<p>The categorical approach for managing criminal records in immigration courts thus disregards the efforts of the criminal system to take into account the history of the defendant and the impact of the crime on the victim in designing a sanction that fits the seriousness of the criminal behaviour and the culpability of the offender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1362480613481488">Stumpf, 2006</xref>: 85). The question of the reintroduction of offenders back into the community, inherent in criminal sentencing, is also ignored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1362480613481488">Stumpf, 2011</xref>: 1710). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1362480613481488">Kanstroom (2007)</xref> suggests, regardless of their immigrant status, migrants are effectively placed on eternal probation, the violation of which depends less on their future conduct and more on security-driven changes in the legal reach of post-entry social control laws. The reduction of the qualifying sentence component for a crime to be considered an aggravated felony from five years to a one-year requirement, for example, changed the conditions of ‘probation’ for many migrants with relatively short sentences, which prior to 1996 would not have triggered removal. In the case of <italic>Johnson v. Holder</italic> (2010), for instance, the petitioner had been convicted, in 1992, 14 years after his legal entry as a lawful permanent resident, on a charge of sexual assault on a minor and sentenced to 30 months of supervised probation and nine months of work release, but no prison time. In 2006, 14 years after this single conviction, the DHS arrested him and charged him with removability on the grounds of his aggravated felony conviction (<italic>Johnson v. Holder</italic>, 2010). The petitioner had come to the attention of the DHS in 2003 when his application for naturalization was denied ‘because of his poor moral character, evidenced by his conviction’ (<italic>Johnson v. Holder</italic>, 2010). In his appeal against the immigration judge’s denial of access to a waiver of relief from deportation, the circuit court upheld the immigration judge’s decision on the grounds that, irrespective of the sentence served or the absence of further conviction in the intervening years, the conviction of a sexual assault on a minor was categorized as a deportable aggravated felony.</p>
<p>The ability of immigration enforcement to intervene in the association of different crimes with proportionate punishment allows total banishment and incapacitation to be imposed to a full range of convictions, including relatively minor and past offences. It is not surprising that the Second Circuit has referred to deportation as ‘a sanction which in severity surpasses all but the most Draconian criminal penalties’ (quoted in <italic>Wallace v. Reno</italic>, 1999). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1362480613481488">Chan (2005</xref>: 161) suggests the purpose of such exceptional punishment is ‘to expel individuals deemed beyond rehabilitation and a threat to the nation’. Yet, the deportation process does much more than remove those whose deportability is already secured. The determinative significance the categorical approach gives to conviction documents at the expense of other evidence, including that which might demonstrate rehabilitation, suggests that even in appeal hearings, the deportation process is active in producing individuals as threats to be secured. Post-entry social control laws, therefore, do not just enable the management of risks and threats to national security; they form part of a range of practices that construct those risks, through actively producing immigrant criminality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1362480613481488">
<title>Denying alternative migrant subjectivities</title>
<p>The second way deportation law and legal practice produce deportable subjects is by making it impossible for individuals targeted for deportation as a consequence of a criminal conviction to occupy other subject positions simultaneously, particularly those associated with their territorial presence in the USA. In her study of Salvadorian migrants, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1362480613481488">Coutin (2000)</xref> suggests that while the territorial presence of undocumented immigrants is informally tolerated, legally they occupy ‘spaces of non-existence’. She documents how ‘legal non-subjectivity’ is routinely reproduced through such practices as those that only recognize documented experiences, define work only in terms of wage labour, negate kin ties and limit spatial mobility. While legal status and criminal records provide documentable experiences for the ‘criminal aliens’ in our study, the legal space for their communal life to be formally recognized is similarly constrained, particularly for those convicted of aggravated felonies. As is the case with undocumented migrants, the social ties that long-term residents build up prior to their deportation triggering conviction are rendered legally non-existent. In part, as we have already suggested, this is because convictions and sentences have come to occupy the legal subjectivity of individuals targeted for deportation on criminal grounds. In this sense, in contrast to undocumented migrants, the territorial personhood of criminal deportees is replaced with a particular presence—criminality—rather than non-existence and non-subjectivity. However, immigration reform has also had a more direct impact on the legal space available for individuals to represent themselves as territorially present persons.</p>
<p>After the 1996 reforms, a non-citizen convicted of an aggravated felony was ‘conclusively presumed to be deportable from the US’ (AEDPA, 442(c)) and this is reflected in the denial of access to discretionary relief via a 212(c) waiver. 212(c) relief from removal required courts to weigh the equities in deportation cases, balancing negative factors (e.g. seriousness of the crime, evidence of recidivism and character) against positive factors (e.g. family ties, long-term residency, age at entry, family hardship, military service, evidence of good character, service to the community and rehabilitation). As a result, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1362480613481488">Sweeny (2010</xref>: 61) suggests, ‘a broad expectation developed in the immigrant community that, even with a criminal conviction, an individual would have a chance to fight deportation by appealing to the discretion of an immigration judge’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1362480613481488">Pratt (2005</xref>: 72) cautions against understanding legal discretion as ‘a crucial feature of individualized justice’ allowing for ‘the tailored and humane application of general rules and laws to individual cases’. Instead, she recommends, discretion is much better understood as a governmental technology that gives ‘practical effect’ to a range of discursive practices that categorize, divide and filter deserving and desirable immigrants from those that must be banished.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding such governmental effects, ineligibility for discretionary relief is a significant loss for non-citizens in deportation cases as it further narrows the permissive range of legally recognizable immigrant experiences. Twenty of our cases involved legal permanent residents petitioning immigration court decisions denying access to a 212(c) waiver of relief from deportation. The terms on which such cases could be granted suggest the individuals involved possessed rich and diverse stories of attachment, belonging and proximity to citizenship. Yet, post-1996, for those convicted of a crime classified as an aggravated felony, these insider narratives were rendered legally invisible and irrelevant. In hearing a 1999 appeal against removal on criminal grounds, in which the petitioner had been denied access to a 212(c) waiver due to the reclassification of a pre-1996 conviction, Massachusetts District Judge Gertner, highlighted the significance of the waiver application, suggesting it was the means non-citizens had to ‘show more of their humanity—their ties to this country, their contributions to the polity—than the label “alien” otherwise suggested’ (<italic>Wallace v. Reno</italic>, 1999).</p>
<p>In addition, territorial presence is rendered invisible through a range of other legal frameworks governing the deportation process. Key among these is the fact that appeal courts are not authorized to consider any matter in a case that has not been previously submitted to the immigration court and the BIA. As the 1996 reforms rendered individual experiences irrelevant in immigration hearings, legal permanent residents’ ties with the USA are rarely fully explored in the processes that contest removability before the immigration judges and the BIA. This means records brought forward to appeal hearings usually include comprehensive evidence of a non-citizen’s criminal record, but little detail of any family relationships or other potentially favourable considerations, such as connections with US citizens or, equally important from the perspective of the individuals in our study, an absence of connection to Jamaica. Immigration enforcement thus confines the ability of individuals to represent themselves as embedded in social relations territorially inside the national community before both immigration bodies and the judiciary. In a 2007 case, a petitioner appealed to the circuit court for reconsideration of his deportability on the grounds that he claimed ‘derivative citizenship’ and that his removal would cause hardship to his two teenage children, who were both US citizens. The appeal court rejected the petitioner’s argument, not because it lacked merit but because he had failed to raise a hardship claim, along with evidence of his family relationships, before the immigration judge and the Board of Immigration Appeal (<italic>Lewis v. Gonzales</italic>, 2007). The petitioner entered the USA as a lawful permanent resident in 1986, aged 14. In 1999 he was convicted of a drug-related offence and served a sentence of less than five years, during which time he was served with a removal order. Although the petitioner in this case never naturalized, his three children and his father were all US citizens.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1362480613481488">Coutin (2005)</xref> suggests there are several ways individuals can contest allegations of their criminality, one of which is to resist allocation as a social outsider by highlighting involvement in legitimate social activities such as work, family life and neighbourhood affairs. By negating the continuous territorial presence of non-citizens, and making legally absent information relating to their health, family, community or rehabilitation, the deportation process thus limits their opportunities to contest efforts to diagnose their criminality. It also eradicates the notion of passing foreignness and reasserts the alienage of lawful and long-term residents. Indeed, it is ‘criminality’—assured by the legal presence of criminal convictions and the legal absence of territorial presence—that has itself come to signify alienage.</p>
<p>Pre-1996 laws, which took account of time of residence prior to conviction, ‘associated criminal propensities with proximate cause’ and recognized that ‘criminal offenses committed long after entry were considered unlikely to result from criminal propensities developing in a foreign country’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1362480613481488">Miller, 2005</xref>: 101). The 1996 laws overturned this thinking and, by erasing the temporality and spatiality of specific criminal acts, advanced the assumption that criminality was not only an enduring condition but it was also one that was alienage-related. When boundaries between citizens and non-citizens are at their most porous, as they are with long-term legal migrants, non-citizen criminality confirms and re-establishes alienage.</p>
<p>The determinative significance of criminal convictions in defining outsiderness for legal residents is demonstrated by the denial of avenues of relief provided by section 212(h) of the INA to long-term residents convicted of an aggravated felony, while still affording the right to apply to non-lawful permanent residents convicted of like offences. Section 212(h) provides an opportunity for those inadmissible to the USA because of a conviction to apply for a waiver, if more than 15 years have passed since a conviction and they can demonstrate they have been ‘rehabilitated’ and will not pose a threat to ‘the national welfare, safety, or security of the United States’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1362480613481488">McDermid, 2001</xref>: 776). The 1996 Acts denied to lawful residents convicted of an aggravated felony access to this ‘relief through the backdoor’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1362480613481488">Stumpf, 2011</xref>: 1710). Relief under 212(h) was raised in 13 of the cases we examined and was contested on the grounds that the differentiation it makes between lawful permanent residents and non-lawful permanent residents is unconstitutional.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1362480613481488">Stumpf (2011)</xref> suggests the difference in the availability of this avenue of relief contradicts the understanding that the level of constitutional and statutory rights granted to individual non-citizens is related to their continuous presence in the territory. Yet, the legal discourse has specifically construed migrants’ territorial presence in the USA as one of the reasons for why they are especially undeserving of expanded rights, such as access to waivers of relief. In 2001, the Seventh Circuit explained that lawful permanent residents (LPRs)</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>enjoy rights and privileges not enjoyed by non-LPRs and have closer ties to the United States through family and employment relationships; consequently, Congress may have rationally concluded that LPRs who commit serious crimes despite these factors are poor candidates for relief from removal.</p>
<attrib>(quoted in <italic>Barton v. Ashcroft</italic>, 2001)</attrib>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For the legally present, therefore, a criminal conviction indicates not simply an enduring criminality but also a failure to assimilate and, therefore, a continued foreignness.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Deportation is exclusively experienced by non-citizens but for those legal categories of migrants, such as the lawful permanent resident, for whom ‘alienage’ has, in many respects, receded through continued territorial presence, it is ‘criminality’ that has become the central condition of possibility for their removal. Constructed as ‘criminal alien’ subjects with little connection to wider communities and citizens, long-term lawful residents can be more readily and legitimately subjected to new forms of punitive practice, regardless of whether they have served their criminal sentence or can demonstrate evidence of rehabilitation. While the spatial banishment of ‘criminal aliens’ often involves highly visible practices such as imprisonment, detention and removal, we have argued it is also achieved through legal practices which assert criminality and sever attachments to the deporting nation. We have set out some of the ways the 84 Jamaican nationals in our study, despite convincing evidence that their attachments to the USA are as significant as they are to Jamaica, become intelligible as both ‘criminal’ and ‘alien’ subjects. Deportation, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1362480613481488">Coutin (2010b</xref>: 359) suggests, ‘is not supposed to transform individuals. Rather, it is supposed to be a consequence of already being both alien and unauthorized.’ Nonetheless, she goes on to argue ‘there is a sense in which the process of deportation produces the very “alienage” and “illegality” from which it is supposed to flow’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1362480613481488">2010b</xref>: 360). Singling out ‘criminal aliens’ from the broader category of removable subjects, we have suggested further how the deportation process also produces the alien ‘criminality’ from which it is similarly supposed to flow. We have highlighted, in particular, how appeal courts operate as sites of containment and exclusion, where both ‘criminality’ and ‘alienage’ are actively secured.</p>
<p>Understanding how varied practices are engaged in making certain individuals intelligible as deportable subjects is important because, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1362480613481488">Coutin (2000</xref>: 10) argues, they ‘negotiate not only the status of the individuals in question but also the relationship between states and citizenries, the nature of movement, the meaning of presence, and the legitimacy of existence’. By untethering criminal acts from their spatial and temporal contexts and ‘proximate causes’, the deportation process not only produces deportable individuals but it functions to maintain discursively the ‘compassionate and law-abiding’ nation. The USA is self-produced through the legal process as a nation hospitable to those who obey the law but a tough judicial space for those who fail (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1362480613481488">Aliverti, 2012</xref>). Erasing time territorially present facilitates the legal attachment of criminality and alienage to individual non-citizens with convictions and assures that responsibility for ‘criminality’ is exported, along with the deportee, to Jamaica. Relocating the national border onto individual migrant bodies ensures that proper belonging to the sovereign state can be policed in diverse spaces beyond ports of entry.</p>
