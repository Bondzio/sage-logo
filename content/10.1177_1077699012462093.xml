<p>The Supreme Court has often observed that there is no hierarchy among the rights guaranteed by the first ten amendments to the U.S. Constitution. The Bill of Rights exists primarily to forestall government from impeding citizens’ exercise of these fundamental rights. Sometimes two of these rights—for example, the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of the press and the Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial—come into conflict. Then judges must utilize balancing tests to determine which interest will triumph in a particular set of circumstances. But neither right is inherently diminished in the process. Both rights survive intact, and the “loser” might prevail on another day.</p>
<p>So what happens if two constitutional rights independently proscribe government intrusion into your rights? You would think that this kind of double whammy would put you in a very favorable position if the government is on the offensive against you. But according to Amos N. Guiora, a professor at S.J. Quinney College of Law at the University of Utah who spent nearly twenty years as an officer in the Israel Defense Forces, mixing together the rights to freedom of speech and freedom of religion can actually create a lethal cocktail. Rather than making the citizen who exercises both of these rights in tandem virtually invulnerable to government restrictions or punishment, he contends that the level of protection received should be less than the sum of its parts. He argues in <italic>Freedom From Religion: Rights and National Security</italic> that what he calls “extreme religious speech” not only can be restricted, but <italic>must</italic> be restricted in order to protect society from harm from “religiously motivated terrorism,” a phrase Guiora borrows from Professor Nadine Strossen, the former president of the American Civil Liberties Union. He calls religious extremism “<italic>the</italic> threat that most endangers contemporary democratic society,” and because of its “extraordinary ability to influence the listener,” religious speech should, in turn, be treated like “any other threat facing the state,” and at least in some cases, enjoy less protection than secular speech.</p>
<p>An earlier edition of Guiora’s book has been described as “impassioned,” and if “passion” is judged by the use of italics, his “clarion call to action” certainly qualifies, as he uses them liberally. But if a law professor is going to propose new categorical restrictions on speech, it behooves him, at least under First Amendment doctrine, to define that speech with precision. However, Guiora, who describes himself as “not a religious person,” declines to define exactly what he means by “religion.” Presumably, he knows it when he sees it, particularly when it is manifested by what he labels “religious extremism.”</p>
<p>He provides us with myriad examples from several countries, including Turkey, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Israel, and the United States, from the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin by right-wing radicals, to forced marriages of underage girls by adherents to the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, to Al Qaeda’s attacks on American interests throughout the world. All, he contends, arose from religious speech. Therefore, the speech must be curtailed.</p>
<p>Some of Guiora’s proposals make sense. He insists that a clear distinction between civil society and religion is essential to guarantee a true separation of church and state. He chides liberal societies for misdirected efforts such as banning the wearing of the hijab by Muslim women, which he considers unnecessary and “classic overreactions” to something that is no threat to security. Yet he also contends that existing U.S. law prohibiting incitement to immediate violence is insufficient to provide the restraints on provocative speech that he believes are necessary, and proposes that governments silence speakers based on the possibility that someone <italic>may</italic> act as a result of hearing what they say, rather than waiting until someone actually does. Though acknowledging this is “admittedly problematic,” he claims it is nevertheless essential to protect society as a whole.</p>
<p>Given his willingness to jettison First Amendment protection in the name of public safety, it is not surprising that Guiora criticizes the media as well as governments for their handling of religious extremism. Although conceding that some news reporting is “in-depth and balanced,” he describes much of the press coverage as “hysterical,” “politically correct,” “dismissive,” or “deferential,” thereby contributing to public ignorance and exacerbating an already dangerous situation.</p>
<p>I might find Guiora’s arguments more persuasive if he did not rely so heavily on anonymous sources (his footnotes are replete with references to “private conversations” and “private emails” with unnamed individuals), make factual errors like asserting that the Salem witches were burned at the stake (they were hanged or pressed to death), and if he was more judicious in his use of italics. I don’t doubt that the threat raised by the actions of religious extremists is real. But he conflates speech and actions, and Guiora has not convinced me that the way to address terrorism is by draconian curbs on freedom of speech. As this book demonstrates, “hysteria” is never very far away when dealing with terrorism and religion.</p>
