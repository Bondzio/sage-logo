<abstract>
<p>From 2001, the construction of flats and high-density developments increased in England and the building of houses declined. Does this indicate a change in taste or is it a result of government planning policies? In this paper, an analysis is made of the long-term effects of the policy of constraint which has existed for the past 50 years but the increase in density is identified as occurring primarily after new, revised, planning guidance was issued in England in 2000 which discouraged low-density development. To substantiate this, it is pointed out that the change which occurred in England did not occur in Scotland where guidance was not changed to encourage high-density residential development. The conclusion that the change is the result of planning policies and not of a change in taste is confirmed by surveys of the occupants of new high-rise developments in Leeds. The new flat-dwellers were predominantly young and childless and expressed the intention, in the near future, when they could, of moving out of the city centre and into houses. From recent changes in guidance by the new coalition government, it is expected that the construction of flats in England will fall back to earlier levels over the next few years.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In England, between 2000 and 2008, the density of new residential development increased substantially. The construction of new detached houses dropped whilst the construction of flats and apartments trebled, many of these flats being in tall blocks built in or near the centres of large English cities.</p>
<p>The question we address is: ‘what was driving this move to higher densities?’ Is it that there has been a change in taste, with the English suddenly preferring to live in flats rather than houses? This is one alternative, a view which was put to one of the authors recently by a senior planner—“People are buying these flats so they must want them”. The other alternative is that the shift results from a combination of government policies, mediated by economic pressures, a view which might be similarly summarised as ‘People are buying these flats because they can’t afford anything else’.</p>
<p>Our research looks at various aspects of the problem. Yet our answer is that the shift in the type of housing being built was the result of government planning policies, in particular those set out in the planning policy guidance on housing (PPG 3), published in March 2000, following the publication of the Rogers report in 1999. Both encouraged construction of housing at higher densities.</p>
<p>Our conclusion is based on an analysis of the problem using three different approaches. We start by examining the economics of the situation and, in particular, the way in which the long-run policy of constraining the availability of land for development has caused an increase in both land values and density over the past 40 years. We then look at the changes over the past 10 years and show that the dramatic increase in the construction of flats occurred in England but not in Scotland, and that this would seem to have happened because government planning guidance was different in Scotland. Then we look at the attitudes expressed by flat-dwellers themselves in surveys carried out in central Leeds. Finally, we note that scarcely any elderly people or families with children live in these new apartments. Further, the young people who do live in them fully intend to move out after a few years. Thus a problem is building up for the future as few houses are being built and the elderly who currently live in these houses appear to intend to remain in them while they can.</p>
<p>In 2009, after the collapse in the housing market, the proportion of new homes which were built as flats fell. Also, the number of new homes which were completed fell considerably in that year and continued to fall in 2010 so the change means little other than that, in a declining market, the price of houses held up better than the price of flats, and that the construction of blocks of flats could be halted and the buildings ‘mothballed’ in a way that the construction of new houses could not. Of course, in 2010 the new coalition government modified the guidance given in the Planning Policy Statement on Housing a month or so after its election and plans, with the introduction of a New Homes Bonus, to incentivise local authorities to build more and larger homes, and these changes should have the effect of reducing the proportion of new homes built as flats in England over the next few years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0042098011405692">
<title>Evidence from Surveys</title>
<p>In the case of the UK at the present time, the evidence from surveys is very clear. A survey carried out by MORI in 2005 for the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment found that over 50 per cent of those questioned would wish to live in a detached house whilst 22 per cent would prefer a bungalow. Only 2 per cent of the population said they would wish to live in a flat in a low-rise block and only 1 per cent wished to live in a high-rise block of flats. Since detached houses and bungalows imply low density whilst flats imply high density, it is clear that people’s preference, unconstrained by questions of cost, is for low density.</p>
<p>Other survey evidence confirms this. One carried out by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation in 2004 found that people preferred houses to be built in their area rather than flats and that the type of housing people most disliked was blocks of flats of four or more storeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042098011405692">Platt <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). And recent academic research into people’s satisfaction or dissatisfaction with their immediate neighbourhood found that</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>those living in higher density built forms … were a quarter more likely to be dissatisfied with their neighbourhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098011405692">Parkes <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>, p. 2434).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Of course, it is possible that the increase in the construction of flats results from only a very small increase in the demand for flats, but that the effect of this shift is magnified because the existing supply is so small. If the proportion wishing to live in a tall block of flats increased from 1 per cent to 2 per cent, this would represent an increase in demand of 100. However, the survey of flat-dwellers in Leeds which is set out later in this report shows that just over half of them regarded their residence as temporary and intended to move within two years (86 per cent of the renters and 30 per cent of the owner-occupiers). Thus there does not seem to have been any significant shift in attitudes and opinions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0042098011405692">
<title>Change over Time</title>
<p>Surveys, of course, may fail to take account of questions of cost and availability. People may want to live in a detached house but be unable to afford it. An agricultural worker might want to live in a tall block of flats, but would be very unlikely to find one in the village. So we have to take economics and economic change into account.</p>
<p>Economic change occurs over time. As incomes increase, we would expect that people’s demand for housing will increase. The income elasticity of demand in Britain is, on average, greater than one, so we would expect, <italic>ceteris paribus</italic>, that the increase in demand over time because of increases in real incomes would result in houses and dwellings becoming significantly larger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042098011405692">Meen and Andrew, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098011405692">Meen, 2008</xref>). Purely from visual evidence it is clear that this is what happened in England through the latter half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. However, in the second half of the 20th century, things changed.</p>
<p>This was because a policy of urban containment had come about in the UK. The boundary of urban areas was determined by planning policies rather than by the demand for living space. By the early 1970s, this was becoming increasingly apparent. Hall <italic>et al</italic>. published their monumental survey of <italic>The Containment of Urban England</italic> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042098011405692">1973</xref> and, indeed, the last chapter of Evans’ book on residential location (also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098011405692">1973</xref>) was an analysis of the economics of green belts.</p>
<p>This policy of containment and constraint was at first unintended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042098011405692">Hall, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098011405692">Cullingworth, 1997</xref>). The assumption made in the plans for Britain’s post-war cities drawn up by Abercrombie and others was that sufficient land was being made available within the inner edges of the green belts and in New Towns on the other side of the green belts to accommodate the anticipated demand for land. The demand for housing increased in a way that was not foreseen, however, but the plans were never changed. Demand increased both because of increasing real incomes and because of a higher birth rate. Both these things had not been a feature of Britain between the wars and were not anticipated after it.</p>
<p>Thus the demand for space increased, but the supply of land did not increase in step with this higher demand. The result was that the price of land for urban uses such as housing rose above the price of agricultural land and is now about two or three hundred times higher. (The price of agricultural land in southern England is unlikely to be higher than £10 000 per hectare—the same land with planning permission for residential development could be sold for £2million or more. In the 1930s, the price of building land was little more than the price of agricultural land; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042098011405692">Cheshire and Sheppard, 2000</xref>.) That this increase was due to both increasing demand and constrained supply was for many years either not realised or denied by urban planners. Their position was finally set down in a publication for South East Regional Planning, written by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042098011405692">Steve Grigson (1986)</xref>, and responded to by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098011405692">Alan Evans (1987)</xref> in a paper published by the House Builders’ Federation. To settle what was called the Grigson/Evans argument, the Department of the Environment asked <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042098011405692">Gerald Eve a</xref>nd Associates and the Department of Land Economy at Cambridge to adjudicate. This they did in 1992, confirming the economists’ view that constraints on the availability of land caused land prices and house prices to rise by more than they would have done otherwise as demand increased.</p>
<p>As the price of land—one factor of production—rises, so basic economic analysis tells us that other factors of production, labour and capital, which have not increased in price to the same extent, will be substituted for land. In brief, there will be an increase in the capital/land ratio as developers find it profitable to economise on the use of land. Most obviously, gardens will become smaller—each house is on a smaller plot—and this change can be easily seen if we compare English houses built 40 or more years ago with those built more recently. The anticipated adjustment in the capital/land ratio can also be seen as people extend their houses, in effect creating a larger house in a smaller garden. Or as existing houses with gardens are demolished and replaced by town houses.</p>
<p>Finally, as land becomes more expensive, it becomes worthwhile developing it even more intensively, by constructing flats and so minimising the land cost per dwelling still more. Of course, on the demand side, people will respond to the increase in the relative price of larger houses and of land, by cutting down on the amount of space they might otherwise expect to occupy, buying smaller houses or flats than they would do otherwise and in general settling for less.</p>
<p>This process of adjustment over time can be seen in various ways. The proportion of new private homes which were built as bungalows in Britain fell from 26 per cent in 1969 to 4 per cent in 1998 whilst, on the other hand the proportion which were flats rose from 12 per cent in 1969 to 17 per cent in 1999 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098011405692">Evans, 2004</xref>). This can be seen as a response to changing prices since the statistics show that the price of bungalows and detached houses tended to rise by more, in the long run, than the price of flats. Yet, interestingly, the proportion of new dwellings which were built as detached houses actually rose over the period as people responded to higher incomes and spending power. On the other hand, the proportion which were built as semi-detached houses fell.</p>
<p>We have set out this summary at some length in order to show that what is bought is conditioned by what is available and the price which has to be paid. We cannot just say that ‘people buy flats so they must want them’. To cite an extreme example: during the siege of Paris during the Franco-Prussian War, the Parisians ate rats, cats and dogs. That did not mean that during that period tastes changed, only that other things became unavailable at any affordable price.</p>
<p>The increase in demand constrained by supply has gone on for about 50 years. As we have shown, as demand has increased, land has increased in price and housing has increased in price. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042098011405692">Kate Barker (2004)</xref>, in her <italic>Review of Housing Supply</italic>, recorded that between 1971 and 2001 the price of housing increased at about 3.3 per cent per annum in real terms, a rate about the same as, and probably slightly higher than, the real increase in average incomes over the period.</p>
<p>The result has been an increase in density as plots have got smaller, as an increasing number of flats have been built, and a decreasing number of bungalows. Because the cost of housing has risen in real terms, the average size of new homes has got smaller, so that the smallest new homes in western Europe now appear to be being built in England. Statistics are difficult to obtain but in 1996 the average size of a new home in England was 76 square metres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098011405692">European Union, 2003</xref>). This is much smaller than the figure for other western European countries with equivalent income levels. Moreover, the average size of a newly built dwelling in England during the period 1981 to 2001 was 82 square metres, suggesting that house sizes were smaller in the 1990s than they were in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Was this move to higher densities desired by people? Only, it would seem, in the sense that the policy of constraint was generally supported. Owner-occupiers also approved the increase in the value of their homes. Yet, at the same time, they could also complain that their grown-up children could not afford the sort of housing that they themselves could afford at the same stage in life. Thus support for higher densities was not actually there, only support for the policies which resulted in the higher densities, usually without any perception of the connection. The result is that people could, in the same conversation—as we can testify—both approve of constraint and complain of higher prices. The same person will object to new homes being built in their area while regretting that their graduate son or daughter is still living at home or has to be subsidised to be able to afford ‘decent’ living space.</p>

<sec id="section4-0042098011405692">
<title>The Past 10 Years</title>
<p>In the previous sections of this paper, we have demonstrated that the policy of constraint resulted, between about 1955 and 1999, in a gradual shift towards higher densities. Yet, in the past few years, what was previously a gradual change speeded up: indeed, it turned into a sudden sharp shift towards much higher densities.</p>
<p>In our view, this change can be attributed to a number of policy changes which occurred after the publication of the Rogers report, <italic>Towards an Urban Renaissance</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098011405692">Urban Task Force, 1999</xref>). New Planning Policy Guidance to local planning authorities with regard to housing was published in March 2000 and the White Paper <italic>Our towns and cities: the future</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042098011405692">DETR, 2000a</xref>), in November. In <italic>PPG 3: Housing</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042098011405692">DETR, 2000b</xref>), English local authorities were instructed that they should avoid the inefficient use of land. In particular</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>policies which place unduly restrictive ceilings on the amount of housing that can be accommodated on a site, irrespective of its location and the type of housing envisaged or the types of households likely to occupy the housing, should be avoided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042098011405692">DETR, 2000b</xref>).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It went on to state that local planning authorities should therefore</p>
<list id="list1-0042098011405692" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>—avoid developments which make inefficient use of land (those of less than 30 dwellings per hectare …</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>—encourage housing development which makes more efficient use of land (between 30 and 50 dwellings per hectare net); and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>—seek greater intensity of development at places with good public transport accessibility such as city, town, district and local centres or around major nodes along good quality public transport corridors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042098011405692">DETR, 2000b</xref> p. 19).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In addition, it laid down that at least 60 per cent of new homes should be built on brownfield sites.</p>
<p>This was a substantial shift from the attitudes expressed in the previous version of PPG 3, published in 1992. The earlier version talked of ensuring that new housing fitted in with the characteristics of the surrounding environment and other housing in the area. What happened was that, as prices rose, developers could get permission for high-density developments which would not previously have been permissible because they would have been out of scale with their surroundings. In consequence, since 2001 it is this policy change which has resulted in a dramatic increase in the proportion of dwellings which have been constructed as flats throughout the English regions and an equally dramatic fall in the proportion of new dwellings which have been constructed as detached houses or bungalows. The NHBC statistics are summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042098011405692">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0042098011405692">2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0042098011405692">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0042098011405692">2</xref>, show the proportions of both built in the years since 1993.</p>

<p>This shift is, as we have said, dramatic and it cannot be explained as part of the general, gradual change which has occurred since 1955 as a result of the general policy of constraint. Moreover, it has occurred throughout England, even in ‘low-density’ regions like the North East, but it has not occurred in Scotland.</p>
<p>When devolution occurred in 1999, planning was one of the activities which was devolved. Thus the policy changes set out earlier were confined to England and did not affect Scotland. Certainly, there has been a policy of encouraging the reuse of brownfield sites, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042098011405692">Dixon and Adams (2008)</xref> have recently noted, but it was a general policy of the kind which had existed in England before 2000. No specific target for the use of brownfield sites was laid down.</p>
<p>Furthermore, higher densities were not encouraged in the same way as in England. <italic>Scottish Planning Policy 3: planning for housing</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042098011405692">Scottish Executive, 2003</xref>)—the Scottish equivalent of the English PPG 3—states that</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The efficient use of land is an important planning aim … But high density development is not always appropriate. Local plans should provide guidance on density appropriate to particular locations and sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042098011405692">Scottish Executive, 2003</xref>, p. 4).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It also refers specifically to the possibility that densities may be reduced, stating that local authorities should</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>identify any areas where it is proposed to replace obsolete higher density housing with medium density in order to increase choice, particularly on peripheral estates … [and] identify areas where existing densities should not be exceeded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042098011405692">Scottish Executive, 2003</xref>, p. 5).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The result has been that in Scotland, as <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0042098011405692">Table 3</xref> shows, there was no fall in the proportion of new dwellings built as detached houses and bungalows—it was 43 per cent in 1999 and it was 43 per cent in 2006. And, as <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0042098011405692">Table 4</xref> shows, there was no significant increase in Scotland in the proportion of new dwellings built as flats. It might be argued that this is because the average density over the whole of Scotland is much lower than it is in England. Yet, as we have already noted, in the ‘low-density’ English regions, the increase in density was as dramatic as elsewhere; indeed, the shift was possibly more dramatic in the low-density regions such as Yorkshire and Humberside or the Eastern region than in the regions with big conurbations because flat construction was so low before and housing construction so high, as can be seen in the tables. (Greater London is omitted from these tables because most new dwellings have been flats for some time.)</p>

<p>The sharpness of the change in the English regions suggests that this was not a change in taste. People did not wake up in 1999 to the news that Rogers had said that they would like living at high densities if the architecture was better and say ‘Yes, he’s right, I’d like to live in a flat now’. Indeed, as we remarked earlier, the CABE survey suggests that very few people actually aspire to live in a flat and still fewer in a high-rise flat. And the lack of any similar change in Scotland confirms, almost beyond doubt, that the shift was not the result of a change in tastes. If it had been, this change would have been reflected in changes north of the border. There, living in a flat or tenement has always been more usual in cities like Edinburgh or Glasgow than in English cities of a similar size. So, if the change were a result of a shift in taste one would have thought that it would have had a head-start in Scotland. Instead of which, virtually no significant shift in the pattern of construction is visible.</p>
<p>Thus we are left with only one explanatory argument. Put into economic terms, the price of land has to have reached a level that it is perceived to be profitable for developers to build at high densities in English towns and cities—for example, the 40-storey block constructed in Reading. Thus, the strengthened policy of constraint has to have resulted in house prices being even higher than they were before so that, with the abandonment of the residential density controls which had been a feature of British planning since World War 2 and before, it became possible to build at much higher densities almost immediately.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0042098011405692">
<title>Living at High Density</title>
<p>Of course, we need not assume what people want from the way that they act; we can ask the residents of flats about the way that they live. This has been done by one of the authors, Rachael Unsworth, in surveys carried out in Leeds in 2003, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042098011405692">2005</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042098011405692">2007</xref>.</p>
<p>Tall, high-density blocks of flats have only recently been constructed there. At the beginning of 2003 there were about 1800 units. Two years later, the number had nearly doubled to 3500 and, by the beginning of 2007, the number had increased to 5700. At that time, there were a further 3800 under construction; planning permissions were in existence for a further 5600; and there were believed to be a further 6200 on which developers were drafting plans in order to obtain permission. Of course, most schemes that were not committed by late 2007 have been put on hold or cancelled.</p>
<p>When major development first started, many of the units were bought off-plan as ‘buy to let’ investments, but later units were more likely to be bought by owner-occupiers. In both 2005 and in 2007, the proportion of those surveyed who owned their apartment was 44 per cent, whilst 56 per cent rented.</p>
<p>The 2007 survey was carried out by mailing questionnaires to 4510 addresses. Some 610 completed surveys were returned for analysis, a response rate of 13.5 per cent. There was no noticeable spatial bias in the responses in that more or less the same proportion seemed to be returned in each of the eight postal districts where central-city flat construction had taken place.</p>
<p>The issues addressed by the questionnaire were</p>
<list id="list2-0042098011405692" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>—profile of city-centre dwellers;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>—attitude towards parking and transport;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>—factors influencing decision to live in city centre;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>—attitude to living in the city centre; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>—areas for improvement.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>As we have said, about half those responding were tenants and half were owner-occupiers. For nearly 90 per cent of those surveyed, the Leeds address was their only residence. Just over 10 per cent of those surveyed therefore had two homes, where the Leeds address was either their first or their second home. This group, as one might perhaps expect, tended to be older and to have a higher income.</p>
<p>Apart from this small group, the residents of the flats, whether tenants or owner-occupiers, tended to be young; indeed, about 60 per cent were 30 years old or less. In 2007, the proportion of this group who were under 25 years old had increased since 2005 and 60 per cent of this youngest age-group had moved into their property in the previous 15 months. Most of this group were thought to be students. Of the residents as a whole, few could be described even as middle-aged. So only 18 per cent of residents were aged 41 or more. These tended to be owner-occupiers, in more expensive apartments and in more senior jobs and, as we have already noted, a high proportion had two homes.</p>
<p>As might be expected, given that the great majority of the residents are young people, 51 per cent, just over half, are single; 45 per cent are married or cohabiting; only 4 per cent were divorced or separated. This demographic pattern is reflected in the occupancy of the flats. Just over half the flats (52 per cent) have two adult occupants and 46 per cent are occupied by only one person. Significantly, only 2 per cent of households include children. Overall, the average occupancy is 1.6 persons per apartment.</p>
<p>To summarise these results, the residents of the flats are predominantly younger, most are single, only a tiny fraction of the flats are occupied by families.</p>
<p>Why this is so is evidenced by residents’ responses to questions about their future intentions. First, the vast majority, 86 per cent, of the renters did not plan to stay at their current address for more than two years. In part, this may have been because many were students, but it is also well known that renters tend to be more mobile than owner-occupiers.</p>
<p>For the whole population, however, their listing of the factors likely to make them move out of the city centre indicated that, with greater maturity and higher incomes, most would move out. These responses are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0042098011405692">Table 5</xref>. Having children tops the list, whilst getting married is also significant. Preferences for a house rather than a flat and for more living space are also significant. Thus, 89 per cent listed ‘inadequate living space’ as an important factor likely to cause movement out of the city centre, whilst 83 per cent listed lack of green space in the city centre as a reason and 80 per cent their preference for a house rather than a flat.</p>

<p>These preferences meant that even the owner-occupiers did not see themselves as staying very long in the city centre. Thirty per cent planned on moving within two years, whilst only 34 per cent had ‘no immediate plans to move’. This tendency to regard life in the city centre as temporary is demonstrated by the fact that 75 per cent of the households had a car, a figure which is close to the national average—and this even though nearly 60 per cent of the respondents walked to work.</p>

<title>Some Further Comments</title>
<p>To try to answer the question set out at the beginning of this paper, the move towards higher densities in England is the result of government policies. Yet another question remains to be answered—‘what are the implications of this shift for different household types, especially families with children?’—and we shall try to give a response to that question.</p>
<sec id="section7-0042098011405692">
<title>The Elderly</title>
<p>One group is represented little if at all in the Leeds survey—the elderly. Yet much of the argument for building large numbers of small flats has been based on the idea that demographic change, in particular an increase in expected life-span after retirement, means that there are, and will be, an increasing number of small households consisting of one or two old-age pensioners.</p>
<p>Of course there are a number of reasons why the elderly are unlikely to be represented in a survey of the occupants of central-city flats. First, they are not working and so do not need to live near their work and can therefore live where space is cheaper. Secondly, the central-city lifestyle, which may be an attraction for the young, is rather less likely to be an attraction for the old. So, to the extent that householders move out of their previous house when their children have left home and they have retired from work, they are unlikely to locate near the city centre. The problem is, therefore, that this is where most of the flats are being built because that is where it is economic to do so, despite the general argument, outlined earlier, that building large numbers of flats is necessary to accommodate large numbers of small households consisting of the elderly.</p>
<p>There is, in any case, another factor which is important to an understanding of the situation. The argument that flats should be built to accommodate the elderly assumes that they will wish to move into a smaller dwelling than they occupied earlier in life. In fact, simple observation of people’s behaviour suggests that this happens fairly rarely. People stay on in the family home for years after their children have grown up. The children may leave when the couple are, say, about 50. If couples remain there in their 50s and early 60s why should they then choose to move out on retirement? First, the surplus space may be occupied by children and grandchildren visiting. Secondly, they have furnished the house, are attached to it and they do not want to move. Thirdly, for an owner-occupier, there is no financial incentive to move. Most will have ensured that the mortgage is paid off at the time that they retire, if not before. Council taxes are regressive in structure and significantly lower than the domestic rates which would have had to be paid on larger properties. Indeed, one of Margaret Thatcher’s arguments for the abolition of domestic rates was that she did not see why the elderly widow should have to pay the same tax on her property as a large family because she did not use the same services. So, council tax is reduced by 25 per cent when one partner dies leaving a sole occupant. And people’s assessment will be that the value of the house is likely to be the same, even possibly higher, in the future so there is no incentive to sell now. So we see large numbers of detached houses occupied by the elderly, whether singly or as a couple, and they will generally remain there. It follows that the new flats being constructed are more than likely to be occupied by the young who, as we have shown, themselves wish to move into a detached house in a few years’ time.</p>

<sec id="section8-0042098011405692">
<title>Families with Children</title>
<p>The survey evidence that we have set out relating to the young flat-dwellers in central Leeds indicates that they did not intend to stay in these flats for very long. It is very clear that they intended to move out when older, when they were married, when they could afford more space and when they had children. A tiny proportion of the existing flat-dwellers, 2 per cent, had children living with them. Yet few houses are being built and few of those are detached. Possibly the houses exist, but they are occupied by older people and these, whether single or a couple, see no reason to move out, as we have already argued. Thus there are two possibilities with regard to the near future. The first possibility is that the existing occupants of the flats will be able to move out, as seems to be their intention, in a few years’ time, with greater maturity, family responsibilities and higher incomes. However, this means that the supply of new flats now being built is too great for the size of the market and market prices will collapse as demand ceases to keep pace with supply. We will comment on this possibility later, in the context of the ‘buy to let’ market. The second possibility is that, as the elderly remain in the existing houses, those families which would wish to move out of the flats into houses will find themselves unable to do so because they cannot find housing which they can afford of a type they wish to move into. In this scenario, prices remain high, but the flats are occupied by families with children who become as frustrated with their existence as the families in the council tower blocks of the 1960s.</p>
<p>Which scenario is the more likely depends to some extent on the stability of the ‘buy to let’ market. The experience of Leeds is that most of the first flats built in the city centre were bought ‘off-plan’ by ‘buy to let’ investors. This experience persuaded developers that there was a potentially very profitable market. Later flats were largely bought by owner-occupiers, however. And given that rent levels scarcely cover the cost of borrowing, investing in ‘buy to let’ property only makes economic sense to the investor if it is anticipated that prices will go on rising at a rate of at least 3 per cent in real terms. As the supply of flats increases, this seems increasingly unlikely. Indeed, there was anecdotal evidence of flat prices falling significantly in 2007, even before the more general fall in prices in 2008, as distressed sales resulting from repossessions resulted in lower prices (although since mid 2008 such properties have come forward in lower numbers). In the case of Leeds, the council has now recognised an increasing mismatch between supply and demand with a great unmet demand for family housing. And of course attempts to steer housing provision towards meeting this demand will make the price of flats even more likely to fall, a fall which might turn into a collapse if ‘buy to let’ investors seek to get out while they are still showing a profit.</p>
<p>Neither of these scenarios is to be wished for, but in fact we would expect that both will be partly true. Households with families will be frustrated in their lack of choice, the more so since, if they are owner-occupiers, the price of the flat that they own will have fallen substantially relative to the price of the housing they would wish to move into.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0042098011405692">
<title>The Current Position Nationally</title>
<p>House prices started to fall in 2008 and the fall continued into 2010. The fall up to that time was not as great as many expected, but it was still substantial. The evidence with regard to the new housing market is that the fall in flat prices was greater than for houses. The NHBC data show that the expected prices of new flats started in England in 2009 were about 20 per cent less than the expected prices of those started in 2008, whereas for houses the decrease was only about 10 per cent. The expected prices of new flats started in Scotland in 2009 were about the same as in the previous year. The proportion of new homes which were being constructed as flats also fell in England, from 51 per cent of the total to 40 per cent (but did not change in Scotland). Yet too much cannot be made of this. Analysis of price trends over the previous three house price downturns shows that the prices of flats have always fallen faster and further, in real terms, than the prices of houses and econometric analysis suggests that they tended to lead—i.e. fall first (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042098011405692">Andrew and Evans, 2010</xref>). Also the number of homes being completed fell by nearly a third between 2008 and 2009 and, as the fall in housing starts is even greater, completions in 2010 will be still lower. Thus, given the evidence relating to previous recessions, we cannot argue that the recent boom in flat construction has itself led to overconstruction and a price fall. On this, at the time this is written, the jury must remain out.</p>
<p>The coalition government elected in May 2010 made a number of changes which will affect future development, however. In June 2010, a month after the election, it revised <italic>PPS 3: Housing</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042098011405692">DCLG, 2010a</xref>). The requirement that housing density should be at least 30 dwellings to the hectare was removed. On the other hand, the requirement that at least 60 per cent of new homes should be built on brownfield sites was retained, whilst altering the definition of ‘brownfield sites’ so that gardens no longer counted as such. Thus the policy of constraint was both relaxed and tightened. In October 2010, the <italic>Local Growth</italic> White Paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042098011405692">Department of Business, Innovation and Skills, 2010</xref>) spoke of the future reform of planning to give more power to local communities and of the introduction of a ‘New Homes Bonus’ to encourage them to permit new housing development. Flesh was put on this proposal in the <italic>New Homes Bonus: Consultation</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098011405692">DCLG, 2010b</xref>) in November. This proposed that local planning authorities would receive an incentive, from central government, equal to the additional council tax which might be paid on a new home and that they would receive this for six years after construction. Clearly, since council tax is higher the larger the home, the incentive is significantly greater when the homes permitted to be built are larger. One would expect that the net effect would be to reduce the proportion of new homes which are built as flats.</p>
<p>Since the coalition has abolished the housing targets set by the previous government, it is not clear that more homes will be built in total, however. The coalition has also proposed, in the <italic>Local Growth</italic> White Paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042098011405692">Department of Business, Innovation and Skills, 2010</xref>), that more power should be given to local communities to approve or refuse permission for development. Many would expect that this would give greater weight to NIMBYism, but the coalition presumes that, to the extent that this is so, it will be counteracted by the incentives given by the New Homes Bonus. As an incentive, however, the amount offered by the bonus is not that large as a proportion of a local authority’s income. What is most likely, therefore, is that the total number of homes built will not increase, and certainly not substantially, but, as we have said, the proportion of flats will fall and the proportion of houses will increase. The change will take time, however, since local authorities, through their Local Development Frameworks, have already set out their plans for the next few years. The process of adjustment will be slow and slowed further by the time it takes to recover from the recession.</p>
<p>The oversupply of central-city flats is therefore likely, in the long run, to be limited and prices are likely to stabilise as the economy recovers but fewer new flats are built. Predicting the future is difficult, however, at the time of writing (January 2011) because, although the cost of borrowing money is currently cheap, banks are unwilling to lend. This means that the ‘buy to let’ market is supported as people find it difficult to borrow money to buy. However, this situation cannot be expected to last.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>So, to conclude, first, a longer-term implicit policy of limiting the land available for development has meant a shift towards higher densities over the past 40 years as house and land prices have risen. Yet, more recently, there has been a dramatic shift in the character of new housing as builders have responded to policy shifts occurring around the year 2000. There is no survey evidence to suggest that people want to live at higher densities, although in general most are also happy to support the policies of constraint, possibly because they do not see the connection between their lack of choice and the policy of constraint.</p>
<p>Of course, as the case study of Leeds indicates, there are benefits to be derived by certain kinds of household from consuming a relatively small amount of space in the city centre at a price that is still competitive with the amount that such a household would have had to pay for larger accommodation further away from the centre. Yet the phenomenon of high-density living space in a central location has not come about as a response to consumer choice so much as from a response to policy encouragement, planning constraints and a particular set of financial market circumstances during a period of ‘turbo capitalism’. This high-density living has been affordable to many young households because the supply came forward at a high pace, while family homes were not being provided in numbers that anywhere nearly matched demand. Yet once these young city-centre residents have outgrown the brief experience of city living, they will be competing for the still-constrained supply of suburban or small-town family property with which they are more familiar from their own childhood. High density does not, by itself, a European city make.</p>
<p>Finally, we note that the coalition government has significantly modified planning policy towards housing since its election and we would predict that there will be a fall in the proportion of new homes built as flats over the next five years as developers and planners react to the new situation.</p>
