<abstract>
<p>Increasing theoretical and empirical interest has turned to the process and dynamics of offender decision making and to how offenders commit discrete acts of crime. One outcome is attention to how offenders manage risks they view as significant. Here, the authors examine how carjackers script and manage victim resistance—the foremost obstacle in the accomplishment of robbery. Using semi-structured interviews with 30 carjackers, the authors explore their perspectives on the ramifications of victim resistance and their strategies to forestall and control it. The authors find that offenders are cognizant that resistance interferes with their goals and that mistakes in managing their victims not only lead to unsuccessful carjackings but also threaten their safety. Much of the scripting of criminal opportunity and the enactment of carjacking are explained, therefore, by strategies offenders use to minimize the chances that victims can resist. Discussion focuses on the implications of findings for theories of offender decision making.</p>

<p>Robberies are dangerous for both victims and offenders. The fact that they result in more felony homicides than any other serious crime reveals how perilous they can be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022427810397949">Zimring and Hawkins 1997</xref>). This is in part because unlike surreptitious crimes, such as burglary or motor vehicle theft, must confront their victim. This confrontation increases offenders’ chances of victims besting them and necessitates that they devote some thought to preventing resistance. The inherent danger of robbery makes its participants attentive to managing criminal scenes and conditions that aid or hinder management of potentially recalcitrant victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022427810397949">Gill 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022427810397949">Luckenbill 1981</xref>). Therefore, the decision to engage in robbery suggests that robbers have reenvisioned the risks of crime (e.g., victim resistance) and their personal capacity for dealing with these situational threats.</p>
<p>Despite the potential loss of freedom and the risks of serious physical harm to themselves and to victims, those who commit violent, acquisitive crime appear to be quite optimistic about their chances of success, at least when referencing a particular crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022427810397949">Shover 1996</xref>). Such optimism appears to be common among those who seek out risky activities. By focusing on skills they have developed through tutoring and/or practical experience, risk takers are able to assuage the fear and anxiety associated with their actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022427810397949">Lyng 1990</xref>). Robbers seemingly are able to neutralize fear by having confidence in their experientially gained abilities to maintain control of the situation and to improvise and adapt to unfolding dangers. Their ability to shirk danger arises partly from the accurate perception that the odds of escape are favorable for any single offense but also stems from specific strategies and skills (i.e., scripts) that they have developed for selecting opportunities and accomplishing crimes unscathed.</p>
<p>The spontaneous and impulsive nature of most crime contributes to the tendency to oversimply the criminal decision-making process. Thus, it is useful to map the scripts offenders use when enacting their crimes so that the incremental development of the decision to offend can be better understood. Doing so gives insight into the routinized, yet flexible, nature of criminal decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022427810397949">Cornish 1994</xref>:151). Here we draw on interviews with carjackers to explore the way they script their crimes to avoid potential catastrophe resulting from the primary risk of robbery-resistant victims. Drawing on script analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022427810397949">Cornish 1994</xref>), we elaborate on the robbery event to understand how victim resistance factors into decision-making at each stage of the crime. In addition, we discuss how offenders interpret failed carjackings and incorporate the lessons learned into future crimes and scripts. This qualitative understanding of victim management incorporates contingencies of situations as interpreted by offenders with an emphasis on their strategic responses to event dynamics. Our findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of robbery and of carjacking, but more importantly, they provide insight into the formation, implementation, and updating of criminal scripts and their role in engendering confidence.</p>
<sec id="section1-0022427810397949">
<title>Crime Scripts</title>
<p>Choice perspectives in criminology are premised on the assumption that crime is purposive behavior designed to achieve desired goals and that decision-making reflects these goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022427810397949">Cornish and Clarke 1986</xref>). Potential offenders decide whether to commit a crime by weighing perceived rewards against perceived costs, while also considering the efficacy of alternatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022427810397949">Cornish 1994</xref>). While decisions are based in part on abstract calculations of the risks and rewards of committing any crime, those interested in criminal decision-making increasingly have turned their attention to examining foreground risks and rewards that offenders take into account when considering discrete acts. This approach is derived from the notion that criminal predispositions manifest only in certain circumstances and that offenders have mental templates that they apply to select crimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022427810397949">Brantingham and Brantingham 1993</xref>). Moreover, the risks and rewards considered as offenders choose targets and seize criminal opportunities unfold in sequences that are unique to the type of crime they are considering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022427810397949">Cornish and Clarke 1986</xref>). Thus, there are particular tracks of acquisitive violent crime including crimes such as commercial robbery, mugging, and carjacking.</p>
<p>Script analysis is a useful device for understanding the process and structure of offender decision-making in particular types of offenses and in discrete crimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022427810397949">Cornish 1994</xref>). As used in criminology, scripts are “programs for behavior stored in memory that, when elicited, may serve as guides for behavior” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022427810397949">Tedeschi and Felson 1994</xref>:181). Scripts guide an actor’s situational understanding by providing a general behavioral protocol for how to respond to contingencies. They contain representations of situations in the form of recognizable cues that trigger interpretation of what is occurring in a scene, expectations of how it is likely to develop, and plans to achieve goals. Additionally, scripts contain procedural requirements and sequential dependencies so that early events produce or enable later events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022427810397949">Cornish 1994</xref>). By drawing attention to the way that episodes develop in the situation and in the mind, the script concept offers a device for analyzing purposive, goal-oriented actions such as acquisitive crime.</p>
<p>Criminological research suggests that scripts develop through a learning process involving tutelage as well as personal and vicarious experience. Scripts rarely are created fully formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022427810397949">Brantingham and Brantingham 1993</xref>); instead, when used successfully, they are repeated. When they are used unsuccessfully, they are modified accordingly. Thus, the scripts individual offenders develop are based, in part, on personal experience and outcomes, which may explain why offenders report such wide variation in ideal targets and crime locations. Despite these idiosyncrasies, general patterns for specific types of crimes can be articulated by examining offenders’ accounts of their crimes. Identifying these patterns places criminologists in a better position to understand the nature of criminal decision-making.</p>

<title>Enacting Robberies and Managing Victims</title>
<p>Criminologists have devoted a great deal of attention to understanding how robbers enact their crimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022427810397949">Gill 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022427810397949">Jacobs 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022427810397949">Lejeune 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022427810397949">Luckenbill 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022427810397949">1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022427810397949">Wright and Decker 1997</xref>). This body of literature shows that robbers are goal oriented and focus much of their energy on establishing and maintaining unquestioned control of the scene. This quest for control affects how robbers enact their crimes. The importance of control over the situation is exemplified by Jacobs’ (2000:74) assessment of robbers who target drug dealers, “Each phase of the offense—from approach to announcement to goods transfer—must establish [control] if drug robberies are to have any chance of success.” While most research on enacting robbery did not rely on script analysis, it is possible to articulate a typical robbery script from the findings.</p>
<p>Establishing control begins with the approach. To ensure success, robbers must close the distance with their prey without raising suspicion prematurely. Muggers take two primary approaches when doing this. The most frequent approach is to “manage normal appearances” by posing as an innocuous citizen intending to engage in a benign interaction, such as pretending to borrow money, a cigarette, or a light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022427810397949">Luckenbill 1981</xref>:29). The other strategy relies less on deceit and more on “stealth or speed to sneak up on unwitting prey” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022427810397949">Wright and Decker 1997</xref>:97). Regardless of how robbers approach intended victims, their overriding goal is to establish co-presence without signaling that something is amiss so as to limit the capacity of victims to flees or resist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022427810397949">Luckenbill 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022427810397949">Wright and Decker 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Once the robber has approached the victim, it is necessary to ensure that all have a common definition of the situation so that victims understand their role in the event. Part of this interaction consists of robbers creating the “illusion of impending death” by making it known that their goal is robbery and that they will escalate violence if the victims “force” their hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022427810397949">Wright and Decker 1997</xref>). Offenders contend that the chances of victims resisting are reduced when they project the willingness and ability to use contingent force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022427810397949">Luckenbill 1981</xref>). Thus, when they possess lethal resources (e.g., firearms) it often suffices to brandish the weapon. Alternatively, when the punitive strength of their resources is perceived to be limited, robbers often resort to incapacitating force at the onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022427810397949">Luckenbill 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>After robbers procure property, they must escape in a way that limits victims’ abilities to attack or call for help immediately. The two available options are to have the victim “stay put” under implicit or stated threat of death while the robber departs or to insist that the victim flee. The most common strategy is to threaten victims with deadly force if they move or immediately seek out help. In this way, robbers try to extend control over the scene even after they depart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022427810397949">Wright and Decker 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on ethnographic evidence, it is clear that robbers are cognizant of the need to manage victims and to script their crimes accordingly. Though scripts for street robbery and carjacking are likely to be similar, some logistical aspects are unique to the accomplishment of carjacking. Carjacking victims can use vehicles as weapons, barriers, or as a means of escape. In addition, culprits must separate owners from vehicles, which is a more daunting and dangerous task than separating them from wallets. Consistent with dictates for being crime specific in attempts to understand decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022427810397949">Clarke and Cornish 1985</xref>), we examine the ways that carjackers enact the crime to manage victim resistance rather than assuming a priori that carjacking follows the patterns of other types of robbery.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0022427810397949">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The current study is based on accounts of carjackers gathered in semi-structured, ethnographic interviews. Participants were serving sentences for various offenses in two medium security prisons in Louisiana. With the help of prison clerks and staff, we collected the names of individuals convicted of carjacking and solicited their participation. In addition, we asked correctional officers if they knew inmates who had stolen vehicles forcibly. Ultimately, we located and interviewed 30 individuals who admitted to carjacking. Respondents ranged in age from 21 to 40 (mean age = 25). Six participants were white and 24 were black; all but 2 were female. Overall, respondents were heavily engaged in and surrounded by the drug economy and streetlife in poor neighborhoods in midsized to large cities in Louisiana and they matched closely the profile of carjackers found using victimization surveys and police reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022427810397949">Bureau of Justice Statistics 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>We asked participants to elaborate on their motivations to commit carjacking, the perceived risks and rewards they associated with participating in carjackings, the way they managed risk and the methods they used to accomplish their tasks. In addition, we asked participants to describe their most recent carjacking, probing to elicit details about their thoughts and actions during the offense. Some offenders were asked to elaborate on additional carjackings (especially those that did not go as planned) yielding descriptions of 44 separate incidences. We transcribed audio recordings of all interviews and coded them manually. When coding transcripts, we independently identified common themes about offenders’ perceptions of victim resistance and their strategies to reduce this potential. Once we agreed upon the overarching themes, we recoded all transcripts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0022427810397949">
<title>Victim Resistance: The Carjacker’s Concern</title>
<p>The most pressing fears described by carjackers stemmed more from the actions of victims than from the formal hazards imposed by law enforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022427810397949">Jacobs 2000</xref>). Offenders acknowledged that uncooperative victims could alter the course of events, threaten valued goals, or put all involved in physical danger. In explaining the hazards of carjacking Michael said, “You never know who got a gun. Just because you got a gun, hey, that don’t mean nothing. You taking a really big chance.” Shawn explained the danger this way, “you might run up on the wrong person. … I mean, the same things you about … they might be about and they ain’t gonna hesitate to let loose [fight back].” According to the offenders, failure to achieve and maintain control of the scene could give victims an opening to escape or mount an effective defense, potentially leading to negative consequences (i.e., injury, retaliation, or arrest). To minimize this risk, carjackers claimed they had to “have the upper hand” (Brennon). They improvised upon loosely scripted strategies at each stage of the offense to keep an advantage and prevent or reduce victim resistance. In line with their accounts and consistent with script analysis, we organize victim management strategies based on the sequencing of the crime (i.e., scanning for targets, approaching victims, establishing co-orientation, and making an escape).</p>
<sec id="section5-0022427810397949">
<title>Scanning for Targets</title>
<p>To get the upper hand, robbers began with assessments about the likelihood of victims fighting back (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022427810397949">Luckenbill 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022427810397949">1981</xref>). Indeed, the potential unpredictability of the victim’s reaction and the consequences of it led most carjackers to devote some attention to selecting proper victims. Apart from a few carjacking incidents where offenders were desperate to acquire immediate transportation, offenders gave attention to characteristics of the vehicle’s occupants in the pre-crime phase and emphasized the profile of <italic>preferred</italic> victims.</p>
<p>While participants admitted to preferences about the types of people they targeted, beliefs about those easiest to control varied tremendously and were based on judgments about who was least likely to resist. Thoughts about the gender of ideal targets reflected this diversity. Several mentioned that they did not like to target females because women were likely to yell for help or act erratically under threat of force, making them difficult to control. Thomas explained why he stopped targeting women:<disp-quote>
<p>Females they, they stupid. They, they resist. You know you got a whole gun big ole .44 in their face—and they just hollering. I want your money. I don’t want you to holler. … I did like two females and they acted the same way [so] I say man don’t fuck with the females.</p>
</disp-quote>Others, like Shawn, sought out women because of assumptions about them being less willing to put up a fight to defend their property.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>If it is a female, I try to talk. … In a male’s case, you see, you can’t talk to them. You going to have to hit them in the leg or whatever. I mean, because a male is [more] difficult to deal with in a jacking than a female, he going to figure how I did it, and he going to want to scuffle. Therefore, you just might have to shoot him.</p>
</disp-quote>When asked who she and her co-offenders targeted, Kristy stated, “Older women. … I think they weren’t going to pick a man ‘cause men going to fight for what’s theirs. A younger woman, they going to give a pretty good fight. You pick an older woman and you don’t have to [worry] too much.”</p>
<p>Overall, it appears that scripts for choosing targets were designed to find those people who would offer minimal resistance. While gender was sometimes used as a proxy for this, offenders more often looked for mannerisms and demeanor that they thought reflected potential to resist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022427810397949">Davis 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022427810397949">Wright and Decker 1997</xref>). They described the ability to “see through people” in order to distinguish attractive targets from those to be avoided. According to Michael, “How you tell a character is by the person. If I run up to a nigga car [and] he got some gold in his mouth he going to do the same thing I’m going to do. He’s going to bust head.” He contrasted this persona with that of the easy marks who inspired his most recent carjacking:<disp-quote>
<p>I see the three little white boys. They was looking at me, you heard me. … [They] look like the type that go to raves. So I’m like these some ducks right there. I got me some ducks sitting right here.</p>
</disp-quote>When asked to explain what a duck was, Michael answered “some stupid ass people who know nothing. You can just go ahead and get them.” Leroy expressed similar confidence in his ability to know which victims to avoid and which to strike but appeared to base it on less superficial markers of character:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Sometimes you can judge a person. You can look at them and know that ain’t the one to mess with, ‘cause they got some dollars, they not giving up their car. [They would say], “You shoot me. I’m not giving up my car.” They got them kind of looks. You don’t mess with them type of people.</p>
</disp-quote>While all offenders endorsed the notion that compliant victims could and should be selected, some believed that the rewards of targeting those likely to fight back (i.e., those entrenched in the street scene) sometimes merited an exception (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022427810397949">Topalli and Wright 2004</xref>). As others have found of robbers, carjackers voiced numerous practical and psychological benefits for targeting dealers, robbers, and hustlers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022427810397949">Jacobs 2000</xref>). Those who targeted people involved in street life acknowledged an increased risk of resistance or retaliation and described significantly more planning than those who targeted noncriminal victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022427810397949">Jacobs, Topalli, and Wright 2000</xref>). Thomas explained, “[Drug dealers] are the ones that were plotted on. The ones that wasn’t drug dealers, those ones we would get at any given time.” Making an exception to target victims likely to resist led to careful consideration of other schematic elements, which usually precluded doing it on a whim.</p>
<p>While nearly all participants claimed that they were adept at picking targets for crime, they did not all agree on the victims who afforded the most safety. The predicted responses of the victim were informed by preconceived notions and served as key elements in the design of crime. In this way those we interviewed were much like the muggers interviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022427810397949">Lejeune (1977)</xref> when he wrote, “The range of phenomena [muggers] attempted to control was not similar in all cases, and the actions taken varied in effectiveness. But the attempt to control some aspects of the situation is evident in all accounts” (p. 133). Although offenders had arrived at differing conclusions about those who should be avoided, they had similar concerns and plans for minimizing resistance. Specifically, all saw advantage in selecting victims according to presumed stoutheartedness, predictability, and preparedness and all sought to prevent victims from preparing a defense. Cognitive scripts allowed offenders to assess victim vulnerability and these assessments were a major consideration in finalizing criminal intentions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0022427810397949">
<title>Shocking Victims</title>
<p>Once carjackers formed the intent to rob and selected suitable targets, they had to establish co-presence with victims in a way that did not allow their prey foresight into what was coming. This was done either by a blitz attack or by manipulating appearances to approach potential victims. Regardless of which approach was taken, participants wanted victims to “be so shocked and afraid, ain’t too much scuffling … as they just want to stay living.” Most interviewees preferred surprising their target with a swift, immediate attack, which is contrary to findings from previous robbery research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022427810397949">Lejeune 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022427810397949">Luckenbill 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022427810397949">Wright and Decker 1997</xref>). This discrepancy is likely due to it being difficult to approach people in vehicles without alarming them. Richard recalled, “I never said a word to [the victim]. I just walked up and grabbed him by the collar and jerked him through the window. … [He] didn’t have a clue what was going on.” Derrick detailed why he thought this strategy was effective:<disp-quote>
<p>They never think it would happen to them. Right here like at the red light? You would never think nobody rob nobody at the red light when you got cars over here, cars over there, especially in broad daylight I mean c’mon. … They [had] a gun on the passenger side of the seat in front of the seat. They couldn’t get to it.</p>
</disp-quote>Derrick’s description highlights the belief that with speed and surprise, assailants could confuse victims and decrease resistance, even if victims had weapons nearby.</p>
<p>A smaller number found rushing the driver foolish. Those preferring a manipulative approach thought that deceiving their victims into believing they were innocuous afforded better opportunities to approach victims. Using the guise of ordinary interactions, they thought they could get close enough for the crime without prematurely alerting victims. For example, Gerald described how neighborhood drug dealers required buyers to park their vehicles (to prevent rip offs). Exploiting this feature of the neighborhood, he approached a would-be buyer and said, “‘Yeah man, I got something. Put your car in park.’ … When he did that … I grabbed him and I throw him on the ground.” Here, the local imperative for a successful drug deal offered the pretense for his approach and decreased the chances that the victim would resist. Others preferred to approach inattentive victims in parking lots as they entered their cars to catch them by surprise and to demand that they surrender keys.</p>

<title>Establishing Co-orientation</title>
<p>In order to obtain the vehicle, the offender must gain compliance from the victim while controlling his or her conduct through threat or force. Doing so requires that the offender and victim have a comparable understanding of the situation (i.e., that a robbery is taking place). Carjackers had varying techniques for doing so. Some started with extreme force to immobilize victims or to confirm that any noncompliance would be met with severe force. Alternatively, some opened with verbal commands and/or threats of punishment, usually following this with gestures (such as pointing a gun) or physical force (such as grabbing the victim’s shirt) that made the intent of the interaction and its threat clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022427810397949">Wright and Decker 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Of the two strategies, opening with a forceful blow was the least often used, which is consistent with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022427810397949">Luckenbill 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022427810397949">Wright and Decker 1997</xref>). This strategy was most often used by those with no weapons because they thought not having a weapon may bolster victims’ confidence and encourage resistance. Therefore, to gain the advantage of surprise in a potential struggle, unarmed offenders initiated physical violence immediately. Thomas described a strong-arm carjacking, “I’m getting close to the car [then] I just click. And I just pow! I just punched him. … He was out.” Thomas later said that he struck so viciously because he was unarmed and his victim was thought to be capable of fighting if given an opening. Even if it did not incapacitate completely, use of violence made clear the dangers of failing to surrender the car.</p>
<p>Even though some offenders resorted to physical violence early in the interaction, almost all claimed to avoid gratuitous violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022427810397949">Hochstetler, Copes, and Williams 2010</xref>). Most claimed to strike victims only hard enough to keep them from fighting back, to shock them, or to communicate that threats were credible. Gerald described his way of carjacking by physically dominating a victim from the onset, “I can grab you, and I know that I ain’t going to really hurt you. But I can punch you a couple times, hit you in your stomach [and] knock your wind out. … That’s enough time for me to get in the car.” One way that the use of violence differed between carjackings and other robberies was that in some cases, the injury also served to facilitate forceful removal of the victim from the automobile. In carjackings involving criminally capable victims, the victims usually were removed from the vehicle by manhandling the victim and simultaneously keeping them at gunpoint. The offender sometimes delivered one or more blows as the victim exited the vehicle to reinforce the point.</p>
<p>When offenders verbally threatened victims, the threats were delivered in a way that assured that robbery was inevitable and that conveyed the “illusion of impending death” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022427810397949">Wright and Decker 1997</xref>). Michael threatened his victim and her child, “Give me this car or I’m going to kill you and your baby right now.” After blindfolding his overpowered victim, Philip told her, “I got to do this, [but] if you take the blind fold out, I’m going to really whop you.” As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022427810397949">Wright and Decker (1997</xref>:104) point out, “All of these pronouncements are intended to ‘soften up’ victims; … and to convince them that they are not in position to resist.”</p>
<p>Those who began with verbal threats typically relied on weapons to reinforce their words; nearly two-thirds of the events described in this sample included armed assailants. Most of the offenders who used guns during a carjacking thought that “ain’t nobody going to put up a fight with a gun!” Thus, they “made [the gun] the first thing they saw.” John put it best, “How you gonna fight back? You got guns at your face. That’s not a good predicament to be in and in New Orleans no such thing as stuntin’ with an unloaded gun. Nobody don’t want to be shot.” Once they wielded the weapon, armed offenders were confident that they would not be injured and that victims could be managed unless some unforeseen and unusual circumstances occurred. Those who target foreboding victims worried about “slipping up” and knew that mistakes might be fatal but also knew that their approach and cold demeanor would place odds of success steeply in their favor; victims would be at such a significant disadvantage that the only choice would be compliance. To the extent that there is a distinction in the script for targeting the streetwise victim, it is that the offender constructs the situation as an uncertain contest and places greater emphasis on planning to win by a swift, decisive effort.</p>

<sec id="section8-0022427810397949">
<title>Making Escape</title>
<p>After establishing co-presence and obtaining control of the vehicle, carjackers still had to escape without interference from their victims. For the most part, carjackers scripted their escape with the goal of removing the victim from the vehicle before commandeering it. Once offenders were in the car, the ability of the victim to resist was thought nullified. However, a few carjackers chose to abscond with the victims in tow because of the risks that an unmonitored victim posed. Those who chose this approach argued that abduction was safer for them because they could take the victim to a place where they had more control over the situation. The technique was used mainly by those who committed crime against victims who were not considered to be a physical threat, when victims did not respond quickly to commands, or when the assailant feared the victim could promptly inform the authorities. Chantey claimed that his main concern during the escape was the victim’s ability to quickly report the crime to police.<disp-quote>
<p>I couldn’t make him get out right there, you know. He’ll probably have easy access to the police because of the neighborhood that it was in. The police station ain’t no more than about two or three blocks away from it. … So I made him scoot over … and took him off by some woods … and made him get out right there.</p>
</disp-quote>Thomas, who planned to open a particular carjacking with force but did not intend to abduct the victim, found that this plan was untenable after inadvertently knocking his victim out with a single blow. Instead of leaving his victim in the road, a location that to his mind was dangerous and conspicuous, he left the scene with his victim in tow.</p>
<p>Most carjackers had no intention of staying in the presence of the victim longer than necessary, and even abductors looked for places to take the car and release captives in a way that advantaged their escape. Compared to the attention given to selecting victims and plans for shocking them, escape appeared to receive little attention. Carjackers knew that escape was contingent on control of victims, but they seemed to think that the most dangerous part was over when they entered the vehicle. Their focus on initial steps was revealed by the fact that many had imprecise plans about what to do in the immediate aftermath of successfully procuring the car.</p>

<title>Unsuccessful Carjackings: Going off Script</title>
<p>Carjacking scripts were designed primarily to manage victims. The fact that even in spontaneous crimes, offenders considered how best to enact the crime to reduce victims’ chances of resistance implies that the perceived prospects for successfully controlling victims were uncertain and worthy of attention. Offenders employed scripts for selecting targets, shocking victims, and establishing co-orientation before striking and had plans to escalate the threat for resistant victims if necessary to ensure success of the crime. They imagined that by presenting the right demeanor and constantly threatening the victim, the danger inherent in carjacking could be minimized. But danger in such pursuits is ever present, no matter how diligent one is. As Thomas contends, “Sometime when you carjack it don’t even work out the way you plan it. So you got some they’ll be headstrong or they’ll take off on you.” We now turn to a discussion of carjackings that failed, mainly due to unexpected victim resistance, to reveal the details of those offenses and how offenders refined their scripts with experiences.</p>
<p>Most offenders had convinced themselves that their crimes were designed well enough for them to be successful; however, in light of failure several admitted mischaracterizing the situation. Tony underestimated his victim’s resolve.<disp-quote>
<p>I didn’t think the woman would keep a gun or know how to shoot a gun. I think she knew how to shoot a gun, but I didn’t think she knew how to aim straight, but I just heard the bullets just graze across my head. Whoosh, whoosh. I was just ducking, praying to the Lord.</p>
</disp-quote>The potential of suffering a carjacking related injury remained fresh in David’s mind after coming “close to getting [his] head knocked off” by a victim armed with a shotgun. David and his partners attempted to rob a known drug dealer. They thought they had orchestrated the event in a way to catch him ill prepared. They did not. In both cases, and others like these, carjackers miscast easy targets. In a show of his capacity to learn, David claimed that this injury caused him to adjust strategies by choosing more passive victims and using greater stealth on the approach.</p>
<p>Even if carjackers do find ideal people and locations to commit their crimes, they still must approach victims without raising suspicion. Revealing their threatening intentions sometimes can lead to victim resistance or escape. In describing a failed carjacking, Shawn stated that he was riding his bicycle looking for someone to rob and noticed a female stopped at a red light. As he approached, she tried to lock the door, but he was able to open it before she could do so. As he was getting in the vehicle his victim was able to get a knife. In his words, “Before I know it she done upped the blade, man. And when she went and did this, she done hit. Boom! It stuck [in my leg.] I’m talking about to the bone. I felt it hit my bone.” Shawn believed that his flaw lay in his conspicuous approach. He acknowledged that by riding slowly toward the victim he signaled alarm, allowing her to fortify the vehicle and ready her weapon. This lesson supported not only his beliefs that a rapid and fully committed approach was critical in carjacking but that victims should be selected wisely.</p>
<p>Sometimes their mistake was not controlling victims’ behaviors during the robbery. David, who described his carjacking-related injury previously, thought that he and his partners had a well-laid plan to attack a specific person. After boxing in the victim with their vehicle, David ran to the side of the victim’s car pointing a gun at him. “When I pulled the gun on him … he was sitting in the car and he looked at me and just shook his head. When he put his hands down I thought he was just relaxing ‘cause he know what was happening. I figured we had him out numbered, and it would be easy. Never expected to get hit with a gun.” This inattentiveness led to much greater diligence in future crimes. In his description of another carjacking, he described how he paid close attention to the victim’s hands to not “give him the chance to try to grab the gun or something. I learned my mistake.”</p>
<p>Despite recognition of risks, offenders seemed genuinely surprised when victims resisted forcefully and it turned out badly. This surprise was likely due to their assumption that they had crafted schemes for avoiding and overcoming resistance. While some may give up on crime in the face of failure, offenders deeply entrenched in criminal lifestyles may be more apt to learn from their mistakes and to adapt accordingly. Many described reworking their scripts and paying greater attention to technique. Despite these efforts to improve among those who commit repeated violent crime, risk is expected and offenders seem willing to accept uncertainty and rely on general criminal resourcefulness to muddle through when things do not go as planned. Failed crimes appeared to have led to increased confidence as attention and diligence devoted to approach technique, victim selection, and mental resolve to intimidate were enhanced by experience. In short, these failures led to the refinement of scripts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0022427810397949">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Recognition that seemingly spontaneous criminal decisions reflect strategic preferences leads to the reasonable assumption that much crime is scripted. This implies that offenders apply experientially learned cognitive templates or mental representations that allow them to size up scenes for specific acts and to imagine and shape crimes strategically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022427810397949">Brantingham and Brantingham 1993</xref>). What seems haphazard and thoughtless to an outsider may in fact be the result of applied experience, strategy, and expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022427810397949">Topalli 2005</xref>). By developing and using a sequenced script for how to select victims and coerce them into compliance with minimal resistance, robbers can seize upon opportunities without great forethought and/or planning. Scripts that facilitate quick decision-making are especially important for carjacking because “a car is there and gone in a matter of seconds, and there often is little or no time for hesitation … carjackers have to be primed to see what they want and strike immediately” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022427810397949">Jacobs, Topalli, and Wright 2003</xref>:678).</p>
<p>Understanding scripts for robberies is important because the serendipitous and reckless appearance of these crimes may disguise or oversimplify the thought process and sequencing that goes into committing them. Additionally, it is important to be crime specific when discussing decision-making and scripts if for no other reason than primary concerns vary greatly among offenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022427810397949">Cornish 1994</xref>). For instance, crimes that entail immediate and extreme potential of physical harm (like robbery and carjackings) typically lead offenders to devote mental resources to minimizing risks, whereas offenders committing less physically threatening crimes (like burglary or shoplifting) tend to devote more resources to bolstering final payoffs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022427810397949">Tremblay, Talon, and Hurley 2001</xref>). This contention was supported by our findings as participants placed a much greater emphasis on managing the informal risks of their actions than any other aspects of it. Carjackers did not set out to search for the optimal target or commit carjackings exclusively in the most desirable environments; instead, pre-existing scripts primed them for recognizing suitable situations to strike. Their decisions were fundamentally logical in the sense that they had confidence in their intuitive ability to recognize potential victims, detect and manage criminal risk, and to improvise if necessary.</p>
<p>Differences in the modal thinking of carjackers and that of other robbers are subtle and largely result from the introduction of a vehicle to the robbery event. Like muggers, carjackers selected targets to minimize threats from victims, approached in ways to reduce victims’ awareness, and announced the crime to ensure all had comparable definitions of the situation. Unlike other robbers, however, carjackers relied much more on speed and stealth to approach victims than on maintaining normal appearances; it is difficult, after all, to approach strangers in cars for conversation without appearing suspicious. While actual and threatened violence is often used in robbery to send a message and thwart resistance, carjackers routinely used direct contact to remove the victim from the vehicle. The most common strategy for leaving the scene of a mugging is to make the victims stay in the same location as the robbers make their escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022427810397949">Wright and Decker 1997</xref>). It is rare for muggers to take their victims with them. While still uncommon, it appears that carjackers are more likely to abduct victims than are other robbers. These distinct scripts and outcomes lend credence to using a narrow scope when modeling the criminal decision-making process because the circumstances surrounding the enactment of crimes and offenders’ intentions vary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022427810397949">Clarke and Cornish 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>Scripts for crime reflect notions of how it should be accomplished that are grounded in experience and that are often idiosyncratic. This is not to say that there are not observable and identifiable patterns in how crime is conducted. For example, our findings suggest that scripts for carjacking seem to vary by motivation and location. Carjackings that occurred on drug corners or similar settings typically involved multiple offenders and were committed by those who either had planned the crimes in advance or who were consistently looking for lucrative targets. In addition, offenders in these types of carjackings were motivated by the material value of vehicles and contents rather than a mode of transportation. They typically approached victims under the guise of a drug dealer, carried out the offense by forceful separation of victim from vehicle (sometimes at gunpoint), and were likely to target streetwise victims. Carjackers who committed their crimes elsewhere (e.g., malls, convenience stores, and suburbs) typically took cars while victims were entering, were more likely to be spontaneously motivated by victims deemed suitable, and claimed to be under a psychological strain or otherwise acting out of character. In addition, they were more likely to offer lengthier verbal commands and exchanges and take victims with them when leaving the scene.</p>
<p>Conventionally, script analysis focuses on identifying critical decision points for developing situational crime prevention programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022427810397949">Cornish 1994</xref>). Here, we have focused on scripts as sense-making devices in keeping with their theoretical origins in cognitive science. We do not mean to imply that there is a single script for carjacking. Instead, we portray scripts as devices that provide only the most general guide for seeing opportunity and how crime should proceed. In fact, some of the crimes described to us violated the most fundamental rules of thumb held by the offender, such as the importance of avoiding streetwise victims. Offenders who committed these crimes, however, typically recognized that they were venturing into danger and compensated by being more diligent in the attention given to ensuring the victims were under control. This suggests that criminal scripts may be loosely formulated reference points that connote potential hazards and points of vulnerability rather than consistently implemented guides for selecting and committing discrete crimes.</p>
<p>Despite the likelihood of being seriously injured in the interaction, carjackers are confident that their skills and experience afford them the ability to exhibit mastery over these risks and their victims. In this way, they are similar to other risk takers who maintain confidence in their abilities to overcome substantial danger in the pursuit of rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022427810397949">Lyng 1990</xref>). Their scripts for carjacking allowed them to deemphasize the dangers of their actions and accentuate experientially learned skills for successfully navigating the crime. Specifically, they are confident in their ability to select safe targets and to enact the crime in a way that minimizes the chances of victims interfering with their efforts. They believe that in most cases, they can detect and snuff out developing threats. Interestingly, even being injured does little to shake their confidence. In some cases, such criminal catastrophes were used to reveal points of vulnerability in their strategies and served as lessons for incorporation into future scripts.</p>
<p>Our analysis of how offenders think about and manage the most daunting element of carjacking supports the notion that scripts play a role not only in how carjackers structure crime and recognize criminal opportunity but also in their decisions to continue offending. It does this in two ways. First, the more offenders are successful in their endeavors, the more their confidence in the validity of their scripts and abilities is bolstered. We found that offenders’ scripts afforded confidence that they could approach and manage victims, thereby making criminal opportunities enticing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022427810397949">Cusson 1993</xref>). Second, the development and updating of scripts allows offenders to assess and seize criminal opportunities as if they are serendipitous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022427810397949">Jacobs 2010</xref>). The offender may quickly play out an imagined sequence of events by matching the most apparent elements of the situation to a scripted ideal in the instant before moving ahead. Such sense making is often done by a desperate satisfier and entails uncertainty, imprecision, and no small measure of mental instability. Nevertheless, experience provides the ability to act strategically. Pointing to the strategy and confidence in ability to react to sequential contingencies refines the meaning of the common assertion by criminologists that street crimes seldom are planned.</p>
<p>Thinking of crime as scripted behavior provides a useful theoretical bridge spanning offenders’ constructions of opportunity, recognition of it, and discrete criminal actions. Yet, the script should not be construed or portrayed as a decision tree where offenders think ahead several steps about how they will react as situations develop. Indeed, offenders often consider only the most immediate and rudimentary threats that might emerge and seem content to proceed if these have been managed. Even the most foreboding contingencies can be managed through the somewhat fanciful belief that unexpected obstacles can be thwarted by toughness and general criminal know-how. Carjacking is a simple, brutal, and sometimes desperate crime. The decisions that lead to it perhaps are better cast as brute reactions to a snapshot understanding of opportunity than as plans containing many foreseeable contingencies. Analysis of carjackers’ scripted behavior reminds that crimes have much in common with a wide array of semi-improvisational risky decisions in naturalistic settings.</p>
