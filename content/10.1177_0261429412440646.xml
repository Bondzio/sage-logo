<p>The transition from school to university presents novel demands for all students. Although this educational milestone has been addressed by scholars, particularly those interested in the study of higher education, there is a dearth of literature regarding gifted students’ experience of their handling demands of first-year university. In the absence of research on the topic, the article explores two themes that emerged from counselling experience with gifted students who were unsuccessful in making the transition, namely lack of knowledge of the reality of first-year university and factors unique to giftedness.</p>

<p>Students who are gifted confront transitions that all students encounter in their education. Transitions from home to school and from one set of grades to another, such as elementary to junior high school in North America, are common to all students who reside in countries with systems of compulsory public education. Students who continue to university face an additional transition, from school to university. The school–university gap is qualitatively different from students’ previous school transitions. University life places novel, if not unique, demands on students during their first year. Successful transition from school to university is essential for academic success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0261429412440646">Nel et al., 2009</xref>). Unsuccessful transitions have a negative effect on students’ academic achievement, leading to significant achievement loss with accompanying levels of psychological distress. Because of its impact on students and its impact on student retention, scholars in higher education have brought attention to the experience of first-year students. Literature in the area has discussed the issue for students in general (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261429412440646">Donnison and Edwards, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0261429412440646">Harding, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0261429412440646">Kwon, 2009</xref>) and for a variety of students with disabilities (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261429412440646">Garrison-Wade and Lehmann, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0261429412440646">Neubert and Redd, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0261429412440646">Wilson et al., 2009</xref>). However, there is a dearth of literature in the domain of higher education dealing specifically with gifted students.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, this state of affairs is also evident in the literature on gifted education: a search found no citations on this topic. Only two studies were found that dealt tangentially with the transition to university. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0261429412440646">Smith (2006</xref>) investigated the predictive effect of achievement loss in the transition from middle school to high school. He found that those high-ability students who experienced achievement loss in that transition were more likely to leave the first college they attended. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0261429412440646">Peterson and Duncan (2009</xref>), in a mixed-methods longitudinal study, reported that participants identified that educational transitions were more influential in their development than life events such as a change in family constellation. With the current state of the literature, we do not know how gifted students cope with this major educational milestone. We can surmise that many gifted students are successful in making a smooth transition and adjust readily to the novel demands of university. We do not know the proportion of gifted students who find the transition relatively easy, challenging but successful, or difficult to the point of withdrawal or failure.</p>
<p>In the absence of research in these areas, a potentially useful source of information is counselling experience. The purpose of this article is to present insights gleaned from my counselling experience with gifted students who were having severe difficulties adjusting to first year of university manifested in significant academic underachievement. It is my hope that sharing my thoughts will be of assistance to other professionals who encounter such clients and to school counsellors who may be in a position to prepare gifted students who are university bound. At the very least, I hope to draw attention to this important topic.</p>
<p>I have organized the article using two themes that I extracted from the descriptions of the gifted students who were in crisis because of unsuccessful school to university transition manifested by significant academic underachievement. The first theme was an ignorance of the actual demands of university. These clients revealed that they had received information that university would be different, but they were unprepared for the reality of university. The second theme was giftedness itself. Paradoxically, factors unique to giftedness contributed to academic underachievement. As it turns out, both themes find support in the literature.</p>

<title>Demands of first-year university and academic underachievement</title>
<p>The transition from high school to university is unique when compared with other educational transitions experienced by students. Movement from junior high school or middle school to high school, for example, places some new demands on students, but they can count on some continuities. Students continue to experience a great deal of externally imposed structure of their daily schedule, and teachers and parents continue to monitor students’ progress and school attendance. Transition from high school to first-year university, on the other hand, is of much greater proportion. It may be described not as a transition at all but as an abrupt change from one state of being a student to a distinctly different one, with nothing in between – a quantum leap. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0261429412440646">Prancer et al. (2004</xref>) describe the transition as follows:<disp-quote>
<p>This transition is one of major proportions and represents a fundamental change in almost every aspect of a student’s life. Students move from small classes of 30 or so individuals, where academic progress was closely monitored by teachers, to lecture courses with perhaps hundreds of students, where no one has time to note how individual students are doing. The academic work at university is more challenging, and students must learn to master the material with less support than was available to them in high school. (p. 184)</p>
</disp-quote>Students who attend university away from home have additional challenges including dealing with the loss of an established network of social support; freedom to miss classes, indulge in alcohol and sexual behavior without vestiges of parental supervision; handling new responsibilities for day-to-day tasks such as laundry; and coping with loneliness and homesickness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0261429412440646">Prancer et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>It is reasonable to assume that the significant differences between high school and university have the potential to adversely affect academic achievement, with ensuing negative psychological consequences on students. High school personnel such as guidance counsellors should create opportunities in schools to discuss the novel demands that students will encounter in university. One possibility is to disseminate information through guidance groups, which allow for both dissemination of information and opportunity for discussion. These groups should not be limited to information regarding application process, scholarships or even study skills. Guidance activities should approximate the actual demands of the leap to university life. Providing information such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0261429412440646">Prancer et al.’s (2004)</xref> description and opportunities for discussion should be integral parts of guidance counsellors’ attempts to help prepare students for the transition. While providing opportunities for high school students to discuss matters such as first-year university class sizes and laundry may not sound profound, they are the realities that students will confront.</p>
<p>Discussion of the unique demands of daily life at university is a first step to having students begin thinking about the transition to university. One approach is to help them see possible negative effects of the demands on achievement. Discussions may include, for example, how the new-found freedom and lack of teacher monitoring of attendance may result in procrastination regarding assignments. Another topic relates to emotions such as loneliness and homesickness and how such emotions may interfere with motivation. In my view, it is important to communicate to students that the way in which they manage the challenges posed by the new demands will probably affect their academic achievement. Students’ awareness of demands, as outlined in the literature dealing with the transition to university, may contribute to a successful transition for all students, including gifted students.</p>

<title>Giftedness and academic underachievement</title>
<p>Though counterintuitive, giftedness has been associated with academic underachievement. A well-known source, <italic>A Nation at Risk</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261429412440646">Commission on Excellence in Education, 1983</xref>) notes that up to 50% of gifted students are academic underachievers; a less-known source, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0261429412440646">Blackburn and Erickson (1986</xref>), suggests that academic underachievement is a predictable crisis confronting gifted students at some point in their educational experience. The affective cognitive model of giftedness, derived from counselling experience with gifted individuals of all ages, proposes an explanation for that contention. In this model, intelligence and achievement are distinct concepts. Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0261429412440646">Gagné’s (2003)</xref> model, factors other than cognitive ability are required to actualize the potential inherent in giftedness. For Gagné, gifts are raw abilities that need opportunities and environmental support for actualization into talents. In the affective cognitive model, achievement can be expressed in the following semantic equation:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-0261429412440646">
<mml:math id="mml-disp1-0261429412440646">
<mml:mrow>
<mml:mtext>Intelligence + Effort = Achievement</mml:mtext>
</mml:mrow>
</mml:math>
<graphic alternate-form-of="disp-formula1-0261429412440646" xlink:href="10.1177_0261429412440646-eq1.tif"/>
</disp-formula>This is in contrast with the perspective implicit in some parents’ and teachers’ comments and explicit in some definitions of intelligence (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0261429412440646">Gardner, 1993</xref>), which can be expressed in the following equation:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-0261429412440646">
<mml:math id="mml-disp2-0261429412440646">
<mml:mrow>
<mml:mtext>Intelligence = Achievement</mml:mtext>
</mml:mrow>
</mml:math>

</disp-formula>In the affective cognitive model, level of intelligence, in and of itself, does not cause a corresponding level of achievement. Average intelligence does not automatically correspond to average achievement. In fact, students with average intelligence may obtain high achievement when they persistently exert effort in their studies. It is important to note that in the affective cognitive model, exerting effort to achieve academically is learned through the socialization process directed by parents and teachers. Children learn that it is important to do well in school when their parents communicate their valuing of academic achievement.</p>
<p>The affective cognitive model proposes three innate motivational characteristics of giftedness: heightened sensitivity, analytical attitude and self-criticism. These are cognitive characteristics – cognitive processes – that influence day-to-day experiences of gifted individuals. Giftedness and its characteristics are assumed to be present throughout the life span. Giftedness in its raw form is presumed to be undisciplined and normally requires effective parenting practices to become disciplined and be under the control of gifted individuals. In their raw form, characteristics may create problems for gifted individuals. Of particular interest for the purpose of this article is unbridled analytical attitude, which is the focus of my discussion regarding giftedness and academic underachievement (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0261429412440646">Mendaglio, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0261429412440646">2010</xref> for a discussion of the other characteristics).</p>
<p>Analytical attitude refers to a mode of thinking by which gifted individuals spontaneously and persistently question, evaluate and judge elements of the physical and social environment. In essence, gifted individuals, because of their giftedness, not through choice, critically evaluate virtually everything and everyone they encounter. Analytical attitude, like giftedness in general, is double-edged. It may have positive and negative outcomes. For example, this trait is very useful in problem-solving tasks. However, it also predisposes gifted individuals to conflict with society. Society demands compliance and conformity from individuals. Agents of society, such as parents and teachers, typically expect compliance from their children and students. Parents issue a request (e.g. time for bed or homework; clean the dishes) and they expect compliance. Teachers also issue requests (e.g. raise your hand before speaking; work in groups) and expect compliance from their students. Such expectations run counter to the naturally occurring analytical attitude in gifted students – their tendency is to judge and question.</p>
<p>Academic achievement may be negatively affected because it rests on conformity not questioning or challenging authority. When teachers assign work that contributes to students’ grades, it is understood that grades will be associated with the extent to which student work matches teacher expectations. A naturally occurring analytical approach motivates gifted students to question the worth of assignments and effectiveness of teachers. When the analytical attitude is unbridled, in its raw form, assignments are not completed when they are judged to be inappropriate or silly – regardless of their actual worth. When judged to be worthwhile assignments are completed and submitted. Teachers are similarly treated. Gifted students may perform very well in some courses because they judge their teachers as worthy of respect; students may perform dismally in other courses when they judge their teachers unfavourably. In their attempts to explain causes of their poor achievement, gifted students seen in counselling pose rhetorical questions such as ‘Why would I waste my time doing busy work?’ and ‘Why would I work for a teacher that I do not respect?’. Such questions, products of their analyses, interfere with their application of effort. In this way, giftedness itself, paradoxically, contributes to academic underachievement.</p>
<p>The analytical attitude, when it persists in its raw form during secondary school, may result in prolonging of secondary school or dropping out of school. Some gifted students may actually fail secondary school courses, making it impossible to apply to university, with their cohorts. Others may drop out of school. Failing grades or dropping out places them out of sync with their original classmates who have continued to university. Gifted students may take more time to complete secondary school, postponing a transition to university. Some gifted students are motivated to control their analytical approach to school when they experience the boredom of menial tasks. Those students who do ultimately gain entrance to university may have the additional challenge of transcending their history of academic underachievement. From the perspective of the affective cognitive model, parents and teachers need to assist gifted students’ effective management of their analytical attitude. As the model assumes that the trait is lifelong, a disciplined analytical attitude will help gifted students engage in judicious conformity that will facilitate, rather than hinder, their achievement.</p>
<sec id="section4-0261429412440646">
<title>Predictable crisis: hitting the wall</title>
<p>Based on the affective cognitive model, hitting the wall (HTW; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0261429412440646">Mendaglio, 2010</xref>) is an attempt to explain the view that academic underachievement is a predictable crisis facing many, if not all, gifted students. As I indicated earlier in my discussion of the model, achievement is the product of both intelligence and effort. When effort increases as difficulty of subject matter increases, academic achievement is likely to be facilitated; when effort does not increase with subject matter difficulty, academic achievement is likely to be hindered. HTW is the product of the first encounter by students of subject matter that requires more effort than they are accustomed to applying. Achievement loss is not the only effect; HTW strikes at the core of self-perception, thereby precipitating a psychological crisis.</p>
<p>HTW has its origins in the interaction among ease of learning, lack of challenge in early school years and early feedback children receive regarding giftedness. Ease of learning stems from the cognitive characteristics commonly associated with giftedness. While there are various conceptions of giftedness, there appears to be consensus on some cognitive characteristics of giftedness including advanced comprehension; unusual interests and curiosity; a high level of language development; a high level of verbal ability; an unusual capacity for processing information; and accelerated pace of thought processes (e.g. Clark, 2008). As a result of giftedness, young children begin school with a great deal of acquired knowledge. Their high cognitive abilities enable them to grasp curricular content readily. Ease of learning when coupled with early school experiences that lack challenge has an effect on the application of effort to school learning. Gifted students, especially those in regular education classes, exert minimal effort but receive very positive academic results – school learning appears effortless. Simultaneously, young gifted students receive praise for their intellectual prowess. Some parents are awestruck by their children’s expression of their cognitive characteristics; some marvel at what comes out of their children’s mouths, others simply quietly acknowledge and praise children’s linguistic and reasoning precocity. Such responses to young gifted children are echoed by many of their teachers. The combination of ease of learning, lack of challenge and positive feedback from important adults repeated over time (months or years) affect gifted children’s academic self-concept, expressed in the following statement: ‘I am very smart and that means that I learn effortlessly.’ The self-perception is reinforced by early school experiences in which subject matter is no match for the intelligence of the gifted child.</p>
<p>When gifted children’s academic self-concept includes the perception that giftedness means obtaining high marks effortlessly or with minimal effort, they are destined to experience the psychological crisis that I label HTW. Gifted students with that perception become fixated on their initial level of effort when dealing with their school work. Meanwhile subject matter difficulty increases with grade level until the complexity of academic work is such that it requires an increase in effort. A first sign of the crisis is a gradual decline in grades, which is bothersome but not the essence of the crisis. The situation reaches a crisis proportion when gifted students begin to realize that they need to exert more effort to achieve the high marks to which they became accustomed. Such awareness conflicts with their now long-held perception that giftedness means ease of learning. As achievement loss persists, they begin to question their giftedness: ‘I can’t be gifted if I have to put effort into my work.’ Some have labelled this as the imposter syndrome; HTW proposes that gifted students’ belief that they are imposters – that they have managed to fool people into thinking they are smart – has its origins in gifted students’ early experiences with themselves and their school, parents and teachers.</p>
<p>Based on counselling experience, the timing of the crisis varies. Some gifted students experience it in later elementary school; however, HTW is most frequent in high school and university, where the nature and demands of subject matter differ significantly from elementary years. Furthermore, certain courses are more likely than others to spark HTW; with some exceptions, it is commonly experienced in courses such as mathematics and science and other courses that contain highly specialized knowledge, for example computer science, finance or law. For this type of course, gifted students are unable to simply draw on general knowledge to obtain a good grade. In effect, such courses require consistent application of significant effort to obtain grades that approximate gifted students’ expectations.</p>
<p>HTW in first-year university is described by some clients as sheer disbelief when receiving their first grade in a university course. Accustomed to achieving high grades in secondary school, some clients described checking with their professors to verify the grade: ‘I was used to getting 90% in high school, I couldn’t believe that I got a mark in the 50s!’ HTW can be a test of motivation: how motivated is the student to complete the programme – how badly does the student want to be an engineer, medical doctor or lawyer? Those who are motivated use the crisis to learn to exert more effort in their studies by seeking advice from professors, counsellors and other resources. HTW may then produce a successful transition to university; alternatively, the result may be withdrawal from university.</p>

<title>Big-fish–little-pond effect</title>
<p>The big-fish–little-pond effect (BFLPE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0261429412440646">Marsh, 1984</xref>) attempts to explain research findings indicating that academic self-concept is negatively affected when students of high ability are grouped in homogeneous high-ability classes, rather than mixed-ability classes. Essentially the effect explains research results that gifted students’ academic self-concept will decline when they move from a regular classroom to a gifted education classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0261429412440646">Marsh et al., 1995</xref>). The rationale for the decline in academic self-concept, and therefore for BFLPE, is found in social comparison theory proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261429412440646">Festinger (1954</xref>). Festinger stated that individuals use social comparison to provide information for self-evaluation in areas that cannot be assessed using objective methods. In contrast to aspects of self, such as height and weight, attributes such as abilities and attitudes are not readily assessed using objective measures. The theory stipulates that individuals have a need to know their standing in these areas. Further, accuracy of self-evaluative information gleaned through social comparison increases with the degree of similarity between individuals and reference group used. According to Festinger, accurate self-evaluation is achieved when we compare ourselves to individuals with whom we share similar attributes. Comparing ourselves to others who are dissimilar results in different outcomes for self-concept. When gifted students are in a regular classroom, their reference group consists of fellow students of mixed abilities – the gifted student may be among a small minority of gifted students, or the only gifted student in that class. Comparison with dissimilar others, a downward comparison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0261429412440646">Wills, 1981</xref>) produces a high academic self-concept. When gifted students move to classes with students who are also of high ability, similar to others, a decline of academic self-concept occurs. As a young gifted student remarked, ‘In my old school [regular school] I was smart, in my new school [gifted education] I am average.’</p>
<p>BFLPE is supported by a body of research conducted by Marsh and his associates with both high-ability and identified gifted students (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261429412440646">Marsh and Hau, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0261429412440646">Marsh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0261429412440646">Marsh et al., 2007</xref>). Other researchers’ findings using samples of gifted students also lend support for the effect (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0261429412440646">Preckel et al., 2008</xref>). One indication of the level of support for the BFLPE is found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261429412440646">Marsh and Hau’s (2003)</xref> study, which used a sample drawn from the Program of Student Assessment database compiled by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. The database contained a variety of information on 15-year-old students, including their performance on standardized achievement tests and a questionnaire that included academic self-concept items drawn from the Self-Description Questionnaire II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0261429412440646">Marsh, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0261429412440646">1993</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261429412440646">Marsh and Hau (2003</xref>) reported that students in schools that had high school achievement averages tended to score lower on academic self-concept than students in schools with lower school averages. Support for the BFLPE is also found in research conducted by other investigators using samples of gifted students. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0261429412440646">Zeidner and Schleyer (1999</xref>) investigated academic self-concept, test anxiety and school grades in 1020 Israeli gifted students in grades four to six attending homogeneous and mixed-ability classes. Gifted students in mixed-ability classes had markedly higher academic self-concepts, lower evaluative anxiety and higher school grades than their counterparts in special classes for the gifted.</p>
<p>Universities, with their competitive admission requirements, are the biggest educational ponds. It is reasonable to assume that school to university transition will spark social comparison processes that will have a negative effect on gifted students’ academic self-concepts. In my view, BFLPE will be strongest for gifted students who were in regular education classes for their entire public school experience. In contrast, the BFLPE should be weaker for gifted students progressing to university from school experiences that included gifted education programmes, international baccalaureate or advanced placement courses. Strong or weak, I suggest that BFLPE is a factor associated with giftedness that creates unique demands on gifted students in their first year of university. They face the demand of coping with a decline in their academic self-concept. Given the established relationship between academic achievement and self-concept, coping with the BFLPE is not a trivial matter as it may lead to the psychological distress and discouragement observed in counselling of gifted students struggling in their first year of university.</p>

<sec id="section6-0261429412440646">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>All students who proceed to university are confronted with demands that are of such magnitude that they may be conceptualized as a quantum leap rather than a transition. Academic achievement is affected by the degree to which students are successful in managing demands such as newly found freedom. Achievement loss results when students are unsuccessful in meeting the novel demands of first-year university. Gifted students, ironically, confront a different set of psychological demands due to giftedness itself. Giftedness may predispose gifted students to academic underachievement. HTW, rooted in the habit of exerting minimal effort, may cause confusion and anxiety. BFLPE, anchored to self-concept, may cause discouragement and depression. Given the competitive nature of gaining entrance to university, it is probable that the majority of university students are gifted, whether identified. If that is the case, the analysis provided in this article is applicable to many, if not all, first-year university students. School personnel concerned with preparing students for their transition to university should consider adding the factors unique to giftedness. Students of ability high enough to consider applying to university, identified as gifted or not, will probably encounter the factors observed in gifted students who have made unsuccessful transitions. Sharing information with prospective university students that comes from research and counselling experience will, in all likelihood, contribute to successful transitions.</p>
