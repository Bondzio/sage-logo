<p>The preference of peripheral neuropathy does not preclude the diabetes educator from including recommendations for being active within DSME and should be individualized to each patient’s preferences, tolerances, and safety needs.</p>
<p>When people with diabetes tell me what their peripheral neuropathic pain feels like, they often describe burning, tingling, pins and needles, numbness, or simply that they have trouble getting out of a chair, standing, or walking. Some say it is unbearable. Many people say this is one of the most difficult problems for them to accept and adapt their lifestyle to accommodate. However, we all know the many values of being active in managing diabetes and related conditions, from blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol control all the way to good mental health. Being active can help maintain muscle strength and flexibility as well as help keep the person with diabetes and neuropathy functionally fit, which helps them maintain their independence. Thus, finding ways our patients can be active while dealing with peripheral neuropathy is a challenge for diabetes educators to take on.</p>
<p>Educators must consider safety when suggesting physical activity for the person with neuropathy. Because of the change in sensation, the person may experience injury without recognizing it, such as blisters on their feet. They may experience changes in sensations connected to balance and strength that cause them to inadvertently injure themselves or experience falls. For sedentary and older individuals with diabetes, a medical evaluation may be appropriate before starting an activity program that exceeds the demands of their usual daily routine.</p>
<p>Your patients may not understand when you suggest they start to “be active” each day, so it may be helpful to break down the terms to be more understandable. In a recent class for older adults, I asked attendees what they did each day to be active. Among the expected answers like dancing and yoga, one person said she volunteers at the local hospital, answering the phone. To her, getting out of her house was “being active” although the volunteer activity was completely sedentary.</p>
<p><italic>Physical fitness</italic> is another term with several meanings. In <italic>The Art and Science of Diabetes Self-Management Education</italic> text, author Colberg refers to physical fitness as “a set of attributes that people have or achieve related to their ability to perform physical activity.” Of the 3 types of physical fitness, physiological, health related, and skill related, the “health-related fitness program” is a primary component of diabetes self-management because of these direct connections to good health:

<p>Translate those terms into something that resonates with your patient, such as for the older person, “Being active each day can help you maintain the strength you need to carry your groceries from your car to your kitchen table.”</p>

<title>Activity and Neuropathy</title>
<p>The presence of peripheral neuropathy may affect the types of activities your patients do but should not prevent them from being active altogether unless medically indicated. Recognize that for the person with peripheral neuropathy, nonweightbearing activities may be most acceptable to them, although weightbearing may also be encouraged. Your patients may welcome the fact that simply having peripheral neuropathy does not preclude them from walking, especially if this is the type of activity they prefer.</p>

<title>You Can Provide Guidance on Stretch, Strength, and Balance</title>
<sec id="section3-2325160313482723">
<title>Stretch</title>
<p>Stretching can help with flexibility, which makes other activities and movements easier. Yoga and tai chi are examples of formal stretching programs. However, simply demonstrating stretching actions can help your patients get started. Ask your member to reach their arms out from their sides at shoulder height. From there, have them raise their arms so their hands meet. Have them slowly lower their arms back to their sides. Then have them reach their hands straight out in front of themselves, then drop their arms to their sides and reach backwards. Any variation of these steps is fine; just show them how easy it is to stretch and how good it can feel.</p>

<sec id="section4-2325160313482723">
<title>Strength</title>
<p>Maintaining muscle strength is a key to being able to function with life’s daily tasks, like being able to carry a basket of laundry or climb the steps. The only way to keep muscles is to use them. Encourage your patients to incorporate strengthening activities into their daily routine. Challenge them to keep light weights or cans of food wherever they may be sitting to watch TV or read a book. Have them lift their weights at planned intervals, such as during commercials or every 15 minutes. Exercise stretch bands can also help them with strengthening the parts of their body they are trying to strengthen.</p>

<sec id="section5-2325160313482723">
<title>Balance</title>
<p>Balance training is a great safety mechanism to prevent falls. If your patient has neuropathy, they may have a limited sense of balance. Ask your patient to try this: Stand behind a sturdy piece of furniture and hold on for stability. Then, have him or her shift their weight from one foot to the other every few seconds. Exercises done while seated can also be used for strength and stretching for your patients with limited mobility or those who cannot stand.</p>

<title>General Precautions</title>
<p>Remind your patients that when they start to be more active than they have been, they will need to keep close track of their blood glucose levels and be prepared to recognize and treat episodes of hypoglycemia. For patients who are concerned with getting started, suggest a certified personal trainer who works with people with diabetes to help them take their first steps. As being active becomes part of their regular daily routine, they may need to have their medications adjusted. Help them make the link between improvements in blood glucose and their being active plan. Encourage good foot care, including proper hygiene and daily inspection and wearing well-fitting shoes and socks. Check in with your patients on how well they are tolerating being active and be ready to offer alternatives for the initially planned activities if necessary. Let your patients know that keeping their blood glucose controlled is one of the best things they can do for themselves and that there are treatments that their doctor or a specialist may recommend that can help manage their condition.</p>
