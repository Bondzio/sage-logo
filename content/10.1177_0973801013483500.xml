<p>The informal sector, often characterised by low capital intensity and a small number of non-unionised family labourers, is traditionally seen as a transitional phase in a society’s movement from an agrarian stage to an industrial stage. This view, like many other ideas of development economics, came about by juxtaposing the development experience of the West and the process of development in the developing world. When development economics started its journey in the 1950s, the only historically successful model of development available was the experience of the West Europe which saw the movement of low-income agrarian societies to high-income industrial ones through capital accumulation. Arthur Lewis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0973801013483500">1954</xref>), in his seminal essay, resonates the same spirit in the theory of growth in a less developed country (LDC) which is characterised by capital accumulation and rural–urban migration in search of jobs in the urban organised sector. But Todaro and Harris rightly noted that migration is not a seamless process—there is a lag between people leaving their rural homes and getting absorbed in the urban factories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0973801013483500">Todaro and Harris, 1970</xref>). In this transition period, they often find work in family-based small units which are termed informal as they lack the size, capital, equipments and institutional frameworks their formal counterpart typically operate with. The term informal, like the word disequilibrium, reveals a lack—an absence—of formality. In the discipline of economics, informal sector is treated the way disequilibrium is treated in Walrasian general equilibrium structure: it will vanish in the long run and therefore does not require any systematic treatment. It is only with accumulated experience that people started to realise the persistent nature of informal sector in the LDCs in providing jobs for the majority of its population. Hence, it is important to have a theory of informal sector which can analyse the persistence and evolution of informal sector. <italic>The Outsiders</italic> by Marjit and Kar fills this gap. This is a work of immense importance.</p>
<p>The book consists of two major sections: theoretical and empirical. The theoretical section understandably dominates the book because of lack of data, as has been mentioned by the authors. The data on informal sector are a serious issue. But with three rounds of National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO) data around, the situation is not as bleak as it used to be. The bulk of the empirical analysis in this book is based on the NSSO data which are supplemented by primary data and case studies. Among the theoretical chapters, the first chapter deals with the political economy of the informal sector, thereby providing a whole new viewpoint as to why informal sector exists. The other chapters mostly look at the relationship between the formal and informal sector and how the relationship gets affected by trade. Even if the latter section has some neatly done chapters, the chapter on the political economy of the informal sector is the most exciting one. This one deviates from the standard view that sees informal sector as an aberration in the logic of economic development. The chapter sees the tolerance of the government towards informal sector as a rational redistributive policy rather than its inability to eradicate the informal sector.</p>
<p>How a society views informal sector is crucial in understanding the government’s strategy of accommodating informal sector. The social perception about informal sector views it as a gray zone between legal and illegal activities. The firms termed as informal often violate tax laws, labour laws and also property rights by encroaching on government land. Nevertheless, in LDCs, informal activities are accommodated in the framework of collective morality. Even if these activities are often of extra-legal nature, they are not considered immoral, which distinguishes this sector from criminal activities. For example, from the moral standpoint of the society, street vending is not objectionable, especially compared to criminal activities such as burglary, even though both violate property rights. Hence, even though informal sector often violates the de facto institutions, it is often accommodated in the de jure one which is the combination of legal framework, norms and ethical values.</p>
<p>Chapter two tries to analyse the conditions under which informal sector expands. In this chapter, the authors present a model where there are two sectors: formal and informal. There are also two classes of people. Rich people work in the formal sector, while the poor work in the informal. Government’s objective is to maximise the poor people’s income by using two types of redistributive policies: tax transfer and governance. Relaxed governance would help the informal sector proliferate and the poor will earn more. The propositions derived in this chapter talk about the general trade-off between the extent of using these two sets of policy instruments, thereby providing some important insights even though they are difficult to test using available data. In this model, the only constraint that the government faces is that total tax revenue is equal to the sum of cost of governance and subsidy. However, in reality, there are other costs of choosing low governance as this may lead to the infringement of property rights of the rich. The fact that lower governance will lower the income of the rich is assumed in the model. However, the fact that the rich can try to lobby in response is not considered. That can be an extension of this model. The rich, even though they are not the majority, may spend resources to alter the voting result. We see this kind of response in real life. One such example is how the corporate media writes about the unruly behaviour of the auto-rickshaw operators who often do not operate within the existing legal structure, and government allows them to do so because it is a kind of redistributive policy. But again, this active lobbying through media campaign makes the government take some measures for controlling them. The model, which gives some insightful results, could be extended in this line to yield some further results.</p>
<p>This chapter ‘The Political Economy of Informality’ that models the political economy of informal sector is the most exciting section of the book. It sets the research agenda of looking at the institutional aspect of the informal sector which is the key for understanding the existence and expansion of informal sector. The rest of the book looks at the relationship between the formal and the informal sector and the effect of globalisation on both the sectors. The chapters mostly look at the relationship between formal and informal sector from the point of view of resource allocation. Policies such as liberalisation put competitive pressure on the formal sector which results in reallocation of resources from the formal to the informal sector. This may lead to expansion of the informal sector. Chapter four of the book looks at the issue of outsourcing of work from the formal units to informal units. However, it does not consider the issue of offshoring which has become the flagship of the global apparel industry from garments in Bangladesh to shoe-making in Lesotho. Instead, it focuses on domestic outsourcing. The benefit the formal firms get by outsourcing is saving on labour cost. But informal sector is treated as illegal and if caught, some penalties are imposed on the formal firms who outsource their job to informal units. Facing this trade-off, the firms decide how to divide their production between formal and informal units.</p>
<p>There are some issues with the assumptions made in this chapter. One assumption is that if a firm gets caught for outsourcing to an informal unit, then the penalty it faces is that it does not enjoy tariff protection anymore. Two objections can be thought against this assumption. One is that in a more liberalised environment, such penalty will not have much of a bite; and second, in many LDCs, informal units are simply family-run small units which operate within the legal framework. Hence, the way the cost of informal outsourcing is characterised is not universal. It is still possible to justify such assumptions in a specific context, but the authors did not give any explicit justifications for such assumptions.</p>
<p>Chapter three situates the informal economy in the general equilibrium set-up. The general equilibrium framework allows one to find the impact of a growing informal sector on the pre-existing formal sector. It is possible that the expansion of informal sector may come at the cost of the shrinkage of the formal sector making the welfare implication ambiguous. The model predicts, contrary to the conventional wisdom, that trade liberalisation in the formal sector can raise both employment and wage in the informal sector. In this case, the welfare of labour employed in the formal sector is going down as people are losing their higher paying jobs in the formal sector to enter the low paying informal labour market. However, some previously unemployed people may be benefiting from getting a job in the informal sector. Hence, even though informal sector expands with trade liberalisation, the welfare impact is ambiguous at the best.</p>
<p>Chapter four deals with the impact of trade on informal sector. The chapter deals with two cases: one of full employment and the other with open unemployment. However, these models assume that people can freely move between the formal and the informal sectors in the sense that the only cost is the waiting cost. One gets absorbed in the formal sector whenever any job is required. This might be true in the context of many developing countries such as China, but may not be right for a country like India where skill-based service sector booms making the absorption of informal labour very difficult. In this chapter, there are quite a few propositions on the effects of exogenous shocks such as tariff and agricultural prices on welfare. However, the results they derive are ambiguous and there is no indication if the conditions required for positive welfare impact hold in the context of less developed economies. Hence, these results are no more than standard mathematical exercises without any useful insights. The authors mention that employment goes up in informal sector which more than compensates for the loss of jobs in the formal sector. However, the jobs in informal sector are not as paying as those in the formal sector. Hence, people who get relocated to the informal sector lose, while the people who were previously unemployed get the benefit. This clearly is not a Pareto improvement and there are reasons to be apprehensive about the expansion of informal sector which comes at the cost of the formal sector.</p>
<p>In the subsequent chapters, the authors provide empirical evidence from India on the informal sector. The authors of this book try to fill the gap that exists in the empirical literature on the informal sector in India by using both primary and secondary data which come from NSSO. Besides the issue of data availability, the identification problem is a big challenge in this literature. The empirical chapters essentially try to capture the linkage between formal and informal sectors. Regression, the technique that is mostly used in microeconometrics, identifies an exogenous source of variation and finds its effect on the variable of interest. The problem with the formal–informal sectors is that they affect each other dynamically making it difficult to identify the exogenous source of variation. A handful of chapters in this book try to find the impact of trade liberalisation on informal sector. One possibility is to use time series data and use the date of liberalisation as the structural break to investigate whether the outcomes are same before and after the date. But this requires a long series of data which, unfortunately, is not available for Indian informal sector. The other possibility is to look at the cross-section data. The problem is that the tariff rate, which is used as a proxy of liberalisation, is fixed by the Central Government in India and therefore, is same for all the regions in India. Hence, there is not enough variation within different regions of India to find the effect of liberalisation. Topalova (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0973801013483500">2007</xref>), however, adopted a novel approach to calculate enough variation within India. She maintained that reduction in tariff affects selected industries whose geographic concentrations are different for different districts. Hence, the effect of tariff reduction is different for different districts. Topalova uses this argument as her identification strategy.</p>
<p>The eighth chapter, rather than using such direct measure of liberalisation, regresses the real value added and capital formation by the formal sector on informal wage with the implicit assumption that formal sector expands (or shrinks depending on which industry we are talking about with liberalisation). Such regression establishes mere correlation between informal wage and growth of formal sector but leaves the channel responsible for such correlation uncaptured. Hence, this exercise may provide motivation for the theoretical studies presented in the first section but it does not provide a test for the hypotheses derived in the same. However, the results based on their primary data provide some useful insights in the process of organisational change within the informal sector. Organisational change is something very important that we need to understand, and it calls for building a theory to explain how the market rule-based liberalisation shapes the organisation of informal sector which is mainly family and community based and is not entirely driven by market-based rules.</p>
<p>In chapter ten, the authors try to evaluate the effect of economic reforms on productivity. The method used in the book is simplistic and may suffer from omitted variable bias. One very important work in this area which uses a more sophisticated econometric technique was done by Nataraj (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0973801013483500">2011</xref>). Nataraj found that reduction in tariff in final goods in India increased the productivity of the informal sector and also, it led to exit of inefficient informal firms from the market. Finally, there are case studies in the book which talk about the leather industry of Dharavi and the paper product industry. These two case studies reveal some important facts about the working of informal industries and can provide some useful insights for building an appropriate theory.</p>
<p>The book, <italic>The Outsider</italic>, by Marjit and Kar fits in the area of the research on informal sector which becomes crucial for understanding development process in the era of globalisation and liberalisation. Less developed countries have the advantage of cheap labour. But the formal sector in these countries is often constrained by strict labour laws leading to the loss of that competitive edge. Hence, the informal sector in LDCs working outside the purview of standard labour laws assumes a leading role in trade expansion. Notwithstanding what some international journal editors think (as revealed by the authors in the introduction section), analysing the operation of the informal sector holds the key to understanding the development process in a free trade environment. The book does play an important role by showcasing some research of this sort which will encourage the young researchers to contribute more in this area. Here lies the importance of this book. However, besides some theoretical and empirical issues with some of the chapters, the book has one critical weakness. It does not go beyond a collection of carefully written chapters and does not become a book which provides the reader with a radically new viewpoint for understanding the informal sector. The chapters are nevertheless related but not bound together by some exciting central thesis which could characterise the contribution of this book beyond the separate contribution of the chapters.</p>
