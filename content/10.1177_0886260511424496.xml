<abstract>
<p>Research on increased medical care costs associated with posttraumatic sequelae has focused on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, the provisional diagnosis of Disorders of Extreme Stress Not Otherwise Specified (DESNOS) encompasses broader trauma-related difficulties and may be uniquely related to medical costs. We investigated whether DESNOS severity was associated with greater nonmental health medical care costs in veterans receiving mental health care. Participants were 106 men and 105 women receiving VA outpatient mental health treatment. A standardized interview assessed DESNOS severity. The dependent variables consisted of primary and specialty medical treatment costs. Sequential zero-inflated negative binomial regression was used to evaluate the variance in medical costs accounted for by DESNOS severity, controlling for PTSD severity and established predisposing, enabling, and need-based health care factors. Contrary to our hypothesis, in fully adjusted models, DESNOS severity independently added a significant amount of variance to <italic>lower</italic> specialty medical care costs, whereas PTSD did not consistently account for significant variance in medical care costs. Greater DESNOS severity appears to be associated with lower specialty medical care costs but not primary care costs. These findings may indicate that patients with DESNOS symptoms are at risk for being underreferred for specialty care.</p>

<p>There is increasing evidence of an association between mental health disorders and health care utilization and costs. One framework for conceptualizing health care service utilization and costs is the Andersen model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260511424496">Andersen, 1995</xref>), which posits that health care utilization is a function of predisposing factors (i.e., preexisting personal features) that include sociodemographic characteristics (age, gender, race, education, and marital status) and trauma exposure, enabling factors (i.e., resources that allow a person to use heath care services) such as household income, insurance, service connection, and clinical need for care factors including high risk behaviors (e.g., smoking, drinking alcohol), and physical and mental health disorders. Among these need-based factors, PTSD has been found to be associated with poorer subjective and objective health status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260511424496">Hoge, Terhalopian, Castro, Messer, &amp; Engel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260511424496">Wagner, Wolfe, Rotnitsky, Proctor, &amp; Erickson, 2000</xref>) and increased health care utilization and cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260511424496">Amaya-Jackson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260511424496">Calhoun, Bosworth, Grambow, Dudley, &amp; Beckham, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260511424496">Dobie et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886260511424496">Polusny et al., 2008</xref>). Trauma exposure itself is also often associated with poorer self-reported health status and increased medical care utilization and cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260511424496">Elhai, North, &amp; Frueh, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260511424496">Stein, McQuaid, Pedrelli, Lenox, &amp; McCahill, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260511424496">Surís, Lind, Kashner, Borman, &amp; Petty, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Increasingly there is recognition that many forms of trauma exposure can lead to mental health symptom sequelae that fall outside the PTSD diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260511424496">Brady, Killeen, Brewerton, &amp; Lucerini, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260511424496">Deering, Glover, Ready, Eddleman, &amp; Alarcon, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260511424496">Herman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260511424496">Ide &amp; Paez, 2000</xref>). Specifically, prolonged or repeated interpersonal violence may be associated with an array of symptoms summarized by Disorders of Extreme Stress Not Otherwise Specified (DESNOS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260511424496">van der Kolk, Roth, Pelcovitz, Sunday, &amp; Spinazzola, 2005</xref>). DESNOS symptoms include chronic problems with affect regulation, interpersonal difficulties, low self-esteem, hopelessness and despair, somatization, and dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260511424496">Courtois, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260511424496">Dickinson, deGruy, Dickinson, &amp; Candib, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260511424496">Ford, Stockton, Kaltman, &amp; Green, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260511424496">Herman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260511424496">Ide &amp; Paez, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886260511424496">Roth, Newman, Pelcovitz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260511424496">van der Kolk et al., 2005</xref>). DESNOS symptomatology may be of particular interest with regard to posttraumatic health sequelae, because somatization is a primary aspect of the disorder. Somatization has repeatedly been found to be associated with increased medical utilization and cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260511424496">Barsky, Orav, &amp; Bates, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260511424496">Duddu, Isaac, &amp; Chaturvedi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260511424496">Fink, Sorensen, Engberg, Holm, &amp; Munk-Jorgensen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260511424496">Gameroff &amp; Olfson, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The nature of traumatic exposure associated with DESNOS has been found to be associated with increased medical utilization and cost. Studies of women veterans indicate that childhood sexual abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260511424496">Surís et al., 2004</xref>) and military sexual harassment and assault (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260511424496">Sadler, Mengeling, &amp; Doebbeling, 2004</xref>) are predictive of significant increases in medical utilization and cost. In light of the large numbers of male and female veterans with histories of childhood abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260511424496">Gahm, Lucenko, Retzlaff, &amp; Fukuda, 2007</xref>) and military sexual trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260511424496">Kimmerling et al., 2010</xref>) presenting for care at VA medical centers nationwide, we believe that the relationship between DESNOS symptoms and health care costs warrants further investigation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260511424496">Ford, 1999</xref>). The current study evaluated the association between DESNOS symptom severity and medical care costs (excluding mental health care) among veterans receiving ongoing outpatient mental health care in the VA system. Our a priori hypothesis was that greater DESNOS severity would be associated with significantly increased medical costs after controlling for the predisposing factors of age, race, gender, and education, the enabling factors of household income and service connection status, and the need-based factors of lifetime smoking status and PTSD severity.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section2-0886260511424496">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The study sample (<italic>N</italic> = 211) consists of 105 women and 106 men veterans enrolled at VA Puget Sound Health Care System (VAPSHCS) in mental health care. An initial sample of 977 veterans (500 males; 477 females) was drawn from the VA Consumer Health Information Performance Sets VISN 20 regional data warehouse. Male veterans were randomly selected from the pool of those eligible, and all eligible female veterans were selected. Participant inclusion criteria were (a) VAPSHCS enrollment for at least 12 months; (b) at least two mental health visits in the past year; and (c) actively followed in outpatient mental health. Using guidelines provided by the researchers (i.e., lack of recent suicidal or homicidal behavior, not currently receiving inpatient care, and no designation of dangerousness), the primary mental health provider for each veteran determined whether his or her patients were stable enough clinically to participate in the study and whether they were capable of providing informed consent. Each provider signed letters introducing the study to his or her patients who were determined to be appropriate to participate. Patients were directed to return a postcard to the research team indicating whether they were interested in participating.</p>
<p>Of the initially identified sample (<italic>n</italic> = 977), 35% were not contacted because the target sample size was achieved. Of the remaining 639, 23% (<italic>n</italic> = 147) were considered ineligible by their primary mental health provider, 42% (<italic>n</italic> = 269) either actively or passively declined participation in the study, and 11 did not attend the scheduled assessment. Of the 492 who were eligible and contacted, 214 (43%) completed the interview. We excluded 3 transgender individuals from these analyses due to the small number. Using the available demographics from the data warehouse (i.e., age, gender, race, and marital status), there were no significant differences between the study sample and those in the initial sample or who declined participation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0886260511424496">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were assessed by a licensed psychologist or master’s level counselor. Interviewers underwent training by conducting mock interviews which were checked for fidelity by the lead author. The procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Washington. All participants provided written informed consent and received US$20 for completing the interview. Data were collected between October 2003 and October 2004.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section5-0886260511424496">
<title>Trauma exposure</title>
<p>The Traumatic Life Events Questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260511424496">Kubany et al., 2000</xref>) assesses a broad range of potentially traumatic life events as well as DSM-IV PTSD Criterion A and has good psychometric properties.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0886260511424496">
<title>PTSD</title>
<p>The PTSD Checklist—Civilian version (PCL-C; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886260511424496">Weathers, Litz, Herman, Huska, &amp; Keane, 1993</xref>) is a validated, widely used 17-item measure assessing severity of PTSD symptomatology consistent with DSM-IV criteria, with scores ranging from 17 to 85.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0886260511424496">
<title>Lifetime smoking status</title>
<p>To control conservatively for smoking-related health costs, cigarette smoking status was assessed by a single item that identified all participants who indicated ever having smoked.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0886260511424496">
<title>Non-VA care</title>
<p>Non-VA medical care was assessed via one previously validated item (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260511424496">Krystal, Gueorguieva, Cramer, Collins, &amp; Rosenheck, 2008</xref>) that queried participants’ estimates of the percentage of overall physical health care obtained outside the VA during the previous year.</p>

<title>DESNOS interview</title>
<p>The Structured Interview for Disorders of Extreme Stress (SIDES; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0886260511424496">Zlotnick &amp; Pearlstein, 1997</xref>) is a 48-item structured interview that assesses lifetime and current DESNOS symptoms. The present study focused on current overall DESNOS symptom severity with a 1-month time frame. The current severity of each symptom was rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0, indicating no problem, to 3, indicating extreme problems. Consistent with previous research, items were summed to obtain a severity score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260511424496">Ford et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260511424496">Ford &amp; Fournier, 2007</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0886260511424496">Zlotnick &amp; Pearlstein, 1997</xref>) (range 0-135; Cronbach’s alpha total score = .90).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0886260511424496">
<title>Administrative database information</title>
<p>The VA VISN 20 data warehouse was used to identify the initial sample of 977 based on the inclusion criteria and to extract pertinent patient descriptives (<italic>N</italic> = 211).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0886260511424496">
<title>Medical care costs and urgent care utilization</title>
<p>The local VA Decision Support System database was used to estimate all inpatient and outpatient medical care costs for the 12 months before the interview. VA stop codes that identify the specific type of visit (e.g., primary care, dermatology visit, and so on) were grouped together to summarize total outpatient medical care costs, our primary dependent variable. Mental health care costs were not included in medical care costs. In addition, urgent-care utilization (<italic>yes</italic>/<italic>no</italic>), inpatient length of stay, and no-show rates for scheduled medical visits were each examined separately. We examined urgent care utilization rather that costs because data on cost of urgent care visits were not available. Medical and psychiatric urgent care visits were not distinguishable in urgent care utilization.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0886260511424496">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The data were first evaluated for assumptions of regression analysis. As is common with health care utilization and cost data, medical care cost was significantly positively skewed, overdispersed, and contained an excess of zero values. As recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260511424496">Elhai, Calhoun, and Ford (2008)</xref>, we analyzed the data using zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression to simultaneously examine nonuse of VA medical care and the continuous measure of medical care costs. Sequential ZINB regression analyses were used to investigate whether DESNOS severity contributed significant variance to medical care costs beyond that associated with demographics and PTSD severity.</p>

<title>Sample Characteristics</title>
<p>Study-sample demographics were drawn from participant self-report. The mean age was 52.4 (<italic>SD</italic> = 11.2) and 73.9% were Caucasian, 12.8% African American, 2.4% Asian American, 2.4% Hispanic, 1.9% Native American, and 5.2% reported other ethnic or racial identity. Marital status was as follows: 43.1% married, 37.0% divorced or separated, 17.1% never married, and 2.4% widowed. More than half the sample reported annual household incomes above US$25,000, and more than half completed at least some college (52.1%).</p>
<p>The average number of self-reported traumas consistent with DSM-IV PTSD A criterion was 8.6 (<italic>SD</italic> = 4.4).

<title>Preliminary Analyses to Test for Covariates</title>
<p>To examine potential covariates for inclusion in the main analyses, we conducted ZINB regression with medical costs as the dependent variable. Income and education were entered as dummy coded binary predictors as they are ordinal variables. The following demographic factors were associated with medical costs (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886260511424496">Table 1</xref>): (a) African American respondents had higher medical costs compared with other racial and ethnic groups; (b) women evidenced greater medical costs compared with men; and (3) in the zero-inflated model, those with 50% or more service connection (dummy coded less than 50% vs. 50% and more than 50%) were more likely to have incurred nonzero medical costs. These variables were included as covariates in the analyses. Age, smoking status, income, and education were not significantly associated with medical care costs in this sample.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0886260511424496">1</xref></sup></p>

<title>Post hoc Analyses of Medical Care Utilization and DESNOS Severity</title>
<p>Given the surprising result that DESNOS contributed to <italic>lower</italic> medical care costs, we conducted post hoc analyses to help elucidate the findings. First, as PTSD and DESNOS share substantial variance, we sought to examine whether the PTSD might be serving as a suppressor variable. Therefore, we reran the analysis excluding PTSD severity. The pattern of results was unchanged: female gender (<italic>B</italic> = .44, <italic>SE B</italic> = .14, <italic>z</italic> = 3.03, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), African American race (<italic>B</italic> = .68, <italic>SE B</italic> = .20, <italic>z</italic> = 3.33, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and <italic>lower</italic> DESNOS severity (<italic>B</italic> = −.01, <italic>SE B</italic> = .004, <italic>z</italic> = −2.43, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) continued to contribute significant variance to greater medical care costs in the full model. In addition, the model including DESNOS severity contributed unique variance compared with the model including only the demographic variables (Nagelkerke Δ<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .03, likelihood ratio χ<sup>2</sup> = 6.35, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).</p>
<p>Next, we conducted two post hoc regression analyses with the medical care cost data to distinguish between primary care and specialty medical care (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0886260511424496">Table 4</xref>). Like overall medical care costs, primary and specialty care cost data were overdispersed and zero inflated; therefore, we analyzed the data using ZINB regression analyses. As with total prior year costs, the demographic variables accounted for significant variance in primary care (Nagelkerke <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .09, likelihood ratio χ<sup>2</sup> = 19.50, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and specialty care costs (Nagelkerke <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .11, likelihood ratio χ<sup>2</sup> = 25.53, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). PTSD severity did not account for significant additional variance (primary: Nagelkerke Δ<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .02, likelihood ratio χ<sup>2</sup> = 5.33; specialty: Nagelkerke Δ<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .00, likelihood ratio χ<sup>2</sup> = .29, both <italic>ns</italic>). Over and above these factors, DESNOS symptom severity accounted for significant variance in specialty care costs (Nagelkerke <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .06, likelihood ratio χ<sup>2</sup> = 11.86, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), with higher costs associated with lower DESNOS severity. However, DESNOS severity did not contribute significant unique variance to primary medical care costs (Nagelkerke Δ<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .02, likelihood ratio χ<sup>2</sup> = 4.80, <italic>ns</italic>).</p>

<title>Exploratory Analyses Examining Failure to Show and Outside-VA Medical Care</title>
<p>To examine whether irregular appointment attendance or obtaining medical care outside the VA could account for the pattern of results, we reran the above analyses with these variables included in the regressions. These variables were entered on a separate step after demographics and PTSD symptoms, and their combination added significant unique variance to overall medical costs (Nagelkerke Δ<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .16, likelihood ratio χ<sup>2</sup> = 36.51, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), primary care costs (Nagelkerke Δ<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .15, likelihood ratio χ<sup>2</sup> = 35.16, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and specialty care costs (Nagelkerke Δ<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .15, likelihood ratio χ<sup>2</sup> = 34.49, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). However, DESNOS severity continued to add unique variance to overall medical costs (Nagelkerke Δ<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .07, likelihood ratio χ<sup>2</sup> = 14.53, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and specialty care costs (Nagelkerke Δ<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .05, likelihood ratio χ<sup>2</sup> = 11.26, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) when these variables were included. In contrast with the analyses excluding no show and outside medical care data, DESNOS severity also added significant unique variance to primary care costs in the model including failure to attend appointments and outside medical care (Nagelkerke Δ<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .03, likelihood ratio χ<sup>2</sup> = 7.05, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .03).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study evaluated whether DESNOS symptom severity was associated with nonmental health medical care costs after adjusting for health care predisposing factors of demographic variables, enabling factor of service connection status, and PTSD severity. Based on previous research indicating an association between increased medical costs and the need-based factors of PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260511424496">Elhai et al., 2005</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260511424496">Stein et al., 2000</xref>) and somatization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260511424496">Barsky et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260511424496">Duddu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260511424496">Fink et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260511424496">Gameroff &amp; Olfson, 2006</xref>), we anticipated that those with more severe DESNOS symptomatology would have greater medical care costs. However, contrary to our hypothesis, DESNOS symptom severity was associated with significantly <italic>lower</italic> medical care costs, whereas PTSD severity was not significantly associated with medical care costs.</p>
<p>The unexpected finding that PTSD severity was not associated with medical care costs may be due to the fact that our sample was drawn from VA outpatient mental health and not from the outpatient population at large, potentially resulting in a ceiling effect. These results are consistent with another study examining these variables in veterans seeking PTSD treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260511424496">Elhai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260511424496">Elhai, Reeves, &amp; Frueh, 2004</xref>). For veterans enrolled in mental health care and stable enough to participate in a comprehensive research assessment, DESNOS severity may be more strongly associated with medical care costs than PTSD. In addition, although the finding that smoking status was not significantly associated with medical costs is unusual, our single-item assessment of smoking status may not have been sensitive enough to adequately capture important aspects of smoking behavior. Similarly, although we did not find an association between age and medical costs, we did find evidence of an age by gender interaction such that older age was associated with costs for men but not women. The mean age among women in this sample was significantly younger (<italic>M</italic> = 48.6, <italic>SD</italic> = 9.8) than the men (<italic>M</italic> = 56.2, <italic>SD</italic> = 11.3, <italic>t</italic>(208) = 5.2, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) potentially accounting for the lack of effect among women. Rerunning the analyses with this interaction included among the demographic variables did not change the observed pattern of results, except that PTSD contributed significant unique variance to primary care costs.</p>
<p>To facilitate interpretation of the DESNOS findings, we took a number of steps post hoc. First, because PTSD severity was strongly correlated with DESNOS severity, we first evaluated whether PTSD severity might be acting as a suppressor variable by removing it from the regression equation. We found that the pattern of results remained the same with greater DESNOS severity being associated with lower medical care costs. Next, we examined whether there were differences in the relationships between DESNOS severity and primary and specialty medical care. Due to the emphasis on unexplained medical symptoms in DESNOS and the possibility that these could be seen as more psychological than physical in origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260511424496">Richardson, Elhai, &amp; Pedlar, 2006</xref>), we reasoned that our unexpected finding of greater DESNOS severity being related to lower medical costs could be due to fewer referrals to specialty medical services. Our post hoc analyses generally support this idea. Greater DESNOS severity was associated with significantly lower specialty care costs but not with significantly lower primary care costs.</p>
<p>Given the potential implications of the unexpected finding that DESNOS was associated with lower medical care costs, we also explored additional alternative explanations including whether those with more severe DESNOS symptomatology might be disproportionately “no showing,” or whether those with more severe DESNOS might disproportionately use non-VA care. However, although these variables did account for unique variance in medical care costs, DESNOS severity continued to contribute significant unique variance in specialty care costs (and also in primary care costs) even with these variables in the model.</p>
<p>The present study has notable strengths and limitations. The primary strengths are the inclusion of a vulnerable clinical sample, inclusion of comparable numbers of men and women, statistical adjustment for predisposing, enabling, and need-based factors that have previously been found to be associated with health care costs among veterans and civilians, and use of automated VA cost data rather than subjective estimates of health care utilization.</p>
<p>The first strength of the study outlined above can also be construed as a limitation. The use of an exclusively veteran patient sample enrolled in mental health services limits the generalizability of the findings. Similarly, because a substantial number of patients (<italic>n</italic> = 147) were deemed too psychiatrically unstable by their mental health providers to participate in the study, our sample represents only those in mental health care who are relatively stable and willing to participate. Another study limitation is our use of the 1-month time frame for assessing current DESNOS as suggested by the SIDES authors, though others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260511424496">Ford, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886260511424496">Pelcovitz et al., 1997</xref>) have used either a 6-month time frame or lifetime assessment. For the present study a 12-month time frame would have been preferable as it would have corresponded directly to past year treatment costs. A final important limitation of the present study is the cross-sectional, correlational nature of the data. Future research in this area should incorporate a longitudinal study design to evaluate whether DESNOS prospectively predicts medical care costs.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The present study found that DESNOS severity accounted for significant variance in lower nonmental health medical care costs even statistically controlling for predisposing, enabling, and other need-based factors. Post hoc analyses indicate that these findings could not be explained by either elevated rates of “no shows” or greater use of non-VA medical care by those with relatively more severe DESNOS. Should these findings be replicated in other samples, primary care providers may need to adjust their practice patterns to ensure that the medical needs of patients with DESNOS symptoms are fully addressed.</p>
