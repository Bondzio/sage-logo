<title>Background:</title>
<p>Many ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) reconstruction techniques have been created and biomechanically tested. Single-bundle reconstructions aim to re-create the important anterior bundle of the UCL. To date, no technique has utilized suspensory fixation on the ulnar and humeral sides to create a single-bundle reconstruction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546513481957">
<title>Hypothesis:</title>
<p>The bisuspensory technique will restore valgus laxity to its native state, with comparable load-to-failure characteristics to the docking technique.</p>

<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Controlled laboratory study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546513481957">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Six matched pairs of fresh-frozen cadaveric elbows were randomized to undergo UCL reconstruction using either the docking technique or a novel single-bundle bisuspensory technique. Valgus laxity and rotation measurements were quantified using a MicroScribe 3DLX digitizer at various flexion angles for the native ligament, transected ligament, and 1 of the 2 tested reconstructed ligaments. Laxity testing was performed from maximum extension to 120° of flexion. Each reconstruction was then tested to failure, and the method of failure was recorded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546513481957">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Valgus laxity was restored to the intact state at all degrees of elbow flexion for both the docking and bisuspensory techniques. In load-to-failure testing, there was no significant difference with regard to stiffness, ultimate torque, ultimate torque angle, energy absorbed, and applied moment to reach 10° of valgus. Yield torques for the bisuspensory and docking reconstructions were 18.7 ± 7.8 N·m and 18.6 ± 4.4 N·m, respectively (<italic>P</italic> = .95). The ultimate torque for the bisuspensory technique measured 26.5 ± 9.2 N·m and for the docking technique measured 25.1 ± 7.1 N·m (<italic>P</italic> = .78).</p>

<sec id="section6-0363546513481957">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>The bisuspensory fixation technique, a reproducible single-bundle reconstruction, was able to restore valgus laxity to the native state, with similar load-to-failure characteristics as the docking technique.</p>

<body>
<p>The anatomy and function of the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) have been studied extensively since the advent of the “Tommy John surgery.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513481957">14</xref></sup> Many advances have been made since early UCL reconstructions, such as utilizing a flexor pronator elevation approach and ulnar nerve transposition, to the current muscle-splitting approach with minimal dissection without ulnar nerve transposition. Return to sport has been successful in 70% to 95% of patients in numerous clinical studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513481957">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513481957">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513481957">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513481957">22</xref></sup> with the Jobe technique and the docking technique being the most widely studied. Many techniques have been created and biomechanically tested as new implants and devices have allowed surgeons to be less invasive. More recent reconstructions utilize single-point distal fixation models that anatomically re-create the anterior bundle of the UCL. However, no study, clinical or biomechanical, has evaluated a reconstruction re-creating the anterior bundle in an anatomic model using suspensory fixation on both the humerus and ulna.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the strength and kinematics of a new reconstruction technique utilizing suspensory fixation on the humerus and ulna. Our hypothesis was that this bisuspensory fixation technique would restore valgus stability to that of the native ligament, with comparable load-to-failure properties to the commonly used docking technique.</p>
<sec id="section8-0363546513481957" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Six matched pairs of fresh-frozen cadaveric elbows were dissected of all soft tissue attachments except the capsule and medial and lateral ligamentous complexes. The tested specimens were all male, with an average age of 68.5 years (range, 63-79 years). Specimens were stored in a freezer at −20°C and thawed at room temperature for 24 hours before testing. Forearms were fixed in neutral rotation with a screw. Forearms and humeri were then potted in polyvinyl chloride pipes and plaster of Paris. The remaining capsule and ligaments were kept moist with saline solution throughout testing. For each matched pair, one elbow was randomly chosen to undergo the described bisuspensory fixation technique and the other elbow the docking technique as described by Rohrbough et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513481957">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513481957">22</xref></sup> Each elbow underwent native ligament laxity testing, followed by laxity testing after transecting the anterior bundle of the UCL, and again after reconstruction using the assigned method; specimens were then tested to failure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546513481957">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Kinematic Testing</title>
<p>Valgus laxity was tested using a 3-dimensional coordinate measurement device (MicroScribe; Revware Inc, Raleigh, North Carolina). The medial and lateral epicondyles were oriented perpendicular to the testing apparatus, with the medial epicondyle placed superiorly so that the weight of the forearm potting provided a valgus torque on the elbow of 0.5 N·m. The device allowed for the forearm to be set at a certain degree of elbow flexion while allowing the forearm to rotate freely in varus-valgus and internal-external rotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546513481957">Figure 2</xref>). The elbow was then brought through a full range of motion 5 times for preconditioning and then placed in maximum extension. The flexion angle and valgus position were noted. Measurements were taken at full extension and at 30°, 60°, 90°, and 120° of flexion. Two measurements were taken to ensure reproducibility to within 1.5° of the valgus angle and 2° of the flexion angle. The 2 values were then averaged for analysis.</p>

</fig>
<p>After the intact UCL was tested, the anterior bundle of the UCL was identified, and a longitudinal cut was made anterior and posterior to the ligament. It was then transected in the midportion of the ligament. In addition, any deep fibers of the ligament and capsule were also transected, exposing this small portion of the joint. The remaining anterior capsule and posterior capsule were left intact, including the posterior bundle. Valgus laxity was then tested in the same fashion as with the intact state. After laxity measurements were completed for the transected specimen, the specimen was left on the apparatus and positioned at 30° of flexion, while the randomly selected reconstruction was performed on the specimen. The elbow was preconditioned again with 5 full cycles of elbow flexion. Each elbow was then tested for valgus laxity using the same previously described methods.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0363546513481957">
<title>Load-to-Failure Testing</title>
<p>After laxity testing, the reconstructed elbows were then mounted on an Instron materials testing machine (Instron, Norwood, Massachusetts) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546513481957">Figure 3</xref>). The humerus was fixed to the apparatus with 4 cross-screws with the forearm placed at 70° of flexion. The force loading arm of the device was placed 15 cm from the medial epicondyle to provide a consistent measurement of torque. The custom device was designed to apply a compressive force through the Instron machine but also to keep a constant moment arm for the torque application about the elbow. A valgus preload of 1 N·m was applied, and then each elbow was loaded to failure at a rate of 50 mm/s. The load-displacement characteristics were recorded and plotted, and the angular displacement at failure, yield torque, and ultimate torque were determined. The yield torque was defined as the point where the slope of the load-displacement curve deviates from linear, and the ultimate torque was defined as the peak of the load-displacement curve. The mode of failure was also recorded.</p>

<title>Reconstruction Technique</title>
<p>After measurements for valgus laxity were performed with the UCL completely transected, the remaining ligament was sharply dissected from its humeral and ulnar insertions. The exact insertions were easily visualized using this sharp dissection technique and were marked with a surgical marking pen. The humeral tunnel was created first by placement of a 3.2-mm spade-tip guide pin through the demarcated insertion, driven slightly ulnar to radial, exiting the medial column anterior to what would be the intermuscular septum. This length was consistently 20 mm. A 4.5-mm cannulated drill was drilled over the guide pin to a depth of 15 mm. The Arthrex ACL Tightrope RT (Arthrex, Naples, Florida) was then passed, resting the button on the outer cortex, and the looped end of the tightrope was left out of the humeral insertion.</p>
<p>The ulnar tunnel was then created in a similar fashion with a 3.2-mm spade-tip guide pin placed at the ulnar insertion point, aimed distally and posteriorly 30°. This angle was created after initially starting with the guide pin aimed perpendicular to the sublime tubercle insertion and then redirecting distally and posteriorly as the pin engaged bone. The guide pin consistently exited the ulnar cortex on the posterior aspect of the interosseous ligament at a length of 35 to 40 mm. The guide pin was then overdrilled with the 4.5-mm cannulated drill to a depth of 30 mm. The drill and guide pin were removed, and the Arthrex tightrope classic button was passed with the aid of the button-passing device. This was done to re-create how the surgery would be conducted, not passing a guide pin distally into the forearm. The button was easily placed by this mechanism, engaging the far cortex. The tightrope is designed to pull on the toggle sutures in a direction 180° to the direction of the advancement of the looped end and thus the graft. This allows the surgeon to dunk the graft from its entrance. Again, the looped end was secured until ready for graft passage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0363546513481957">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Extensor digitorum longus (EDL) tendons were used for grafts in all reconstructions. The EDL tendons were readily available and have been used as an alternate to palmaris longus tendons. Palmaris grafts were not used because we amputated the wrist and hand 18 cm from the joint line in a guillotine fashion so that the wrist and hand in their entirety could be used in future studies. The EDL tendons were sized to 4.5 mm doubled over to match line to line with our tunnels. Each graft was pretensioned at 10 lb for 10 minutes before implantation. The free ends of the graft were placed through the looped ends with the tails of each end coming back to double over each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0363546513481957">Figure 4</xref>). The humeral toggle stitches were then tensioned to bring the looped graft into the humeral tunnel as far as possible, bottoming out in the tunnel. The ulnar side of the looped graft was laid over the tunnel while providing a varus force to reduce the joint and marked 4 cm distal to the insertion point with a surgical marking pen. The graft was then brought into the ulnar tunnel by tensioning the toggle sutures on the tightrope, toggling until the marked line was flush with the tunnel aperture, allowing 2 cm of a doubled graft within the ulnar tunnel. The free ends of the graft were doubled over on themselves at the site of the newly reconstructed UCL and sutured to each other with 3 stitches in a figure-of-8 fashion using No. 2 FiberWire (Arthrex), to tie 4 knots. Final tensioning of the graft was done by tensioning the ulnar-sided toggle stitches at 49 N of force as measured by a digital tensiometer (digital scale, Quarrow, Grand Prairie, Texas). All tensioning was performed at 30° of elbow flexion.</p>
<p>For the contralateral elbow, the docking technique as described by Rohrbough et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513481957">22</xref></sup> was performed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513481957">12</xref></sup> A 3-mm drill was used to create the ulnar tunnels on either side of the sublime tubercle, connecting the tunnels with a curette and leaving a 2-cm bone bridge between the tunnels. Care was taken not to violate the bony bridge. The humeral tunnel was made with a 4-mm drill at the humeral insertion. This was advanced 1 cm, with care taken not to violate the posterior and medial cortexes. A 1.5-mm drill was used to create the 2 small exit punctures for the sutures, leaving a 5- to 10-mm bone bridge. The graft was then passed through the ulnar tunnel from anterior to posterior, and the posterior limb, with No. 2 FiberWire suture in a Krackow fashion, was docked in the humeral tunnel with the sutures exiting one of the puncture holes. The elbow was reduced and held in 30° of flexion, while the appropriate length of the anterior limb was determined such that the graft would be short of the length of the tunnel and the limb would not bottom out in the tunnel. The No. 2 FiberWire was then placed in the anterior limb in a Krackow fashion and passed through the remaining puncture hole. The sutures from the anterior and posterior limbs were tied over the bone bridge while holding the elbow in 30° of flexion and a varus force applied to reduce the joint. The EDL tendons were also used and tensioned at 10 lb for 10 minutes before implantation. Photographs of the final reconstructions are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0363546513481957">Figure 5</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have detailed a technique for reconstruction of the UCL that utilizes suspensory fixation on the ulna and humerus to create a single-bundle reconstruction. The data support our hypothesis of comparable strength, but we have shown improved kinematics in laxity testing and ulnar rotation when compared with the docking technique. Important components to creating a UCL reconstruction are the reproducibility of the technique, ease of graft tensioning, restoration of valgus laxity and normal elbow kinematics, and strength of the construct. All of these components are present in this technique, and while it was shown to be a biomechanically acceptable technique, its clinical outcome has yet to be studied.</p>
<p>The function of the anterior bundle of the UCL as the primary restraint to valgus stress has been well studied in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546513481957">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513481957">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513481957">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546513481957">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513481957">23</xref></sup> More recently, new techniques have been developed to reconstruct the UCL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513481957">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513481957">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513481957">18</xref></sup> The most tested constructs are the Jobe and docking techniques. Among all the different reconstructions, there is no consensus on which construct is the strongest. Armstrong et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513481957">4</xref></sup> studied 4 reconstructions, noting the docking and EndoButton constructs to be stronger than the figure-of-8 and interference screws, although the exact surgical technique used in the study has been questioned. Paletta et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513481957">20</xref></sup> compared the Jobe technique and the docking technique and noted the latter to be stronger. We chose to compare our novel technique with the docking technique because the docking technique is clinically proven and has performed well in load-to-failure biomechanical testing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513481957">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513481957">20</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Clinical outcomes for UCL reconstruction have demonstrated excellent results in 83% of overhead athletes as measured by the Conway-Jobe rating. In a systematic review by Vitale and Ahmad,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513481957">24</xref></sup> there was a better outcome with the docking technique versus the Jobe technique, with 90% and 76% excellent results, respectively. This study, published in 2008, did not take into account the largest outcome study, which reported on 1281 athletes. Cain et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513481957">7</xref></sup> using the Jobe technique, reported an 83% return to sport, making the Jobe technique the most studied technique.</p>
<p>Newer techniques aim to re-create the anterior bundle in a single-bundle reconstruction, while the Jobe and docking techniques are double-bundle reconstructions. Armstrong et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513481957">3</xref></sup> had previously shown in a laboratory model that single-strand ligament reconstruction can restore valgus stability and has isometric properties through the arc of elbow flexion. Ahmad et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513481957">1</xref></sup> evaluated a single-strand interference screw model and showed that ultimate moment at failure was 95% that of the intact elbow but with a stiffness of approximately 50% of the native ligament. Concern with a fracture of the medial epicondyle has led to the DANE technique, which utilizes the docking technique in the humeral insertion instead of the interference screw.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513481957">11</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Several studies have demonstrated the improved kinematics of single-strand grafts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513481957">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513481957">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513481957">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513481957">16</xref></sup> However, none of these studies has directly compared a single-bundle reconstruction with a double-bundle reconstruction. This is the first study that directly compares these 2 types of reconstructions. Our results show that single-bundle reconstructions perform more like the native UCL in terms of laxity and ulnar rotation. The implications for abnormal rotation in a double-bundle model are unknown, and further biomechanical or long-term clinical studies could help answer this.</p>
<p>The finding of laxity at low flexion angles and overtightening at higher flexion angles can be explained. We tensioned at 30° of flexion in the docking reconstruction, as it was originally described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513481957">22</xref></sup> However, some authors prefer to tension at higher degrees of flexion. The reconstruction immediately after tensioning and securing the knot was firm; however, the tension was lost with the preconditioning with 5 full cycles of elbow flexion. Often, the elbow was difficult to flex beyond 90° because of the high tension in the posterior bundle. This finding is consistent with a study by Bernas et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513481957">6</xref></sup> in which strain was measured in the docking technique. The authors found significant strain in the posterior bundle with elbow flexion greater than 50° and up to 7% strain at 90°. In the bisuspensory model, we tensioned the graft at 30° of flexion, but because of the isometric nature of the reconstruction, this increasing strain with flexion did not occur.</p>
<p>Multiple studies have shown that the mode of failure of reconstructions is the suture-tendon interface or screw-tendon interface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513481957">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513481957">20</xref></sup> The aim of our technique was to minimize the most common mode of failure of the docking technique and other various techniques: the suture-graft interface. The tightrope device with looped tendon was noted to be a very strong interface and was not the site of failure for any of our constructs. This technique uses 3 figure-of-8 sutures in the doubled-over ends of the graft. The suture-tendon interface was the mode of failure of all our reconstructions and is consistent with other reconstruction techniques.</p>
<p>A weakness of this study is that we did not measure the strength of the UCL. Therefore, we cannot compare load-to-failure characteristics of our reconstructions to those of the native ligament. It is well documented that a reconstructed ligament will not be as strong as the native ligament, and thus, we thought that this was not the goal of this reconstruction method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513481957">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513481957">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513481957">20</xref></sup> Previous studies have shown that the strength of the native ligament ranges from 22.7 N·m to 34 N·m, while our reconstruction measured 26.5 N·m.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513481957">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513481957">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513481957">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513481957">20</xref></sup> These values depend on the age of the specimens,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513481957">1</xref></sup> testing methods, and many other factors. Instead, we chose to compare this reconstruction to the docking technique, which is commonly used clinically and has performed well in previous biomechanical studies. We also chose to test load to failure as opposed to cyclic loading to failure, as a load-to-failure test gives greater insight into the structural integrity of the reconstruction. This also permits comparison with other studies in the literature because load-to-failure testing has most commonly been performed in previous biomechanical studies on UCL reconstruction. Another weakness is the type of tendon graft used. We chose EDL tendons because they were readily available and have been used in previous studies, rather than the more commonly used palmaris longus tendon. Three articles report the clinical outcomes after UCL reconstruction utilizing the EDL tendon as the graft.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513481957">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513481957">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513481957">10</xref></sup> Although this is not the most common graft used, its documented clinical use in the published literature was sufficient to proceed with its use in this biomechanical study. In addition to the type of tendon, the age of these tendons was unknown. This is less likely an issue, as the cadaveric specimens themselves were 68.5 years of age.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The bisuspensory fixation technique is an easily reproducible reconstruction that utilizes suspensory fixation with a simple tensioning mechanism in a single-strand model. Furthermore, the bisuspensory technique has comparable load-to-failure biomechanical properties as compared with the docking technique. This reconstruction technique could be considered in a clinical setting as a primary method of UCL reconstruction or as a backup fixation method should intraoperative complications occur.</p>
