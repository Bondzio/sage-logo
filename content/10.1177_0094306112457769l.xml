<p>Given the severity of the current crisis in global capitalism, it is disappointing to note that, with the notable exceptions of Immanuel Wallerstein and the late Pierre Bourdieu, critical social theory in the United States is today largely the province of non-sociologists such as David Harvey, a cultural geographer, Frederic Jameson, a literary theorist, and Douglas Kellner, a philosopher. For almost a quarter century, however, Robert Goldman and Stephen Papson have produced a remarkable series of articles and books documenting a variety of advertising strategies employed by large corporations to legitimate their increasing hegemony in contemporary American society. In <italic>Landscapes of Capital</italic>, the authors continue this important work by means of a theoretical analysis of 2,400 television ads broadcast from 1995 to 2010, which the authors digitized, entered into a database, and coded for key concepts and signifiers. The database, including the ads themselves, are available at a website created by the authors to accompany the text, which itself is focused on readings of selected ads chosen to represent dominant themes in their larger sample.</p>
<p>The analysis focuses primarily on ads produced by the major players in the so-called New Economy, such as finance (investment, banks, insurance), computer technology (semiconductors and software), biotechnology, and energy companies. Historically, corporate ads aimed generally at identifying a company and what it stood for, rather than offering a particular commodity for sale. More recently, however, these distinctions have become blurred, as businesses increasingly market their services and products to other companies by “branding” themselves via corporate “logos,” creating an association between their firms and images of a desirable quality, therefore enhancing what the authors refer to as a corporation’s “sign value.”</p>
<p>The ads themselves depict what Goldman and Papson call “symbolic landscapes of capital,” designed to produce “a legitimating mythology of global corporate capitalism” (p. 202). They are characterized collectively by several common features: a primacy given to communications networks, and, more generally, to science and technology; the disappearance of the state and bureaucracy; the demise of conventional categories of class and class conflict in favor of harmonious images of multiculturalism; and the collapse of material distance in favor of instantaneity. The authors also identify a small set of preferred images that dominate the lexicon of corporate advertising: orange-robed Buddhist monks, camels and desert nomads, spiral staircases, transparent acrylic markerboards, satellite dishes, wind turbines and speed blurs. Employing fast-paced video editing techniques that reassemble, montage-style, these otherwise disparate images of the latest technologies with those of traditional peoples and places, these ads construct a vision of corporate-sponsored global harmony, devoid of any traces of contradiction or crisis.</p>
<p>What distinguishes <italic>Landscapes of Capital</italic> from the dominant trends in contemporary sociological work on advertising and media culture is that Goldman and Papson anchor their analysis in classical Marxian political economy and extend it up to the present in terms of a political economy of sign value, a project initiated in Jean Baudrillard’s early work but largely ignored by American sociologists. They begin with Marx’s discussion, in Volume III of <italic>Capital</italic>, where he introduces the concept of “fictitious capital” to describe the role of credit in the expansion of capitalist economies, whose forms they trace from simple credit to stock markets to the contemporary development of derivatives such as collaterized debt obligations (CDOs). They point out that, following an initial boost, the profitability of CDOs began to level off as more and more banks competed for a share of this new market. In response, banks began pooling together these CDOs, creating secondary and tertiary derivatives to sell on the market, ultimately turning to the sale of bundles of subprime mortgages to back them up. Each new form of derivatives, however, was further and further removed from the original underlying assets, generating an increasingly abstract financial system that the authors refer to as “hyperreal capital.”</p>
<p>Corporate advertising, according to Goldman and Papson, is simply the “representational equivalent of this hyperreal capital” (p. 51). Just as financial derivatives based on complex computer models are so far removed from any real assets that they seem to take on a life of their own, so corporate ads construct signs to stand for a particular commodity, and then substitute the sign for the commodity. Also as with the case of derivatives, the substitution of signs for products or brands represents an attempt to add another layer of value. At the same time, however, the competition to generate additional profit either through financial derivatives or advertising sign-value is affected by what Marx called the tendency of the rate of profit to fall, as each new cycle of innovations is both accelerated and more quickly exhausted.</p>
<p>In <italic>The Communist Manifesto</italic>, Marx and Engels describe the relentless commodification of social relations in capitalist societies via the oft-quoted phrase “all that is solid melts into air,” by which they referred to capitalism’s tendency to displace all other types of ties among people with that of the “callous cash payment.” According to Goldman and Papson, corporate advertising displays an ambivalent relationship to the commodification process. On one hand, commodity consumption is positively portrayed in emotionally charged images of warmth, caring for others, and community. On the other, advertisers seek to distance themselves from an accusation of crass commercialism “by conjuring up nostalgic markers of life in a non-commodified world” (p. 107). Similar ambiguities characterize representations of class and inequality in the ads. Images of traditional manufacturing production are replaced largely by those of younger, hip, ethnically diverse “Generation D” (digital) information technology workers, led by corporate executives more concerned with realizing their vision of creating a better world than making profits. Equally prominent are representations of class as a category of consumption, featuring refined individuals displaying their good taste via a series of consumptive choices, or as a new breed of relatively young, middle-class “maverick” investors. Notable in their absence are the casualties of deindustrialization, outsourcing, and offshoring.</p>
<p>A third aspect of Marxian political economy employed in <italic>Landscapes of Capital</italic> is taken from the <italic>Grundrisse</italic>, where Marx notes that the contradictions of capitalism necessitate the “annihilation of space by time.” Recent developments in transportation and communications technology have accelerated the process of “time-space compression” to an incredible degree. The increased speed of these new technologies, according to critics such as Paul Virilio, induces a general “loss of orientation,” whereas the conquering of space results in “deterritorialization,” as meaningful places become hollowed out spaces. Goldman and Papson also point out that a similar process occurs at the human level, as the notion of place-based cultural identities has been deterritorialized. In corporate advertisements, however, the effects of time-space compression are glorified as liberation from outdated constraints in the emerging global networked society.</p>
<p><italic>Landscapes of Capital</italic> is a densely written and, at times, difficult book to read. It is well worth the effort, however, as the authors provide an important theoretical alternative to the uncritical celebration of contemporary culture that currently dominates American sociology.</p>
