<p>Clinical Rehabilitation has always given priority to studies evaluating aspects of rehabilitation, from specific treatments to parts of the process such as goal setting, and has given priority to randomised controlled studies. However so many are now submitted that we have rejected about 125 since 2007, most since 2011. We hope to increase the number of pages published so that we can continue to publish the better randomised trials while still publishing other types of article. This issue is entirely comprised of controlled trials, eight being randomised. They demonstrate that RCTs are indeed possible in almost any area of practice, contrary to what I was told 33 years ago and contrary to the continuing beliefs of many people. For example an interesting <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra1-0269215513492277" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215512473136">study</related-article> in people with schizophrenia compared the differences in outcome between a group of patients where the therapist chose the domains to work on, with a group where the patient made the choice facilitated by the therapist. As one would expect, allowing the patient to choose was associated with quite significant reductions in patient psychiatric morbidity. Huntington’s disease is a disorder that has traditionally been considered difficult to research. No longer; a <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra2-0269215513492277" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215512473762">trial</related-article> in 25 patients found that compliance with an exercise programme was high, and it had quite large effects although a larger study is still needed. ‘Alternative’ therapies such as reflexology are also considered beyond research but a <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra3-0269215513492277" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215512469383">study</related-article> on 20 people with multiple sclerosis shows that research is possible and, as expected, there is a large expectation (placebo) response. Stroke, in contrast, has been extensively researched but there is still much to evaluate. Surface neuromuscular stimulation of paretic arms has been studied for at least 30 years. A large <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra4-0269215513492277" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215512464502">study</related-article> on 90 acute stroke patients found some benefit for pain and contractures, but none for spasticity or stiffness. Research into the amelioration on unilateral (left) neglect has also been ongoing for years, and another reasonably large <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra5-0269215513492277" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215512471959">study</related-article> on 40 patients found that regular cueing did not affect outcome. A third large (but not as large as they hoped) <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra6-0269215513492277" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215513476312">study</related-article> on 87 people at home after stroke investigated two ways to improve exercise and mobility: a static exercise bike, or a programme of walking and exercise tasks. There was no difference. Vibration therapy is a current favourite treatment that may help. In a <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra7-0269215513492277" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215512470673">study</related-article> on 30 children with cerebral palsy some benefits on gait and mobility were found. Another less well known treatment is investigated <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra8-0269215513492277" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215512471062">here</related-article> in 87 elderly people. Does training plantar sensory function improve walking stability? Perhaps, but the practical benefits on falling need to be established before instituting the practice widely. Finally, there is another <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra9-0269215513492277" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215512471063">study</related-article> that finds that pre-operative respiratory ‘pre-rehabilitation’ (i.e. training) improves respiratory function post-operatively.</p>
