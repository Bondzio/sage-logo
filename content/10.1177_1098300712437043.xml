<abstract>
<p>The literature suggests that adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) typically are not socially engaged during unstructured school activities and do not initiate social activities with typically developing peers. This study assessed whether implementing socialization opportunities in the form of lunch clubs based around aspects of the adolescents with ASD’s perseverative interests would promote positive and direct social interaction between the target adolescent and their typically developing peers. A repeated measures multiple baseline experimental design (with two reversals) was implemented across participants. During baseline measures, the participants did not show social engagement or initiations. During intervention, results showed large increases in both social engagement and initiations. These results have implications for understanding variables related to social development in autism.</p>

<body>
<p>A defining characteristic of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is atypical development in socialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1098300712437043">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2009</xref>). In particular, research has documented that adolescents with ASD have difficulty socially interacting with peers, including limited responsiveness, limited or nonexistent initiations, reduced conversational reciprocity, and an overall difficulty sustaining social engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1098300712437043">DiSalvo &amp; Oswald, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1098300712437043">Moxon &amp; Gates, 2001</xref>). Unfortunately, very little research has been published relating to systematic procedures for improving socialization among this age group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1098300712437043">Reichow &amp; Volkmar, 2010</xref>). For this reason, research on the efficacy of successful social interventions with adolescents with ASD becomes especially important when considering the growing number of children approaching this age range, and the risk factors of developing comorbid disabilities as a direct consequence of difficulty with peer interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1098300712437043">Farrugia &amp; Hudson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1098300712437043">Stewart, Barnard, Pearson, Hasan, &amp; O’Brien, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In particular, adolescents with ASD have fewer lasting peer relationships and spend less time in peer interactions compared to typically developing peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1098300712437043">Bauminger &amp; Shulman, 2003</xref>). This lack of socialization is correlated with the fact that adolescents with ASD are at higher risk for developing depressive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1098300712437043">Kim, Szatmari, Bryson, Streiner, &amp; Wilson, 2000</xref>) and developing high levels of social anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1098300712437043">Gillott, Furniss, &amp; Walter, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1098300712437043">Sze &amp; Wood, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1098300712437043">Wood &amp; Gadow, 2010</xref>). As well, they report to be lonelier than their typical peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1098300712437043">Lasgaard, Nielsen, Eriksen, &amp; Goossens, 2010</xref>). To ameliorate the possible comorbid risk factors faced by adolescents with ASD, it is essential to develop effective interventions that will assist them with socialization and ultimately friendship development with their typical peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1098300712437043">Simpson, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the literature has documented a variety of effective social intervention strategies, most of these models have focused on preschool or elementary school–age children with ASD (Koegel, Vernon, Koegel, Koegel, &amp; Paullin, in press; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1098300712437043">Reichow, &amp; Volkmar, 2010</xref>). There are relatively few effective intervention models or programs aimed at ameliorating social deficits experienced by adolescents with ASD, particularly in their inclusive school settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1098300712437043">Bellini, Peters, Benner, &amp; Hopf, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1098300712437043">White, Keonig, &amp; Scahill, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the literature on social interventions for young children offers some direction for practitioners and researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1098300712437043">Reichow &amp; Volkmar, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1098300712437043">Rogers, 2000</xref>). For example, structured and predictable environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1098300712437043">Klin, Volkmar, &amp; Sparrow, 2000</xref>) and involvement of typical peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1098300712437043">Rogers, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1098300712437043">Smith, Lovaas, &amp; Lovaas, 2002</xref>) have been shown to be effective components of social interventions. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1098300712437043">Baker, Koegel, and Koegel (1998)</xref> showed that incorporating highly preferred perseverative interests as the theme of a social activity resulted in improving the participation of elementary school individuals with ASD in social activities with their typically developing classmates during lunchtime.</p>
<p>Therefore, the purpose of this study was to systematically assess the effectiveness of structured lunchtime clubs that were based on the perseverative interests of adolescents with ASD. Data were collected to assess whether these procedures would increase the positive social interactions between adolescents with ASD and their typically developing peers.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-1098300712437043">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Three participants, between the ages of 11 and 14 years, participated in this study. All were diagnosed with ASD by an independent state agency with expertise in the differential diagnosis of autism. In addition, staff in our center verified the diagnosis according to the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders–Fourth Edition, text revision</italic> (<italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1098300712437043">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>) criteria. Participants were identified either by their teachers or counselors as being verbal and conversational, but socially isolated in their school setting.</p>
<p>Participant 1 was a 13-year-old boy in the eighth grade. He attended public school and was fully included in all of his classes, and excelled academically. Prior to intervention, his junior high school teachers and counselors expressed their concerns about his social behavior. Specifically, he sat by himself throughout every lunch period and never initiated conversation with peers. Furthermore, he made comments to his teachers and adults about feelings of loneliness at school and a desire for meaningful friendships.</p>
<p>Participant 2 was an 11-year-old boy in the sixth grade. He was fully included in a regular education class at the local elementary school. After graduating from elementary school, Participant 2 began the fall semester of seventh grade at a local private junior high school and then transferred into a local public junior high school for the second semester. Academically, he received Bs and Cs and had some pullout resource services for math. Socially, Participant 2 engaged in some limited conversation with adults but did not initiate or engage in interactions with his peers. Participant 2 was socially isolated, regularly went to the library, and remained by himself.</p>
<p>Participant 3 was a 14-year-old male in the eighth grade. He was mainstreamed at a local public school in several subjects but also attended special education classes and with support he achieved Bs and Cs in his academic courses. During baseline, Participant 3 reported serious depression. He engaged in conversation with adults inconsistently and rarely interacted with peers. Participant 3 spent his lunch periods alone, engaging in repetitive ritualistic behaviors that included hand flapping, putting his elbow above his head and pulling them down, and making inappropriate verbal noises (i.e., “arggghhhh”).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1098300712437043">
<title>Settings</title>
<p>The study primarily took place at local junior and senior high schools in and around Santa Barbara. For Participant 1, the study took place at a local junior high school. For Participant 2, the study took place at a local elementary school and when the participant graduated from the school, the study took place at a local junior high school and he then transferred to another local high school. For Participant 3, he attended a nearby junior high school. At the school sites, we implemented the structured socialization opportunities (SSOs) either in a classroom or in the courtyard during lunchtime. The study also took place at a laboratory at the University of California, Santa Barbara, for detailed data analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1098300712437043">
<title>Dependent Measures</title>
<p>Throughout the study, data were collected on two dependent measures: the percentage of intervals that the students with ASD engaged with their typically developing peers and the frequency of initiations by the students with ASD toward their typically developing peers. Data were unobtrusively collected either by scoring videotapes of the club or by BA-level observers that were frequently in the school environment. These observers had experience with adolescents with ASD and data collection. When data were recorded in vivo, observers recorded the dependent measures at the participating schools. The observers were integrated unobtrusively in the school environment and introduced as student teachers, which is a common practice in the school system. When data were recorded by video, observers recorded the dependent measures at the laboratory in real time. Approximately half of the sessions were recorded in vivo and the other half were recorded by video, with the decision based on the ease of unobtrusively integrating the recording procedure into the ongoing activity.</p>
<p><italic>Percentage partial interval of engagement</italic> was recorded using a 1-min interval recording. For each interval, the presence or absence of engagement was recorded with a plus or minus, and the percentage of intervals with presence of engagement was calculated for each session. Engagement was defined as using appropriate pragmatic behavior in the context of the club activity. Thus, appropriate engagement was defined as the target adolescent’s ongoing appropriate use of at least three of the following: facing peers, making eye contact, gesturing (e.g., pointing), responding to questions, asking questions, making comments, smiling, nodding, and/or sharing of activities or materials with peers during the interval. The absence of appropriate engagement was defined as follows: periods when the target adolescent was not involved in the activity; was not facing peers or making eye contact; did not respond to questions; did not answer questions or verbalize in any way with the typically developing peers; and did not smile, nod, share activities or materials, or nonverbally interact with peers.</p>
<p><italic>Frequency of initiations</italic> was measured as the number of independent spontaneous verbal social communicative behaviors each target adolescent directed toward another peer without being prompted to do so. Initiations included requests, questions, or comments that were not taught to the adolescents during the time frame of the study and were not preceded by a prompt or instruction to speak. A frequency count was used to record frequency of initiations for each session. The total number of initiations the target adolescent made to a typically developing peer(s) was tallied at the end of each club session, and the total was divided by the duration of the club session for that day.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1098300712437043">
<title>Interobserver Agreement</title>
<p>Two observers independently recorded data for approximately 20% of the sessions for each dependent measure for each target adolescent in all conditions. Interobserver reliability was calculated by dividing the total number of agreements by the total number of disagreements plus agreements. Interobserver agreement was collected either by in vivo or by analyzing a video in the laboratory. As noted in the measurement section, data were recorded in vivo, that is, two observers independently recorded the dependent measures at the participating schools. When data were recorded by video, two observers independently recorded the dependent measures at the laboratory.</p>
<p>Agreements for percentage intervals engaged were defined as the observers recording identical marks (i.e., plus or minus) for each 1-min interval throughout the session. Disagreements were defined as the observers having a different recorded response for each 1-min interval. The average percentage agreement for percentage intervals engaged was 89%, with a range of 75% to 100%.</p>
<p>Agreements for frequency of initiation were defined as the observers recording the same number of initiations for a specific session. Disagreements were defined as the observers recording a different number of initiations for any specific session. The average percentage agreement for recording frequency of initiations was 88%, with a range of 66% to 100% (with only one very short session at 66%).</p>

<sec id="section6-1098300712437043">
<title>Research Design</title>
<p>A repeated measures multiple-baseline across-participants experimental design (with two reversals for Participant 2) was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1098300712437043">Barlow &amp; Hersen, 1984</xref>) to assess the effect of the intervention. Probes were collected one to two times per week throughout the study. Systematically staggered baselines of five, seven, and nine probes were recorded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1098300712437043">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>Throughout both the baseline and intervention, students could join any of the large variety of ongoing clubs on campus. In addition, club participants had opportunities to choose partners and team names according to already existing protocols in place at the schools.</p>
<sec id="section8-1098300712437043">
<title>Baseline</title>
<p>During the baseline phase, adolescents participated in their regular lunchtime activities. No changes were made in their lunchtime environment, and no additional instructions were given to the adolescents. A large variety of ongoing school clubs were available to students at lunch, as a regular part of the schools’ extracurricular activities. The ongoing school clubs varied greatly and included sports activities, arts and crafts, and academic activities. In regard to the actual organization of the ongoing clubs, they had similar components to the clubs developed for intervention, such as encouraging the students to join the clubs through announcements and notes sent home to parents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1098300712437043">
<title>Intervention</title>
<p>For each participant with ASD, a social club was formed around their perseverative interest. Similar to the ongoing school clubs available to students in baseline, each activity was presented through announcements and printed materials (i.e., flyers) as a club available for all students to attend. Similar to the other social clubs, before each club meeting, students were encouraged to choose partners and choose team names if they desired. At no point in time during the social club was the adolescent’s diagnosis disclosed to any of the participating peers nor were peers informed that the club was developed around the target adolescent’s interests. In addition, similar to the clubs already available to the students at the school, snacks and refreshments (e.g., pizza, cookies) were available for the members. As in the baseline condition, the students were never prompted to initiate or engage with their typical peers, and the participants and their typically developing peers always chose to participate willingly with the exception that Participant 1 forgot to attend one of the club meetings and data were not recorded for that session. Specific information related to the students’ individual clubs are described below.</p>
<p>Participant 1 had a perseverative interest in movies. Therefore, a Movie Trivia Club was developed. An adult downloaded movie trivia questions from the Internet every week and the club facilitator asked the questions in a manner similar to the television show <italic>Jeopardy</italic>. Students were paired into teams of 2 to 4 students, and the club facilitator read each trivia question while teams were given 10 seconds to discuss the correct answer with their partner and provide a response. The first team that scored 7 points won the prize of the day (e.g., a candy bar). Before the club ended, club members voted on a movie title for the following week.</p>
<p>For Participant 2, a social club was formed around several of his perseverative interests, which included comic books, cartooning, and card games. Thus a “comic book and gaming club” was organized. For the drawing aspect, cartooning and how-to drawing guides were provided for the club members to learn drawing techniques. The gaming aspect of the club was incorporated with drawing. Each week, a drawing themed game was created. For example, a student would start a picture and pass it around the club where other students would add to the original picture. In the end, all club members would have to discuss the image.</p>
<p>Participant 3 had a perseverative interest in card games, and therefore a “Card Game” club was formed. Similar to the other clubs, the rules of the specific card game were explained to all members before the club began. Card games included age-appropriate games, such as Uno, Bingo, and Go Fish.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1098300712437043">Figure 1</xref>, all three participants were socially isolated during the baseline, with zero or near zero percent of the intervals with engagement for every session, with no improving trend over time. This is in spite of the fact that numerous clubs were available for them to attend during baseline. In contrast, all participants improved with intervention when all variables remained the same except for the individualized theme of the club that incorporated the students’ perseverative interests.</p>

</fig>
<p>Specifically, Participant 1 showed no engagement with peers during any of the baseline sessions. During intervention, however, his level of engagement increased immediately and remained at 100% throughout the condition.</p>
<p>Similarly, Participant 2 did not engage with any peers whatsoever during the baseline data that were collected at his elementary school. Once intervention was implemented, his engagement level gradually improved, reaching and remaining at 100% by the end of the condition. Participant 2 then graduated to junior high school, creating a return to the baseline condition, and his percentage of intervals with engagement with peers dropped to near zero levels. When the intervention was implemented at the junior high school, he rapidly increased his percentage of intervals of engagement with typically developing peers to 100%. At that point, this participant transferred to another junior high school because of parental feeling that the academic setting in the subsequent school was better. Again, his percentage of intervals with engagement decreased and continued falling throughout this third baseline condition. Although his level of engagement was low, it did not reach zero at the third school. When intervention was again implemented, he engaged with his peers an average of 80% of the time.</p>
<p>Participant 3 also showed near zero percent engagement (average of 3%) during the baseline period. In contrast, during intervention, his engagement increased steadily, eventually reaching 100% by the end of the condition.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1098300712437043">Figure 2</xref> shows the results for initiations. As can be seen, all three participants did not initiate with their peers during the baseline period. In contrast, all three participants increased their number of initiations following the start of intervention. Participant 1’s initiations increased from zero throughout the baseline sessions to an average of 16 initiations per session during the intervention condition.</p>

</fig>
<p>Participant 2 made no initiations during baseline at his first school. Once intervention was implemented, his frequency of initiations increased to an average of 6.33 per session. Participant 2 then graduated to junior high school with a return to baseline conditions, and his frequency of initiations dropped to near zero averaging 0.25. When intervention was again implemented, he again increased his frequency of initiations, averaging 10 per session. At his third school, Participant 2 averaged 2.57 initiations during baseline. During the final intervention condition, he averaged 11.3 initiations per session.</p>
<p>Participant 3 also demonstrated no initiations during baseline. During the intervention phase he improved, averaging 2.6 initiations per session. Although Participant 3 improved overall, his improvements in initiating to typical peers were small increases and began to decrease after the fourth session and reached near zero by the sixth session (the asterisk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1098300712437043">Figure 2</xref> indicates that medication was prescribed during these sessions and it is possible that the medications may have influenced the results).</p>

<sec id="section11-1098300712437043" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of this study contribute to the existing literature in several interrelated ways. First, the results of our study clearly demonstrate that adolescents with ASD can appropriately engage and initiate in social environments with their typically developing peers. As documented, all three participants positively responded to intervention not only by increasing their percentage of intervals engaged with their typically developing peers but also by increasing their rate of initiations during the sessions. Engagement and initiations are frequently targeted goals for individuals with ASD and are considered prognostic indicators of long-term favorable outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1098300712437043">Koegel, Koegel, Shoshan, &amp; McNerney, 1999</xref>). Moreover, these results are especially important because, to date, there are relatively few studies documenting effective naturalistic social interventions focused on this older age group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1098300712437043">Bellini et al., 2007</xref>). As mentioned above, the majority of social interventions for individuals with ASD have been conducted with young children (e.g., elementary school age) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1098300712437043">Koegel et al., in press</xref>). The results of this study extend the existing body of research by demonstrating that adolescents with ASD in junior high school can rapidly improve appropriate social behaviors (i.e., engagement, initiations) in inclusive school settings with typical peers using a relatively simple intervention model.</p>
<p>Secondly, the current study corroborates previous research findings related to using perseverative and/or ritualistic interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1098300712437043">Baker, 2000</xref>), as well as peer-mediated interventions to improve social behaviors in adolescents with ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1098300712437043">Chan et al., 2009</xref>). Specifically, we found that providing a structured club that incorporated themes of activities around the adolescents’ perseverative interests helped increase initiations and engagement with typically developing peers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1098300712437043">Baker et al. (1998)</xref> also found similar results when they developed playground games and activities during recess and lunch based around the preferred interests of elementary school–aged children with ASD. Further, the present study supports the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1098300712437043">Hillier, Fish, Cloppert, and Beversdorf (2007)</xref> in which they found that youth clubs for adolescents with ASD helped foster positive social interactions with other students. As a whole, these studies suggest that specially designed individualized activities can be very important in helping adolescents with ASD develop social relationships with typically developing peers.</p>
<p>It is also interesting to note that some of the procedures used in this intervention relate to key components of Pivotal Response Treatment as they relate to motivation. For example, variables such as incorporating highly preferred activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1098300712437043">Koegel, Dyer, &amp; Bell, 1987</xref>), priming or prior experience with activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098300712437043">Gengoux, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098300712437043">Koegel, Koegel, Frea, &amp; Green-Hopkins, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1098300712437043">Zanolli, Daggett, &amp; Adams, 1996</xref>), and using natural and direct reinforcers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1098300712437043">Koegel, Koegel, Harrower, &amp; Carter, 1999</xref>) may also be important in motivating adolescents with ASD. These components, used in combination, have been shown to produce particularly large effects for improving social communication and socialization, and these variables have been shown to encourage participation, engagement, and generalization to other settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1098300712437043">Koegel &amp; Koegel, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>It may also be important to note that while there was an adult facilitator at these clubs, the clubs were mostly mediated by peers (i.e., students did most of the talking, as well as directing of the club activities). This may be especially important, as research has shown that peer-mediated interventions promote positive development of friendships and also have the greatest potential to exhibit generalization outside of the clubs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1098300712437043">Chan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1098300712437043">Christopher, Nangle, &amp; Hansen, 1993</xref>). Anecdotally, Participant 1 had never been invited to hang out with a typically developing peer nor had he received a birthday invitation from a peer until he participated in the club designed around his perseverative interest (i.e., Movie Trivia Club). However, during the course of this study, he received multiple invitations to hang out and invitations to birthday parties from typically developing peers who also participated in the same club. The fact that the lunch clubs were peer mediated may have facilitated the formation of friendships for Participant 1, leading to these peer interactions outside of school. Similarly, Participant 2 may have also benefited from the clubs being peer mediated as reflected by his generalization of social behaviors to his second and third schools.</p>
<p>Although research suggests that children and adolescents with ASD have a difficult time developing and maintaining friendships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1098300712437043">Attwood, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1098300712437043">Knott, Dunlop, &amp; Mackay, 2006</xref>), these individuals appear to yearn for such relationships with peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1098300712437043">Kasari &amp; Rotheram-Fuller, in press</xref>). This study demonstrated that creating a club centered on the adolescent’s perseverative interest provided a common ground on which significantly improved social interactions (between adolescents with ASD and typically developing students) could be formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1098300712437043">Cohen, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1098300712437043">Feld, 1982</xref>). From a theoretical point of view, these idiosyncratic interests may be powerful positive reinforcers for adolescents with ASD and provide them with a context to engage appropriately with peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1098300712437043">Charlop, Kurtz, &amp; Casey, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1098300712437043">Wolery, Kirk, &amp; Gast, 1985</xref>). Furthermore, the results of this study also demonstrated that once intervention began, the participants were able to quickly stay engaged with peers and make spontaneous and unprompted initiations. Similar studies that studied effective social clubs in the school environment have found parallel effects, where once intervention began, the participants showed a sudden increase in appropriate social interactions with typically developing peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1098300712437043">Baker et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1098300712437043">Koegel et al., in press</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, it may be important to note that this study focused on an age group that is often teased, bullied, and socially isolated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1098300712437043">Bauminger &amp; Shulman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1098300712437043">Knott et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1098300712437043">Lasgaard et al., 2010</xref>) and that the intervention was altered only slightly from ongoing extracurricular activities that were previously occurring at the schools. However, by incorporating the individualized interest of the adolescent with ASD, immediate improvements in socialization occurred. Social interventions for adolescents are greatly lacking in the literature, and future research addressing interventions that improve the socialization of adolescents and the generalized effects of these interventions is most certainly needed and likely to be productive.</p>
<p>Although the results of this study generally indicated improved social behavior as an outcome of the intervention, there were some limitations to this study. For example, because Participant 3’s initiations decreased by the sixth session, this may suggest a slightly weaker and unstable improvement for this participant, or it may suggest that medication may have confounded the results. Future studies in this area may be important to conduct. Another limitation to our study was the lack of generalization measures for our participants. Anecdotally, however, Participant 1 has maintained his friendship with peers he has met from the SSO and has met with his newly obtained friends outside of the school setting. Furthermore, as the facilitators were all undergraduate psychology majors, there is a slight possibility that the results were achieved because of the facilitators’ relatively high level of sophistication compared to many playground aides. Future research focused on aide qualification and training may be important. It may also be important to conduct future research aimed at accessing and measuring the duration and significance of the new friendships formed through such social clubs. Overall, the present research suggests optimism in developing friendships for adolescents with autism, and future research and practice in this area may be especially important.</p>
