<abstract>
<p>In a context of international economic uncertainty and uneven domestic economic performance, labour market outcomes showed considerable diversity. Wide-ranging outcomes in employment numbers, patterns of full-time and part-time work, labour utilization, and changes in earnings were evident both across and within industries. Men’s full-time employment appears to be one labour market area that is experiencing particular decline as casualization of the workforce continues and men’s traditional industries of employment experience subdued economic growth. Women’s employment appears to be faring relatively well in terms of growth, but large and persistent gender pay gaps remain evident in particular feminized industries, including financial and insurance services and health and social assistance. Predictions made earlier this decade that population ageing might ensure relative stability in employment among younger workers have not yet been fulfilled. Younger workers continue to experience relatively high levels of unemployment and underutilization, with the immediate employment experiences of younger men being relatively unfavourable compared with younger women in the workforce.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0022185612442281" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>By the end of 2011, international concerns dominated media discussions about the economic context in which Australian firms and labour operated. Expectations of a second global financial crisis were fuelled by heightened concerns about European sovereign debt default risks. Greece was increasingly at risk of defaulting and Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Italy were also considered at risk. Australia, however, continued to benefit from the surge in growth in Asia and its associated demand for resources. Notwithstanding the wealth effect from strong terms of trade, consumers remained cautious and national spending modest. By the middle of the year, fears of rising inflation began to ebb, allowing the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to cut interest rates in both November and December in an effort to boost demand in struggling trade-exposed sectors such as manufacturing and tourism.</p>
<p>As Australia undergoes structural shifts underpinned by continued strong demand for mineral and energy resources, some commentators have begun to question the downsides of the mining boom. Some warn of the Dutch disease (a term used to refer to the Netherlands’ experience of declining manufacturing following the discovery of natural gas and an associated surge in the terms of trade). Others believe this to be an unprecedented opportunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022185612442281"><italic>Deloitte</italic>, 2011</xref>). Whether one agrees with the discussion of the Dutch disease or a two-speed economy, there is little doubt that the outcomes in Australia’s labour markets are far from consistent across all sectors or industries. Instead, movements in employment and wages outcomes varied between industries, with some showing ongoing steady growth and other labour market areas experiencing anything from strong growth to declining employment and wage outcomes.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0022185612442281"><title>Macroeconomic Context 2011</title>
<p>An overview of key macroeconomic indicators provides insights into some of the specific challenges facing labour markets throughout the year. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022185612442281">Table 1</xref> lists selected key macroeconomic indicators for 2010–2011, including Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth, Consumer Price Index (CPI), interest rate, retail turnover, housing approvals and business investment.

<p>Annual growth in GDP in the year to June 2011 was a relatively low 1.4%, suggesting a drop in aggregate economic activity from the 3.3% recorded in the previous year and a significant drop from the 4.3% recorded in the 12 months preceding the financial crisis of September 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022185612442281">ABS, 2011a</xref>). The growth rate of 1.2% in the June 2011 quarter may provide some optimism for a trend towards an increase in activity, although, as mentioned earlier, considerable international uncertainty makes it difficult to predict future developments in this area.</p>
<p>Modest GDP growth was accompanied by an annual increase in the CPI of 3.5%, higher than the 2.8% recorded for the same period last year. This was accompanied by two reductions in the RBA’s official interest rates of 25 points in November and December, taking the cash rate to 4.25% at the end of 2011. Turnover in the retail sector remained relatively subdued but was higher than 2010 indicators, while motor vehicle sales and business investment showed some improvements. Approvals for dwelling units declined by 12.0% in the year to September 2011. This decline followed a decline 11.6% in the previous year and represents a strong contrast with predictions over recent years for high housing demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022185612442281">Lawless, 2011</xref>). The lack of consistency across all these broad indicators suggests uneven outcomes across the economy. This is a theme that is mirrored in Australian labour market indicators, to which we now turn.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0022185612442281"><title>Employment Outcomes – Australia 2011</title>
<p>Despite some areas of modest growth in specific macroeconomic indicators, aggregate unemployment rose slightly from 5.2% to 5.3% over the year to October 2011, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022185612442281">Table 2</xref>. Men seeking full-time work were a major factor reflected in this increase. In the year to October 2011, the number of men seeking full-time work increased by 12.3%, compared with 0.4% among women. Employment growth was evident among women, with overall growth in employment numbers of 1.6% reflecting similar rates of growth in both women’s full-time and part-time employment. In contrast, a 0.1% increase in the number of men employed reflected a decline in the number of men employed part time and only modest growth of 0.3% in the number of men employed full time.

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022185612442281">Table 3</xref> provides a summary of unemployment rates by state, age and sex at November 2011 and shows that total unemployment is relatively low in Western Australia, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). Male unemployment rates of 5.6% and 5.7% are considerably higher than the comparable female rates of 4.9% and 4.9% in South Australia and Tasmania, respectively. Unemployment rates among 15 to 24 year olds are more than double the national average for all persons, and we consider this section of the workforce later in this article. Unemployment rates among young males are higher than for young females, reflecting higher male unemployment rates among men in the workforce generally.

<p>The contrasting employment growth among men and women is likely to be the result of very different patterns of employment in the industry sectors in which their employment is concentrated. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022185612442281">Table 4</xref> shows the total change in the number of employees by industry and the shift <italic>within</italic> each industry, in the year to August 2011, of the proportion of men and women employed full time and part time. This, for example, shows that there was an overall increase of 14.05% in the number of employees working in the mining industry. Within this overall increase, there was a shift of 1.55 percentage points in the proportion of the mining workforce who are females working part time and a corresponding small decline in the number of men and women working full time and the number of men working part time.

<p>Full-time men’s employment as a percentage of overall industry employment declined in nine industries: Mining; Electricity, gas, water and waste services; Construction; Wholesale trade; Accommodation and food services; Information, media and telecommunications; Finance and insurance services; Administrative and support services; and Arts and recreation services. In some industries, growth in the number of employees suggests that while the share of industry employment undertaken by male full-time workers may have declined, the number of full-time male employees may have increased. This is the case with the mining industry, for example. In other industries, however, the decline in the share of employment in men’s full-time work has been accompanied by a decline in the overall number of employees. Such industries include: Electricity, gas, water and waste services; Wholesale trade; and Information, media and telecommunications. These industries employ a larger proportion of men than women and appear to be part of the shift away from men’s full-time employment across the economy.</p>
<p>In terms of employee numbers, the fastest-growing industries, with at least 5% increases, were: Mining; Arts and recreation services; Finance and insurance services; Administrative and support services; and Accommodation and food services. The two smallest of the industries in terms of employee numbers, ‘Mining’ and ‘Arts and recreation services’, have a majority of male employees, while the three larger industries have relatively feminized workforces. In contrast, the largest overall reductions in employment numbers were in ‘Agriculture, forestry and fishing’, ‘Manufacturing’ and ‘Construction’, each of which have men as a majority of employees. Again, this is a factor contributing to women’s relatively better aggregate employment outcomes (discussed earlier).</p>
<p>Despite the apparent shift away from men’s full-time employment, labour underutilization among both men and women remained relatively stable from August 2010 to August 2011, dropping just 0.1% overall (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0022185612442281">Table 5</xref>). Thus, the increase in male unemployment and relative decline in male full-time employment noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022185612442281">Table 1</xref> have not translated into a similar increase in underutilization.

<p>The relatively stable rates of underutilization might be related to recent increases in the average number of hours worked since August 2009, when average hours among both full-time and part-time employees reached their lowest level since August 2004 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0022185612442281">Table 6</xref>). This might suggest that most men in employment consider their hours to be sufficient and thus those in employment are not contributing to higher rates of underutilization through a wish to work more hours.

<sec id="sec5-0022185612442281"><title>Changes in Average Weekly Earnings of Persons Employed Full Time</title>
<p>Despite the ongoing and growing importance of part-time employment among men and women, our knowledge of wage outcomes in Australia’s labour markets is limited to data relevant to full-time employees. Our focus on the earnings of persons employed full time stems from the relative lack of regular timely data on hourly earnings for both part-time and full-time employees. While the Household Income and Labour Dynamics Australia (HILDA) survey includes some data for hourly earnings of both part- and full-time employees, a lag of almost one year between the completion of fieldwork and the release of data make this data more appropriate for the examination of longer-term trends rather than annual reviews.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022185612442281">1</xref></sup> In order to make some comparison of earnings between 2010 and 2011, we use full-time earnings data and assume that these reflect wages for a relatively constant number of hours worked by full-time employees throughout this period. Given the ongoing shift from full-time to part-time employment across a range of industries, the focus on full-time earnings continues to provide evidence for a partial and declining sector of the workforce. This is an important limitation of earnings data.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0022185612442281">Table 7</xref> lists percentage changes in average weekly ordinary time earnings (AWOTE) and total earnings for men and women full-time employees between August 2010 and August 2011, according to industry of employment. Again, there is no clear pattern of change across industries. Instead, changes in earnings ranged from a high of a 14.6% increase among women employees in the ‘Wholesale trade’ sector to a decline of −3.4% among women in ‘Administrative and support services’. In this context, it is difficult to attach a specific interpretation of an average increase in ordinary time earnings of 5.7% for men and 4.4% for women, as only a small number of industries had earnings changes close to these levels.

<p>One of the key difficulties with comparing annual average earnings data is that it does not account for possible changes in the composition of the workforce. We consider this issue further later, by examining wage price index (WPI) data, which address this issue. However, one of the disadvantages of WPI data is that they do not allow for comparisons between men’s and women’s wages growth and, in this regard, average wage rates demonstrate some interesting contrasts. In the ‘Health care and social assistance’ industry, men’s ordinary time earnings increased by 10.9% during the year to August 2011, while women’s increased by a considerably lower 4.4%. While the percentages are much lower, men’s earnings in the ‘Finance and insurance services’ industry increased by 3.2%, again more than double the increase in women’s average earnings of 1.4%. In other industries, the reverse was true, with women’s average ordinary time earnings growing faster than men’s, such as in ‘Retail trade’ (7.2% compared with 0.3%), ‘Accommodation and food services’ (5.9% compared with 2.9%) and ‘Other services’ (6.3% compared with −0.3%). The lack of consistency across industries suggests that analysis and policy based on national average earnings data for all industries are likely to neglect important differences between and within specific industry sectors. The AWOTE data provided earlier are adequate for identifying possible contrasts between different industries, but also reinforce the need for further detailed industry-level data and analysis.</p>
<p>An example of the need for detailed analysis within specific sections of the labour market was perhaps most evident in the equal remuneration case held before Fair Work Australia in 2011. In this case, historical, social, political and economic factors were all shown to be relevant factors in the patterns of work and pay among social and community care workers. In a context of changing patterns of working hours and diverse wage outcomes, there is an apparent need for detailed industry- and sub-industry-level data and analysis. This, rather than the percentage changes, might be one of the key conclusions to be drawn from the data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0022185612442281">Table 7</xref>.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, ordinary time wages growth for women in the private sector has been relatively lower than that for men in the private sector and among public sector employees. In the year to August 2011 this has altered, with private sector earnings among women working full time increasing by 4.4%, the same percentage change as for men and relatively close to the 4.7% and 4.5% experienced by full-time public sector employees (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0022185612442281">Table 8</xref>).

For example, if the profile of employees within an industry had shifted towards those with greater industry experience or education, then the increased average earnings may reflect a shift in the characteristics of employees rather than an increase in pay for employees with a stable set of characteristics. The WPI is designed to address such compositional issues.</p>
<p>The industry WPI data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-0022185612442281">Table 10</xref> demonstrate some differences in the changes of earnings suggested by average earnings data. For example, the growth rates of ordinary time earnings of full-time workers in the ‘Wholesale trade’ sector (11.4% for men and 14.6% for women) are relatively high compared with the ‘Wholesale trade’ industry’s WPI of 6.2. Similarly, the increases in average earnings among men and women in ‘Health care and social assistance’ (10.9% and 4.4%, respectively) give a different perspective than the 3.8% increase in WPI. Again, however, there is considerable variability between industries and the average of 4.7%. In general, however, the WPI data suggest that the average earnings data for full-timers shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0022185612442281">Table 7</xref> are not indicative of the increases in wage costs being borne by employers in the relevant industries, but reflect other factors such as compositional change in their workforces.

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-0022185612442281">Table 10</xref> also contains information about the GWR for each industry in August 2009 and August 2011. While the overall respective GWRs of 82.5% and 82.1% for the two years show relatively little change, there were considerable variations within industry GWRs during this period. In relatively lower-paid, feminized industries such as ‘Retail trade’ and ‘Accommodation and food services’ there were relatively large increases in the GWR of 11.2 and 4.9 percentage points, respectively. In contrast, there were declines of 3.8 and 4.5 percentage points in ‘Finance and insurance services’ and ‘Transport, postal and warehousing’, respectively. In August 2011 there is considerable variability, ranging from 66.7% in the ‘Finance and insurance services’ industry to 95.7% in ‘Retail trade’. Such ‘raw’ estimates fail to take into account differences that might be due to factors such as different occupations, levels of education and experience, and other factors that might be expected to influence individuals’ earnings. However, it is perhaps noteworthy that industries such as ‘Mining’ and ‘Construction’, sometimes associated with gender wage gaps, have comparatively favourable ratios compared with the more highly feminized ‘Finance and insurance services’ and ‘Health care and social assistance’ industries. As shown earlier, these industries also demonstrated both a growth in their overall number of employees (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022185612442281">Table 4</xref>) and much larger increases in the average earnings of male employees compared with females (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0022185612442281">Table 7</xref>). In addition, there appears to be considerable scope for further detailed study to understand the development and persistence of gaps in these and other industries. As with all areas of labour market analysis, this could be facilitated by the ready availability of regular and systematic collections of hourly earnings data together with other labour market data.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0022185612442281"><title>Minimum Wage Decision 2011</title>
<p>In a context of widely diverging patterns of wage outcomes, it appears likely that those with relatively low bargaining power may become relatively more reliant on minimum wage decisions in order to maintain some relativity with the other sections of the labour market. The Wage Review Panel (WRP) of Fair Work Australia ruled that from 1 July 2011, the national minimum wage should be increased from AUD$569.90 per 38-hour week (AUD$15.00 per hour) to AU$589.30 (AU$15.51 per hour). Despite the relative unevenness of economic outcomes across the economy, the WRP perceived that Australia’s relatively favourable economic context meant that a uniform percentage increase in award wage rates was warranted:<disp-quote>
<p>Labour productivity is growing, the profit share remains at historically high levels and underlying inflation is well within the RBA’s medium-term target band. Employment is growing, unemployment is reducing and labour force participation remains high. In the circumstances a significant increase is appropriate which will improve the real value of award wages and assist the living standards of the low paid. We have adopted a uniform percentage increase. The increase in modern award minimum wages we have decided on is 3.4 per cent. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185612442281">Fair Work Australia, 2011</xref>)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The WRP’s 2011 decision to award a percentage increase rather than a dollar increase contrasted with its 2010 decision to award a flat dollar increase. In making this decision, the WRP referred to the compression of wage relativities and lower rewards to skill acquisition that arose from the implementation of flat dollar increases. Loss of relativity with non-award-reliant employees was also cited as a reason for awarding a percentage increase in award rates. Submissions that argued for deferring an increase due to either economic conditions or the natural disaster of cyclone Yasi in Queensland were also rejected on the basis that Australia’s economic performance, while uneven, was ‘quite positive’.</p>
<p>The 3.4% minimum wage increase was granted in the context of a CPI in the year to June 2011 of 3.6% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022185612442281">ABS, 2011b</xref>) and an increase in average weekly ordinary time adult earnings in the year to May 2011 of 4.3% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022185612442281">ABS, 2011h</xref>). It would therefore appear that those reliant solely on award minimum rates of pay would not retain the real value of their wages and would be unlikely to retain relativity with those on other forms of agreement. In comparison, the average annualized wage increase was 4.0% for all industries under federal wage agreements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022185612442281">Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (DEEWR), 2011</xref>). This was the same estimated increase for single enterprise non-greenfield agreements, the largest category of agreement (in terms of number of employees covered). Other forms of agreement had estimated increases ranging from 1.5% to 5.1%, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table11-0022185612442281">Table 11</xref>, although the majority of employees covered by federal wage agreements received increases in excess of the 3.4% increase granted to minimum wage workers.

</p>
<p>While the implementation of a percentage increase and the recognition of the historically high profit share were significant developments in 2011, it is also the case that the Annual Wage Review was somewhat overshadowed by the Equal Remuneration Case initiated early in 2011. The Equal Remuneration Case was initiated in March 2010 by five unions representing social and community services (SACS) employees. The unions submitted an application to Fair Work Australia (FWA) seeking an equal remuneration order under section 2.7 of the Fair Work Act 2009, which gives the authority to ‘make any order it considers appropriate to ensure that, for employees to whom the order will apply, there will be equal remuneration for work of equal or comparable value’. The claim might be broadly described as encompassing two sets of related arguments. The first set argued that SACS employees are predominantly women and that SACS work is undervalued with regard to the nature of the work and the skills and responsibilities involved in performing the work. A second set argued that specific historical and institutional factors have contributed to the ongoing undervaluation of work by SACS employees. Relevant factors included the competitive tendering processes used by governments for providing the funds used to pay the wages of SACS employees and the history of wage regulation in the sector. A decision handed down on 16 May 2011 acknowledged the importance of both these arguments for wages in the sector and the need for further submissions to determine the appropriate quantum of possible wage increases. In November 2011, the Commonwealth Government announced that it would participate in a joint submission to FWA with the relevant unions and provide additional funding of AUD$2b to facilitate payment of increased wages as determined by FWA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022185612442281">Prime Minister of Australia Press Office, 2011</xref>). This case was an important development that is likely to have ongoing implications in specific areas of Australia’s labour markets and is discussed in detail by Meagher and Cortis (2012, this issue).</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec7-0022185612442281"><title>Younger Workers in the Labour Market</title>
<p>Earlier this decade, it was suggested that young workers (15–24 years old) would be increasingly in demand and that ‘No longer is it purely the case of employees selling themselves to employers; the situation has flipped to an extent’ (Rich, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022185612442281">Tresize-Brown, 2004</xref>: 1). One of the distinguishing features of younger workers’ employment is the prevalence of part-time work. Over the last two decades, there has been a shift towards higher levels of part-time work among young workers, older men and women of prime age (25–44 years old), such that part-time work now accounts for one-third of all jobs. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table12-0022185612442281">Table 12</xref>, part-time work is an important source of employment among younger workers, with 39% of young men and 56% of young women working on a part-time basis. For many, this might be the result of combining paid work with other activities such as education. Employment among young workers is concentrated in the ‘Retail trade’ and ‘Accommodation and food services’ industries, which together account for over 40% of employees aged between 15 and 24 years old. The ‘Health care and social assistance’ and ‘Manufacturing’ industries account for approximately 7% of employment of young workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022185612442281">ABS, 2011g</xref>). Perhaps because of the concentration of young employees in feminized sectors, the patterns of recent employment growth are markedly different for young men and women. The number of young women employed both full time and part time grew in the year to October 2011 by 2.2% and 3.7%, respectively. In contrast, the number of young men employed full time declined by 2.2% and part-time employment fell by 1.6%.

<p>There is limited data available on average earnings for younger workers. However, their concentration in traditionally low-paying industries suggests that minimum wage rates for junior employees provide some indication of earnings among younger employees. Junior award rates and apprenticeship rates relevant to younger workers are also likely to represent substantially lower rates than the comparable adult wages.</p>
<p>Despite predictions from earlier this decade, the outlook for younger employees in the current and foreseeable economic context looks relatively subdued, particularly for younger men. The industries in which they are largely employed are those experiencing subdued growth and are largely feminized. The continued unemployment and underutilization of the younger workforce in a context of specific current and predicted skill shortages is an area worthy of further investigation.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-0022185612442281" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Uncertainties in both international and domestic economic contexts have contributed to diverse outcomes across Australia’s labour markets. There are clear signs of employment and earnings growth in the mining sector, which continues to benefit from strong regional demand. In other industries there is no clear pattern, although full-time employment for men appears to be declining as a result of both increasing casualization in the workforce and low rates of employment growth in traditionally male industries such as ‘Manufacturing’ and ‘Construction’. In comparison, women’s employment numbers are growing, although persistent gender pay gaps remain evident. Predictions made earlier this decade that population ageing might ensure relative stability in employment among younger workers have not yet been fulfilled. Younger workers continue to experience relatively high levels of unemployment and underutilization, with the immediate employment experiences of younger men being relatively unfavourable compared with younger women in the workforce.</p></sec>
