<abstract>
<p>The immune properties of breastmilk are the most effective preventative means of reducing infant mortality through both passive and active immunity. Breastmilk for term infants has been linked to decreased incidence of respiratory and ear infections and gastrointestinal distress. This protection is even more important for the preterm infant. Prematurity is one of the leading causes of infant death in the United States. Hospitalized infant outcomes associated with consumption of breastmilk are shorter length of stay and decreased incidence of nosocomial infections and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). The presence of nosocomial infections and necrotizing enterocolitis increases risk of preterm mortality and morbidity as well as healthcare expenditures. However, breastmilk immunological components such as secretory immunoglobulin A, lactoferrin (LFT), and cytokines provide a framework of immunity that, in conjunction with nutritional support, significantly improves neonatal health. The relationship between maternal characteristics and breastmilk immune properties is central to further the understanding of the impact of breastmilk on preterm infant morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this article is to review the numerous immune components in breastmilk, the moderators of the immune components, and the relevance of these components to preterm/infant health. Exploration of the complexity of breastmilk immune components may direct future development of interventions to improve and sustain the immunological benefits of preterm breastmilk.</p>

<p>Breastmilk is abundant with immune factors produced through the biological mechanisms of evolution as well as communication between the immune systems of mother and infant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1099800411400064">Labbock, Clark, &amp; Goldman, 2004</xref>). In addition, breastmilk promotes colonization of the gastrointestinal tract with commensal organisms that facilitate intestinal function and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1099800411400064">Wold &amp; Adlerberth, 2000</xref>).Use of breast milk has been linked to a 34% decreased incidence of respiratory infection in the first 6 months of life for infants fed breastmilk versus those fed formula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1099800411400064">Beaudry, Dufour, &amp; Marcoux, 1995</xref>). Additional overall health benefits of breastmilk include fewer ear infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1099800411400064">Duffy, Faden, Wasielewski, Wolf, &amp; Krystofik, 1997</xref>), decreased incidence of gastrointestinal distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1099800411400064">Stephans et al., 2006</xref>) as well as prolonged protection against infection through active stimulation of the infant’s immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1099800411400064">Oddy, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The very-low-birth-weight preterm infant is particularly at risk for nosocomial infections and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), an inflammation of the bowel that can be fatal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1099800411400064">Lawrence &amp; Pane, 2007</xref>). Many of the immunological components in breastmilk decrease the risk for development of nosocomial infections and NEC in the very-low-birth-weight infant, including secretory IgA (sIgA), lactoferrin (LFT), and cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1099800411400064">Labbock et al., 2004</xref>). These agents provide antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory protection for the neonate.</p>
<p>Researchers have reported that maternal health, maternal environment, maternal psychosocial experiences, and infant gestation correlate with levels of immune components in mother’s milk. The purpose of this article is to review the numerous immune components in breastmilk, the moderators of the immune components, and the relevance of these components to preterm-infant health. Exploration of the complexity of breastmilk immune components may direct future development of interventions to improve and sustain the immunological benefits of preterm breastmilk.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>The mammary gland begins development in the 4th week of gestation as corridors of thickened epithelial cells navigate from groin to axilla in the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1099800411400064">Riordan, 2005</xref>). By Weeks 7 and 8, these corridors of thickened cells grow inward into the chest wall and continue to develop as mammary buds. The buds form a treelike pattern known as alveoli which become the basic units of mature glandular tissue. The mature mammary gland contains three major units that synergistically work together to produce and eject breastmilk: the alveoli, myoepithelial cells, and the ductules. The alveolus is the milk secreting unit, which is surrounded by a wall of myoepithelial cells that contract to eject milk through the ductules by means of duct openings contained in the nipple.</p>
<p>The transition of the breast from early pregnancy through lactation is termed lactogenesis. In the first half of pregnancy, the breast undergoes physical changes to produce nutritional substance for the newborn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1099800411400064">Riordan, 2005</xref>). During the second half of pregnancy the breast glands swell with the accumulation of fat droplets within the epithelial cells of the alveoli. These fat droplets, along with increased plasma concentrations of lactose and α-lactalbumin, migrate across the cell membrane into the ductules. Colostrum is the collection of this secretory activity within the alveoli epithelial cells and contains much of the immunological protection for the neonate during the transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life.</p>
<p>All mammals are born with developmentally delayed immune systems; however, the timing and mode of compensation for these delays differ among species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1099800411400064">Goldman, 2002</xref>). There is an evolutionary relationship between placenta and immune response of the mammary gland that determines the amount and type of immunoglobulins (IgAs) in colostrums and later-stage breastmilk. Species such as horses, pigs, cows, sheep, and goats use colostrum to transfer the majority of the immunoglobulins necessary to protect the offspring. Conversely, rodents, pigs and rabbits, great apes, and humans utilize the placenta to transfer the greater proportion of immunoglobulins to the offspring. The majority of the mammary-gland immune components develop to protect the skin and mucosal portals in the infant. In humans, the predominant immune factor in milk is sIgA, whereas colostrum and later-stage milk of cows and pigs contains more immunoglobulin G. Thus the distinct immunological relationship between mother and offspring originates within the communication between placenta and fetus and is extended via breastmilk to defend overall infant health through the first year of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1099800411400064">Goldman, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1099800411400064">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1099800411400064">Labbock et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Breastmilk immune components function to compensate for the immature infant immune system, adapt the gastrointestinal tract to extrauterine life, prevent inflammation, provide antimicrobial defense, and establish commensal bacterial flora (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1099800411400064">Goldman, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1099800411400064">2007</xref>). Breastmilk is designed to support the deficiencies of the immature infant immune system with antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory components. Of the many components in breastmilk, sIgA, anti-inflammatory cytokines, and proimmune cytokines are most closely linked to preterm infant outcomes, but LFTs and lysozymes also function to protect the neonate. Secretory IgA provides a protective coating for the infant’s mucosa lining, preventing pathogens from adhering to or penetrating this surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1099800411400064">Brandtzaeg, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1099800411400064">Rodriguez, Miracle, &amp; Meier, 2005</xref>). Cytokines act as messengers to boost the neonatal immune system by communicating with other immune components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1099800411400064">Goldman, Chheda, Garofalo, &amp; Schmalstieg, 1996</xref>). LFTs damage the outer membrane of pathogens, providing antimicrobial protection. Lysozymes cause bacterial cell lysis and are resistant to breakdown during infant digestion. This framework of immunity acts in conjunction with nutritional support to encompass the neonate in an umbrella of protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1099800411400064">Goldman, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The mucosal lining, which has a surface area 200 times greater than the surface area of the skin, is a major portal of entry for pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1099800411400064">Lawrence &amp; Pane, 2007</xref>). This lining is responsible for defending the host against infection. It is estimated that over 90% of microorganisms infecting humans crosses over the mucosa, which increases the vulnerability of the immunologically immature neonate. The immunity provided by the immune components in breastmilk is moderated by maternal characteristics and activation of the mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1099800411400064">Brandtzaeg, 2003</xref>). The MALT pathway receptors in the mother are located in the tonsils, adenoids, and Peyers patches in the small intestine and appendix. Antigens that come in contact with the mother’s mucosa trigger immune responses in activated mucosal lymphoid cells with specific receptors for the antigens. The MALT response stimulates antigen-specific T and B lymphocytes that travel to various maternal mucosal sites, including the lactating breast. This adaptive system ensures that the infant receives the antibodies and products of activated immune components in breastmilk, which transfers antigen-specific immunity to the nursing infant. The communication between maternal and preterm infant environments may not always be plausible in the neonatal intensive care unit; however, skin-to-skin contact, known as kangaroo care, may provide the mechanism to activate the MALT pathway during infant hospitalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1099800411400064">Brooks &amp; Anderson, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The nutritional benefits of breastmilk for term and preterm infants has been well-reported, but the level of specific immunological breastmilk components for the term and preterm infant are less understood. The relationships between maternal characteristics and breastmilk immune properties are central to further the understanding of the impact of the immune properties of breastmilk on preterm infant health and mortality. Premature birth is the leading cause of infant death within the first month of life in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1099800411400064">March of Dimes, 2009</xref>). For the first month postdelivery, many premature infants are hospitalized in neonatal intensive care units where technology is used to improve infant survival; yet, the use of mother’s milk remains the most significant predictor of healthy growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1099800411400064">Meier, Engstrom, Patel, Jegier, &amp; Bruns, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1099800411400064">Rodriguez et al., 2005</xref>). The use of mother’s milk has been linked to shorter length of stay, decreased incidence of nosocomial infections, and decreased incidence of NEC for preterm infants as compared to the use of formula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1099800411400064">Bisquera, Cooper, &amp; Berseth, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1099800411400064">Hylander, Strobino, &amp; Dhanireddy, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1099800411400064">Leroyer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1099800411400064">Sullivan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1099800411400064">Wold &amp; Adlerberth, 2000</xref>). Nosocomial infections or NEC prolongs length of stay 5–22 days, increasing healthcare expenditures by $10,000–186,200 and increasing risk of mortality and morbidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1099800411400064">Bisquera et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1099800411400064">Leroyer et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>One question raised in the literature regarding immune properties of breastmilk is which immune factors of breastmilk are influenced by maternal health and/or maternal psychosocial well-being. Current research describes the relationships between maternal characteristics and the immunological properties of breastmilk and explores interventions to improve the immune factors of breastmilk (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1099800411400064">Table 1</xref>
). A potential guiding framework for furthering our understanding of the relationship between maternal psychosocial characteristics and breastmilk immune factors is a conceptual model based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1099800411400064">Lazarus and Folkman’s (1984)</xref> stress and coping model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1099800411400064">Figure 1</xref>
). The stress in the model derives from both the physical and the psychosocial experience of becoming the mother of a preterm infant, which includes stressors not typical for all new mothers. Mothers of hospitalized preterm infants must cope with physical separation from their infant, concerns over infant health, and provision of breastmilk using a mechanical pump, until the neonate can be successfully placed at the breast. The process of coping involves using realistic and flexible thoughts and actions to solve problems that impact the perceived stress of the lactating preterm mother, which then generates stress-related immune responses in the breastmilk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1099800411400064">Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1099800411400064">Witek-Janusek &amp; Mathews, 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>Associations Between Maternal Physical Characteristics and Breastmilk Immune Factors</title>
<p>Researchers report that gestational age at delivery and maternal health, age, and parity are the predominant mechanisms for variance in the production of sIgA in breastmilk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1099800411400064">Montagne, Cuilliere, Mole, Bene, &amp; Faure, 1999</xref>). Cytokines in breastmilk regulate and improve the function of the infant’s immune system through communication with the cells of the infant’s epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1099800411400064">Goldman et al., 1996</xref>). Breastmilk supports the neonate with its supply of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukins 4 (IL-4), 6 (IL-6), 8 (IL-8), and 10 (IL-10). The absence of IL-10 in breastmilk has been associated with adverse neonatal outcomes such as NEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1099800411400064">Fituch, Palkowetz, Goldman, &amp; Schanler, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1099800411400064">Goldman et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Duration of pregnancy is linked to levels of sIgA and cytokines in breastmilk during the early postpartum period. Using a longitudinal panel design, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1099800411400064">Araújo and colleagues (2005)</xref> compared total sIgA of breastmilk on Days 1, 4, 10, and 15 in term (<italic>n</italic> = 10) and preterm mothers (<italic>n</italic> = 10). Term milk had significantly lower amounts of sIgA (Day 1 = 2,835 ± 956 mg/dl; Day 15 = 88.4 ± 16.5 mg/dl) than preterm milk (Day 1 = 23,234 ± 13.6 mg/dl; Day 15 = 723.8 ± 563.3 mg/dl; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001). Preterm milk also showed a slower rate of decline in the amount of sIgA than term milk over the 15 days, illustrating the uniquely important role of breastmilk in the immunological protection of the neonate.</p>
<p>Preeclampsia is an excessive inflammatory response in the mother that often results in preterm birth. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1099800411400064">Erbağci and colleagues (2005)</xref> conducted a longitudinal panel study of immune factors in breastmilk from women who experienced preeclampsia (<italic>n</italic> = 15) compared to those of healthy pregnant women (<italic>n</italic> = 15).

<title>Associations of Ethnicity and Atopic Disease With Breastmilk Immune Factors</title>
<p>Levels of sIgA and cytokines in breastmilk have also been associated with maternal ethnicity, diet, and atopic disease. Past and present maternal environment may play a role in the immune properties of breastmilk. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1099800411400064">Ciardelli and colleagues (2007)</xref> conducted an investigation into whether women of various ethnic backgrounds produce differing amounts of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>–specific sIgA and cytokines in breastmilk associated with previous antigen exposure. Using a cross-sectional design, the authors compared sIgA, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 levels in breastmilk samples collected on postpartum Day 3 from term mothers residing in Italy from diverse ethnic backgrounds (Italy, <italic>n</italic> = 40; Eastern Europe, <italic>n</italic> = 24; Asia, <italic>n</italic> = 24, Africa, <italic>n</italic> = 24). All women from non-Italian descent had greater levels of immune factors in breastmilk than Italian women. Asian women had the highest IL-6 levels (2077 pg/ml ± 4680, <italic>p</italic> = .004) and highest sIgA levels (38.4 AU/ml ± 36.2, <italic>p</italic> = .007), whereas Eastern European women had the highest IL-8 levels (9483pg/ml ± 7699, <italic>p</italic> = .026). The authors used this comparative design to explore the possible influence of past antigen exposure on breastmilk immune components among the ethnically diverse sample, controlling for length of time in Italy, number of trips back home, environment, level of education, and work. Women from various locations are exposed to different environmental pathogens/antigens in their gut, which then stimulate B-cell immune activity that is transferred to the mammary gland resulting in breastmilk immune components specific to environment. The maternal enteric immune memory of past antigen exposure coupled with current immune exposure provides the infant with more comprehensive protection. However, the cross-sectional design limited the analysis due to the one-time measurement. Research has found that the levels of these immune factors change over time postdelivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1099800411400064">Araújo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1099800411400064">Erbağci et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1099800411400064">Fituch et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1099800411400064">Laiho and colleagues (2003)</xref> examined the association between nutritional components and inflammatory factors in breastmilk in mothers with allergic disease (AD; <italic>n</italic> = 43) and without (<italic>n</italic> = 51) by using a cross-sectional design to describe the ratio of fatty acids to cytokine concentrations of TNF-α, IL-4, IL-10, and TGF-β<sc>2</sc> in breastmilk. The investigators found a positive association between TGF-β2 and the proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids in breastmilk (σ = .29, <italic>p</italic> = .0038).

Breastmilk fatty acids may modulate the degree of proimmune and anti-inflammatory cellular immune response.</p>
<p>Future research should investigate whether nutritional composition of breastmilk can attenuate the immune properties of breastmilk resulting in better protection for the preterm infant.

<title>Effect of Stress on Breastmilk Immune Factors</title>
<p>There has been little research about the breastmilk immune factor response in mothers of preterm infants to separation, perceived stress, and coping with a hospitalized infant. Psychological variables such as stress and depression are correlated with the levels of sIgA and cytokines; however, the majority of research conducted thus far has focused on women delivering term infants.</p>
<p>Breastfeeding is as much an emotional experience as a physical one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1099800411400064">Kendal-Tackett, 2007</xref>). The psychoneuroimmunological pathway provides a framework for understanding the impact of emotional and physical stress on the mother’s cellular responses in breastmilk via neuroendocrine interactions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1099800411400064">Ader, Cohen, and Felten (1995)</xref> described the pathway as a system of biobehavioral-neural-endocrine-immune interactions. The pictorial presentation of the psychoneuroimmunological framework shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1099800411400064">Figure 4</xref>
 illustrates the biophysical responses to the potential stressors and supports of the preterm birth experience. Physiologic stressors such as maternal health, socioeconomic status (SES), infant health, and birth experience are individualized to situation and perception. New mothers perceive supports from family and other care providers differently depending on their individual personality factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1099800411400064">Taylor &amp; Aspinwall, 1996</xref>). Mothers with increased self-efficacy may perceive their potential supports as positive, which ultimately shapes adaptive coping responses such as role adjustment to motherhood, increased visitation/bonding with hospitalized infant, and improved lactation volume and quality.</p>

<p>One of the first nursing researchers to utilize the psychoneuroimmunology pathway as a guiding framework for research was Groër (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1099800411400064">Witek-Janusek &amp; Mathews, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1099800411400064">Groër, Humenick, and Hill (1994)</xref> conducted a study using a cross-sectional design to measure the differences in concentrations of breastmilk cortisol and sIgA and the relationship of these levels to psychosocial factors in term (<italic>n</italic> = 29) and preterm (<italic>n</italic> = 34) mothers by combining data from two different studies. They found significantly higher levels of sIgA in preterm versus term milk (<italic>t</italic> = 1.96, <italic>p</italic> = .05) and a significant inverse relationship between breastmilk cortisol and sIgA in both term (<italic>r</italic> = –.72, <italic>p</italic> = .0001) and preterm (<italic>r</italic> = –.35, <italic>p</italic> = .05) breastmilk. Anger and vigor were positively correlated with sIgA in preterm milk (anger: <italic>r =</italic> .20, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; vigor: <italic>r =</italic> .35, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), whereas breastfeeding satisfaction was inversely correlated with sIgA (<italic>r</italic> = –.51, <italic>p</italic> = .006). As the authors noted, limitations of this study included the singular collection point (Day 5), varied timing of the collection (early morning through evening), and varied psychometric measures between studies. The questions they raised, however, served as the foundation for future exploration of the impact of psychosocial variables on immune factors in breastmilk.</p>
<p>In lactating women, postpartum fatigue, a measurement of perceived stress, is a potentially powerful moderator of immune factors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1099800411400064">Groër and colleagues (2005)</xref> conducted a cross-sectional study to describe the relationship between neuroendocrine and immune responses in 119 women experiencing postpartum fatigue. Maternal fatigue was slightly correlated with symptoms of maternal infection (<italic>r</italic> = .215, <italic>p</italic> = .02), whereas mothers with greater sleepiness reported greater symptoms of maternal infections (<italic>r</italic> = .29, <italic>p</italic> = .002) and infant infections (<italic>r</italic> = .28, <italic>p</italic> = .002). The level of sIgA was associated with the level of prolactin (<italic>r</italic> = .56, <italic>p</italic> = .01) in breastmilk, and the level of serum prolactin was inversely related to depression. The physical and emotional stress due to lack of sleep in postpartum term mothers may impact the immune response of the breast by altering sIgA levels in breastmilk, however, the cross-sectional design of this study limits causation inference. Mothers of preterm infants are at high risk for perceived stress thus further research of maternal stress using preterm breastmilk would benefit our understanding of the relationship of immune components and preterm infant health.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1099800411400064">Groër and Morgan (2007)</xref> conducted a secondary analysis of the above cross-sectional dataset to compare biological and psychological differences between women categorized as depressed (<italic>n</italic> = 25) and not depressed (<italic>n</italic> = 169). Depressed women had more perceived stress and negative life events (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), lower serum prolactin levels (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), greater salivary cortisol levels (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), and lower serum levels of interferon-γ (INF-γ), which supports the premise that depression in postpartum women is associated with a downregulated hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenocortical axis and depresssed cellular immunity. Although breastmilk immune factors were not included in this analysis, the lower cellular immune activity in relation to depression and stress warrants further longitudinal exploration of preterm breastmilk immune factors, which ultimately affects preterm infant health.</p>

<title>Diet</title>
<p>The few intervention studies conducted to explore possible moderators of immune factors in breastmilk have reported inconsistent results. The postulation that immune factors in breastmilk can be modified with diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1099800411400064">Mayer, 2000</xref>) was the premise of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted in Japan on lactating women. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1099800411400064">Sakamoto and colleagues (2007)</xref> examined Total Mood Disturbance (TMD) scores, salivary amylase, and sIgA and LTF in breastmilk before and after a diet intervention of brown rice (<italic>n</italic> = 21) versus white rice (<italic>n</italic> = 20) in women who had been lactating for 2–11 months. The two groups were nonequivalent prior to the diet intervention in reported scores on individual parameters of the Profile of Mood State (POMS), with white rice consumers having higher scores than the brown rice consumers. Postintervention, TMD scores (11.5 ± 10–5.6 ± 8.9, <italic>p</italic> = .01) and sIgA levels (788 ± 498.7–893.2 ± 579.1 mg/L, <italic>p</italic> = .04) increased significantly in the brown rice consumers, whereas salivary amylase increased significantly (<italic>p</italic> = .02) in the white rice consumers postintervention. One variable that the investigators did not consider in this study is the intake of fish (containing ω3) among the Japanese. Omega 3 fats have been linked to decreased depression and improved proinflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1099800411400064">Kendal-Tackett, 2007</xref>). The results of this study concur with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1099800411400064">Ciardelli et al.

<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1099800411400064">Hawkes, Bryan, Makrides, Neumann, and Gibson (2002)</xref> examined the effect of the manipulation of dietary fatty acids on the production of cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α) in breastmilk using a double-blind RCT of lactating mothers who consumed a dietary supplement of 300 mg docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; <italic>n</italic> = 40), 600 mg DHA (<italic>n</italic> = 40), or oil containing placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 40) from Day 3 to the end of 12th week postpartum. The investigators collected breastmilk and peripheral blood samples during the 4th week postpartum. There were no differences in IL-6 or TNF-α of the breastmilk aqueous fraction between groups, nor were there significant correlations between levels of DHA and IL-6 or TNF-α in breastmilk. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1099800411400064">Laiho et al.

TGF-β2 is one of three TGF-β isoforms and is the most prevalent in breastmilk. The TGF-β isoforms are important in neonatal gut maturation and defend against orally ingested antigens; thus it potentially plays a role in the prevention of NEC. TNF-α enhances epithelial cell growth and is also important to neonatal intestinal health.</p>

<title>Stress Reduction and Exercise</title>
<p>To evaluate whether a stress reduction exercise increases the level of breastmilk sIgA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1099800411400064">O’Connor, Schmidt, Carroll-Pankhurst, and Olness (1998)</xref> conducted a quasi-experimental pre–post test trial of 38 lactating women at 4–6 weeks postpartum. The women were divided into three groups: relaxation training (<italic>n</italic> = 14), attention control (<italic>n</italic> = 15), and nonintervention (<italic>n</italic> = 9). Investigators collected breastmilk samples, demographics, and psychosocial variables preintervention and postintervention. There was no statistically significant difference in sIgA levels among groups, however, women reporting more stress between Visits 1 and 2 had increased levels of sIgA in breastmilk (+0.16 g/L, <italic>p</italic> = .03) compared to those reporting no stress (–0.09 g/L). This finding correlates with the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1099800411400064">Groër, Davis, and Steele (2004)</xref>, in which increased levels of sIgA were also associated with increased perceived stress.

Milk sIgA did not significantly correlate with exercise; however, there were significant correlations between calories expended and various levels of cytokines in breastmilk (IL-17 [<italic>r</italic> = .33, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .019], IFN-γ [<italic>r</italic> = .34, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .017], IL- 1β [<italic>r</italic> = .43, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .006], IL-2 [<italic>r</italic> = .31, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .03]). Moderate-to-vigorous exercise that expends calories may influence the proimmune cytokine levels in breastmilk, suggesting a danger signal response of the mother’s immune system within the mammary gland.

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In summary, investigators have conducted little research on preterm breastmilk. They have explored associations of levels of sIgA in breastmilk with maternal characteristics. Greater levels of sIgA are associated with anger and vigor in preterm mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1099800411400064">Araújo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1099800411400064">Groër et al., 1994</xref>), whereas increased levels of sIgA in the breastmilk of term mothers is associated with higher levels of perceived stress, anger, maternal infection, and dietary consumption of brown rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1099800411400064">Groër, Davis, &amp; Steele, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1099800411400064">Groër et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1099800411400064">Sakamoto et al., 2007</xref>). The moderators for levels of proimmune cytokines such as ILβ, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, and TNF-α and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10, TGF<italic>-</italic>β2 are not well understood in preterm breastmilk; however, the balance among these breastmilk cytokines is vital to neonatal intestinal integrity and health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1099800411400064">Field, 2005</xref>). Understanding the effect of maternal stress from the preterm birth experience on expression of breastmilk immune components is key to understanding the quality of preterm mothers’ breastmilk and ultimate immune protection of the neonate.</p>
<p>Studies using a longitudinal design will best address the influence of maternal physical and psychological characteristics on preterm breastmilk immune factors over the first 30 days postpartum. In the studies we reviewed above, the instruments used to measure perceived stress were not consistent, nor were biological measurements of stress. Future investigations would benefit from the use of a perceived stress instrument as well as the use of biomarkers such as salivary cortisol to describe the relationship of biobehavioral stress and preterm milk immune components. Examination of the relationship between stress and breastmilk immune components of mothers of hospitalized preterm infants is essential as their experiences of adjusting to a preterm birth add another layer of stress to the postpartum period. Perceived control or lack of control over a stressful situation mediates the psychoneuroimmunological pathway, possibly altering cellular immune response in the mother’s milk. Exploration of these complicated relationships should be conducted to lay the foundation for interventional studies.</p>
<p>Clarifying the moderators of preterm breastmilk immune factors would further the understanding of the synergistic relationship between mother, environment (physical and psychosocial), and preterm infant so that researchers and clinicians could identify and implement targeted interventions to optimize breastmilk quality in these mothers. Improved neonatal health and mortality through enhanced quality of breastmilk would help to reduce the lifelong complications for preterm infants that can have a large impact on the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1099800411400064">Goldman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1099800411400064">Rodriguez et al., 2005</xref>). Exploring these biomarkers in preterm breastmilk will open avenues to improve the immunological properties of this irreplaceable resource. The first 30 days of a neonate’s life are predictive of long-term morbidity and mortality. The quality of breastmilk, which contains both nutritional and immunological components, remains the most important variable to reducing infant morbidity and mortality worldwide.</p>
