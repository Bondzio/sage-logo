<p><italic>Objectives</italic>. Control of perioperative infection can increase the success rate of organ transplant. The incidence, clinical features, and optimal management of chronic otitis media (COM) in solid organ transplant recipients have not been adequately evaluated. We therefore assessed the incidence and clinical course of COM in solid-organ transplant recipients.</p>
<p><italic>Design</italic>. Case series with chart review.</p>
<p><italic>Setting</italic>. Tertiary referral center.</p>
<p><italic>Subjects and Methods</italic>. We reviewed the medical records of 3278 patients who underwent solid organ transplantations between February 1995 and December 2007 to identify those diagnosed with COM before and after transplant. We analyzed the long-term clinical course and management of COM in these patients.</p>
<p><italic>Results</italic>. Of 3278 solid organ transplant recipients, 65 (2.0%) were diagnosed with pretransplant COM with a perforated ear drum, including 31 liver, 28 renal, and 6 heart transplant recipients. The primary symptom was otorrhea, followed by hearing disturbance, otalgia, and tinnitus. Middle ear swab culture showed bacterial growth in 17 of the 40 patients (42.5%) with suppurative COM. Of these 40 patients, 14 underwent tympanomastoid surgery (operation group) and 26 were prescribed antibiotics (medication group). The remaining 25 patients, with dry perforated ear drums and well-pneumatized mastoids, were observed without treatment (observation group). After transplantation, the incidence of otorrhea was significantly lower in the operation group (11.1%) than in either the medication (26.9%) or observation (26.7%) group (<italic>P</italic> = .040, .048, respectively).</p>
<p><italic>Conclusions</italic>. Precise diagnosis and proper surgical intervention for COM may reduce the rate of otorrhea and exacerbation of COM in solid organ transplant recipients.</p>

<body>
<p>Solid organ transplantation is a therapeutic option for many human diseases, and liver, kidney, heart, and lung transplantation have become standard therapies for selected end-stage diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599811433276">1</xref></sup> Infection is the most common life-threatening complication of long-term immunosuppressive therapy required by organ transplant recipients, making the prevention and effective management of infection after transplantation important.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811433276">2</xref></sup> The increased numbers of immunosuppressed patients showing prolonged survival has led to increases in the incidence and spectrum of opportunistic infections among these individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599811433276">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599811433276">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Chronic otitis media (COM) is associated with inflammatory changes of the middle ear and mastoid along with a perforated tympanic membrane. Subclinical COM in immunosuppressed organ transplant recipients can result in life-threatening complications, such as meningoencephalitis, intracranial abscess, sigmoid sinus thrombosis, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage, along with transplantation failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599811433276">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The impairment of inflammatory responses induced by immunosuppressive agents in organ transplant recipients can attenuate the signs and symptoms of invasive infection. This may make it difficult to determine whether to treat a transplant recipient for COM in the absence of otological symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599811433276">6</xref></sup> Therefore, the prevention or successful management of COM could decrease the postoperative morbidity in a patient who is immunocompromised. To our knowledge, no optimal treatment of COM in such patients has yet been described, nor has the impact of COM on patient and graft survival been evaluated.</p>
<p>Our hypothesis was that early diagnosis and aggressive surgical intervention for COM in solid organ transplant recipients may reduce the rate of posttransplant otorrhea and exacerbation of COM. We analyzed the clinical characteristics and treatment of COM in patients who were immunosuppressed after solid organ transplantation. The main purpose of this study was to assess the clinical findings, therapeutic methods, results, and prognoses of patients with pretransplant and posttransplant COM. Our findings will suggest a standard of care to guide the prophylactic assessment and treatment of COM during the peritransplantation period.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-0194599811433276">
<title>Patient Selection</title>
<p>We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 3278 patients who underwent solid organ transplantation between February 1995 and December 2007 at the Asan Medical Center in Seoul, Korea, to identify patients diagnosed with COM before or after transplantation. The clinical manifestations, treatment modalities, and clinical courses in these patients were recorded. Patients who underwent bone marrow transplantation and those diagnosed with COM after solid organ transplantation were excluded, as were patients with underlying immune deficiency conditions, including autoimmune diseases, AIDS, neutropenia, and infection with immunomodulating viruses.</p>
<p>The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Asan Medical Center.</p>
<sec id="section3-0194599811433276">
<title>Pretransplantation protocol</title>
<p>All patients scheduled to undergo solid organ transplantation were carefully evaluated to prevent the reactivation of occult infections following surgery and after the commencement of immunosuppressive therapy. During examination of the ear, nose, and throat, patients were evaluated for otitis media, rhinosinusitis, tonsillitis, and upper respiratory tract infection.</p>
<p>The preoperative otologic evaluation protocol used in the Asan Medical Center for management of COM is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599811433276"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>. Patients were thoroughly queried about their medical and family histories, followed by physical examination, including otoscopic inspection and a mastoid x-ray series. Patients with a perforated ear drum or attic cholesteatoma were referred to otologic specialists for further evaluation and management. All patients with COM with or without cholesteatoma were evaluated by temporal bone computed tomography (CT), and pathogenic bacteria in patients with otorrhea were identified by culturing middle ear swab samples.</p>

</fig>
<p>Patients were classified into 3 groups according to management method. The operation group consisted of 14 patients who underwent tympanomastoid surgery due to abnormal findings on CT scan, such as sclerotic or soft-tissue density in the mastoid or middle ear, accompanied by cholesteatoma with attic destruction and the presence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens such as methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> or ciprofloxacin-resistant <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>. The medication group consisted of 26 patients who were prescribed antibiotics and otic drops, depending on the results of middle ear swab cultures. Surgery was not performed when medical management successfully controlled the otorrhea and there was no evidence of inflammatory changes on temporal bone CT scan. The observation group consisted of 25 patients with dry perforated eardrums, clean middle ear cavities, and well-pneumatized mastoids on CT scans who did not undergo surgery or receive medication.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0194599811433276">
<title>Posttransplantation protocol</title>
<p>Following solid organ transplantation and commencement of treatment with immunosuppressive agents, the surgical wounds of patients who underwent tympanomastoid surgery (operation group) were routinely examined. Patients in the medication and observation groups who developed abnormal ear symptoms after transplantation, such as otorrhea, otalgia, hearing disturbance, or fever of unknown origin, were referred to an otologist. If physical examination showed evidence of reinfection or recurrence in the middle ear, a middle ear swab culture was taken and patients were treated with antibiotics for several weeks based on culture results, with temporal bone CT or magnetic resonance imaging used to evaluate the degree and extent of inflammation. Immediate surgery was indicated if the infection was life threatening or if improvement was not expected after antibiotic therapy because of severely depressed immune status.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0194599811433276">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The association between treatment modality and outcomes was assessed using the Kruskal-Wallis 1-way analysis of variance by ranks. Factors influencing the recurrence of COM were assessed by univariate analysis. All statistical associations were analyzed using 2-tailed <italic>t</italic> tests, with <italic>P</italic> values &lt;.05 considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences software (SPSS for Windows 12.0; SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois).</p>

<p>Of the 65 patients with pretransplantation COM, 14 (21.5%) underwent surgery, 26 (40.0%) improved with antibiotic treatment, and 25 (38.5%) were observed without definite treatment. Surgical treatment included mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty in 12 patients (simple mastoidectomy in 8; intact canal wall mastoidectomy in 2; open cavity mastoidectomy in 2), and tympanoplasty in 2. Of these 14 patients, 6 received preoperative antibiotic therapy for 2 weeks based on the results of drug sensitivity tests.</p>
<p>After follow-up for more than 2 years, 49 of the 65 (75.4%) patients maintained dry, safe ears, whereas 16 (24.6%) had recurrent or newly developed otorrhea after transplantation, including 1 patient (11.1%) in the operation group, 8 (26.9%) in the medication group, and 7 (26.7%) in the observation group. The rate of posttransplant otorrhea was significantly lower in the operation group than in each of the other 2 groups (relative risk = 0.24; 95% confidence interval, 0.09 to 0.64). The time from the date of transplantation to the onset of symptoms ranged from 7 days to 13 months (mean, 5.4 months). Of the 16 patients with posttransplant otorrhea, 3 underwent reoperation after medication showed no improvement. Of the remaining 13 patients treated with antibiotics, 12 showed improvement, including a cessation of otorrhea. The remaining patient, who was in the pretransplant medication group and received a kidney transplant, was unable to undergo surgery because of poor general condition and died of a complication of COM (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599811433276"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>COM is a chronic disease defined as a perforated tympanic membrane with persistent drainage from the middle ear. Such perforations may arise traumatically, iatrogenically during tube placement, or after an episode of acute otitis media that decompresses through a tympanic perforation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599811433276">7</xref></sup> The pathogenesis of COM is multifactorial, involving both environmental and genetic factors, as well as the anatomic and functional characteristics of individual Eustachian tubes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599811433276">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599811433276">9</xref></sup> The prevalence of COM depends on several factors, including heredity, race, sex, age, and socioeconomic status. Its prevalence rate is likely to decrease as socioeconomic conditions improve and as medical benefits are expanded.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599811433276">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599811433276">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the present study, the most common pathogen was methicillin-sensitive <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MSSA), followed by methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA), <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, and coagulase-negative <italic>Staphylococcus</italic>. Recently, we reported the prevalence of pathogenic bacteria in the patients with COM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599811433276">11</xref></sup> According to this study, the most prevalent pathogen of COM was MRSA (30.5%), followed by <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> (25.8%) and MSSA (17.2%) in South Korea. In the present study, the prevalence of pathogenic bacteria of COM in organ transplant recipients was similar to the general population of patients.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, the incidence of COM in organ transplant recipients has never been accurately determined. This survey of 3278 solid organ transplant recipients showed that 65 (2.0%) had been diagnosed with COM, a prevalence similar to that in the general population. In addition, we found that the rate of newly developed COM after transplantation was only 0.09%, indicating that our management protocol is adequate for the prevention and treatment of COM in organ transplant recipients.</p>
<p>An immunosuppressed state results from the complex interaction of many factors, including the nature of immunosuppressive therapy, the presence or absence of infection with immunomodulating viruses, and the technical complications of the transplantation procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599811433276">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599811433276">13</xref></sup> The correlation between immunosuppression and otitis media remains unclear. The presence of a distinct secretory immune system in the middle ear may protect against microbial infections in the middle ear or may be involved in the pathogenesis of these infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599811433276">14</xref></sup> Refractory experimental otitis media with effusion has been reported to require 2 pathologic conditions: tubal ventilatory dysfunction and suppression of immunologic defense mechanisms by immunosuppressive drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599811433276">15</xref></sup> Recently, IgG and IgA have been shown to be very important defenses against mucosal infections such as COM. Moreover, interactions between lymphocytes and interleukins 2 and 4 have been reported to control the conversion of acute otitis media to COM, especially in patients with serous otitis media.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599811433276">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599811433276">18</xref></sup> Therefore, despite advances in organ transplantation, a high index of suspicion is required to promptly diagnose occult infections. The reactivation of occult infections and the occurrence of new postoperative infections may occur with some regularity in solid organ transplant recipients.</p>
<p>This study had several limitations, the most important being that it was not a comparative case control study, which would have provided more information on the clinical course of COM and related mortality in solid organ transplant recipients. The pathophysiology of otitis media in transplant patients remains poorly defined, although immunosuppression appears to be important.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599811433276">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599811433276">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599811433276">19</xref></sup> This study was not designed to define an optimal therapy or prophylaxis for otitis media, including COM, in transplant patients. However, our experience suggests that precise diagnosis and proper surgical intervention will decrease the recurrence or exacerbation of COM in patients immunosuppressed after organ transplantation.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The rate of posttransplant otorrhea was significantly lower in patients undergoing pretransplant tympanomastoidectomy surgery than in those receiving medication or observation alone. Prompt diagnosis and proper surgical intervention for COM may reduce the rate of otorrhea and exacerbation of COM in solid organ transplant recipients.</p>
