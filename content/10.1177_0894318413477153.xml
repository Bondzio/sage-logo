<abstract>
<p>The concept of quality of life is a popular, confusing taxonomy of definitions that lacks consensus for practice applications in healthcare disciplines. Usage of the term is infused with diverse and inconsistent meanings in contemporary healthcare literature. This article begins a discussion regarding the ethical implications for current usage of the concept in professional healthcare literature. Potential opportunities-limitations in professional nurse practice are discussed. The theoretical lens of the humanbecoming ethical tenets shall undergird the exploration and articulation of potential meanings of the concept.</p>

<p>In contemporary healthcare literature, the usage of the phrase or concept of <italic>quality of life</italic> has been of profound importance and is inextricably linked with human health. What does it mean to have or exhibit quality of life? Potential meanings of the term are illuminated in the ethos or straight thinking conceptualizations and definitions found in diverse multidisciplinary professional healthcare literature and practices. The phrase <italic>quality of life</italic> was popularized in the 1970’s as a global taxonomy used in the context of healthcare where it has been linked with sociology, medicine, psychology, economics, geography, social history, philosophy, and nursing. Historical evolution of the term emerged with positive connotations in that quality of life was viewed as an aim, a distinguishing characteristic, a property, or an attribute for individuals, groups, and communities that could be studied both quantitatively and qualitatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894318413477153">Farquhar, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>In the normative philosophy of bioethics, there has been no firm consensus and there are ever-changing definitions with conceptualizations and multifaceted meanings of the term found in the literature. Many definitions offer little about the lived human experience, but instead, offer information regarding defining functional abilities and the degree of satisfaction or dissatisfaction felt by persons who experience these labeled components or functions. Quality of life has also be categorized and labeled according to another person’s expert judgment regarding what is considered good or normal in certain defined situations or static moments of time. Other healthcare disciplines have described quality of life as being related to a person’s sense of well-being and achievement of some satisfactory social situation within the limits of perceived physical capacity juxtaposed with desired knowledge and experiences of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894318413477153">Farquhar, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>In sociopolitical realms, quality of life indicators have also been associated with socioeconomic status and the quantity or limiting factors of material possessions that satisfy individual and community perceived needs. From this economic perspective, quality of life is linked with the consumption of market goods, and other physical and social characteristics of the environment or setting where individuals are located.</p>
<p>In nursing and other health disciplinary formal paths of inquiry, quality of life has been conceptualized and defined operationally. These formal paths of inquiry have included the design and testing of quantitative scales with designated variables incorporated for the ultimate determination of a quality of life index score for persons or groups who meet certain requirements, demographic characteristics, and diagnoses of certain pathophysiologic diseases. The results or index scores have been published as a standard, a normative measure for quality of life. The results of these studies have profound implications for professional healthcare practices with a particular group or population. The quantitative analyses inform healthcare disciplines policy-making and recommendations for national practice and educational standards, and are disseminated to professional healthcare disciplines through publications and professional practice standards.</p>
<sec id="section1-0894318413477153">
<title>Quality and Safety</title>
<p>Recently, quality of life has been linked to issues of patient safety in diverse healthcare settings and institutions. With an emphasis on the attainment of minimum competencies and standards for professional practice, the term quality is reduced to the introduction of minimum standards for health outcomes and for purposes of monetary government reimbursements to healthcare institutions. National accreditation standards for hospitals and government healthcare agencies have defined that a minimum quality of life exists for persons who have been diagnosed with a chronic disease during a hospitalization and have not returned for emergency healthcare services requiring readmission before 30 days after discharge from the hospital. Equating quality of life to whether or not someone returns for hospitalization is a questionable practice and is an unsuitable and potentially dehumanizing endeavor.</p>
<p>The national quality and safety measures recently employed are measurements and standards that are assumed and understood by the scientific community to be an unbiased, objective, impartial assessment of the quality of the human condition. Should the discipline of nursing support philosophical beliefs of healthcare where the quality of human life is reduced to a set of conditions with standard measures that are viewed as impartial, unbiased, and equated to a numerical system for healthcare financial reimbursement?</p>
<p>By limiting quality to the diagnosis of disease processes and reimbursement levels for admission or readmission to an acute healthcare institution, quality of life is not about the human experience and the ways in which human beings define what is most important to them. Personally defined human value priorities incarnated with limitless meanings that guide health and decision-making for persons, families, and community in diverse healthcare settings may be ignored. Instead, quality is viewed as a measurable feature understood by everyone. Potentially, this view could be interpreted to mean that one health professional would have the opportunity to determine the quality of life for another person, family, or community; therefore, possible notions may surface that quality of life for another may be deemed insufficient or unacceptable according to these chosen philosophical beliefs and value priorities.</p>
<p>In the author’s view, all human life is to be revered and all human experience is incarnated with intrinsic value. Philosophical worldviews and theories do serve as a lens of understanding about relationships regarding knowledge and beliefs about humans and the universe and guide all healthcare disciplinary practice. The phenomenon of concern to nursing as a healthcare disciplines encompasses beliefs, postulates, principles, and concepts about nursing, humans, the universe, health, and quality of life. Members of healthcare disciplines should undergo careful consideration of the philosophical and theoretical underpinnings that are guiding national and global healthcare with regard to conceptualizations of health and quality of life. The author suggests an alternative view from a nursing theoretical ethos of humanbecoming as emanating truths for beholding quality in human life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894318413477153">Parse, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>A Humanbecoming Ethos and Quality of Life</title>
<p>The straight thinking ethos regarding quality of life is embedded in the notion of human dignity. The ontological beliefs of humanbecoming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894318413477153">Parse, 2010</xref>) undergird any understanding of the concept of quality of life. From a humanbecoming perspective, human dignity is “an august presence, a noble bearing of inherent uniqueness” (p. 257). Persons are incarnated with a noble standing, each person bearing qualities that are inherently different. Persons should be regarded by healthcare professionals with the highest regard and esteem. Persons are distinct unfolding seamless symphonies of becoming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318413477153">Parse, 1996</xref>). Notions surrounding the ethos or straight thinking of what it means to have quality of life are inextricably linked to the ontology (the assumptions, postulates, and principles) of the humanbecoming school of thought. As enduring truths, four ethical tenets inform thinking about implications for what it means to be with others as they experience quality of life. The discipline of nursing has a responsibility with duties and obligations to those who receive vital healthcare services that professional nurses uniquely provide. The interrelationship should be imbued with reverence and awe as person(s) live their chosen cherished, value priorities in the moment.</p>
<p>“Reverence is solemn regard for human presence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894318413477153">Parse, 2010</xref> p. 258). In choosing to respect the quality of life as described by another, reverence shines forth while bearing witness with the confirming-not confirming unfolding of others’ cherished value priorities. Persons choose personal health, choose quality, and choose meaning with situation, bearing responsibility for decisions. Choosing a certain path or defining quality is ever-shifting, transforming, and may be known in rhythmical patterns of relating that reveal-conceal chosen hopes and dreams for the not yet. The choices that unfold are not static or defined, but instead are ever-evolving, ever-changing with the transforming of the familiar-unfamiliar. In choosing quality of life, persons, family and community together with healthcare professionals experience the mystery of human existence.</p>
<p>“Awe is beholding the unexplainable of human existence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894318413477153">Parse, 2010</xref>, p. 258). As individuals, groups, and community choose quality of life, the nurse and other health professionals ought to appreciate and deeply respect the wonderment of being human. Living health and making difficult, complex healthcare choices in situation is not a numerical, objective evaluation pre-determined by algorithm or managed care path according to the diagnosis of a disease process. Instead, speaking and moments of silence should be honored with regard as nurses bear witness to myriad unpredictable ways persons choose how they will be with their changing health in situation. There are no pre-defined answers to others’ labels of problems in healthcare or the challenging ethical issues that arise while living health. Rather, living health and living quality of life are unexplainable as persons are to be uniquely appreciated for their humanness while coconstituting rhythmical patterns of relating and choosing cherished priorities in interrelationships.</p>
<p>Humans are becoming; only they can define what their personal quality of life is. It is truth for the moment. Persons structure meaning while freely choosing in situation and only the person, family, community, may describe what their quality of life is as it is lived in the moment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894318413477153">Parse, 2010</xref>). Members of the discipline of nursing have a duty and obligation to society to promote and ensure that the human experience of quality of life is at the table and adequately honored and represented in the realms of public policy and published healthcare standards. In pondering the aforementioned linear perspective with what ought to be acceptable as measures of quality and safety, it is the author’s view that in the current healthcare climate, the minimum has become a standard to be aspired to and there is an emerging new definition for quality in healthcare that has vital implications for the discipline of nursing. Differing human experiences and ever-changing definitions of quality of life have not been acknowledged or encouraged since only group cohort statistical differences are included as evidence for practice. Members of professional healthcare disciplines bear responsibility for the possibilities of betrayal and violation of human trust as the current emphasis shifts from human experiences to mechanical, monetary views of quality of human life.</p>
<p>According to numerous opinion polls, the discipline of nursing has long been acknowledged as a most trusted profession. However, the discipline stands at remarkable crossroads for its role in the current healthcare climate regarding priorities for minimum quality and safety. In the author’s view, quality of life ought to be studied with formal disciplinary research methods that expose an ethos of human dignity and advance nursing knowledge. The findings of these paths of inquiries should inform and be regarded for future healthcare policy.</p>
