<p><italic>Special school</italic> is a term that describes all of the possibilities for schools that are created for specific purposes. Special schools are not a recent phenomenon, but rather have existed as long as there have been schools in the United States, beginning with schools for boys to prepare for college. They may be planned for elementary, middle, or high school young people. They may be formed as a school for students with specific talents and interests—law and government; visual and performing arts; science, technology, engineering, and mathematics; or health care careers. The motivation to create the school may be to establish a magnet school, a charter school, a private school, or a parochial school. Special schools may be residential or nonresidential. They may be freestanding schools or a school-within-a-school. Special schools come in many variations and serve multiple purposes.</p>
<p>Special schools for advanced or gifted students provide opportunities to match the curriculum to the readiness, ability, and interests of students. The curriculum may focus on a particular type of learning experience, such as Advanced Placement classes or an International Baccalaureate program. They also may provide options for various types of acceleration. They may offer early entrance to kindergarten, first grade, middle school, high school, or college. They may include mentoring and research experiences not usually offered for that age of a child or young person. They also may be organized to solely offer online learning as a strategy for removing the learning ceiling. The possibilities for organizing the learning in the special school to accommodate the needs of advanced learners are numerous.</p>
<p>This special issue provides five articles that describe special schools for gifted or advanced students. All five articles offer glimpses into opportunities to accelerate learning for students who attend special schools. Acceleration takes various forms. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217513487537">Colangelo, Assouline, and Gross (2004)</xref> detail 18 types of acceleration. Three types of acceleration are the focus of articles in this special issue—early entrance to college, differentiation, and mentoring. Starting college at a young age compacts the years in K-12 education. Differentiation allows for matching the curriculum to the interests, readiness, and characteristics of the learners. Mentoring fosters interest in careers, enhances research, or establishes role models for scholarly activity.</p>
<p>Jenny Klimis and Joyce VanTassel-Baska write about establishing middle schools, self-contained programs for gifted learners within three existing schools in a large county school district. The authors describe the goals as well as the process of planning and implementing these special schools-within-schools. They suggest that what was done for these three schools offers a blueprint for other school personnel who want to establish gifted magnet schools.</p>
<p>Christine L. Weber, Linda Johnson, and Shane Tripp describe a special school from the angle of professional development needed to create a private, pre-K to Grade-8 school characterized by differentiation. Professional development focused on differentiation and the implementation of differentiation strategies are emphasized in this article. One of several important points is that preassessment data are important for meaningful differentiation.</p>
<p>Maren Halvorsen, Nancy Hertzog, and Sarah A. Childers provide insights into a well-established early college entrance program for middle school students. They detail the experiences that the seventh- and eighth-grade students encounter during the 1-year preparation to be full-time college students. They include data from their research to support this yearlong experience for early college entrance for middle school students.</p>
<p>Julia Link Roberts describes a special school that is a statewide residential school with a focus on mathematics and science. Students from across the Commonwealth of Kentucky attend this residential school and graduate with a minimum of 60 college hours and a high school diploma. This article provides information about various aspects of this early college experience for high school juniors and seniors.</p>
<p>The final article is by Sandra N. Kaplan. She discusses the implementation of a differentiated curriculum as the distinguishing feature of a special school that is really appropriate for children with gifts and talents. She describes the appropriate alignment of curriculum to the gifted population.</p>
<p>This special edition on special schools will be of interest to parents and educators who want to learn about special schools as well as to those who want to implement such a school or improve the school they are involved with as parents or educators. These five articles can spark thinking about special schools and will initiate discussions on this important topic.</p>
