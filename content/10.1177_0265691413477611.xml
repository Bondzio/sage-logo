<abstract>
<p>The article analyses how nineteenth-century Spanish Democrats understood democracy, what were the issues at stake, how they were debated, and how political and social discourses evolved. It focuses on Democrats’ conceptions of citizenship, freedom, equality, sovereignty, political activity and the nation, as well as on their ideas on the most convenient form of government and organization of the State. It traces the process through which their original idea of democracy as an active and immediate exercise of power evolved into another centred on the control and limitation of power and the promotion of individual autonomy. It finally points out their holistic vision of society and their difficulty accepting a plurality of interests and parties, which had considerable influence on their political practice and their attempts at self-organization.</p>

<p>In 1856, Charles Otway, secretary to the British Legation in Madrid, wrote to Lord Clarendon that the Spanish ‘democratic band’ that ‘came into the world weak and puny’ could at that moment ‘bring respectable forces on the battlefield of politicks’. He added that its influence over ‘the masses’ was ‘almost unbounded’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0265691413477611">1</xref></sup> Even if these statements involve a great deal of exaggeration, it is true that the self-identified Democrats who first appeared in Spain around 1840, struggling for ‘universal’ male suffrage and popular sovereignty, achieved a larger geographical and social basis as the century progressed, and were essential actors in the political integration of wide social sectors. Their discourses, practices and popular mobilization contributed to the gradual opening up of the liberal system that had itself been painfully established in Spain from 1808, in an uneven process whose main highlights were the revolution of 1868, the establishment of the First Republic in 1873, the proclamation of universal male suffrage in 1890 and, finally, the coming of the Second Republic in 1931.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0265691413477611">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Spanish Democratic leaders pitched their appeal mainly to an audience of urban artisans and workers, peasants, shopkeepers, wage-earners from the service sector, students and liberal professionals. These were social groups that had been politicized by the ‘Liberal revolution’, chiefly through their participation in national militias or in ‘patriotic societies’ devoted to reading and discussing the numerous political newspapers launched from 1808 to 1814, then again from 1820 to 1823 and finally from 1835 onwards. After the proclamation of the Constitution of 1837 and, above all, that of 1845, these popular social groups, which had come to believe in the importance of political participation to achieve individual emancipation and social regeneration, were definitively excluded from politics. Democrats offered them an alternative political model to the ‘oligarchic-property-based’ system which excluded them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0265691413477611">3</xref></sup> What did this model involve, and how did it change over time?</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to analyse how nineteenth-century Spanish Democrats understood democracy, what were the issues at stake, how they were debated, and how political and social discourses evolved. This analysis will show that, as Robert Dahl has pointed out, democracy ‘has meant different things at different times’, and that its multi-stranded history has always been full of unforeseen eventualities and setbacks as well as of negotiations or indeed struggles between contending definitions and conceptions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0265691413477611">4</xref></sup> Democracy as defended by the first Spanish Democrats was quite different from the current definition of liberal democracy, in which diversity of opinions and political conflict are considered as normal and even desirable. In fact, anti-pluralism was one key element of democratic political culture and it also affected Democrats’ attempts at self-organization. Conceptions started to change under the pressure of historical events and in particular the brief experience of participation in government which Democrats underwent during the First Republic of 1873.</p>
<p>Taking into account the growing popular support Spanish Democrats obtained during the century and their influence on the historical dynamics of the period, analysis of their discourse is crucial to a proper understanding of the tortuous history of Spanish democracy and democratization, and in particular to an understanding of what kinds of democratic identities and practices were configured and how they changed over time. Additionally, the article aims to provide some grounds for comparison in order to achieve a deeper understanding of the main features of the nineteenth-century ‘European democratic universe’, its common imaginaries and practices, as well as its varying local contexts, traditions and differences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0265691413477611">5</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="sec1-0265691413477611"><title>The Emergence of Nineteenth-Century Spanish Democrats</title>
<p>The first Spanish Democrats began to organize in the political arena around 1840. They were typically journalists or liberal professionals such as doctors and lawyers. Most came from advanced Liberal groups which had developed an increasingly radical stance in the 1830s, ceasing to support the order established by the Constitution of 1812 (which sharply limited the powers of the Crown and established a wide, though indirect, franchise) and advocating instead the granting of universal political rights and liberties under a democratic republic or a very restricted monarchy dependent on the nation’s will.</p>
<p>This process of radicalization resulted from the influence of the French Revolution and European Democratic, Republican and Socialist discourses and movements, but also the conflict-ridden course of the Spanish ‘Liberal Revolution’ between 1808 and 1840. The years from 1830 were especially important, because at this time most Spanish Liberals (divided between Moderates and Progressives),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0265691413477611">6</xref></sup> abandoned the original principles of Spanish Liberalism, as recorded in the Constitution of 1812, and adopted those of the French Doctrinaire, in particular their idea that sovereignty might be shared between the King and the <italic>Cortes</italic> (the national assembly) and that the franchise should be subject to a property qualification.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0265691413477611">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Radicals, by contrast, identified liberty with the political participation of the people. Their aspirations were frustrated by the Constitution of 1837, designed by a combination of Moderate and Progressive Liberals, that reinforced the authority of the Crown (which gained, for example, an absolute veto), established a bicameral parliamentary system and restricted the franchise to a tiny 2.2 per cent of the population.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0265691413477611">8</xref></sup> The struggle for political rights subsequently became more intense, and various radical groups, notably the editors of the newspapers <italic>El Corsario</italic> (Madrid, 1836) and <italic>El Sancho Gobernador</italic> (Barcelona, 1837) started to support universal male suffrage. From 1835, moreover, some of these radicals became aware of the support the Crown was giving to the Moderate political project. This gradually led them to consider the monarchy as linked to privilege and to stop trusting its potential to liberalize the political system and to act as a true moderating power. This was one of the main causes of the shift to republicanism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0265691413477611">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Republicans and Democrats started to organize, taking newspaper offices, reading associations and secret societies as headquarters. Their activities were especially conspicuous in cities such as Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Seville, Cádiz and Cáceres and were reflected in the election results of 1841, which gave them seven seats in the <italic>Cortes</italic> (out of 375).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0265691413477611">10</xref></sup> The Moderates seized power in 1844 and the following year proclaimed a new Constitution, which restricted the franchise to a mere 0.8 per cent of the population and further reinforced ‘the decision-making power of the monarch, the cabinet and the Senate’. In addition, the Moderate government, dominated initially by an ‘intransigent’ faction, adopted a ‘heavy-handed policy toward the press and freedom of association’. The activities of Republicans and Democrats were thus stifled until 1846, when a more liberal moderate group came to power with a slightly less restrictive policy which allowed them to hold some meetings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0265691413477611">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Democratic Party was founded in 1849, integrating both Republicans and supporters of a limited monarchy; they launched a manifesto that included a declaration of civil, political and social rights. The Party set up an organizing committee in Madrid and some educational societies. In the elections of 1851 despite new franchise restrictions, Democrats gained six representatives in parliament (out of 349). In parallel, as a result of the existing legal limitations to the freedom of press and association, which prevented them from publishing long-lasting newspapers, they organized a secret society called ‘Los hijos del pueblo’ (The sons of the People), with propagandist and organizational purposes, which had branches in several Spanish provinces and links to similar societies in Paris, Lisbon and other European capitals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0265691413477611">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>A revolution in 1854 resulted in two years of Progressive government, allowing Democrats to publish many newspapers and – thanks to the extension of the franchise – to win 21 seats in parliament (out of 349). But the support of the Crown and the inability of Progressives to consolidate their rule and control the political system allowed Moderates to return to power in 1856. The severe repression promoted by the Moderate government left Democrats in a situation of ‘semi-ostracism’ until 1862; their activities during these years were limited to clandestine action and conspiracies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0265691413477611">13</xref></sup> Most Democrats joined a secret society which promoted failed insurrections in 1857 and 1859.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0265691413477611">14</xref></sup> After that date, local and regional clandestine associations proliferated, in some cases keeping touch with Italian and Portuguese democrats, but we do not yet know the full extent to which they collaborated with each other and with Democrats organized on a national basis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0265691413477611">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>After the failure of the revolution of 1854, most Democrats started to support a Republic. A manifesto published in 1858 by the Party’s National Committee proclaimed the Republic to be democracy’s essential form of government.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0265691413477611">16</xref></sup> During the reign of Isabella II, as we have remarked, the monarchy identified completely with the Moderate Party and favoured a political system privileging the power of the executive over the legislative, repeatedly frustrating the Democrats’ hopes of establishing the principle of national sovereignty. This had considerable influence on the process of ‘republicanization’, which cannot be examined in detail due to the political repression of the time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0265691413477611">17</xref></sup> It is a situation that calls to mind that of many French liberals, who, according to Michel Winock, were also ‘potential republicans’ who provisionally accepted the monarchy under the condition that this be ‘constitutional, that is, well-defined, exempt from arbitrariness, with regulated powers and, if possible, <italic>tricolored</italic>’. During the July regime of 1830–48 the image of the French monarchy gradually became tarnished, and finally came to be associated with all possible forms of social division: tax exemptions, privileges and even economic inequalities. Likewise Mazzini believed at first that both the democratic republic and the constitutional monarchy could be ‘free governments’. From 1830 onwards, however, he realized that Doctrinarism blocked any policy of reform and he experienced an ‘intellectual transformation’ which led him to become a republican.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0265691413477611">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Starting in 1864, Spanish Republicans worked hard to constitute a united and disciplined political party with a legitimate and centralized leadership, able to make decisions and to impose a unified political line. They elected a National Committee and created several provincial and municipal committees. Their project was, however, hindered by their own disagreements and by their entanglement in the revolutionary movement that was promoted by all groups opposed to Moderate rule, which eventually caused the fall of Queen Isabella II in 1868. In June 1866 Republicans joined the Progressives in a frustrated uprising that resulted in the exile of most of the prominent figures involved. A joint Progressive-Democratic meeting held in Ostend (Belgium) in August of the same year concluded with the agreement to dismantle the Moderate regime and the reign of Isabella and to decide the future of the country through a Constituent Assembly elected by ‘universal’ suffrage. Their common goal was to ‘revitalize political life by expanding individual and political rights’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0265691413477611">19</xref></sup> The Revolution of 1868 inaugurated a six-year period known as the ‘Democratic <italic>Sexennium</italic>’, during which some of the essential Republican demands of past decades – including right of expression, assembly, association and universal male suffrage – became legal.</p>
<p>The Constitution of 1869 nevertheless produced a renewed version of the constitutional monarchy embodied in Amedeo of Savoy, who was proclaimed King in November 1870 and who arrived in Madrid in January 1871. Royal powers were considerably reduced, but the King kept the right to sanction and veto new laws. During these years, Republicans continued to engage in intense political activity and proved that they had a considerable influence among the popular classes. In Madrid alone they published around 70 newspapers and organized a large number of clubs and associations. This effort was rewarded by their election results, which showed an important advance compared to the years before the revolution. The Republican Federal Party, which had been founded in 1868 and absorbed the former Democratic Party, won 85 seats (out of 350) in 1869. The new party obtained its best results in Lérida, Sevilla, Cádiz and Huesca, followed by Barcelona, Gerona, Zaragoza and Valencia. Its organization was based on a Federal assembly formed of three representatives from each province, which made decisions on tactics and doctrine; a board of directors with executive functions; and a network of provincial and local committees. This did not prevent intransigent groups from contemplating revolutionary action, justified mainly by alleged electoral corruption, as the involvement of some Republican activists in the uprising of September–October 1869, which broke out after the disarmament of some battalions of the Militia, demonstrates.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0265691413477611">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Amedeo’s abdication in February 1873, due to extreme political instability which included a failed assassination attempt against him, was followed by the proclamation of the Republic, which lasted until December of the same year. During that time, a federal constitution was drafted, but political stability proved elusive: Republicanism was deeply divided between several factions and, furthermore, the successive governments (the Republic had four presidents altogether) had to face three simultaneous armed conflicts – a civil war against Carlist monarchists between 1872 and 1876, a federalist (anti-centralist) insurrection, the First Cuban war of independence against Spain which had started in 1868 and would last until 1878, as well as the hostility of rival parties (reflected in non-cooperation and, in some cases, active conspiracy). The period, which has been described as ‘a catalogue of errors and chaos’, ended when General Pavía led a military coup to overthrow the regime, and ‘no serious attempt was made anywhere in the country to defend the Republic’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0265691413477611">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>After the Restoration of the Bourbon dynasty (embodied in Isabel II’s son Alfonso XII), in 1874, Republicans were divided into four different parties: Emilio Castelar’s Possibilists, who defended order and authority, administrative decentralization, and a representative parliamentarian regime; Francisco Pi y Margall’s Federalists, who advocated a contractual federalism and an advanced social policy; Manuel Ruiz Zorrilla’s Progressives, who, like Castelar, favoured administrative decentralization but believed also in the use of military force to seize power; and Nicolás Salmerón’s Centralists, who supported the rule of law and a representative regime. These were all socially diverse parties with an essentially urban support, whose principal activity was the publication of newspapers, making more organized efforts only at election times. Some ephemeral coalitions were formed (for instance in 1879, winning 16 out of 391 seats in Parliament, or in 1893, gaining 45 out of 437), but relations among the four parties were generally bad. A Republican Union was formed in 1903 which drew various groups together, but inner differences grew stronger, such that each coalition finally split. The Republicans’ inability to challenge the hegemony of monarchists and agree on a common programme resulted in their virtual disintegration by 1923. Their victory in the municipal elections of 1931, which forced King Alfonso XIII into exile, came as a surprise even to themselves.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0265691413477611">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Throughout the whole period, the democratic movement was decidedly heterogeneous. Besides the disagreements about the form of government, already mentioned, Democrats differed significantly on doctrinal and strategic matters. In this they were similar to other Democrat or Radical groups in Europe, which usually did not share a single view of democracy and had different positions concerning economic and social issues.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0265691413477611">23</xref></sup> In Spain, this diversity proved a major handicap to the development of a coherent political line and the constitution of a cohesive and well-organized party. The problem was aggravated by the lack of appropriate fora for discussions (which derived in great measure from government repression and the restrictions on the right of association that prevailed during most of the period) and by the Democrats themselves, who entered any dispute with the goal of imposing their own opinion and excluding their opponents. Finally, Spanish Democrats remained divided into personal factions and could not agree on a single leadership accepted by all.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0265691413477611"><title>Democracy and Citizenship</title>
<p>The Spanish Democratic groups which emerged around 1840 aspired, above all, to popular sovereignty; a government of the people and by the people. This implied a large extension of political rights, in particular the granting of universal male suffrage. This right was conceived as being natural and inalienable, allowing for the representation of all individual interests and, therefore, the achievement of general utility.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0265691413477611">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although they claimed to represent all interests, Democrats expressed most concern about the interests of rural and urban workers who lacked material property, but could be thought to have property rights in their wages and their ability, who contributed by their efforts to national prosperity and possessed ‘intellectual faculties’ that allowed them to think and deliberate. Democrats also usually thought of workers as being heads of families. They held that all those who had a ‘home to defend’, ‘sons to give up for the army, honour to keep’ were interested in social order and stability, and in the legislation and government of society.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0265691413477611">25</xref></sup> British supporters of electoral reform in the 1860s also emphasized the granting of suffrage to heads of family: this recalled the civic humanist tradition, which reserved political rights to free men owning a home. The ability to support a family was considered a basis for independence. But British reformers, like Spanish Demo-republicans, also viewed husbands and fathers as sober and respectable citizens. Their insistence on this condition was a way of limiting access to citizenship to virtuous, decent and stable workers, and excluding the poorest and rootless social sectors, which they identified with vice and degradation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0265691413477611">26</xref></sup> ‘People’ was then a concept which generally included ‘the sum of workers and productive middle classes’ and left out vagrants, beggars and marginalized persons.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0265691413477611">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Women were not included in these claims. Democrats accepted the prevailing discourse of domesticity which confined women to the household sphere. However, they charged women with the task of educating children with the aim of forming honest men and good citizens, willing to fight for freedom and the nation, and this required them to know the principles of democracy. From this angle, women were not totally excluded from the public sphere: although effectively separated from the political scene, they were linked to it by their responsibility for the formation of future democrats, and from this perspective they could be considered as ‘citizens without political rights’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0265691413477611">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>The extension of rights advocated by Democrats would bring about, in their opinion, a cohesive community of citizens, free from any form of fragmentation or social exclusion. This was so because Spanish Democrats, like British Radicals and Chartists, held that society was divided by politics between the holders of political rights – called ‘privileged’ or ‘aristocrats’ – and those deprived of political rights, who formed the ‘people’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0265691413477611">29</xref></sup> Because of the nature of the franchise, this purely political fracture was linked to a socio-economic division: the owners and the poor. Electoral qualifications had divided the nation into <italic>fit</italic> and <italic>unfit</italic> (for political participation) according to the value of the property they occupied. This classification had replaced the old nobility for a ‘modern aristocracy of money’ and divided the society into ‘oppressors and oppressed’, which was in turn the main cause of social conflict and disorder. Now Democrats did not condemn economic inequalities. They found them inevitable. What they could not tolerate was that wealth gave rise to ‘privileges’, the foremost of which was the ‘monopoly of political rights’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0265691413477611">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>The political participation of all (male) citizens in the nation’s public affairs would end social division. On the one hand, it would make it possible to restrict somewhat the accumulation of wealth, according to the view, held also by British Radicals, that economic inequalities derived from problems of distribution, and therefore depended on legislation, government and administration, monopolized up to that point by ‘privileged’ sectors. On the other hand, and most importantly in a Spanish context, the extension of political rights to all Spanish males would erase the differences based on birth. All men would be considered, in abstract terms, as citizens and holders of rights, and judged only by their intelligence and productive capacity, in the context of a truly meritocratic regime. Thus there would no longer be ‘nobles nor plebeians’ and a true equality – political, juridical, of conditions – would be achieved. This would not imply material equality nor exclude differences resulting from diverse degrees of merit, talent or physical condition. The goal was not to suppress ‘natural’ inequalities among men, but to eradicate legal inequality, sanctioned by institutions; to avoid, ultimately, the existence of ‘citizens destined to rule and others destined to obey only on account of their class status’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0265691413477611">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>The possession of political rights, access to citizenship, was in addition the main guarantee of freedom. This was conceived, on the one hand, as the ability to participate in politics and to watch the authorities’ performance, and on the other, as personal autonomy. Both issues were inextricably linked, for Democrats believed that involvement in public affairs made possible the emancipation of the will. The groups excluded from political rights remained perpetual minors, as they put it using Kant’s metaphor, and therefore in a state of dependence, because their will was subject to another will. They remained ‘outside political life’ and had the status of ‘subjects’ or, worse, of serfs, ‘who by pity were granted some civil rights which they seldom had the chance to exercise’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0265691413477611">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>Political participation, on the contrary, turned men into subjects independent of all principle alien to their own will; through politics men gained control of their actions and decisions. When all individuals obtained the right to intervene in legislation, they came to be ‘in possession of themselves, their faculties, their rights, their whole personality’, and revolved as sovereign beings ‘in the social sphere’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0265691413477611">33</xref></sup> Democrats aspired, then, to fulfil the liberal ideal of autonomy, which they considered impossible as long as political equality was not established. Only thus could a <italic>community of citizens</italic> be established in which privileges and all kind of subordination would disappear. The extension of political rights would bring personal emancipation, giving rise to order, peace, harmony and social cohesion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0265691413477611">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>Political rights were also necessary to guarantee the continuity of the nation, as the latter was understood as an association of citizens with equal civil and political rights. According to <italic>El Huracán</italic>, for instance, it was precisely popular sovereignty that constituted nationality, for in its absence there only remained a ‘flock of slaves’. The nation was, then, a sovereign and egalitarian community, and without democracy and freedom it was destined to decadence and even death.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0265691413477611">35</xref></sup> But these political considerations were tied up with ethnic and cultural conceptions. Democrats also emphasized that the national essence was formed by ‘the blood bond of the race’, its traditions, customs, language and history.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0265691413477611">36</xref></sup> These cultural and ethnic features constituted the superiority of Spain, the country which ‘possessed the richest history in great and magnificent events among all nations in the universe’. This conferred upon Spain a messianic mission outside its borders, with three fronts: the union with Portugal, which would create ‘a single and sturdy nationality’ (and basically meant the absorption of Portugal by Spain); the development of relations with the Latin-American republics, with the aim of establishing ‘a common confederation’ led by Spain, which would give its confederates ‘the advice a good mother always gives her emancipated child’; and the conquest of Africa, which would enlarge the frontiers of Spain and allow her to carry out a civilizing mission that would confer glory and honour on the nation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0265691413477611">37</xref></sup> Other Progressive and Moderate Liberals shared many of these goals. Spanish Republicans’ national exaltation sometimes resulted in overtly imperialist, racist and bellicose attitudes, as it did in the Spanish-American war of 1898.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0265691413477611">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>Otherwise, the Democrats’ emphasis on rights and personal autonomy did not produce an individualistic discourse; on the contrary, their thought was always markedly civic and communitarian, and contained a holistic conception of society in which man was not only regarded as an abstract rational individual, but also considered as a social being linked to his community. As has been said, the goal of Democracy was to ‘unite … reconcile, harmonize, associate’, creating a great family of citizens.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0265691413477611">39</xref></sup> This had two main implications. First, Spanish Democrats had difficulties in accepting the existence of various individual interests and motivations different from those of the community, an aspect that will be dealt with below. Second, they also proclaimed a series of citizens’ duties and obligations: the respect of other citizens’ rights, the payment of taxes according to income, the defence of freedom and the nation through integration in municipal and provincial militias and the participation in politics: every citizen ought to participate in all the elections, avoid electoral corruption and ‘perpetually inspect, judge and exercise public power’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0265691413477611">40</xref></sup> Active and alert politics was not only a way to guarantee freedom, but also a means to achieve the self-fulfilment and full development of the human fate, and hence the regeneration of society.</p>
<p>These demanding conceptions of citizenship led to a model of popular sovereignty in ‘constant exercise’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0265691413477611">41</xref></sup> This meant a view of politics as an immediate action which did not necessarily go through institutional channels and the defence of procedures of direct democracy. Although the ideas of Democrats on the subject differed, they usually demanded the popular vote of all the legislation produced by those elected by ‘universal’ suffrage, considered in turn as delegates or trustees and subject at all times to the electors’ will. Up to approximately the late 1850s most Democrats agreed on defending this concept of democracy, which, as Rosanvallon points out, was based on the assumption that there was a natural harmony or unity among individual interests and a single pre-existent authority. Referring to French Democrats who defended similar projects, this author also observes that their goal was to reconcile popular sovereignty, whose possible anarchic consequences were a matter of concern, and the representative principle, which was considered necessary in large societies but also distressing, in so far as the separation between representative and represented was identified with the establishment of a juridical difference and the possibility of a confiscation of popular power.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0265691413477611">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>After 1860 some Spanish Democrats started to defend the representative principle gradually accepting that MPs should be independent except from public censorship and the need periodically to seek re-election.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0265691413477611">43</xref></sup> However, previous ideas of representation were not easy to eradicate. Two Republican constitutional drafts elaborated in 1872 and 1873, for instance, permitted the dismissal of representatives by their constituents when the formers’ votes and actions in Parliament were not in accordance with their statements and commitments as candidates.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0265691413477611">44</xref></sup> Other figures, such as José Paúl y Angulo, advocated a ‘real, positive and constant exercise of national sovereignty’ based on a <italic>permanent universal suffrage</italic> (which would be applied both to the periodic election and ratification of rulers and to the sanction of bills).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0265691413477611">45</xref></sup> After the 1874 Restoration there were still groups who defended direct democracy in local areas (Pi y Margall’s Federals) or the imperative mandate (Ruiz Zorrilla’s Progressives). Others, such as Salmerón’s Centralists, rejected these forms of political action, but still claimed ‘the immanence of sovereignty in the nation’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0265691413477611">46</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0265691413477611"><title>Individual Sovereignty and Socialism</title>
<p>According to some scholars the Spanish Democratic Party emerged from the convergence of two different tendencies: Democrats (republicans or not) and Socialists. The later fragmentation of the movement derived, in their opinion, from the irreconcilable aspirations of these two sectors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0265691413477611">47</xref></sup> I disagree with this. Most Democrats did not think that their ideal of individual autonomy could be attained by the possession of political rights only, since these meant nothing either for the individual who lacked education and culture or for those ‘afflicted by hunger and deprived of all sort of material means’. It was necessary, therefore, to provide a basis for the independence of reason and individual self-determination, and to suppress all kind of subordination.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0265691413477611">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>In order to attain this goal Democrats trusted, on the one hand, in education, which would allow all citizens to gain control of their conscience and become responsible for their actions, that is, to become intellectually autonomous. This was not, however, the only purpose that popular education was supposed to achieve. Democrats were, like most of the liberals, somewhat distrustful of the people’s ability to exert their rights in a responsible way and become citizens under a free regime. Their educational project aimed, therefore, to eliminate political passivity and indifference through the teaching of civic rights and the duties and importance of participation and alertness. Democrats also aspired to ‘civilize’ the people to prevent them from presenting themselves as uncontrolled and brutal masses. In this connection, they spoke of raising the moral standards of the people and instilling in them the habits of work, honesty and effort. They also believed in the need to foster virtue in the domestic sphere, to promote the dedication and commitment of spouses and parents. In their opinion, the public and private spheres were interconnected: no man could be ‘useful to his homeland’ if he was not at the same time a ‘virtuous and selfless republican’ and an ‘excellent father’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0265691413477611">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>Democrats hoped additionally to guarantee the material independence that was necessary to enjoy full citizenship. As deputy Francisco García López once stated, the ‘people not only want political rights, they also want social rights. Political rights guarantee their dignity…; social rights the bread they need in order to subsist’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0265691413477611">50</xref></sup> Hence they trusted in the ‘confused mass of ideas, systems, various conceptions’ which aimed to eradicate misery and ‘social monopoly’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0265691413477611">51</xref></sup> Consequently most Spanish Democrats initially shared the wish to promote some kind of social reform, and for this purpose borrowed ideas from the various social projects circulating in Europe at the time (some of which already had some followers in Spain, as in the case of the Cabetians in Catalonia and the Fourierists in Cadiz).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0265691413477611">52</xref></sup> The projects defended by different Spanish Democrats were obviously diverse, but they usually agreed on defending producers and consumers’ associations, mutual aid societies, loan and savings banks, a progressive tax system and/or a democratic policy of confiscation aimed at extending property to as many people as possible.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0265691413477611">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>Democratic discourse on these matters, however, was revised in the 1850s, and especially after 1856. The dogma of national sovereignty was gradually replaced by the defence of the ‘sovereignty of … reason’ and the pre-eminence of each man’s will.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0265691413477611">54</xref></sup> Individual autonomy had always been the focus of democratic discourse. As has been pointed out, it was at first associated with participation, which turned ‘subjects’ into sovereign citizens. Democracy was defined as popular sovereignty, and it was assumed that the involvement of all in public affairs would result in the establishment of a community of free and independent men. Little by little, however, autonomy became independent from participation, since the latter, as Tocqueville had pointed out, could produce ‘the tyranny of society over the individual’. Democrats started to fear the ‘oppression of majorities’ and the perverse effects that ‘universal’ suffrage might have on freedom and individual rights.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0265691413477611">55</xref></sup> The fact that both Moderate and Progressive governments implemented restrictions on individual rights (in the name of national sovereignty embodied in the Parliament) also influenced this democratic shift.</p>
<p>Democracy came to be defined as the guarantee of the ‘sovereignty that man possesses from birth over himself’, and became associated with a series of natural and inalienable rights which needed to be secured.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0265691413477611">56</xref></sup> As Francisco Pi y Margall pointed out, ‘conferring power on the people’ collectively meant ‘sanctioning the predominance of collective reason over that of the individual’, which produced ‘a tyranny as unjustified as the tyranny of divine right’. Emilio Castelar, for his part, added that even popular sovereignty could ‘deny the foundations of human nature’, exclude people from the political system and violate the dignity of men and the privacy of households. These concerns led to a distinction between ancient democracy, which originated in the State ‘and moved down to meet man’, and modern democracy, which emerged from ‘the individual and moved up to constitute the State’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0265691413477611">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>This reformulation notwithstanding, the extension of political rights and popular participation in public affairs remained essential goals; democracy did not cease to be conceived as the exercise of power by the people. From 1868 Democrats tried to resolve the contradiction by redefining democracy as ‘the government of everyone by each one’. They then started arguing that democracy had two complementary goals: individual sovereignty, which conceived reason and men’s natural rights as inalienable principles placed ‘out of the reach of political laws’, and the people’s sovereignty, which guaranteed the people’s right to govern itself by means of universal suffrage and to delegate its powers, but always to public servants who were accountable and could be removed from their posts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0265691413477611">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>Democrats’ emphasis on individual sovereignty made most of them increasingly supportive of a State with minimal powers, allowing plenty of space for individual initiative. Theories such as these were obviously incompatible with previous formulations in which it had been proposed that the State should intervene to a certain extent in order to implement social reforms guaranteeing the material independence of underprivileged groups. The concept of Socialism became increasingly associated with the omnipotence of the State at the expense of the individual, the ‘tyrannical regulation … of man’s life’, and was fiercely rejected. Another factor that contributed to this reaction was the growing influence of Bastiat and the French liberal school of <italic>laissez-faire</italic> among Democratic groups, especially after the publication in 1860 of the debate between Bastiat and Proudhon, translated as <italic>Capital y renta</italic> (<italic>Capital and rent</italic>) by Roberto Robert. As is well known, this school affirmed the existence of a natural harmony among economic interests when left completely alone, defended the free market and rejected any kind of statist policies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0265691413477611">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some Democrats, such as Pi y Margall, continued to believe that a certain amount of activity on the part of the State was needed to prevent the subordination of large social groups, who would otherwise live as slaves. His goal remained the establishment of a true freedom and equality of conditions (never of fortunes) that spontaneous social forces could not produce alone. Socialism could ‘emancipate the working classes and provide them with the guarantees of ability and independence needed to avoid the risk of political rights becoming a sad and heartbreaking farce’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0265691413477611">60</xref></sup> The differences between such thinkers and those who associated Socialism with the omnipotence of the State and dictatorship produced bitter controversies, especially in 1860 and 1864.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0265691413477611">61</xref></sup> The seriousness of these clashes was caused not so much by the existence of incompatible positions (no one ever defended the omnipotence of the State, material equality or the possibility of confiscating individual property and all of them aspired to achieve individual freedom) as by the fact that the diverse activists who took part in the debates – carried out publicly in several newspapers (<italic>La Discusión, La Democracia, El Pueblo</italic>) – systematically regarded their opponents as anti-democrats and tried to exclude them from the Democratic Party, holding organizational meetings without them and multiplying accusations and insults in the press.</p>
<p>The issue of Socialism represented a great obstacle to the projects of self-organization of these groups, and became increasingly important due to the reactionary drift of Moderate governments. The beginning of a revolutionary cycle brought to the fore the need to unify the growing Democratic body in order to play a role in the overthrow of the Isabelline monarchy. In 1865, Democrats were finally forced to interrupt their quarrels in order to join the rest of the opposition to Moderatism in the struggle for regime change. These conspiratorial efforts, both in Spain and abroad, culminated in the ‘Glorious Revolution’ and the end of the monarchy of Isabella II. The differences between Democrats, however, would return to the foreground during the <italic>Sexennium</italic> (1868–1874) and the Restoration (1874–1923).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0265691413477611"><title>The Federal Republic</title>
<p>In 1868, the Democratic Party founded in 1849 was renamed the Federal Republican Democratic Party. In the first moments of the Revolution, when there existed several possibilities of political organization, the party’s chief goal, which absorbed all of its resources in terms of propaganda and political action, and which kept Democrats firmly united for a while, became the defence of the Republican form of government.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0265691413477611">62</xref></sup> Most Democrats had come to consider monarchy as an ‘unfair’ institution which existed only to ‘preserve some privileges’ and which was incompatible with equal rights and freedom. The concentration of power in one individual – and other people’s wish to attain it – produced, in their opinion, corruption, conflicts and excesses of all kinds. As the <italic>Manifesto</italic> published in 1868 by Madrid’s Republican Committee stated, the Republic was based on the limitation and division of power, and therefore on morality and virtue. The Republican regime was associated, in addition, with the guarantee of liberties and individual rights, of unlimited popular sovereignty and of universal male suffrage. It was also linked to the suppression of the death penalty, a budget cut and the abolition of conscription and indirect taxes, goals that were also defended by some activists of other political groups. It was characterized by the existence of an elected and temporary executive, removable and accountable, and depending at all times on a single chamber of representatives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0265691413477611">63</xref></sup> Efforts to theorize this element, however, were rare during the whole period. Some activists defended a directory of several members, whereas others preferred a president named by the Assembly.</p>
<p>Most Republicans supported a Federal State as well. Since its emergence as a creed around 1840, Federalism had been linked to Republicanism, but until 1868 it was understood as mere administrative decentralization. When Democrats spoke of Federalism they mainly referred to the free election of local authorities by the inhabitants of towns and provinces, and to the possibility of realizing their ideal of active and participating citizens in a large State. The ‘Federal’ structure would establish centres of power close to an electorate who would be well informed, and capable of intervening and playing an influential role in public affairs. ‘Federalism’ was also valued because it would make possible the distribution of power needed to guarantee freedom. Municipal independence would ensure the existence of permanent sources of resistance to any attempt at reaction by the central government. But the functions which were usually assigned to the provincial and municipal bodies were basically levying a share of taxes and taking care of public works and local educational institutions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0265691413477611">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Spanish Democrats started to insist on individual sovereignty, in the 1850s, Federation started to be viewed also as a means to guarantee the independence of the will of each entity (towns, provinces), which would associate with others to form a national unit only as a result of its own wish. The idea in its most general form was that social organization stemmed from the citizen and continued through a series of ‘organic groups’, including the municipality and the province and culminating in the State. The only way to ensure the harmony among all these organisms and to avoid conflicts was to leave them entirely free.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0265691413477611">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>The growing emphasis on the sovereignty and autonomy of municipal and provincial entities resulted in the attribution, defended by most Democrats from 1868, of – more or less – political competencies to the diverse territorial units. They seldom specified, however, how responsibilities would be shared; generally a hierarchical model was proposed in which the smaller entities were subordinated to the control of higher bodies. The Constitution of 1873, for instance, allowed provinces (now called ‘states’) to give themselves political constitutions, but these should be subject to the judgement and sanction of the Federal <italic>Cortes</italic> and might under no circumstance contradict the Federal Constitution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0265691413477611">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>The fact that the various entities were considered as organs within a body deprived them of the capacity to separate or rebel. As Stefan Berger has pointed out, corporatist metaphors emphasize harmony instead of diversity of interests: the various parts do not compete, but are mutually complementary.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0265691413477611">67</xref></sup> The Federalists’ goal was indeed to guarantee the autonomy of municipalities and provinces ‘under the shadow of a single banner and in the heart of a single nation’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0265691413477611">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>Federalism lent Democratic discourse an intense revolutionary component; especially because many activists saw the federation as a regime where political life would be controlled by an active people. Federalism allowed for a sort of daily plebiscite and an immediate, assembly-like way of doing politics. But this revolutionary component was also influenced by discourses favouring violent means to reach power, which became especially conspicuous after the election of Amedeo of Savoy as King of Spain in 1870, as suspicions of governmental electoral corruption grew and as the hopes of a legal Republican victory faded.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0265691413477611">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>Democratic thought was linked from the start to the revolutionary idea. For all Democrats revolution could be used as a last resort to overthrow a tyrannical government, and was justified by the property franchise, which left a large part of the population outside the system, by electoral corruption and/or by the repressive policies, exclusivism and sectarianism adopted by Spanish liberal governments during that period.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0265691413477611">70</xref></sup> But there was also something else. Democrats shared with Moderates and Progressives a political practice which aimed rather at ‘subordinating the opponent’ than at conciliation. M. C. Romeo has referred, in this connection, to the slowness with which Spanish liberals accepted the ‘rules of the game’ in a representative system, and their difficulty in articulating a ‘consensual political structure’ which would integrate the various liberal sensibilities and their respective social bases.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0265691413477611">71</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this sense, Spanish Democrats understood the ballot more as a symbol of legitimacy, social inclusion and membership in a homogenous community than as a tool of political change. Suffrage was not conceived as an instrument allowing choice among different ways of conceiving the political and social order. In fact, Democrats did not recognize the existence of many different political conceptions. Most Democrats only acknowledged the existence of two socio-political projects: that of freedom, emancipation, truth and good, and that of absolutism, slavery, error and evil. The people, conceived as a homogeneous whole, naturally supported the project of freedom which they advocated themselves. All those who did not defend this project were considered as enemies or strangers – excluded from the nation – who had to be eliminated. The nation was identified with democracy, and within it, as has been said, there were difficulties in recognizing different individual political interests.</p>
<p>Democrats’ emphasis on individual sovereignty derived from their concern with avoiding the possibility that legislators might restrict political and civil rights. It meant considering those rights as sacred and inalienable. It came also from their desire to implement the ideal of a community of autonomous citizens in which any kind of subordination (that is, subjection because of material or intellectual insufficiencies to another person’s will) would disappear. But autonomy did not mean the co-existence of contending interests. Once factions had disappeared from the political scene <italic>the good Spanish people</italic> would share the same interest and will: the material, intellectual, and moral well-being of the whole community; in other words, the democratic project, which was essential to the Spanish nation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0265691413477611">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>Consequently, and like British and French radicals, Spanish Democrats did not conceive politics as an activity involving the clash and compromise of contending interests, but a cohesive activity involving the designation of and vigilance over common administrators, who would constantly execute <italic>the</italic> will of the ‘Spanish people’. It was a cohesive activity that would result from a single and effective <italic>coup-de-main</italic> that would modify forever all the perversions of the politico-social order, including the elimination or absorption of the opponent. First, it was necessary to eject from power those political opponents conceived as ‘factions’ dangerous for the common good, and to suppress all factors distorting the political and social establishment – legal and political inequality, dependency, subordination.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0265691413477611">73</xref></sup> Then, the Democratic Republic would mean the ‘final organization of State and society’, solving all conflicts and eliminating the fragmentation of the political scene.</p>
<p>This exclusive conception of politics survived during the Democratic <italic>Sexennium</italic>. In fact, a moderate Republican journal, <italic>La Discusión</italic>, pointed out in 1873 that no wing in the Party trusted only in the ‘power of reason and words’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0265691413477611">74</xref></sup> This explains the persistence among Democrats of clandestine and conspiratorial political practices, despite the fact that the Constitution of 1869 proclaimed many of the principles which they had been advocating for decades, such as popular sovereignty, and a declaration of rights which included the rights of expression, assembly and association as well as the freedom of worship and of universal male suffrage. It also explains their persistent lack of interest in cultivating an electorate which could take them to power by legal means, and in promoting standardized practices of civic participation. The educational institutions which they established throughout the period studied here did little other than politicize the people and prepare it for action, while trying to promote its self-control and obedience in order to avoid eventual disorders and violent outbursts. Nor did they conceive the democratic regime as a system open to the creation of different competitive political groups, or even as a system allowing for political opposition and divergences which would need to be dealt with.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0265691413477611"><title>Epilogue: Towards a New Conception of Democracy</title>
<p>Even though its supporters were convinced that the Republic would ensure ‘the harmony of all interests’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0265691413477611">75</xref></sup> the 11-month long Spanish First Republic was marked by an intense political instability. This experience was crucial to promoting the emergence of new visions of democracy among some Republican groups. Although in this short article I cannot fully explore this complicated issue, I would like to highlight two important examples. On the one hand, the frequent popular riots culminating in the so-called ‘cantonal revolution’ – in which Federal Republicans in some towns in Andalusia, Valencia, Castilla and Murcia proclaimed independent cantons with the goal of establishing a free federation from the bottom up and of accelerating reforms – alienated many groups (essentially, Possibilists and Centralists) from Federalism and from any kind of direct democracy allowing autonomous political action by the people. They started actively to defend a regime capable of avoiding all kind of dangers – coming from above or from below – for freedom, and to champion the guidance of the people by ‘enlightened minds’. Prejudices against the people were not new, but previously it was considered possible to prevent excesses by educating the people and organizing them in highly hierarchical institutions such as the Militia or the secret societies. Some Democrats now began to focus on the need for a certain distance between the people and politics, and for the establishment of ‘a series of mediations between the political power and the social body’. That is, the creation of a system that would be truly representative – based on ‘universal’ male suffrage – but one in which decisions would be made in Parliament on the basis of debate and discussion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0265691413477611">76</xref></sup></p>
<p>At the same time, participating in government in 1873 provoked some early reflections on the exclusivism which characterized Spanish politics, preventing the foundation of a ‘solid, stable and permanent’ regime.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0265691413477611">77</xref></sup> Possibilist and Centralist groups started, as a result, to condemn the vision of different political options as armies at war, each aspiring to seize power by force. They now actively defended an institutional and legal political practice, as well as the replacement of revolution by reform.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0265691413477611">78</xref></sup> They started to display a more tolerant and pluralistic vision of politics, and to consider that political parties and all manifestations of diverse interests which contended in the public sphere were legitimate and even necessary, and should aspire to gain majority support by free discussion, by diffusion of their ideas in the press, and by the exercise of the liberties of assembly and association.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0265691413477611">79</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thus, even though certain groups such as Progressives and federals remained tied to a ‘culture of riot’ and direct democracy, a deep theoretical and organizational transformation in the democratic universe began, which increasingly displaced previous conspiratorial practices and replaced them by attitudes closer to those of what we consider <italic>modern</italic> democracy<italic>,</italic> based on pluralism, the representative principle, parliamentarianism and the defence of legality and institutions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0265691413477611">80</xref></sup> This, however, did not replace the rivalries and struggles for power among Democrats by a more flexible and conciliating attitude allowing for joint actions. In fact, during the Second Republic (1931–36), they were once again unable to form a stable coalition government, a failure that contributed to the weakening of the regime.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0265691413477611" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Spanish Democrats defended universal male suffrage and a set of civil, political and social rights. They stressed the need to represent all men’s individual interests and wills and they intended to fulfil the liberal ideal of independence and autonomy. Nevertheless, this did not result in a plural or individualistic conception of politics and society. Democrats did not seem to accept plurality of interests or parties; they generally distrusted representative systems and defended a direct and permanent control of MPs, considered as mandatories, who were in charge of executing a single popular will. They pleaded for immediate political action in the form of voting and vigilance, which was tightly related to their advocacy of federalism. Federalism had therefore more to do with guaranteeing the exercise of citizenship rights and freedom than with ideas about the most convenient State organization. Finally, voting was conceived of as more a symbol of belonging to the community than as a tool for political change. In this conception, any distortion of the political order was to be solved by an immediate and direct action and this hindered any possibility of peaceful resolution of political conflicts.</p>
<p>All this shows that, as Pierre Rosanvallon has pointed out, discourses or words apparently similar from one time to another can convey different conceptions of the principles that symbolically structure society.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0265691413477611">81</xref></sup> These conceptions must be analysed in order to foster an accurate comprehension of political and social change, as well as of the way people in the past understood and experienced politics. Spanish Democrats shared many assumptions with their European counterparts, especially with British radicals and French and Italian republicans – and the story of these connections and cultural exchanges has still not been fully explored – but they had their own context and experiences. These particularities, some of which have been presented in this article, influenced how things were conceived and debated as well as how conceptions changed and evolved, and, in short, shaped the Spanish course of democracy and of democratization.</p>

<fn id="fn6-0265691413477611"><label>6</label><p>The main difference between Moderates and Progressives was the extent to which they were willing to grant political rights and liberties. The former defended a constitutional monarchy with a very restricted social basis (determined by the payment of elevated property taxes), whereas Progressives favoured a wider integration. At the municipal level, for example, they accepted the election of town councils by indirect suffrage of all those inhabitants paying any kind of taxes. This resulted in a percentage of electors ranging from 66 to 83 per cent of the population.</p></fn>
