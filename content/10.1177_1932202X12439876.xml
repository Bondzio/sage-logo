<p>We are very pleased to be writing this forward to our second issue as editors. The number and quality of submissions to the journal continues to increase, and we now are able to move more rapidly from review to publication, thanks to the ScholarOne Manuscripts™ system provided for the journal by SAGE Publishing. As this issue is going to press, we have completed the reviews and decision process for the last few remaining manuscripts submitted under the old email-based review system. Having all manuscripts now in the same system will greatly improve the speed and ease with which we are able to move submissions through the review and decision process.</p>
<p>Our lead article in this issue is “Shaping Aspirations, Awareness, Academics, and Action: Outcomes of Summer Enrichment Programs for English-Learning Secondary Students.” Authors P. Matthews and Mellom report results that show promise in addressing the achievement gap. A variety of data support their finding that a relatively short summer enrichment program was successful in increasing students’ aspirations and behaviors in support of academic achievement, graduation, and college attendance.</p>
<p>Scott Peters and Marcia Gentry contribute “Group-Specific Norms and Teacher Rating Scales: Implications for Underrepresentation.” The authors show how an alternative identification system could result in the identification of more students from groups who have been underrepresented in advanced education programs. The authors insightfully discuss the programmatic and curricular implications of their proposed alternative identification model.</p>
<p>Australian author Mimi Wellisch brings us the article “An Integrated Identification and Intervention Model for Intellectually Gifted Children.” Building on the Differentiated Model of Giftedness and Talent proposed by Gagné, Wellisch proposes an inclusive model that would allow greater identification of students who are underachieving or who have dual exceptionalities.</p>
<p>We are very excited to note that this issue brings our first commentary and critique feature to the journal. Commentaries by Flint and Ritchotte, and by Peters, focus on the article “Differentiating Low Performance of the Gifted Learner: Achieving, Underachieving, and Selective Consuming Students” by Figg and colleagues, which was published in our February 2012 issue (23[1]). A response by Figg follows the commentaries. We intend to offer readers at least two such commentary-and-response features in each volume year, to stimulate conversations around important issues in our field.</p>
<p><italic>Journal of Advanced Academics</italic> has a long history of publishing work related to achievement and motivation, and this issue concludes with an interview with Allan Wigfield. As interviewer Hefer Benbenutty points out, Wigfield’s pioneering work with Eccles and others in developing the expectancy-value model of motivation has had a substantial impact on our understanding of this area of education. Benbenutty’s insightful questions and Wigfield’s firsthand accounts of his research and service contributions make for an informative introduction to these important topics.</p>
