<p>The book is a good attempt to highlight the contemporary issues in services trade. Theoretical exposition to various services trade modes including outsourcing and component trade forms the backbone for later discussions. Services trade related to production structure, immigration etc. is discussed with reference to their welfare implications. Change in structure of services is dealt with at length across developing countries. Travel and transport services have emerged as the leading exporting sectors over time for the developing countries. Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) is calculated for the various sectors to measure their competitiveness for selected developing countries.</p>
<p>Thereafter the authors turn their attention to trade in services in India. Services trade profile for the country and competitiveness have been discussed at length. Based on annualized growth rates of share of GDP, ‘communication’ services seems to have grown at the highest rate also attracting the highest share of inward FDI. In terms of exports, ‘financial and business services’ have grown at the highest rate between the year 2000 and 2007. In terms of change in composition of services, exports share of ‘travel’ have declined whereas share of ‘financial services’, ‘computer and information services’ and ‘personal, cultural and recreational services’ have gained importance between the years 2000 and 2010. This change is also reflected in the competitiveness measures (RCA). Authors briefly discuss India’s stance on services at WTO and domestic liberalization measures undertaken.</p>
<p>Services Trade Facilitation Index (STFI) is constructed comprising of indicators related to infrastructure availability across countries. Principal Component Analysis is used to construct this index. Scandinavian countries rank high in terms of trade facilitation. Most of the countries barring a few did not show changes in ranking over time implying rigidity to changes in facilitation measures. India ranks 32 among the countries included for analysis revealing a considerable scope for improvement in services trade facilitation.</p>
<p>The rest of the chapters are a collection of empirical work on various aspects of services trade. Services trade flows for India are analyzed through relationship with its determinants. Income per capita of trade partners and favourable exchange rates are found to be important determinants of India’s services exports. Trade barriers are found to be multiple and complex in nature. Trade in higher education services specifically between developing and developed countries is considered next. Authors find that higher per capita income growth in destination countries increases demand for foreign students to fill up the skill-labour requirements. A survey-based study on health services in India is mentioned in a separate chapter in the book. Authors use limited dependent variable models to judge the impact of various factors on perception about barriers to trade in health services. It is found that ‘age’ of the respondents has a negligible role in this regard whereas higher level of education and income reduces perceptions about potential barriers. In a rare attempt to link productivity to concentration of market power in the ‘shipping services sector’ in India, authors calculate the total factor productivity (TFP) of the ports across India and relate it to the concentration of market power among respective private container terminal operators. In most of the cases they find uni-directional causality from performance to traffic. A positive estimated relationship between TFP and concentration of market power index (HHI) reveals a tendency towards few operators running the show across the ports. The authors then go on to discuss the regulatory and reform issues in the shipping sector. They observe that infrastructure is mainly catering to coastal trade and imports and lack an export orientation. This problem is compounded by the fact that the levels of investment by both the Central and the State governments have been lower than the requirements of this sector.</p>
<p>Services trade and development linkages are explored by the authors in the Indian context. Through scatter plots and regression lines estimated thereof the authors show that per capita income is significantly positively affected by rise in per capita income from services (PCISE). Though PCISE have reduced poverty, its impact on inequality in India is rather weak. These findings are confirmed when the authors use Two-Stage Least Squares (TSLS) to estimate the impact of PCISE and other regressors on poverty and inequality. They further show that growth in PCISE has favoured skilled workers over un-skilled ones. Finally, the authors share some perspectives on how services sector can work for the poor in the long run. They emphasized the importance of generating demand for unskilled workers and reduce skill-gap through human resource development.</p>
<p>The book is a very first attempt to quantify the impacts of various determinants of services trade as well as quantifying the impact of services trade growth on indicators of development. By digging into their own research over the years the authors give us a glimpse of the relevant issues in services trade for India and developing countries at large. It is perhaps among the few books on this topic that have included both the theoretical as well as the empirical perspective in a single volume.</p>
<p>Despite these merits, lack of an integrated approach cannot be overlooked. The link between theoretical models in Chapter 1 and the subsequent chapters are not established. Though the appropriateness of a sectoral approach to analyze services trade issues is well recognized in the literature, lack of detailed analysis on important services sectors in India, like IT and business services limits the scope of the book in terms of relevant issues. The Bilateral issues related to trade negotiations among countries have not been given due importance. Given the fact that India has signed (and is going to sign many) a number of Regional Trading Agreements (RTAs) with services trade components, an analysis of such issues would have benefited not only the researchers in this area but the negotiators and policymakers who are plagued by lack of such studies. Lastly, a suggested methodology to capture services trade data would have added a lot of value to the content.</p>
