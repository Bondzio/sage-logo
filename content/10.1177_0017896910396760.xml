<p><bold>Objective</bold>: To investigate the duration, intensity and type of physical activity undertaken by people aged 60 years and over in relation to their reported levels of participation in social activities and their perceptions of their neighbourhood.</p>
<p><bold>Design</bold>: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey of older people attending two luncheon and eight social clubs in two London boroughs.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: The questionnaires were distributed to volunteers and sought information on the following topics: physical and social activities undertaken, perceived health and weight status, views about local amenities and neighbourhood, and demographic data.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: The sample comprised 225 adults aged 60 years and over (response rate: 88.6 per cent; mean age 75.0 years; 76.7 per cent women). Only 20.8 per cent of the sample met the recommended levels of physical activity if heavy housework and heavy gardening were not included, rising to 48.0 per cent when these activities were included. Reported good health status was strongly associated with higher levels of physical activity although physical activity significantly declined with advancing age. Living in an area with good recreational facilities and taking part in social entertainment were significantly associated with being physically active at the recommended levels.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions</bold>: Good health status is associated with levels of physical activity in older people. Heavy housework is an important physical activity and provides an activity for maintaining functional independence in old age.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There is strong evidence that the aging process is affected by health-related behaviours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0017896910396760">1</xref></sup>. Regular physical activity has been shown to have health benefits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0017896910396760">2</xref></sup>, producing improvements as well as maintaining health and physical and intellectual capability in old age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0017896910396760">3</xref></sup>. Physical activity can also prevent the onset of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0017896910396760">4</xref></sup>. It is recommended that adults aged 65 years and over should undertake a minimum of 30 minutes of moderate intensive physical activity at least 5 days a week, like younger adults but with consideration for age-appropriate intensity and type of activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0017896910396760">5</xref></sup>. Exercises to maintain flexibility and balance are also encouraged for this age group as a means of maintaining mobility and independence and thus less dependency upon others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0017896910396760">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0017896910396760">6</xref></sup>. With people living longer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0017896910396760">7</xref></sup> it is important to determine to what extent exercise and physical activity can improve health, functional capacity, and quality of life for this population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0017896910396760">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0017896910396760">9</xref></sup>. Household-related activities could be added to sports and recreational activities when estimating levels of physical activity in older adults, as domestic tasks contribute to increased levels of physical activity in older people<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896910396760">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896910396760">11</xref></sup>. Although household-related activities may neither increase physiological performance nor necessarily contribute sufficiently to levels yielding health benefits, older adults undertaking such activities are likely to maintain health, functional capacity and independence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0017896910396760">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896910396760">11</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>There is a growing body of literature about the relationship between physical activity and the social and the physical environment; however, relatively little is known about the interaction between these factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0017896910396760">12</xref></sup>, particularly in relation to older adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0017896910396760">13</xref></sup>. The physical environment plays an important role influencing physical activity passively through the design of the urban environment and buildings enabling physical activity opportunities that are accessible, convenient, safe, and appealing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0017896910396760">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0017896910396760">15</xref></sup>, so that levels of physical activity tend to be significantly higher in places with attractive parks and enjoyable scenery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0017896910396760">16</xref></sup>. Similarly, high levels of walking and engagement in other physical activities have been associated with good access to sport and leisure facilities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0017896910396760">17</xref></sup>. Convenience and access to formal (e.g. golf courses, swimming pools) and informal (e.g. parks, biking trails) activity facilities are likely to act as enablers to physical activity amongst older people<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896910396760">11</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The health benefits of social integration and social support include physical health outcomes including lower mortality risk, and better mental health with a protective effect on depression and cognitive impairment are widely known<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0017896910396760">18</xref></sup>. Further, being surrounded by friends who encourage exercise, having at least one friend with whom to exercise, and doing exercise in areas in which many people exercise are factors associated with higher levels of sustainable physical activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0017896910396760">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0017896910396760">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0017896910396760">20</xref></sup>. In older adults there is evidence of decreased social interaction with increased physical health impairment with statistically significant correlations between the perception of the social environment and participation in activities of daily living<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0017896910396760">21</xref></sup>. Additionally, affluent neighbourhoods with facilities for those over 65 years have been associated with higher levels of engagement in social activities, with the older adults’ perceptions of their neighbourhood being important for engagement in social activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0017896910396760">13</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The study objectives were: (1) to investigate the duration, intensity and type of physical activity undertaken by people aged 60 years and over; (2) to investigate reported levels of participation in social activities and perceptions of the neighbourhood; and (3) to investigate the relationships between health status, reported levels of participation in social activities, perceptions of the neighbourhood and physical activity undertaken by people aged 60 years and over.</p>
<sec id="section3-0017896910396760">
<title>Study design</title>
<p>A survey was conducted using a 30-item self-complete structured questionnaire. The questionnaire drew upon relevant literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0017896910396760">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0017896910396760">22</xref></sup> and collected data relating to physical activity, social activity, perceptions of their neighbourhood, health status and demographic data including their last main job and perceived body shape using nine alternative silhouettes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0017896910396760">23</xref></sup> as a proxy for their BMI.</p>
<p>Data were collected from people over 60 years of age attending 10 selected venues (2 lunch and 8 social clubs) situated in 2 inner London boroughs with large populations of older people and health inequalities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0017896910396760">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0017896910396760">25</xref></sup> over 6 weeks (May to July 2009). Ethical approval was given by the Research Ethics Committee of King’s College London.</p>
<p>All statistical analyses used STATA version 9.2 (Stata, College Station, Texas, USA). The level of significance was defined as <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05. For the purpose of bivariate analysis of performed physical activity including heavy housework and heavy gardening participants were divided into whether they met the recommended levels of five periods of 30 minutes of physical activity a week (i.e. being sufficiently active). The variables sufficiently active and insufficiently active were coded so that an increased odds ratio indicated an increased likelihood of being sufficiently active. A forward stepwise selection procedure was then performed. With the exception of the variables closely related to light exercise such as light housework, light gardening, sitting activities and walking for any reason, the variables that constantly showed significant results became reference categories. Categorical variables allowed for comparison of proportions using the chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test when frequencies were less than five participants. The <italic>t</italic>-test was used for the variable age, which is continuous and was therefore compared by the mean value<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0017896910396760">26</xref></sup>. Due to the small sample, the bivariate analysis indicated very small values and categories were therefore combined consistently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0017896910396760">27</xref></sup>. The Standard Occupation Classification (SOC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0017896910396760">28</xref></sup> was used to determine the participants’ social class based on their last main job.</p>

<title>Characteristics of the participants</title>
<p>The sample comprised 225 older people (88.6 per cent response rate) of whom 76.7 per cent were women with a mean age of 75.0 years (range 60–99 years, SD 8.79). One-fifth (20.8 per cent) of the sample reported living outside the two study boroughs. The majority of the sample were White British (71.2 per cent) and lived alone (74.9 per cent) and most of the sample reported a good health status (good 61.9 per cent; very good 23.9 per cent). High blood pressure was the most commonly reported health problem (46.4 per cent) followed by arthritis (37.5 per cent).</p>

<sec id="section6-0017896910396760">
<title>Health status</title>
<p>Younger age (Fisher’s exact=0.007; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0017896910396760">Table 1</xref>), being black (Fisher’s exact=0.034) and reporting (very) good health status (<italic>p</italic> = 0.002) were associated with being physically active at recommended levels in the bivariate analysis. Gender, borough of residence, living alone, educational level, and social class were not significantly associated with meeting the physical activity recommendations. Although not statistically significant, participants who reported that they have or had chronic breathing problems (<italic>p</italic> = 0.064) or a stroke (<italic>p</italic> = 0.058) within the last 10 years tended to be less active. Health problems not significantly associated with meeting the physical activity recommendations were heart problems, cancer, high blood pressure, arthritis, broken hip or arm in the last 10 years, diabetes, being a smoker or overweight/obese. Just over one-third (35.6 per cent) of the sample reported a body shape corresponding to normal weight and over half (54.2 per cent) of the sample reported a body shape corresponding to being overweight (44.9 per cent) or obese (9.3 per cent).</p>

<p>In the multivariate analysis, age (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), borough of residence (<italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and reported health status (<italic>p</italic> = 0.037) became statistically significant on a 95 per cent confidence interval level. Although not statistically significant, current smokers (OR 0.39, CI 0.10 to 1.53) and previous smokers (OR 0.68, CI 0.35 to 1.35) tended to be less physically active. Participants who classified themselves as Black reported being more than two times more active than White participants (OR 2.59, CI 0.66 to 10.12) although this was not statistically significant.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0017896910396760">
<title>Physical activity</title>
<p>Only 20.8 per cent of the sample reported recommended activity levels (moderate to intense and/or strenuous exercise at recommended levels [5 periods of 30 minutes of exercise; 2.5 hours a week] or more); see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0017896910396760">Table 2</xref>. When heavy housework and heavy gardening were added to the activities 48.0 per cent of the sample met the recommended activity levels. Performing light housework, light gardening, walking outside for any reason and the number of flights of stairs climbed weekly correlated with being physically active at recommended levels in both the bivariate and multivariate analyses. Sitting activities and caring for another person such as spouse or dependent child were not statistically significant, although the odds of being classified as active increased with the number of hours spent caring for another person. Working for pay or as a volunteer was not associated with being physically active (<italic>p</italic> = 0.080), however, the type of activity such work involved was statistically significant in the multivariate analysis (<italic>p</italic> = 0.019) although the confidence intervals were wide (work that requires walking and carrying materials; <italic>p</italic> = 0.019, OR 11.97, CI 0.92 to 156.29).</p>

<title>Neighbourhood</title>
<p>The majority of participants reported having access to good facilities (public outdoor areas, transport system, closeness to shops, leisure and social facilities in general, social facilities for people aged 60 years and over, recreational areas for exercising, closeness to local health services, and litter and rubbish collection) in their neighbourhood (79.5 per cent) but 26.8 per cent of the sample reported perceived problems in their neighbourhood (speed and volume of traffic, noise, crime, air pollution, and, graffiti and vandalism). Although not statistically significant the odds of being physically active tended to be 33.0 per cent higher among participants who reported feeling safe walking outside when dark (OR 1.33). Participants who reported being physically active for at least 2.5 hours a week also tended to be more likely to take public transport (3–4 times a week OR 2.60; 5 times or more a week OR 2.04). Participants who met the recommended levels of physical activity were significantly more likely to report good facilities for exercising (<italic>p</italic> = 0.047) in their neighbourhood. Also the odds of being physically active tended to be higher among those who reported good leisure and social facilities in general (OR 1.88, CI 0.42 to 8.53) and among those who reported good facilities for people aged 60 years and over (OR 1.26, CI 0.39 to 4.07). Although noise was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.058, OR 0.51, CI 0.26 to 1.03), there was a trend between being sufficiently active and reporting noise as not being a problem in the local neighbourhood. However, being sufficiently active was not associated with living in an area where graffiti and vandalism were not problems (OR 0.57, CI 0.22 to 1.45).</p>

The odds of being physically active for 2.5 hours or more a week also increased with having face-to-face contact with a family member or a friend 3-4 times a week (OR 1.29, CI 0.55 to 3.04) whereas having face-to-face contact 5 times or more a week, taking part in neighbourhood issues, being in a religious group, visits to the library or any other activity were not related to reported physical activity. Although all participants attended the data collection club/venue, being engaged in a local organisation (OR 1.54, CI 0.78 to 3.05) tended to be associated with more physically activity. There were no differences between those engaged in one or several social activities, although those spending more time on social activities were more likely to be physically active (Fisher’s exact=0.022) but this was not statistically significant in the multivariate analysis.</p>

<title>Characteristics of the sample</title>
<p>The proportion of active participants (20.8 per cent) appeared to be higher than the national average<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0017896910396760">29</xref></sup>, however, the proportion of physically active adults aged 16 years and over is significantly higher in these two boroughs than the English average<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0017896910396760">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0017896910396760">25</xref></sup>. More of the sample reported living alone than in previous similar studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0017896910396760">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0017896910396760">30</xref></sup>, which probably reflected sample recruitment from lunch clubs and social settings where social interaction might have been a reason for attendance. Bowling and Stafford<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0017896910396760">13</xref></sup> also found high levels of social activity were greater for older adults living alone.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0017896910396760">
<title>Health status</title>
<p>In contrast to this study’s findings physical symptoms and health conditions such as heart disease have been associated with less physical activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896910396760">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896910396760">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0017896910396760">30</xref></sup>. Lack of such an association in this study could be due to the limited number of health conditions within the questionnaire or self-selection of the sample to the data collection venues.</p>
<p>The participants were not aware of that the body silhouettes represented BMI values and therefore it was interesting that 44.8 per cent of the sample reported a body shape indicating being overweight. The Health Survey for England<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0017896910396760">29</xref></sup> had similar findings with 49 per cent of men and 38 per cent of women aged 65-74 years being overweight and amongst those aged 75 years and over 51 per cent of men and 42 per cent of women were overweight.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0017896910396760">
<title>Physical activity</title>
<p>Only 20.8 per cent met the recommended levels of physical activity if heavy housework was excluded which was similar to Lawlor et al’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896910396760">10</xref></sup> findings and confirms that domestic activities have important health benefits, particularly for older adults. This study, like others, found that activity levels reduced with age and the oldest participants did not participate in strenuous exercise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0017896910396760">31</xref></sup>. No previous research has examined ethnic differences in reported physical activity levels, however, why Blacks were about 2.6 times more active than Whites is unknown although part of the explanation may relate to more heavy housework over longer periods of time every week.</p>
<p>Only 4.4 per cent of the sample reported never walking outside at all and almost half of the sample (48.8 per cent) reported walking outside daily for at least 2 hours. Walking has repeatedly been reported as the most common form of physical activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0017896910396760">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0017896910396760">31</xref></sup> and even if the speed and effort is not equivalent to moderate exercise it can contribute to independent living and mental wellbeing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0017896910396760">32</xref></sup>. There are seasonal differences in physical activity with adults in the United Kingdom walking significantly less in the winter compared to the summer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0017896910396760">33</xref></sup> and it is also likely that even if housework is undertaken all year round, levels of such activity may differ in the winter months.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0017896910396760">
<title>Neighbourhood</title>
<p>Reporting good local facilities and very few problems in the neighbourhood echoed previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896910396760">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0017896910396760">13</xref></sup>. Interestingly a significantly higher proportion of participants living in one of the two boroughs reported being significantly more physically active (<italic>p</italic> = 0.005) than those living elsewhere despite national statistics indicating great inequalities within the data collection boroughs.</p>
<p>Living in a neighbourhood with good facilities has been associated with a greater likelihood of being physically active<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0017896910396760">17</xref></sup>. Participants who were sufficiently physically active were more likely to report good facilities for exercising (<italic>p</italic> = 0.047) compared to those who reported insufficient physically activity. This finding is similar to that of Bowling and Stafford<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0017896910396760">13</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Very few neighbourhood indicators correlated with reported physical activity levels. Previous studies have presented weak evidence between physical activity levels and the local physical environment regardless of whether the local facilities have been self-reported or objectively measured<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896910396760">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0017896910396760">17</xref></sup>. It may be that inactive participants are less cognisant of their neighbourhood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896910396760">11</xref></sup> or that they do not know their area very well as they undertake their shopping and other activities elsewhere.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0017896910396760">
<title>Social activities and social contact</title>
<p>Due to the recruitment method all participants were engaged in at least one social activity, however, the number of activities attended was not related to the reported levels of physical activity. Nonetheless the time spent on social activities tended to be positively correlate with high levels of physical activity but this correlation was only significant in the bivariate analysis, although such an association in the multivariate analysis may have been expected since social integration and health are strongly associated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0017896910396760">34</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Whilst most social activities were not associated significantly with physical activity levels, taking part in social entertainment was strongly associated with higher levels of physically activity. This reinforces the positive association between physical activity and wellbeing noted by McAuley et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0017896910396760">35</xref></sup> and may reflect social class and health status which influence people’s behaviour and are strongly associated with wealth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0017896910396760">34</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Having face-to-face contact with a family member or friend 3-4 times a week was related to higher levels of physical activity (OR 1.29, CI 0.55 to 3.04) while 5 times or more contacts a week were not related to increased physical activity (OR 0.99, CI 0.46 to 2.12). It is likely that those reporting five times or more contacts had more complex lives including living with a dependent spouse, which could limit their time for non-essential activities such as exercise although the importance of activities beyond caring are well documented<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896910396760">10</xref></sup>. Thus, the context of individual lives need to be considered.</p>

<sec id="section16-0017896910396760">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This was a small-scale study that cannot be considered representative of the older adult population of England. Further the sample recruitment method is likely to have introduced bias as it excluded both housebound older people and those not attending lunch or social clubs. Data on local facilities and social environmental indicators was solely from the perspective of the sample and was not verified objectively.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Reporting good health status was strongly associated with higher levels of physical activity although physical activity significantly declined with advancing age. Heavy housework contributed greatly to the overall level of physical activity, which suggests that it is an important component for maintaining functional independence in old age.</p>
<p>Living in a neighbourhood with good recreational facilities for exercise, and taking part in social entertainment significantly increased the odds of being physically active and having face-to-face contact with a family member or a friend 3-4 times a week tended to be associated with higher levels of physical activity. However, further research is needed to understand the environmental and social determinants of activity levels in older adults if health promotion programmes are to be effective. It will also be important to understand the different needs of different older adults as they are a heterogeneous population.</p>
