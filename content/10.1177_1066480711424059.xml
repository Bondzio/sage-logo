<abstract>
<p>The structure-related validity and internal consistency reliability of the translated version of the Adlerian Parental Assessment of the Child Behavior Scale (APACBS) which would be referred to as the Lithuanian APACBS (LAPACBS) was the focus of the research study. A factor analysis was performed using a sample of 246 Lithuanian parents. It revealed a four-factor construct related to the parental assessment of child’s behavior: (a) responsible behavior subscale; (b) emotionally charged behavior subscale; (c) school task subscale; and (d) peer relationship subscale. Furthermore, the adequate levels of internal consistency of the LAPACBS subscales as well as the entire instrument were demonstrated. Cronbach’s αs ranged from .62 to .90 and the correlational analysis showed moderate-to-strong relation between the four subscales with absolute values of Pearson correlation coefficient ranging from .26 to .69. However, further research with a more balanced gender and geographical representation is needed on the analysis of the psychometric properties of this research tool.</p>

<body>
<p>A wide range of Adlerian research tools have been developed over the years to explore parents’ perceptions of children’s behavior in the family setting (Buri, 1991; Croake &amp; Hinkle, 1978; Dagley &amp; Dagley, 1994; Freeman, Croake, &amp; Hinkle, 1978; McKay, 1967; Shaw &amp; Right, 1967; as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066480711424059">Thaler, 2002</xref>). Most of them such as Attitude Toward Child Rearing Scale (Croake &amp; Hinkle, 1978), Children’s Behavior Checklist (Freeman et al., 1978), and others have been used for measuring the effectiveness of Adlerian parent training programs (as cited in Thaler, 2002).</p>
<p>The Adlerian Parental Assessment of the Child Behavior Scale (APACBS; McKay, 1976) has been one of the most frequently used instruments to assess parents’ perceptions of child behavior related to a variety of Adlerian-based parent education programs (Systematic Training for Effective Parenting [STEP]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066480711424059">Dinkmeyer, McKay, &amp; Dinkmeyer, 1997</xref>; Active Parenting; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066480711424059">Popkin, 1993</xref>, etc.). The APACBS has been used to assess Adlerian-based parent education programs nationally and internationally for approximately 40 years (Bauer, 1977; Catania, 1985; Clarkson, 1978; Cronauer, 1981; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066480711424059">Fennell &amp; Fishel, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066480711424059">Gillette, 1989</xref>; Vesper, 1985; Wantz &amp; Recor, 1984, and others; as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066480711424059">Gibson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066480711424059">Newlon, Borboa, &amp; Arciniega, 1986</xref>). In fact, the search of all the studies available in our library on parent education which we determined showed that this instrument was used more than any other instrument to assess parent education programs based on the principles of individual psychology.</p>
<p>However, one of the major issues related to the instrument is the lack of studies that focus on the psychometric properties of the APACBS. This becomes of utmost importance for making any generalizations of significant findings that may have occurred related to experimental treatment procedures. The issues of reliability as well as validity of the instrument need to be addressed carefully before users can draw conclusions about the utility and integrity of a particular study and theoretical constructs. Regardless of the theory base of the study, researchers must have confidence that the measurement tool that is used is psychometrically sound, that is, the instrument measures the construct which it is intended to measure (construct validity) and that the instrument is reliable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066480711424059">Borsboom, Mellenbergh, &amp; Heerden, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066480711424059">DeVon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066480711424059">Flay et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>To date the only psychometric data reported on the APACBS addresses reliability issues. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066480711424059">McKay (1976)</xref>, the internal consistency reliability coefficient (Cronbach’s α) of the APACBS ranged from .90 to .91 in a pilot study and from .81 to .89 in his research project. The test–retest reliability (Pearson <italic>r</italic> test) yielded coefficients of .97 in a pilot study and .83 in the research project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066480711424059">McKay, 1976</xref>). Most other studies, which were reported in the United States that employed the instrument, were dissertation projects (such as Bauer, 1977; Catania, 1985; Clarkson, 1978; Gruen, 1978; Krieg, 1985; Vesper, 1985; Weaver, 1985, etc.; as cited in Gibson, 1999). When psychometric properties were addressed in these studies, they were those that were reported by the original author of the instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066480711424059">Fennell &amp; Fishel, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066480711424059">Newlon et al., 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, when reviewing the use of the instrument related to cross-cultural adaptations, only the Spanish and Chinese versions of the APACBS were found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066480711424059">Gillette, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066480711424059">Newlon et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066480711424059">Yuk-Ching, 1993</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066480711424059">Yuk-Ching (1993)</xref> reported the Cronbach’s α (.85) for the internal consistency reliability in her study. The researchers using the APACBS adapted for the Spanish version did not report any psychometrics related to the instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066480711424059">Gillette, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066480711424059">Newlon et al., 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>After searching numerous databases (EBSCO Publishing, ScienceDirect, Wiley Online Library), no additional studies could be identified that addressed construct validity or reliability issues of the APACBS in the literature. This void of studies related to other psychometric properties such as content or criterion validity interferes with researcher’s efforts to reliably validate theoretical constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066480711424059">DeVon et al., 2007</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066480711424059">Stone &amp; Newbauer, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Need for the Study</title>
<p>Individual Psychology has a rich history related to parent education. The APACBS was developed to help the users of Adlerian-based parenting programs and specifically, the STEP program, to measure the success of these particular psychoeducational models. With pressure from funding agencies and professional organizations to move toward more evidence-based parenting programs coupled with the extensive use of the APACBS to measure the effectiveness of these programs, it was surprising to discover that there was so little research conducted on the psychometric properties of the APACBS. This makes it problematic related to the generalizability of findings related to the instrument. This becomes of even more concern if researchers and practitioners wish to translate the instrument for use in another country.</p>
<p>In that one of the authors of this study is conducting a research study using the STEP program with a Lithuanian parent sample and employing the APACBS instrument as one part of the posttreatment assessment, the need to establish additional evidence of the reliability and validity of the instrument became a prerequisite for the generalizability of the results of the study. In addition, to adapt the instrument to another language requires the researcher to conduct the translation of the instrument, which is linguistically correct and culturally sensitive to the sample under investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066480711424059">Beaton, Bombardier, Guillemin, &amp; Ferraz, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066480711424059">International Test Commission, 2010</xref>). Consequently, the development of the Lithuanian APACBS will require an appropriate translation of the instrument adhering to the international standard test translations as well as addressing the construct validity and reliability issues.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The sample consisted of 246 parents recruited for this research from nine schools or other public institutions in Lithuania. The majority of participants were mothers (<italic>N</italic> = 219; 89%), Lithuanians (<italic>N</italic> = 239; 97%), and the age range was 24–59 (mean age = 37.01 years, standard deviation [<italic>SD</italic>] = 5.893 with no statistically significant difference between mothers and fathers). Forty-seven percent of the sample was well educated and graduated from a university, 23% graduated from secondary school, and 23% from college, and 5% completed basic school.</p>
<p>The number of children in families from which the sample was taken ranged from one to eight (mean number = 1.97, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.99). Participants reported on 238 target children (116 boys and 122 girls; 8 were identified as missing values) ranging from 4 to 13 years (mean age = 9.38 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.65 with no statistically significant difference between boys and girls).</p>

<title>Instruments</title>
<p>The APACBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066480711424059">McKay, 1976</xref>) was originally developed to test parents’ perceptions of typical 6- to 12-year-olds’ behavior, who participated in Adlerian-based parent education programs. APACBS is a time-efficient instrument and consists of 32 items. Parents are asked to identify the child in the family that may be most challenging and rate the behavior of the child on a 7-point Likert-type scale. The instrument includes items related to responsible behavior (e.g., considering parents’ feelings, sharing problems, doing chores without reminding, etc.) and irresponsible child behaviors (e.g., arguing, disturbing when driving, involving parents in verbal arguments, or physical fights with other children, etc.).</p>
<p>Computing the APACBS total score was suggested by the author of the instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066480711424059">McKay, 1976</xref>). The scale contains randomly assigned positive and negative items. The positive items are scored from 7 to 1 and the negative ones from 1 to 7. The highest possible score is 224 (the higher the total score, the more positive parental perception of the target child’s behavior is).</p>
<p>The content validity of the scale was determined by three judges familiar with STEP and other Adlerian-based programs (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066480711424059">Newlon et al., 1986</xref>). The analysis of internal consistency and test–retest reliability for the APACBS showed that the items were consistent with each other and stable over a period of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066480711424059">McKay, 1976</xref>). According to the author of the instrument, the internal consistency reliability coefficient (Cronbach’s α) of the APACBS ranged from .90 to .91 in a pilot study and from .81 to .89 in his research project; the test–retest reliability (Pearson <italic>r</italic> test) yielded coefficients of .97 in a pilot study and .83 in the research project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066480711424059">McKay, 1976</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1066480711424059">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>Permission for translating the instrument was obtained from the author of the instrument. The translation was organized following the procedure of back-forward translation according to recommendations prepared by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1066480711424059">van de Vijver and Hambleton (1996)</xref>. One of the authors of this publication translated the instrument, and the translated items were reviewed by a Lithuanian language expert. This was followed by two bilingual (talking Lithuanian and English) psychologists translating the instrument back to the English language. All translations (the original and back translated by two experts items) were reviewed and analyzed by a psychologist whose native language was English. Difficult items (No. 19, 28) were discussed after the back-forward translation and corrected by translators proficient in both languages.</p>
<p>The data-gathering procedure with the completed instrument was conducted during the 2009–2010 time period. It was organized in three steps which employed one of the following methods for recruiting participants. Twelve percent or 30 parents for the sample completed the questionnaire during regular meetings at school. The second phase of the data collection process included sending letters and testing packets home with children from the school inviting parents to participate in the research and giving specific instructions related to blocks of time to return the materials. Sixty-two percent (152 parents) of the sample was collected by this method. The final number of participants was collected (64 parents or 26% of the sample) during the first session of STEP project.</p>
<p>The number of participants was a convenience sample of parents who volunteered to participate in the study. Testing packets for all the three methods included envelope, informed consent form, demographic information questionnaire, LAPACBS, and several other questionnaires related to parents’ behavior with children (these are not analyzed in this publication). All packets were designed to meet the professional requirement of confidentiality and privacy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1066480711424059">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Several analyses were conducted to explore the psychometric properties of the Lithuanian APACBS. First, a binary logistic regression statistical analysis was conducted to determine whether mothers and fathers responded in a similar way to each of the items on the instrument. Second, an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted to assess the structure-related validity of the LAPACBS. Finally, Cronbach’s αs and Pearson intercorrelation coefficients were calculated to assess the internal consistency of the subscales extracted. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 15 was used for these analyses.</p>

<title>Item Analysis of the LAPACBS for Mothers’ and Fathers’ Samples</title>
<p>The enter method of binary logistic regression, wherein all significant items in a block were entered in a single step, was used. Omnibus tests of model coefficients for step, block, and model (χ<sup>2</sup> = 37.16, <italic>p</italic> = .24) indicated that none of the LAPACBS items in the model were statistically significant for predicting the occurrence of dependant variable when analyzed together. Nagelkerke’s <italic>r</italic>
<sup>2</sup> coefficient (.28) indicated that the proportion of dependant variable’s (parent’s gender) variance explained by the block of LAPACBS items was low.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when individual LAPACBS items in the regression model were analyzed, only 3 items (No. 7, 15, and 32) were found to explain statistically significant variance in parent’s gender. The logistic regression model estimates (such as β coefficients [B], their standard errors [<italic>SE</italic>], the Wald χ<sup>2</sup> statistic, associated <italic>p</italic> values, and odds ratio [Exp(B)]) for them are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1066480711424059">Table 2</xref>

<p>The results indicated that parents’ responses to Items No. 7 (<italic>involves you in resolving physical fights with other children</italic>) and No. 32 (<italic>is quiet after going to bed</italic>) had statistically significant negative influence, and No. 15 (<italic>is on time for meals</italic>) indicated a statistically significant positive influence on predicting parent’s gender. In that there were few items where there was disagreement by gender on the instrument, it was decided that it was safe to further investigate construct and internal consistency reliability issues for mothers’ and fathers’ samples together.</p>

<title>Factor Analysis of the LAPACBS</title>
<p>An EFA was performed on 32 items to explore the factorial structure of the LAPACBS. The more acute principal axis factoring method of factor extraction was chosen for estimating the communalities without unique and error variance from variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1066480711424059">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2007</xref>). An oblique promax rotation to factor extraction was added because of the expected correlation between factors.</p>
<p>Several EFAs were conducted for the purpose of extracting the clearest and the best interpretable factorial structure. Initially, the primary analysis revealed eight factors with Eigenvalues greater than 1 which accounted for 62% of the variance. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy was very high at .87 and the Bartlett’s test of sphericity was highly significant (Test value = 2974.88, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) indicating that the data could be used for EFA. However, several factors in the eight-factor solution were extremely weak and had factor loadings lower than .32. A scree plot was drawn and a break point at the forth or fifth data point was identified. After more thorough examination, the four-factor solution for the instrument was found to be the best fit for the data. The results of four-factor EFA solution, showing complete item-factor loading matrix and the percentage of total variance accounted for by each factor are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1066480711424059">Table 3</xref>
. Only items that reached .32 and above loading were considered as significantly contributing to the factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066480711424059">Costello &amp; Osborne, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1066480711424059">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2007</xref>).

<p>A description of the four identified factors includes the following. Factor 1 (<italic>N</italic> = 15 items) consisted of situations characterized by target child’s positive behaviors. We named this factor as the responsible behavior subscale. These items include situations where a target child demonstrated his or her independence (e.g., (9) <italic>figures out solutions to his/ her own problems</italic>; (30) <italic>remembers where (s)he puts personal belongings</italic>), responsibility (e.g., (23) <italic>cleans up after snacking without being reminded</italic>; (28) <italic>stays with difficult tasks until they are completed</italic>), and readiness to cooperate (e.g., (16) <italic>eats most food offered without being coaxed</italic>; (10) <italic>changes behavior when told that it bothers you</italic>).</p>
<p>Factor 2 (<italic>N</italic> = 8 items) included a large number of emotionally challenging situations such as any target child’s misbehavior that caused parents’ feelings of frustration (e.g., (26) <italic>behaves in such a way that you find yourself feeling discouraged, believing that the child cannot improve</italic>), angriness (e.g., (27) <italic>behaves in such a way that you find yourself feeling angry</italic>), annoyance (e.g., (25) <italic>behaves in such a way that you find yourself feeling annoyed</italic>), and so on. The Items No. 19, 21 related to the target child’s temper tantrums and inconsideration of parental feelings were also involved. Accordingly, the Factor 2 may be best conceptualized as representing target child’s emotionally challenging behaviors. We named this factor as the emotionally charged behavior subscale.</p>
<p>Factor 3 (<italic>N</italic> = 3 items) was found to be items related to the school such as <italic>leaving for school</italic> (Item No. 4), <italic>getting dressed for school</italic> (Item No. 2), and <italic>remembering to take all possessions necessary</italic> (Item No. 3). We identified this factor as the school task subscale.</p>
<p>Factor 4 (<italic>N</italic> = 3 items) which we identified as issues related to peer relationships and parents included situations where the child involved parents in <italic>solving verbal arguments</italic> (Item No. 6), <italic>physical fights</italic> (Item No. 7), and <italic>tattling on other children</italic> (Item No. 18). The final factor was named the peer relationship subscale. The internal consistency reliability for APACBS and the four APACBS factors are reported in the analysis to follow.</p>

<p>The correlational analysis showed moderate-to-strong relation between the four subscales of the instrument with absolute values of Pearson correlation coefficient ranging from .26 to .69 (according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066480711424059">Field, 2005</xref>). The subscales <italic>responsible behavior</italic> and <italic>emotionally charged behavior</italic> correlated negatively (−.69), which was expected in that the scales assess positive and negative attributes of the parent–child interaction.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first investigation of the psychometric properties of APACBS with a Lithuanian parent sample. Moreover, this is the first study conducted on the factorial structure of the instrument. The findings of this research are critical for others who wish to conduct studies employing the APACBS in other cultures. These findings related to reliability and the four-factor construct of parental assessment of child behavior provide other researchers with a framework to assess if the instrument is reliable and if these factors are supported in other cultures.</p>
<p>Our findings revealed that the translated instrument (LAPACBS) had similar internal consistency reliability properties as the original APACBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066480711424059">McKay, 1976</xref>). The Cronbach’s α coefficient for the overall scale was of high magnitude (.90) showing high intercorrelations between items. Similar adequacy of internal consistency reliability was reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066480711424059">McKay (1976)</xref> for the English version (Cronbach’s α was equal to .81 to .91) and other investigators for translated versions, for example, Chinese—.85 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066480711424059">Yuk-Ching, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Our identification of four subscales provides additional support related to the construct validity of the Lithuanian instrument. These subscales in summary include what we have named as <italic>responsible behavior subscale</italic> of 15 items that includes items related to positive behavior of the targeted child (1, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 23, 28, 30, 31, and 32), <italic>emotionally charged behavior subscale</italic> of 8 items that focus on items that are conflictual in nature (19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 26, 27, and 29), <italic>school task subscale</italic> of 3 items which address the presence of school preparation behavior (2, 3, and 4), and the final <italic>peer relationship subscale</italic> consisting of items that assess troubled interactions with other children (6, 7, and 18).</p>
<p>Internal consistencies were satisfactory for all the subscales (Cronbach’s α ranged from .62 to .87), which were significantly interrelated to each other—in a positive or negative way depending on the nature of the subscales. Such a four-factor solution appears to be logical and easily interpretable. Though, the first two subscales aid in evaluating target child’s behavior considering the overall positive (<italic>responsible behavior subscale</italic>) as well as negative (<italic>emotionally charged behavior subscale</italic>) issues, the two other subscales (<italic>School Task</italic> and <italic>Peer Relationship</italic>) are more specific. However, the underlying themes for these subscales fit well with the child’s everyday life situations: going to school and communicating with other children of similar age.</p>
<p>Since the four-factor model of the LAPACBS suggested by the current research is the first attempt to explore the factorial structure of the original instrument, no further analysis evaluating the overlap of the factorial model with other research is possible. Nevertheless, the results of this investigation suggest that the LAPACBS has acceptable internal consistency reliability and is similar to the original APACBS English version. In addition to that, the identification of the four factors provides valuable information for the users as well as those who wish to continue research on the original instrument or translated versions. With the identification of the four LAPACBS subscales it provides extensive possibilities for cross-validation studies with different instruments, correlation of subscales with lifestyle information of parents, and information for practitioners to assess the impact of parent education programs based on the principles of individual psychology.</p>
<sec id="section13-1066480711424059">
<title>Limitations and Suggestions for Future Research</title>
<p>An obvious limitation of the study is a potential lack of generalizability of the results in that the majority of the parent sample was mothers (89%) and selected from two cities in Lithuania. Though the performed analysis indicated little difference between males’ and females’ item response on the instrument, this lack of balance of gender of parents in the study may bring into question the reliability and factors that were identified in the LAPACBS. Second, the sample size of 246 parents could also be a potential limitation. Consequently, additional data from a broader range of Lithuanian parents with a more balanced gender and geographical representation would be helpful to replicate the internal consistency reliability and structure-related validity of the instrument. Given these findings of the EFA, it is proposed that the next step might be to conduct a confirmatory factor analysis study to establish the functioning of the LAPACBS factorial structure over time and in other cross-cultural settings. Exploring other psychometric properties such as content or criterion validity as well as test–retest reliability would also be informative for possible users of the LAPACBS.</p>
<p>Even with the forgoing limitations, the importance of the current study is that this is the first attempt to explore the internal consistency reliability of APACBS for a Lithuanian parent sample and the first study to address the factorial structure of the APACBS. The results of this study provide important information for future researchers to investigate the psychometric properties of the LAPACBS and the original instrument more thoroughly. We believe that based on our findings of acceptable internal consistency reliability and sufficient construct-related validity related to the Lithuanian instrument, it is safe for researchers to continue to expand on the research of this study, and practitioners to use the instrument to measure the effectiveness of Adlerian parent training programs. Finally, in that this analysis was completed on a Lithuanian sample, it is suggested that a similar analysis be conducted on samples in other countries and in particular North America where the majority of the studies have used this instrument. We believe this research has created a natural link for a number of studies that could be conducted by students in university settings and other researchers.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The findings of the current study show that the LAPACBS has acceptable internal consistency reliability that is similar to the original APACBS English version. Furthermore, the 32-item LAPACBS has a more specified factorial structure and consists of four adequately reliable subscales: (a) <italic>responsible behavior</italic>, (b) <italic>emotionally charged behavior</italic>, (c) <italic>school task</italic>; and (d) <italic>peer relationship</italic>. The logical and easily interpretable nature of the four subscales supports the construct-related validity of the scale. However, though this research is the first attempt to translate and adapt the APACBS for a Lithuanian parent sample, we believe this is a valuable first step for other researchers to continue studies related to Lithuanian parent samples. We also believe that a similar study needs to be conducted in North America where the majority of research has been conducted on the original instrument.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the practical application of this study is that researchers and practitioners in Lithuania now have some form of reliable instrument to measure outcome results for parent education programs based on the principles of individual psychology. We conclude by stating that we are encouraged with the identification of the four factors related to the LAPACBS. We believe we have provided school psychologist, counselors, consultants, and parent educators with an instrument that may be used to provide parents with more clearly targeted feedback that would help them to be more encouraging with the child or children who experience difficulties in the family.</p>
