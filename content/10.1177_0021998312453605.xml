<abstract>
<p>The thermal performance of fibrous lightweight aggregate concrete short columns was investigated in terms of compressive mechanical response and thermal and load cracking patterns and characteristics. Seventy-two scaled column specimens (120 × 120 × 400 mm) having varying lateral steel confinements were cast without and with hooked steel fiber reinforcement, before cured for 28 days and exposed to high temperatures (from 300 to 700℃) in an electric oven followed by slow cooling in laboratory air. The results indicated a marked reduction in their compressive load capacity and rigidity, and an increase in their strain at peak stress and compressive toughness as exposure temperatures exceeded 400℃. An enhancement in mechanical properties under high temperatures was noticed at moderate confinement levels. The benefit of using hooked-steel fibers in preserving post-heating mechanical properties of short columns was more pronounced in unconfined rather than in confined lightweight aggregate concrete specimens. Thermal cracking was proportional to exposure temperature with its extent reduced upon use of steel fibers or steel confinement. Failure modes of column specimens varied from brittle to semi-ductile fracture with longitudinal steel buckling noticed for those treated at 700℃.</p>

<p>Exposure of concrete to high temperatures results in its cracking because of the inhomogeneous volume changes of concrete's ingredients, generation of vapor pressure, and decomposition of cement hydration products beyond a temperature of 550℃.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312453605">1</xref></sup> These result in large losses in compressive strength and modulus of elasticity and an increase in compressive ductility, especially at temperatures greater than 450℃.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312453605">2</xref></sup> The effect of high heat on the mechanical properties of steel reinforced concrete was investigated under temperatures from 300 to 700℃ that simulate those recorded during real fires. The results demonstrated a significant reduction in their load bearing capacity, because of the combination of three factors, reduction in concrete's observed strength, post-heating-induced stresses in both concrete and steel, and partial loss in concrete–steel bond.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998312453605">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998312453605"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998312453605"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998312453605"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998312453605"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998312453605">8</xref></sup> The use of fiber reinforcement in concrete was reported to be advantageous in reducing heat-damage and hence minimizing corresponding loss in major mechanical properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998312453605">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998312453605"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998312453605">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>In an event of an aggressive fire, the safety of a skeleton-type concrete structure is primarily determined by the ability of the column elements to withstand high temperatures, hence maintain their properties and load-carrying capacity. The compressive strength of concrete determines the overall column behavior under low to intermediate axial loads, whereas the confining pressure on the concrete core by the steel ties plays a significant role in resisting relatively high external loads.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998312453605">12</xref></sup> Most recent research works reported improvement in thermal resistance of ordinary weight concrete when confined using transverse steel reinforcement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998312453605">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998312453605">14</xref></sup> This is represented in higher residual compressive strength (RCS), ductility, and toughness for confined as compared to unconfined concrete.</p>
<p>Nowadays, universal and local governmental agencies have been encouraging and promoting the use of green concrete in construction of residential buildings to reduce energy consumption, preserve available resources, and reduce environmental pollution. Consequently, there has been a noticeable demand for lightweight aggregate of moderate density for use in the production of structural lightweight aggregate concrete (LWAC). Other advantages of using structural LWAC are represented in relatively small structural elements and excellent resistance to dynamic loads owning to its low mass to inertia ratio. The superior properties mentioned overwhelm the relatively high brittleness of LWAC, which can be reduced by either the use of steel reinforcement at relatively high ratios, or addition of steel fibers to concrete.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998312453605">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998312453605"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998312453605"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998312453605"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998312453605"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998312453605"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998312453605"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998312453605"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021998312453605"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021998312453605"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021998312453605"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998312453605">26</xref></sup> Generally, the use of steel fibers in structural concrete elements contributes to improving their ductility, serviceability, and durability in addition to reducing reinforcing steel required.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998312453605">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021998312453605">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021998312453605"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998312453605"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021998312453605">27</xref></sup> The majority of literature works published about the thermal mechanical behavior of LWAC considered mainly the effect of LWAC basic properties and test conditions yet overlooked the effect of fiber reinforcement or reinforcing steel confinement.</p>
<p>The present work investigates post-heating mechanical compressive behavior of high-strength fibrous LWAC short columns. Seventy two LWAC column specimens (120 × 120 × 400 mm) without and with two different steel ties spacings were cast using either plain or fiber reinforced concrete, cured for 28 days in water at 40℃, and then dried in air for 3 days at room temperature, before being subjected to elevated temperatures in the range of (300–700℃) and allowed to cool down to room temperature. The overall response of unheated (control) and heat-damaged specimens, loaded in compression up to failure, cracking patterns, serviceability, stiffness, and ductility, were described.</p>

<p>The mixing of plain and fiber reinforced LWAC was performed using a tilting drum mixer of 0.15 m<sup>3</sup> following the test method ASTM-C192.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021998312453605">28</xref></sup> Initially, little amount of water was poured in the inside surface of the mixer, before the entire quantity of coarse aggregate were placed in the mixture and their surfaces wetted with water under continuous mixing. After that, alternative amounts of the binder (cement and silica fume), fine aggregate particles, and water were added. The superplasticizer at 2% (by binder mass) was blended with the last one-third of the water quantity. Finally, hooked steel fibers were spread manually into the mixtures while mixing. The fibers were already dissociated in Hobart mixer using water. The entire mixing process took about 5 minutes before LWAC was discharged into a large flat ban. Finally, the concrete mixtures were placed in the pre-oiled wooden moulds at three layers; each was consolidated using a vibrating table. The surface of the specimens was finished smooth by a trowel. The specimens were covered with wet burlap after casting for 24 hours before demolded and stored in a curing tank at 40℃ for another 27 days. The slump, air content, and the unit weight tests were performed on fresh concrete according to ASTM testing methods C143, C173, and C138, respectively,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021998312453605">28</xref></sup> and are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998312453605">Table 2</xref> along with mix proportions.</p>

Column specimens (in duplicates) were subjected to thermal treatment at 300, 400, 500, 600, and 700℃ for 2 hours by means of an electrical furnace before left to cool down inside the oven at a rate of about 42℃ per hour.

The interface temperatures for the column specimens used in the present study are expected to be close enough to those of the furnace.

<p>Post-heating cracking extent was visually and quantitatively evaluated for different column specimens. Heat-generated cracks were black-marked before photos were taken and cracking intensity was quantified using an image processing technique. The specimens' images were converted into black and white, before exported to MATLAB software and transformed into binary code (0, 1). The codes (0 and 1) represented marked cracks (black) and uncracked concrete (white), respectively. Based on a simple programming in MATLAB language, the percentage of black color of the total area of specimen was computed. Since the thickness of cracks marking was kept constant, the results are considered valid for comparison purposes. The maximum crack width on the specimens’ surfaces was also measured using an optical microscope having an accuracy of 0.02 mm, while the number of faces on which a single crack was continuous determined.</p>

<p>Sulphur-capped column specimens were braced at both ends using square steel rings (3 × 40 mm) to ensure failure occurrence around the specimens' mid-height. Column specimens were tested under uniaxial compression using a universal testing machine having a maximum load capacity of 1200 kN. Length changes were measured using a linear variable displacement transducer (LVDT), mounted on special steel frame fixtures (20 × 20 mm). These were fixed around the specimens' periphery using six steel bolts at a distance of 130 mm from the specimen's ends, allowing a gage length of 140 mm.

<p>The present results are reported and discussed according to the following sequence. First, the extent of heat-damage in column specimens was qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated. Second, a description of stress–strain diagram at various exposure temperatures was presented. Third, the effects of the temperature level, steel ties confinement, and hooked steel fibers inclusion on the residual characteristics of the stress–strain diagram were discussed.</p>
<p>The column specimens of the present study were categorized into six groups according to confinement level and whether fibers were incorporated in LWAC or not. Alphabet–number designations were used to identify various groups. Letters A, B, and C designated no, medium, and heavy reinforcing steel confinement, respectively, while numbers 0 and 1 designated plain and fiber reinforced LWAC, respectively.</p>
<sec id="sec12-0021998312453605"><title>Cracks distribution, intensity, size, and continuity</title>
<p>Typical cracking patterns on the surfaces of different specimens under exposure temperatures of 400 to 700° can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998312453605">Figure 4</xref>. The resulting cracking pattern can be categorized as “spider” net type cracking. The cracks initiated at 300℃ and their intensity increased with exposure temperature. Specimens prepared with plain LWAC experienced higher cracking intensity as compared to that of those with hooked steel fibers. As temperature was increased to 500℃, steel fibers maintained their property and bond with surrounding concrete, hence worked on arresting heat-generated cracks, hence reduced the cracking intensity in corresponding specimens. Because of C-S-H decomposition and loss of bond between fibers and concrete matrix at temperatures of (600–700℃), cracks number and size increased and similar patterns and intensity were observed for fiber reinforced as well as for plain LWAC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312453605">1</xref></sup> The cracking paths correlated very well with the distribution of steel reinforcement. Therefore, heavily confined specimens cracked the most followed, in sequence, by medium and unconfined ones. The cracks percentages of total area for different specimens and exposure temperatures, depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312453605">Figure 5</xref>, supported the above discussion. The cracking intensity for unconfined specimens (Groups A<sub>0</sub>, and A<sub>1</sub>) was almost negligible at 300℃; hence the corresponding histograms of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312453605">Figure 5</xref> were not seen.

<p>The cracks characteristics (size and continuity) on the surfaces of column specimens under different exposure temperatures are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021998312453605">Table 3</xref>. The cracks appeared on specimens' surfaces at a temperature of 300℃ for specimens with plain LWAC and at temperatures greater than 300℃ for those with incorporated hooked steel fibers. The maximum crack width increased with temperature and was higher for plain LWAC specimens as compared to those incorporated fibers. These behaviors are related to the crack-arresting action of fibers that reduced cracks sizes and limited its propagation. Cracks sizes in confined were larger than that of corresponding unconfined column specimens. This was attributed to the restraint imposed on concrete by transverse steel, especially at temperature beyond 400℃.

<p>Results of visual inspection indicated no continuity of a single crack on the surfaces of the unconfined specimens; regardless of the mixtures used, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021998312453605">Table 3</xref>. However, for medium and heavily confined specimens, cracks were discontinuous at 300℃, and became continuous along 2 to 4 faces at higher temperatures. In confined specimens, cracks were concentrated above reinforcing steel ties probably because of difference in thermal expansion between steel and concrete. The coefficients of thermal expansion for steel bars and fibers (12 × 10<sup>−6</sup>/℃) and concrete (5–13 × 10<sup>−6</sup>/℃) were close at room temperature, yet diverged significantly as temperatures exceeded 500℃; resulting in an increase in the size and number of concrete cracks at locations of transverse steel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312453605">1</xref></sup></p>

<p>The RCS showed either a slight increase or decrease under an exposure temperature of 300℃ and decreased noticeably with higher temperatures. The variations of elastic modulus with temperature may be characterized by an initial stage of stiffness loss (from 23 to 300℃), followed by a monotonic decrease at higher temperatures. The greatest reductions in compressive strength and elastic modulus were for unconfined plain concrete specimens reaching as high as 80%, 93%, respectively. The trends of RCS and residual elastic modulus (REM) with exposure temperature were similar to those of high strength normal weight concretes of similar steel confinement conditions, reported by Wu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998312453605">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The strain at ultimate stress increased slightly up to 400℃ and significantly at higher temperatures. The residual toughness increased with temperature up till 400℃ and 500℃ for plain and fiber reinforced unconfined and confined column specimens, respectively, yet decreased or increased at a lower rate at higher temperatures depending upon the mixture type and confinement condition. The increase in strain at ultimate stress is referred to the softening of concrete and post-heating increase in steel bars and fibers ductility at corresponding temperatures. The significant increase in strain at peak stress, because of the increase in cracks intensity and size, coupled with limited the reductions in <italic>RCS</italic> explained the dramatic increase in residual toughness at exposure temperatures equal to or less than 400 or 500℃. Further yet limited increase in strain at peak stress coupled with the sharp decrease in <italic>RCS</italic> explained the decrease or the limited increased in residual toughness at extreme temperatures (600–700℃).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-0021998312453605"><title>Effect of steel confinement level</title>
<p>The residuals for compressive strength and elastic modulus for confined were higher than those for corresponding unconfined specimens over the entire temperature spectrum; especially for specimens without fibers. Use of heavy steel confinement yielded better yet limited improvement in RCS under high temperatures as compared to those of medium confinement. As expected, the positive effect of steel confinement on RCS is more pronounced for specimens without than that for those with fiber reinforcement.</p>
<p>The results indicated that confined column specimens achieved higher strain at ultimate stress than that of unconfined ones; and that using higher confinement level may not necessarily improve post-heating ductility of LWAC. The residual toughness values were higher for confined as compared to those of unconfined column specimens, especially for those with plain concrete. Results indicated that the contribution of transverse reinforcement to enhancing residual toughness was the greatest in the temperature range of (300–500℃).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-0021998312453605"><title>Effect of fibers reinforcement</title>
<p>The contribution of hooked steel fibers to salvaging RCS for unconfined and confined column specimens was at temperatures in the range of (300–600℃) and (400–500℃), respectively. The fibers used played less significant role in maintaining RCS for confined as compared to that for unconfined specimens; because of the contribution of steel reinforcement in resisting external loads. The negative contribution of fibers to RCS for unconfined specimens that were pre-exposed to 700℃ is referred to the significant loss of bond between the cement matrix and embedded fibers. Fibers contribution to maintaining post-heating REM was much higher than that of RCS for both confined and unconfined specimens; with its highest at intermediate temperatures in the range of (500–700℃). The results showed limited and minor to negative enhancement in post-heating REM upon use of fiber reinforcement in specimens with medium and heavy tie reinforcement, respectively.</p>
<p>The result of Table 5 reflected the advantage of using fibrous instead of plain LWAC in allowing higher compressibility at ultimate stress; especially at intermediate temperatures. The strain at ultimate stress at room temperature for column specimens of groups (A<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>1</sub>, and C<sub>1</sub>) were about (1.1, 1.4, and 1.3) times that for those pertaining to groups (A<sub>0</sub>, B<sub>0</sub>, and C<sub>0</sub>), respectively. The corresponding ratios increased to (1.53, 1.54, and 1.79) at 400℃, before decreased at higher temperatures reaching (1.05, 1.09, and 1.07) at 700℃, respectively. The incorporation of steel fibers in LWAC enhanced, as expected, the toughness before and after exposure to high temperatures. The contribution of fibers to residual toughness was proportional to their crack-arresting efficiency which increased up till an exposure temperature of 600℃, and dramatically decreased at 700℃, because of the loss of bond between fibers and surrounding matrix.</p>

<sec id="sec18-0021998312453605"><title>Failure modes</title>
<p>Failure of unconfined plain concrete specimens was characterized by brittle fracture whereas those confined or reinforced with fibers exhibited a semi-ductile fracture. The failure mode of column specimens under uniaxial compression appears to be a combination of axial splitting and shear: typical modes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0021998312453605">Figure 12(a)</xref>. The buckling of longitudinal steel between ties outward was observed in all confined specimens, especially for those exposed to 700℃, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0021998312453605">Figure 12(b)</xref>. Dusty fracture, identified in all tested specimens, was more pronounced in specimens without confinement. Contrary to that observed for fiber reinforced LWAC specimens, failure of plain ones was accompanied with pealing off concrete cover, extensive cracking, and loss of small-size concrete fragments.
