<abstract>
<p>Although the financial crisis has elevated the interest for factors such as consumer financial healthiness, broad-scope trust, financial knowledge, and consumer relationship satisfaction, no existing model describes how these factors may influence consumer financial relationship trust. This research extends prior research by developing a conceptual framework explaining how these constructs affect consumers' trust in their financial service provider. Based on two surveys comprising 764 pension consumers and 892 mortgage consumers, respectively, the results of this study indicate that financial healthiness, broad-scope trust, knowledge, and satisfaction positively affect narrow-scope trust in financial services. Furthermore, it is found that broad-scope trust negatively moderates the relationships between financial healthiness and narrow-scope trust and between satisfaction and narrow-scope trust, respectively. In addition, the results marginally indicate that broad-scope trust negatively moderates the relationship between consumer financial knowledge and narrow-scope trust. This study encourages public policy makers, consumer organizations, and financial service providers to continue, improve, and/or develop consumer financial education programs and also encourages consumers to participate in such programs. This is especially important when broad-scope trust is low. Also, when broad-scope trust is low, financial service providers should consider devoting additional resources in satisfying their customers and/or in improving their financial healthiness.</p>

<p>As one of its many serious outcomes, the global financial crisis has led many to believe that the relationships between customers and financial service providers have become badly damaged. For instance, recent research and commentaries have suggested that “financial services providers are struggling to maintain consumer trust” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1094670512439105">Costa 2010</xref>) and that “the economic crisis of 2008 led to a loss in confidence in financial institutions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1094670512439105">Uslaner 2010</xref>, p. 110). In this article, we argue that consumers' financial knowledge, financial healthiness, trust in the financial services industry as a whole, and satisfaction with their financial service provider are key concepts for explaining consumers' trust in a financial service provider. However, even though researchers have long acknowledged the importance of such factors for the understanding of consumer financial service behavior (e.g., Grayson, Johnson, and Chen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1094670512439105">2008</xref>; Hogarth and Hilgert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1094670512439105">2002</xref>; Howlett, Kees, and Kemp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1094670512439105">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1094670512439105">Joo and Grable 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1094670512439105">Perry and Morris 2005</xref>; Xiao, Tang, and Shim <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1094670512439105">2009</xref>), no existing model describes how these factors may influence consumer financial relationship trust. This is unfortunate since a better understanding of the relationships between such factors and consumers' trust in their financial service provider may assist financial service providers in managing their financial services and may also assist financial authorities and public policy makers in facilitating well-functioning financial markets.</p>
<p>Trust is believed to be among the most critical variables for developing and maintaining well-functioning customer–seller relationships (Eisingerich and Bell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1094670512439105">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1094670512439105">Johnson and Selnes 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1094670512439105">Morgan and Hunt 1994</xref>; Selnes and Sallis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1094670512439105">2003</xref>). However, although past research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1094670512439105">Driscoll 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1094670512439105">Scott 1980</xref>) suggests that trust not only relates to consumer trust in individual companies but also relates to the broader business context in which consumers may plan and carry out their financial behavior; only one previous study (i.e., Grayson, Johnson, and Chen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1094670512439105">2008</xref>) has empirically considered this distinction in a marketing context. In the present study, two kinds of trust are specified: narrow-scope trust and broad-scope trust. Following Sirdeshmukh, Singh, and Sabol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1094670512439105">2002</xref>), narrow-scope trust can be defined as “the expectation held by the customer that the service provider [i.e., the specific financial institution] is dependable and can be relied on to deliver on its promises” (p. 17). Based on this definition, we define broad-scope trust as the expectation held by the consumer that companies within a certain business type are generally dependable and can be relied on to deliver on their promises.</p>
<p>No research has yet examined how broad-scope trust relates with consumer financial knowledge, financial healthiness, and satisfaction in influencing narrow-scope trust. This is an important shortcoming. An understanding of how broad-scope trust may influence narrow-scope trust and how broad-scope trust may moderate relationships between other key constructs and narrow-scope trust is highly beneficial to financial service providers. If moderating effects occur it means that financial services managers should not only consider their own behavior and trustworthiness when seeking to develop trustful relationships with their customers but also that the successfulness of such attempts may be influenced by the trustworthiness of other service providers.</p>
<p>The present research contributes to the service marketing literature by addressing these important shortcomings. Specifically, we find support for the premise that financial knowledge, financial healthiness, broad-scope trust, and satisfaction with their financial service provider significantly influence consumers' trust in a financial service provider. Also, we demonstrate that trustful customer–seller relationships derives not only from the interaction between the two parties, as is typically modeled (Danaher, Conroy, and McColl-Kennedy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1094670512439105">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1094670512439105">Morgan and Hunt 1994</xref>) but also from the trustworthiness of the financial context (i.e., broad-scope trust) in which they develop.</p>
<p>Our study is based on two surveys. Survey 1 comprises 764 pension consumers, whereas Survey 2 comprises 892 mortgage consumers. Trust is likely to be especially important in consumer financial behavior because financial service providers have an implicit responsibility for the management of their consumers' funds and the nature of financial advice supplied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1094670512439105">Harrison 2003</xref>). The remainder of the article is organized as follows. First, the theoretical framework and hypotheses are introduced followed by a review of the methods used to test the hypotheses. Next, the results are presented. Finally, the implications of the findings are discussed and suggestions for future research are provided.</p>

<title>Theoretical Framework and Research Hypotheses</title>
<p>Our theoretical framework is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1094670512439105">Figure 1</xref>. The specification of the hypothesized relationships in the theoretical framework draws primarily on attribution theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1094670512439105">Fiske and Taylor 1991</xref>; Tomlinson and Mayer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1094670512439105">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1094670512439105">Weiner 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1094670512439105">2000</xref>), institutional theory (DiMaggio and Powell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1094670512439105">1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1094670512439105">Meyer and Brian 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1094670512439105">Scott 2004</xref>), and consumer choice theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1094670512439105">Jayanti and Burns 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1094670512439105">Shafir and Tversky 1992</xref>; Shiu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1094670512439105">2011</xref>).</p>

<p>Because there is no comprehensive theory dealing with how financial healthiness, broad-scope trust, knowledge, and satisfaction may affect narrow-scope trust in financial services, we combine several theories to form a more complete picture of how these factors can be expected to influence trust. Specifically, the multitheoretical approach taken in this study recognizes that our framework contains a multifaceted range of variables, including evaluative and personal outcomes such as satisfaction and financial healthiness (i.e., attribution theory is particularly devoted to explaining consumers' evaluation of the causality of outcomes), knowledge (i.e., consumer choice theory may explain how consumers act upon their knowledge), and different levels of trust (i.e., institutional theory).</p>
<p>Although it is acknowledged that also other contextual, relationship, and/or individual constructs (e.g., culture, general economic welfare of the society, relationship communication, consumers' financial expectations, consumers' trust in their own financial behavior, and the like) may potentially influence narrow-scope trust, the constructs included in our framework were selected (a) based on theories suggesting that they can be regarded as key concepts for developing trust in financial service providers, (b) in response to the financial crisis, which has elevated the importance of consumer trust in both individual financial service providers <italic>and</italic> in financial institutions for the well-functioning of financial markets, (c) because the range of choice available to financial consumers has increased dramatically in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1094670512439105">Brennan and Coppack 2008</xref>) emphasizing the potential importance of consumer financial knowledge for developing well-functioning customer–seller relationships, and (d) because the financial crisis has evoked an increased focus on the financial healthiness of financial services customers and on their satisfaction with their financial service provider. Financial healthiness is also important since it contributes to financial satisfaction, which ultimately contributes to life satisfaction (Xiao, Tang, and Shim <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1094670512439105">2009</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-1094670512439105">
<title>Construct Definitions</title>
<p>Consumers' <italic>financial healthiness</italic> refers to consumers' financial status and the degree to which they have financial adequacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1094670512439105">Xiao, Sorhaindo, and Garman 2006</xref>). Financial healthiness can be related to objective circumstances such as income and assets, subjective phenomena such as financial satisfaction or happiness, and/or outcomes such as whether consumers exhibit positive and desirable financial behaviors (Xiao, Tang, and Shim <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1094670512439105">2009</xref>). In line with Joo and Grable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1094670512439105">2004</xref>) and Perry and Morris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1094670512439105">2005</xref>), we take an outcome approach and conceptualize financial healthiness as the extent to which the consumer exhibits positive financial behaviors, such as avoiding financial troubles caused by not having enough money and paying credit card bills in full each month. A number of studies have focused on how financial healthiness relates to financial customer–seller relationships. For instance, it has been considered how financial healthiness may guide relationship segmentation and communication, influence customers' need for relationship information and advice, and use of relationship technology (Cameron, Cornish, and Nelson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1094670512439105">2006</xref>; Hogarth and Anguelov <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1094670512439105">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1094670512439105">Lee and Cho 2005</xref>). However, no studies known to us have previously considered the relationship between financial healthiness and trust in financial service providers.</p>
<p>While marketing relationship trust (i.e., narrow-scope trust) has been extensively investigated within the relationship marketing literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1094670512439105">Morgan and Hunt 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1094670512439105">Sharma and Patterson 2000</xref>), <italic>broad-scope trust</italic> is clearly underresearched. Broad-scope trust can be regarded as “formal” or “informal.” Formal broad-scope trust is the belief that proper impersonal structures are in place to enable one to anticipate a successful future endeavor (McKnight, Cummings, and Chervany <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1094670512439105">1998</xref>). Formal broad-scope trust is also referred to as “system trust,” thereby underlining that it relates to the consumer’s views regarding the formalized regulation of a particular activity system (Grayson, Johnson, and Chen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1094670512439105">2008</xref>). Informal trust (also referred to as generalized trust; Humphrey and Schmitz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1094670512439105">1996</xref>) concerns whether the entities in a system can be trusted, regardless of sector or context.</p>
<p>In the theoretical framework, informal trust is considered. This is because informal trust is more directly related to the behavior of companies than formal trust, which also concerns trust in legal rules and public authorities. We conceptualize (informal) broad-scope trust as the expectation held by the consumer that companies within a certain business type are generally dependable and can be relied on to deliver on their promises. This definition is consistent with previous research suggesting that broad-scope trust (or generalized trust) is a generalized expectancy that the promise of a group can be relied upon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1094670512439105">Rotter 1980</xref>; Siegrist, Gutscher, and Earle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1094670512439105">2005</xref>).</p>
<p>
<italic>Narrow-scope trust</italic> is being regarded as one of the most critical variables for developing and maintaining well-functioning relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1094670512439105">Morgan and Hunt 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1094670512439105">Sharma and Patterson 2000</xref>). While a large body of research exists within the concept of narrow-scope trust, with different points of view being advocated, we adapt the often-cited definition proposed by Sirdeshmukh, Singh, and Sabol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1094670512439105">2002</xref>) and conceptualize narrow-scope trust as “the expectation held by the consumer that the service provider [i.e., the specific financial institution] is dependable and can be relied on to deliver on its promises” (p. 17).</p>
<p>
<italic>Consumer financial knowledge</italic> refers to the body of facts and principles (i.e., information and understanding) accumulated by a consumer (i.e., stored in memory) about a financial domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1094670512439105">Page and Uncles 2004</xref>). A distinction can be made between domain-general knowledge (i.e., general knowledge about financial services) and domain-specific knowledge (i.e., knowledge about a specific financial service or range of related financial services; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1094670512439105">Duncan 2007</xref>). This study focuses on domain-specific knowledge. This is because financial services are a very broad term covering a range of different service offerings (i.e., short term/long term, simple/complex, etc.). Hence, by focusing on domain-specific knowledge, we consider the implications of consumers' knowledge for their evaluation of narrow-scope trust, and of other constructs included in this study, given the particular characteristics of services. A distinction can also be made between subjective knowledge which refers to individuals' perceptions of their own knowledge, and objective knowledge which refers to absolute knowledge measured against objective standards (Alba and Hutchinson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1094670512439105">2000</xref>). In the present research, we focus on subjective (domain-specific) knowledge. This is consistent with past research, which suggests that subjective consumer knowledge is a stronger customer-related motivation than objective knowledge, and which has shown a tendency to prefer subjective knowledge measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1094670512439105">Flynn and Goldsmith 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>
<italic>Satisfaction</italic> may be conceptualized as a facet (attribute-specific) or as an overall (aggregate) characteristic. Also, the characteristic can be viewed as transaction-specific (encounter satisfaction) or as cumulative (satisfaction over time). Similar to past relationship and service-related research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1094670512439105">Dimitriades 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1094670512439105">Levesque and McDougall 1996</xref>), satisfaction is in the present study conceptualized as an overall, cumulative consumer evaluation of her or his relationship with a financial service provider. Cumulative relationship satisfaction recognizes that customers may rely on their entire experience with a financial service provider when evaluating its performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1094670512439105">Dimitriades 2006</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-1094670512439105">
<title>Hypotheses</title>
<p>We argue that institutional theory can explain how broad-scope trust influences narrow-scope trust. Institutional theory suggests that the processes and structures that are established within a society, or a community, act as authoritative guidelines for social behavior. Social behavior needs to be legitimized by the rules and norms that exist in the social environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1094670512439105">Scott 2004</xref>). In a similar vein, Meyer and Brian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1094670512439105">1977</xref>) argue that institutional rules function as myths, which organizations incorporate in order to gain legitimacy, stability, and enhanced survival prospects. Also, DiMaggio and Powell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1094670512439105">1983</xref>) suggest that organizations that operate outside of accepted norms in the organizational field face isomorphic pressures. According to DiMaggio and Powell, organizational legitimacy is therefore closely linked with survival. Thus, if trust is common within a business type, it encourages the development of trust in customer–seller relationships suggesting the existence of a positive relationship between broad-scope trust and narrow-scope trust.</p>
<p>The few studies dealing with the relationship between broad-scope trust and narrow-scope trust suggest the empirical validity of institutional theory. Although Kenning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1094670512439105">2008</xref>) found no significant correlation between general trust and specific trust, Grayson, Johnson, and Chen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1094670512439105">2008</xref>) found that broad-scope trust positively affected narrow-scope trust. Consistent with this finding, Pennington, Wilcox, and Grover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1094670512439105">2003</xref>) found that system trust positively influenced perceived trust in a vendor. On the basis of our theoretical reasoning and empirical evidence, we hypothesize as follows.
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: Broad-scope trust has a positive influence on narrow-scope trust.</p>
</list-item>
</list>Our arguments concerning the relationships between financial healthiness and narrow-scope trust, between financial healthiness and broad-scope trust, and between financial healthiness and satisfaction, respectively, build primarily upon attribution theory. Attribution theory describes consumers' evaluation of causality in a postbehavior context on the basis of different situational contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1094670512439105">Fiske and Taylor 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1094670512439105">Tomlinson and Mayer 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1094670512439105">Weiner 1986</xref>). As stated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1094670512439105">Weiner (1991)</xref>, attributions are considered answers to why questions regarding outcome occurrences. In general, attribution research indicates that consumers tend to attribute their failures to variables outside themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1094670512439105">Gotlieb 2009</xref>). Such “defensive attributions” help consumers to establish mental justification in relation to their outcome experiences and to maintain self-confidence and avoiding cognitive dissonance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1094670512439105">Gotlieb 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1094670512439105">Todd and Gigerenzer 2003</xref>). In other words, when outcomes are unfavorable, there is a tendency to assign external blame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1094670512439105">Blount 1995</xref>), which suggests that narrow-scope trust, broad-scope trust, and relationship satisfaction would be negatively affected by a decrease in financial healthiness.</p>
<p>In line herewith, we also expect that narrow-scope trust, broad-scope trust, and relationship satisfaction would be positively affected by an increase in financial healthiness. This expectation is consistent with marketing relationship theory suggesting that customers who perceive value or benefits, which (wholly or partially) can be attributed to their relationship with an exchange partner, are likely to increase their willingness to develop relational bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1094670512439105">Palmatier et al. 2006</xref>). Moreover, past research suggests that people experiencing positive outcomes and that “everything is under control” are more likely than other people to develop “interpersonel trust,” which is the “generalized expectancy that the promise of an individual or a group can be relied upon” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1094670512439105">Couch and Jones 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1094670512439105">Rotter 1980</xref>). While attribution theory especially focuses on the explanation-seeking process, individuals engage in when they are surprised or threatened by unexpected or negative events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1094670512439105">Fiske and Taylor 1991</xref>), the “New Look” model states that mental imbalance is aroused whenever outcomes are inconsistent with perceived societal normative standards for competent or moral behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1094670512439105">Maertz, Hassan, and Magnusson 2009</xref>). In this regard, Abelson and Rosenberg’s theory of Symbolic Psycho-Logic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1094670512439105">Abelson and Rosenberg 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1094670512439105">Rosenberg and Abelson 1960</xref>) posits that a person experiencing mental imbalance will try to redress the cognitive state by altering the relations, modifying the elements, or avoiding the issue altogether. Hence, in incidents where the consumer is financially healthy, it provides a reason to positively evaluate her or his financial surroundings in order to achieve cognitive consistency. The following hypotheses cover our reasoning.<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Financial healthiness has a positive influence on narrow-scope trust.</p>

</list-item>
</list>We argue that attribution theory can also explain how broad-scope trust moderates the relationships between financial healthiness and narrow-scope trust and between satisfaction and narrow-scope trust, respectively. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1094670512439105">Weiner (1986)</xref> suggests that the causes of all outcomes can be decomposed into a set of points on three orthogonal continua, or causal dimensions. These continua are (a) locus—the prior outcome’s causal agent relative to the decision maker; (b) stability, stable to unstable—the likelihood that a prior outcome’s causal agent will persist in the future; and (c) controllability, controllable to uncontrollable—the decision maker’s degree of influence over the causal agent. Locus of causality relates to the location attributed to the cause of an outcome. It could be an internal position (the cause is located in the consumer herself/himself or in one of her or his decisions), external (located in the company that offers the service), or situational (located in environmental effects; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1094670512439105">Oliver 1993</xref>). In that respect, consumers will distinguish between causes that are internal, external, and situational. Locus of causality is in particular relevant in the present study because it explicitly distinguishes between situational causes (i.e., broad-scope trust) and causes (i.e., narrow-scope trust) that are more directly related to the individual seller that offers the service. Attribution theory predicts that consumers are more likely to evaluate a supplier positively when they make higher external attributions and lower situational attributions toward a positive experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1094670512439105">Weiner 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Several insightful studies have investigated trust using an attribution theory approach. As an overall conclusion, these studies indicate that trust in a relationship (i.e., narrow-scope trust) is enhanced to the extent that the other’s trustworthiness can be ascribed to factors that are internal to the trustee, rather than situationally driven (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1094670512439105">Malhotra and Murnighan 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1094670512439105">Tomlinson and Mayer 2009</xref>). Drawing on such insights, it is predicted that in an environment where broad-scope trust is low, consumers should be expected to be more likely to attribute negative outcomes to situational causes and less likely to attribute negative experiences to external causes (i.e., poor and untrustworthy advices from their financial service provider) compared with environments where broad-scope trust is high. In a similar vein, when broad-scope trust is low consumers should be expected to be less likely to attribute positive outcomes to situational causes and more likely to attribute positive experiences to external causes (i.e., good and trustworthy advices from their financial service provider) compared with environments where broad-scope trust is high. Specifically, in trying to assess the causes for their satisfaction and their financial healthiness, consumers may evaluate their experiences in the light of the perceived trustworthiness of available alternative financial service providers. In incidents where broad-scope trust is high, attribution theory suggests that consumers would be more inclined to attribute negative outcomes to their current financial service provider, and vice versa when broad scope trust is low. Thus, it is expected that broad-scope trust would <italic>negatively</italic> moderate the relationships between financial healthiness and narrow-scope trust and between satisfaction and narrow-scope trust, respectively. In sum, the following hypotheses are proposed.<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 5</italic>: The influence of financial healthiness on narrow-scope trust is negatively moderated by broad-scope trust, such that financial healthiness has a greater positive effect on narrow-scope trust when broad-scope trust is low compared to high.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 6</italic>: The influence of satisfaction on narrow-scope trust is negatively moderated by broad-scope trust, such that satisfaction has a greater positive effect on narrow-scope trust when broad-scope trust is low compared to high.</p>
</list-item>
</list>We expect that knowledgeable consumers will be more trustful than less knowledgeable consumers. Past research suggests that knowledge facilitates the learning of new information and that knowledgeable consumers acquire and retain more information than less knowledgeable consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1094670512439105">Brucks 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1094670512439105">Jayanti and Burns 1998</xref>). Also, as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1094670512439105">Brucks (1985)</xref> knowledge may allow consumers to formulate more questions. Hence, financial knowledge is likely to make consumers more aware of what is possible for a financial service provider and may facilitate consumers' possibility to make reliable predictions about the future behavior of a financial service provider, which in turn may be an important information source of trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1094670512439105">Pučėtaitė and Lämsä 2008</xref>). Also, knowledgeable consumers may feel more in control and more comfortable in their evaluation of a financial service provider (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1094670512439105">Walczuch and Lundgren 2004</xref>). Although it could also be argued that increased knowledge could backfire because knowledgeable consumers may be more able to detect the limitations of a financial service provider, thus decreasing trust, several studies from other areas suggest a positive relationship between individuals' knowledge and trust. For instance, it has been found that public’s trust in a government is positively related to its knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1094670512439105">Cook, Jacobs, and Kim 2010</xref>) and that consumer knowledge is positively related to trust toward food product categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1094670512439105">Puspa and Kühl 2006</xref>). The following hypotheses cover our reasoning.<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 7</italic>: Financial knowledge has a positive influence on narrow-scope trust.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 8</italic>: Financial knowledge has a positive influence on broad-scope trust.</p>
</list-item>
</list>We expect financial knowledge to positively influence <italic>both</italic> narrow-scope trust and broad-scope trust. This is because previous studies indicate that individuals' domain specific-knowledge and domain-general knowledge are interrelated and that domain-specific knowledge is likely to influence their domain-general reasoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1094670512439105">Duncan 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>We also suggest that higher financial knowledge should lead to greater relationship satisfaction among financial consumers. Knowledgeable consumers enjoy an increased ability to evaluate information and to conduct more effective search, are likely to make better decisions about which service provider to choose, and are likely to form more realistic relationship expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1094670512439105">Morgeson et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1094670512439105">Tam 2006</xref>) than less knowledgeable consumers, and thus should be more satisfied with the service provider finally selected. Also, less knowledgeable consumers may feel more insecure in the customer–seller relationship, which is likely to be associated with a reduction in satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1094670512439105">Wilkens and Nermerich 2011</xref>). On the basis of such reasoning, the following hypothesis is proposed.<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 9</italic>: Financial knowledge has a positive influence on satisfaction.</p>
</list-item>
</list>The evolving dynamism and complexity of modern financial markets makes the challenges for consumers to maintain knowledge structures suitable for financial decision making increasingly higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1094670512439105">Brennan and Coppack 2008</xref>; Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1094670512439105">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1094670512439105">Towers Perrin 2008</xref>). Research suggests that when the complexity of the information provided exceeds consumers' knowledge and information processing capacity, the quality of the latter’s financial decisions will be affected negatively in a considerable manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1094670512439105">Howlett, Kees, and Kemp 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1094670512439105">Oehler and Kohlert 2009</xref>), which may reduce their financial healthiness. On a similar note, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1094670512439105">Hogarth and Hilgert (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1094670512439105">Hilgert, Hogarth, and Beverly (2003)</xref> found in a series of studies that financially knowledgeable consumers are more likely to behave in financially responsible ways. The survey results obtained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1094670512439105">Perry and Morris (2005)</xref> support this notion. Hence, we hypothesize as follows.<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 10</italic>: Financial knowledge has a positive influence on financial healthiness.</p>
</list-item>
</list>When broad-scope trust is low, it means that consumers cannot just rely on any service provider to reduce the complexity and uncertainty they are faced with. Hence, the consumer risks that her or his interests will not be properly served. When faced with such circumstances, consumer choice theory indicates that a consumer will tend to more thoroughly evaluate the trustworthiness of various service providers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1094670512439105">Shafir and Tversky 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1094670512439105">Shiu et al. 2011</xref>). That is, when broad-scope trust is low even higher demands are put on consumers' knowledge and cognitive skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1094670512439105">Jayanti and Burns 1998</xref>). On a similar note, high broad-scope trust should be expected to facilitate consumers' evaluation of the trustworthiness of service providers without having extensive knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1094670512439105">Hall et al. 2002</xref>). Moreover, even when people possess knowledge and information, they may ignore it if they feel that their decision-environment can be trusted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1094670512439105">Rotfeld 2007</xref>). In summary, we expect that when broad-scope trust is low consumers will rely more on their financial knowledge in determining the trustworthiness of their financial service provider than when broad-scope trust is high. We hypothesize as follows.<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 11</italic>: The influence of financial knowledge on narrow-scope trust is negatively moderated by broad-scope trust, such that financial knowledge has a greater positive effect on narrow-scope trust when broad-scope trust is low compared to high.</p>
</list-item>
</list>Although previous research results are mixed concerning the relationship between satisfaction and narrow-scope trust (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1094670512439105">Grayson, Johnson, and Chen 2008</xref>) found that narrow-scope trust positively influenced consumer relationship satisfaction), we expect relationship satisfaction to positively influence narrow-scope trust. Our expectation is based on past research suggesting that satisfaction antecedes trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1094670512439105">Ouyang 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1094670512439105">Zboja and Voorhees 2006</xref>), that satisfaction develops in the initial stages of marketing relationships and trust develops in the intermediate stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1094670512439105">Geyskens, Steenkamp, and Kumar 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1094670512439105">Leisen and Hyman 2004</xref>) and that satisfaction positively influences narrow-scope trust because it increases consumers' confidence that they will be treated fairly and that the seller cares about their interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1094670512439105">Ganesan 1994</xref>).

<sec id="section5-1094670512439105">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Two financial service industries were selected for our study: pension and mortgage companies. The use of multiple service industries provides a robust test of model relationships by allowing greater variability in study constructs (Sirdeshmukh, Singh, and Sabol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1094670512439105">2002</xref>). For each industry, a two-step procedure was utilized to sample respondents from Capacent Epinion’s online panel of approximately 30,000 Danish consumers. In the first step, a stratified random sample of 4,820 respondents aged 18+ was drawn from the online panel, reflecting the distribution of gender, age, and educational level in the population (aged 18+) as a whole. In the second step, these 4,820 respondents were contacted by e-mail, and asked to respond to the screening question: “Have you recently been in contact with your current (main) pension/mortgage company?” (Yes/No/Not currently engaged with a pension/mortgage company) to ensure that only ongoing relationships were included in the sample.</p>
<p>In the final samples (pension sample, <italic>n</italic> = 764; mortgage sample, <italic>n</italic> = 892), 52.3% (pension sample) and 52.5% (mortgage sample), respectively, were women and average age was 46.5 years (pension sample) and 49.1 years (mortgage sample), respectively, with ranges between 18 and 85 years (pension sample) and 20–87 (mortgage sample), respectively. It was investigated whether the profiles of the study samples deviated from the country population aged 18–85 and 20–87, respectively, on gender and educational level. χ<sup>2</sup> tests of difference between samples and population frequencies on each of these criteria produced <italic>p</italic> values &gt;.11 for both samples, indicating that our samples reflected the demographic profile of the studied country population.</p>

<title>Measurements</title>
<p>Our measurement items were based on prior research, modified to fit the financial service context of this study where relevant. The final items for each construct are summarized in Appendix A. Financial healthiness was measured using 6 items adapted from Joo and Grable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1094670512439105">2004</xref>). Narrow-scope trust was measured by 3 items adapted from the trust in the Organization scale developed by Tax, Brown, and Chandrashekaran (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1094670512439105">1998</xref>). A 3-item scale adapted from De Wulf, Odekerken-Schröder, and Iacobucci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1094670512439105">2001</xref>) measured satisfaction, whereas 3 items based on Tax, Brown, and Chandrashekaran (1998) measured broad-scope trust. Knowledge was measured using the 3-item Subjective Knowledge scale provided by Mukherjee and Hoyer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1094670512439105">2001</xref>).

Thus, since the chi-squared test is highly sensitive to sample size other fit measures are given greater prominence in evaluating model fit (e.g., Ye, Marinova, and Singh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1094670512439105">2007</xref>). The root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA = .057), the comparative fit index (CFI = .95), and the normed fit index (NFI = .94) suggest that the measurement model fits the data reasonably well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1094670512439105">Bagozzi and Yi 1988</xref>). Composite reliabilities were close to or greater than .80, indicating good reliability of measured constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1094670512439105">Bagozzi and Yi 1988</xref>). Finally, extracted variance was greater than .5 for all latent constructs, which satisfies the threshold value recommended by Fornell and Larcker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1094670512439105">1981</xref>).</p>
<p>Discriminant validity is assessed in two ways. First, the method proposed by Fornell and Larcker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1094670512439105">1981</xref>) was applied. According to this method, the extracted variance for each individual construct should be greater than the squared correlation (i.e., shared variance) between constructs. An examination of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1094670512439105">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1094670512439105">2</xref> shows that the extracted variance for each of the constructs exceeded the squared correlation.</p>
<p>Second, the baseline measurement model was compared to alternative models where covariances between pairs of constructs were constrained to unity (Anderson and Gerbing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1094670512439105">1988</xref>). In every case, the restricted model had a significant ( <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) poorer fit than the unrestricted model suggesting sufficient discriminant validity.</p>

<title>Model and Hypotheses Testing</title>
<p>The moderating effects were formed using the product indicator formatting procedure (i.e., matching indicators by reliability) proposed by Jackman, Leite, and Cochrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1094670512439105">2011</xref>) and applying the residual-centering (i.e., orthogonalizing), two-step procedure recommended by Little, Bovaird, and Widaman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1094670512439105">2006</xref>). First, each of the specified interactions was regressed onto the first-order effect indicators of the two constructs under consideration. Second, for each of these regressions, the residuals were saved and used as indicators of the interaction construct. This method, which is facilitated by the relatively large sample sizes of this study, is regarded superior to more common path models, because it incorporates measurement error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1094670512439105">Kaplan 2009</xref>). Both the main effects and the hypothesized interaction effects were estimated in the model.</p>
<p>The use of product indicators renders nonnormality, which violates the distributional assumptions of the standard ML estimator and can lead to underestimation of standard errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1094670512439105">Kaplan 2009</xref>). Hence, the model estimations reported below were initially estimated using the bootstrapping resampling procedure (2000 samples; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1094670512439105">Efron and Tibshirani 1993</xref>) to produce distributionally appropriate standard errors and chi-squared statistics. Next, the models were reestimated using ML. A comparison of the parameter estimates produced by bootstrapping and ML suggested similar significance levels for all estimated structural equation modeling (SEM) paths. This result is consistent with the suggestion put forward by Little, Bovaird, and Widaman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1094670512439105">2006</xref>) that when utilizing the residual-centering procedure “the standard maximum likelihood estimator likely provides a reasonably robust estimate of standard errors and significance” (p. 512). In the following, the results based on ML estimates are reported.</p>
<p>Initially, an estimation of the model for each of the two samples separately showed reasonable model fit in both incidents (pension services: χ<sup>2</sup> = 871.99, df = 300; CFI = .94; NFI = .91; RMSEA = .047; mortgage services: χ<sup>2</sup> = 844.93, df = 300; CFI = .93; NFI = .91; RMSEA = .049). The hypothesized model was then fitted simultaneously to the pension and mortgage services samples using multiple-group latent variable SEM analysis. Initially, a fully restricted model was estimated holding all paths invariant across the two data sets. Next, using a chi-squared difference test, we investigated whether paths with significant test statistics varied across subsamples. All of the released paths failed to enhance model fit suggesting that the investigated path coefficients did not differ significantly across the two subsamples; therefore, the fully restricted model was used to represent the data sets. The model chi-squared statistic was 1756.86 (<italic>df</italic> = 678, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), indicating that the model fails to fit in an absolute sense. However, the more robust fit indexes (CFI = .94; NFI = .92; RMSEA = .031) indicated an acceptable model fit. In addition, the NNFI, which is thought to be sensitive to both explanation and parsimony, equals .91, suggesting that the model shows an appropriate balance between these competing goals.</p>
<p>To test the improvement in fit due to the hypothesized interaction effects, a competing model omitting these interactions, but retaining all other relationships, was estimated. Compared with the proposed model the results suggest that the competing model had inferior fit statistics: χ<sup>2</sup> = 1229.40, <italic>df</italic> = 297, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01; CFI = .92; NFI = .91; RMSEA = .044; NNFI = .90. To conclude, the hypothesized model is a reasonable fit to the data. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1094670512439105">Table 3</xref> displays the estimated coefficients from the multiple-group SEM analysis.</p>

<title>Common Method Variance</title>
<p>In order to assess the effects of common-method variance, we reestimated the structural model by adding a same-source factor (all 18 main construct items loading on it) to the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1094670512439105">Figure 1</xref> (Netemeyer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1094670512439105">1997</xref>). Common method variance is a known limitation when using self-report measures. Comparing an unconstrained model in which all indicators are related to a common factor to one in which these paths are constrained to zero represents a significance test of the effects of the same-source factor.</p>
<p>For the <italic>pension services sample</italic>, the fit of the constrained model was χ<sup>2</sup> = 843.00 (<italic>df</italic> = 299), CFI = .94; NFI = .92; RMSEA = .046; NNFI = .91.

The fit of the unconstrained model did not differ from that of the constrained model (Δχ<sup>2</sup> = 22.88, Δ<italic>df</italic> = 17, <italic>p</italic> = .15) and the results for all the hypotheses tests were identical to the results reported above suggesting that the results are robust with respect to common method variance.</p>

<title>Results Summary</title>
<p>Consistent with institutional theory, our research shows that broad-scope trust can improve narrow-scope trust. Drawing on attribution theory, we found that financial healthiness positively influenced narrow-scope trust, broad-scope trust, and satisfaction, respectively. Guided by consumer choice theory, the results also show that consumer knowledge positively influenced narrow-scope trust, broad-scope trust, financial healthiness, and satisfaction, respectively. Consistent with past relationship research, this study also demonstrates the beneficial effect of relationship satisfaction for increasing narrow-scope trust. We also found that broad-scope trust negatively moderates the relationships between financial healthiness and narrow-scope trust and between satisfaction and narrow-scope trust, respectively. In addition, the results marginally indicate that broad-scope trust negatively moderates the relationship between consumer financial knowledge and narrow-scope trust.</p>

<title>Theoretical Implications</title>
<p>This study has several implications for marketing relationship theory, which has heavily focused on the role of narrow-scope trust in developing close relationships with consumers. Although a large number of conceptualizations of “relationship marketing” have been proposed, marketing researchers seem to agree that (a) relationship marketing focuses on the individual customer–seller relationship; (b) both parties in a relationship must benefit for the relation to continue; (c) the relationship is often longitudinal in nature; (d) the focus of relationship marketing is to retain customers (Hunt, Arnett, and Madhavaram <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1094670512439105">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1094670512439105">Peterson 1995</xref>). These perspectives have resulted in a strong focus on variables such as satisfaction, trust, cooperation, understanding, and fulfillment of promises within the relationship marketing approach. In that respect, our results strongly suggest that the investigation of customer–seller relationships should not be limited to focusing on the interaction between the two parties, as is typically modeled (Danaher, Conroy, and McColl-Kennedy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1094670512439105">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1094670512439105">Morgan and Hunt 1994</xref>), but should expand into a broader perspective, which also includes consumer personal constructs (such as financial healthiness and knowledge) and contextual variables (such as broad-scope trust). Specifically, we highlight three important theoretical implications.</p>
<p>First, this study provides further evidence for the usefulness of the distinction between narrow-scope trust and broad-scope trust. This is because the trustworthiness of other service providers, even if they may not be considered direct competitors, may (a) influence narrow-scope trust and (b) moderate the development of specific financial customer–seller relationships. Second, we demonstrate that our understanding of narrow-scope trust may substantially benefit from taking into account personal characteristics. Specifically, by showing that financial healthiness and knowledge positively influence narrow-scope trust, this study establishes these personal characteristics as key constructs in understanding consumer financial relationship behavior. Third, it is generally believed that broad-scope trust may arise from the law and/or from company culture (Carlin, Dorobantu, and Viswanathan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1094670512439105">2009</xref>). Hence, by proposing and showing that personal financial healthiness and knowledge positively influence broad-scope trust this study (a) extends prior theoretical considerations concerning the development of broad-scope trust and (b) demonstrates the importance of taking personal characteristics into account when studying the functioning of financial markets.</p>
<p>In addition to these implications, previous theorizing suggests that early in a relationship narrow-scope trust is most likely based primarily on general trust, but as the relationship continues, a divergence is more likely between broad-scope trust and narrow-scope trust (Gutek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1094670512439105">1999</xref>). This is because as individual relationships develop, the personalization that occurs may boost the level of narrow-scope trust. Notably, our study results support this suggestion. A comparison of broad-scope trust with narrow-scope trust shows that narrow-scope trust is more than one third higher on average than broad-scope trust (5.61 vs. 4.04, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1094670512439105">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, the finding that broad-scope trust positively influences narrow-scope trust supports institutional theory at the expense of functionalist theory. These two theories represent competing views on the relationship between broad-scope trust and narrow-scope trust. In contrast to institutional theory, functionalist theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1094670512439105">Luhmann 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1094670512439105">Parsons 1967</xref>) holds that narrow-scope trust is only formed where it is needed. In incidents where broad-scope is insufficient (i.e., at a low level), economic parties may therefore compensate for this by developing narrow-scope trust suggesting the existence of a negative relationship between broad-scope trust and narrow-scope trust.</p>

<title>Implications for Marketing Practice, Consumers, and Public Policy</title>
<p>Financial education programs have now been established in many countries (e.g., Gaurav, Cole, and Tobacman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1094670512439105">2011</xref>) and also the OECD prioritizes this issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1094670512439105">OECD 2006</xref>). Our finding that increased knowledge may improve financial healthiness encourages public policy makers, financial authorities, and consumer organizations to continue and even further develop consumer financial education programs. Also, it encourages consumers to participate in such programs. As important additional effects of such initiatives increasing consumer financial knowledge is also likely to improve broad-scope trust and narrow-scope trust. The positive relationship between knowledge and financial healthiness is also of interest to financial managers. Since financial companies are dependent on customers to pay their loans and bills they have a greater interest in developing relationships with financially healthy consumers than with the opposite. Our results further underline this interest by showing that financial healthiness positively affects narrow-scope trust and relationship satisfaction.</p>
<p>In addition to improving consumers' knowledge about financial topics and concepts, our results suggest that financial education programs should be concerned with enabling consumers to assess the trustworthiness of their individual service provider. This is especially important when broad-scope trust is low. It is well-known that some consumers face particular difficulties and are often categorized as vulnerable, excluded, or susceptible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1094670512439105">Brennan and Coppack 2008</xref>). Vulnerable consumers can be characterized as consumers who are disadvantaged due to factors that are largely beyond their direct control, such as lack of knowledge, the young, and members of ethnic minorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1094670512439105">Andreasen and Manning 1990</xref>). Our results suggest that when broad-scope trust is low, consumers rely more on the evaluation of relationship satisfaction and (to a marginal degree) knowledge in assessing narrow-scope trust. Hence, when broad-scope trust is low even higher burdens are put on cognitive skills, which in turn may reduce the ability of vulnerable consumers to confidently determine the trustworthiness of their individual service provider. However, while general consumer financial knowledge and capability can hardly be strongly improved in the short-term vulnerable consumers may be even more difficult to educate by financial programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1094670512439105">Brennan and Coppack 2008</xref>). Our study thus suggests that in the after-crisis era, public policy makers and legal authorities should increasingly consider complementing educational programs with financial services consumer protection initiatives in order to ease the cognitive burdens put on vulnerable consumers. Because satisfaction is positively related to narrow-scope trust facilitating consumers' evaluation of relationship satisfaction is also in the interest of financial managers. Hence, when broad-scope trust is low, financial service managers should, in particular, consider collaborating with public authorities in increasing consumer knowledge and/or developing their own educational programs.</p>
<p>Because broad-scope trust is associated with financial service providers as a whole, the detected positive relationship between broad-scope trust and narrow-scope trust holds true even for service providers who have not actively participated in improving broad-scope trust. However, because of market competition and scarce resources some managers may feel tempted only to focus on developing narrow-scope trust (Carlin, Dorobantu, and Viswanathan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1094670512439105">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1094670512439105">Williamson 1993</xref>). Since it is in the interest of societies that their citizens have trust in financial institutions this underlines the importance of developing well-functioning financial regulations, which ensures that the development of broad-scope trust is not left to the financial industry alone. On top of this, the financial services industry may consider improving self-regulatory mechanisms to facilitate the development of a trustful company culture.</p>
<p>As expected from attribution theory, the results indicate that broad-scope trust has a negative moderating influence on the relationship between satisfaction and narrow-scope trust and a negative moderating influence on the relationship between financial healthiness and narrow-scope trust. These results have important implications for financial service managers.</p>
<p>While managers should be concerned that a low level of broad-scope trust may have a direct negative influence on narrow-scope trust, they should also pay attention when broad-scope trust level is high or on the increase since broad-scope trust negatively moderates the relationships between customer satisfaction and narrow-scope trust and between financial healthiness and narrow-scope trust, respectively. On the other hand, with higher levels of broad-scope trust managers may benefit from an improved relationship between broad-scope trust and narrow-scope trust. Hence, when considering how to approach their customers and the amount of resources (staff resources, market campaigns, etc.) needed in order to develop trustful relationships with consumers financial services managers should take into account the trustworthiness of other service providers as detailed in the following.</p>
<p>When broad-scope trust is low, financial service providers will gain a higher amount of narrow-scope trust from satisfying their customers than when broad-scope trust is high. Hence, as a direct managerial implication, financial service managers should consider investing additional resources in satisfying customers when broad-scope trust is low or on the decrease. In addition, financial healthiness is a more important antecedent of narrow-scope trust when broad-scope trust is low compared to high. When broad-scope trust is low, managers will therefore benefit from increasing their financial counseling effort and should, as an additional effort, consider developing services (e.g., favorable savings accounts, financial budgeting services, and the like) specifically aimed at improving and/or preserving customers' financial healthiness. When broad-scope trust is high, the positive influence of consumer satisfaction and financial healthiness on narrow-scope trust decreases. However, this may be compensated by the positive relationship between broad-scope trust and narrow-scope trust. Since financial healthiness and satisfaction are less important determinants of narrow-scope trust when broad-scope trust is high, financial service managers may instead wish to direct a larger amount of their resources at (a) attracting new customers (because broad-scope trust is high, consumers should be expected to be less skeptical when exposed to financial market campaigns from alternate service providers) and (b) providing existing customers with favorable offerings in order to make them more reluctant to market communication and offers from competing financial service providers.</p>

<title>Limitations and Directions for Future Research</title>
<p>This study drew on various theories and concepts in order to develop a theoretical understanding of how financial healthiness, broad-scope trust, knowledge, and satisfaction affect narrow-scope trust. In relation hereto, future research could collect longitudinal data to assess the long-term relationships between the proposed antecedents and narrow-scope trust. Longitudinal studies would help understand whether the nature of the effects obtained in this study is indeed long term. Also, while this research demonstrates the importance of one contextual variable (i.e., broad-scope trust), one evaluative variable (i.e., satisfaction) and two personal characteristics (i.e., knowledge and financial healthiness) for the development of narrow-scope trust future research may wish to include additional explaining personal, evaluative and/or situational characteristics. For example, it is known that consumer financial knowledge and healthiness can vary with education, income, gender, and age (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1094670512439105">Garmaise 2010</xref>) and that satisfaction and narrow-scope trust (and perhaps also broad-scope trust) may be affected by service providers' communication effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1094670512439105">Selnes 1998</xref>). Also, while broad-scope trust is known to be positively correlated with economic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1094670512439105">Zak and Knack 2001</xref>), it might also be interesting to investigate how the perceived general economic welfare of a society may complement broad-scope trust in affecting narrow-scope trust and in moderating the relationships between satisfaction, knowledge, and financial healthiness, respectively, and narrow-scope trust.</p>
<p>Although the present research concentrated on investigating consumers' trust in their financial service providers, our theoretical framework may also be applicable to research dealing with other business and services areas, such as for instance food retailing and medical services. Food might cause health risks and both individual food retailers and the food industry as a whole are often dealing with lack of consumer trust, for instance caused by mad-cow-disease, food poisoning, or when risks of genetically manipulated food are discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1094670512439105">Kenning 2008</xref>). Also, it is well known that individuals are likely to distinguish between trust in their individual medical service provider and trust in the medical service industry as a whole and also that individuals may differ according to their personal healthiness, knowledge of health issues, and relationship satisfaction with their medical service provider (Hall et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1094670512439105">2002</xref>).</p>
<p>There are several other limitations of this study that should be acknowledged. Consumers were approached via online surveys; they may behave differently when engaging in specific relationship settings. Also, this study concentrated on analyzing the consumer population of one society and in two industries. Although the investigated financial industry types are present in most societies and even though their service offerings are most likely guided by similar financial and economic principles, this could mean that the results may suffer from a lack of generalizability when other countries and/or industries are considered. Future research is called upon to take into account cultural characteristics such as, for example, the degree of consumer uncertainty avoidance, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1094670512439105">Hofstede 2001</xref>). Since trust may decrease uncertainty, financial consumers within uncertainty avoiding societies may put higher emphasis on broad-scope trust and narrow-scope trust when compared to less uncertainty avoiding societies. Also, recent research suggests that the trust-building process may differ across cultures (Schumann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1094670512439105">2010</xref>). Future research could also manipulate some of our antecedent variables in an experimental setting. Such an experimental study would replicate the present cross-sectional survey results, and thus provide stronger evidence for the direction of causality in the proposed research model.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Drawing on institutional theory, attribution theory, and consumer choice theory, this study demonstrated that financial healthiness, broad-scope trust, knowledge, and satisfaction affect narrow-scope trust in financial services. Because consumer knowledge was found to positively influence financial healthiness, broad-scope trust and narrow-scope trust, respectively, this study encourages public policy makers, financial authorities, and financial service providers to continue, improve, and/or develop consumer financial education programs. This study also indicated, however, that when broad-scope trust is low even higher burdens are put on cognitive skills, which in turn may reduce the ability of vulnerable consumers to confidently determine the trustworthiness of their individual service provider. Thus, when broad-scope trust is low, financial education programs become even more important. In addition, we showed that financial service providers may benefit from an increased broad-scope trust since it positively influences narrow-scope trust. However, when broad-scope trust is low, financial service providers will gain a higher amount of narrow-scope trust from investing additional resources in satisfying their customers and/or from improving customers' financial healthiness than when broad-scope trust is high.</p>
