<p>In “Building a Larger Tent for Public Health: Implications of the SOPHE-AAHE Partnership,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090198113482325">Robert Goodman (2013)</xref> poses thoughtful questions for the role that the Society for Public Health Education (SOPHE) may play with the integration of former American Association for Health Education (AAHE) members into SOPHE. He further describes a process by which a college with a strong Health, Physical Education, and Recreation (HPER) history and culture can be transformed into a school of public health; moreover, because of this strong HPER history, he identifies a “look” and “feel” for these new entities that will set them apart from traditional schools of public health. Thus, what Goodman describes is an <italic>opportunity</italic> that builds on the strength of a college that has been a leader in health education and health promotion, a leader in recreation and sport management, and a leader in exercise physiology—all traditional disciplines within a HPER college. Because of this strong HPER history and tradition, I predict that not only will this new school of public health continue its legacy of excellence in research, teaching, and service but also serve as a model for other universities.</p>
<p>Before I address the many opportunities that are presented to us with the new SOPHE–AAHE partnership, allow me one clarification. AAHE members are not always affiliated with HPER colleges nor are SOPHE members always affiliated with schools or colleges of public health; there are AAHE members involved with professional preparation in MPH programs as well as schools of public health. Furthermore, not all SOPHE members in higher education reside in schools of public health. Perhaps Goodman’s characterization was not intentional, but even if this generalization may have had some validity decades ago, such a portrayal is erroneous in the 21st century.</p>
<sec id="section1-1090198113482325">
<title>Opportunities for Health Education in Higher Education</title>
<p>Goodman’s examples of the synergy between schools of HPER and public health exemplify why this partnership is so important as we prepare the next generation of health education and health promotion professionals. However, it only scratched the surface of opportunity, as SOPHE can be a resource for higher education administrators when considering restructuring and/or creating new academic entities, alignments, and configurations to meet new challenges. Currently, there are 50 schools of public health and 92 MPH programs accredited by the Council on Education for Public Health (CEPH; <italic>CEPH Newsletter</italic>, January 2013). According to the 2009-2010 National Center for Education Statistics report, there are 4,495 degree-granting postsecondary Title IV programs in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090198113482325">National Center for Education Statistics, 2013</xref>). Of these, just more than 200 identify themselves as offering an undergraduate degree in health education (2009 AAHE Directory of Health Education Programs). Much of the training of health education specialists across all settings occurs in <italic>undergraduate</italic> programs, with many not affiliated with a school of public health or an MPH program.</p>
<p>The new Indiana University School of Public Health–Bloomington’s structure is one university’s answer to the question: “How do we solve the challenging and complex problems of today’s and tomorrow’s society and still provide a quality undergraduate experience?” It combines basic, social, and translational sciences under one roof to encourage collaborations as well as enhance intended as well as unintended outcomes as noted by the example of Captain Kidd’s Pirate Ship.</p>
<p>Our AAHE colleagues not only bring a rich history informed by their HPER roots but also contribute a wealth of experience in preparing undergraduate students for an array of health education practice settings. Faculty members in AAHE possess vast experience in translating research and incorporating it into undergraduate education. These undergraduate teaching and learning experiences are invaluable as schools of public health, which are traditionally graduate-only entities, begin to offer minor and major degrees in public health. In addition, our AAHE colleagues, many of whom teach in the more than 200 undergraduate health education degree programs, add value to these newly formed colleges and schools. I was a faculty member at the University of South Florida’s College of Public Health when administrators began discussions around creating both a public health minor and a major. A concern was the actual teaching of undergraduates, inasmuch as the College had been a graduate-only institution since its inception. An assessment revealed that only a handful out of 50 faculty members had taught at the undergraduate level. I was one of those few who had, as my career started in a HPER college.</p>
<p>Goodman encourages us to think broadly and openly about public health and no longer view it as fitting neatly into distinct silos; the new modality requires <italic>evolutionary</italic> ways of thinking and <italic>revolutionary</italic> structures within institutions of higher learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090198113482325">McDermott, 2000</xref>). Liberal arts colleges are now thinking of ways to incorporate public health into their curricula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090198113482325">Hovland, Kirkwood, Ward, Osterweis, &amp; Silver, 2009</xref>). This educational movement is a rich opportunity for public and community health education as universities seek to provide students with a liberal arts foundation, yet help them develop a skill set needed either for the workforce or for further professional education. One of the larger undergraduate degree programs in public health is in the Krieger School of Arts and Sciences at Johns Hopkins University; there may be a good reason (beyond the fact that the Bloomberg School of Public Health is graduate only) that Johns Hopkins has placed its public health undergraduate studies program in arts and sciences. Imagine a health education curriculum that is consistent with and in some ways is transformed by the traditional foci of liberal arts education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090198113482325">Roe, 2009</xref>). A successful student would be able both to address critical health education problems and, perhaps more important, possess the critical thinking and analytical skills to advance health education and health promotion. The profession needs its universities and other types of learning institutions to think differently in the creation of health education degree programs, to design programs for tomorrow rather than for yesteryear, and most critically, be mindful of the discipline’s strengths. Initiatives such as the Association of Schools of Public Health’s “Framing the Future: The Second 100 Years of Education in Public Health” and the Rockefeller Foundation’s “Dreaming the Future of Health for the Next 100 Years” also challenge us to consider the larger global context in which our graduates will operate.</p>

<title>Opportunities for the Profession</title>
<p>This partnership between SOPHE and AAHE reminds me how our roots, our history, the foundation under which many health educators were trained, is important. It also brings home that we are so much more alike than we are different.</p>
<p>Despite being organizations that have coexisted separately for many years, SOPHE and AAHE have worked collaboratively to advance the health education profession. There is a rich history of partnership around initiatives between the two organizations—initiatives such as the creation of individual certification, operationalizing a unified code of ethics, advocating for program accreditation, developing a common heath education and promotion terminology, and lobbying for “health educator” as a distinct occupational classification within Department of Labor, just to name a few. For decades, SOPHE and AAHE leaders and members have taken advantage of their commonalities and used them as opportunities to strengthen the profession.</p>
<p>There have been health education professionals who have been leaders in both organizations. This crossover of leadership is another example of how much more our similarities outweigh our differences. A quick glance at the AAHE Scholars of the past 30 years reveals several SOPHE members as well who excelled in organizational leadership for one or both entities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1090198113482325">Table 1</xref>). This new organizational partnership allows many of these former honorees to focus their leadership even further under one “tent.” AAHE colleagues through their AAHPERD lens will bring innovative ways of thinking that will influence health education and health promotion but also SOPHE’s organizational structure and future partnerships.</p>

<p>Goodman refers to “our allied professions” (p. 124) as if these are two distinct disciplines coming together. His choice of words is unfortunate because scholars and professionals from HPER disciplines and public health both have had, and will continue to share, a great commonality, a rich history, and an inspired tradition. This is not to say there may not be differences in approaches to healthy individuals and communities; but in the end, regardless of their previous primary organizational affiliation, these health education professionals work toward the same goals. Finally, regardless of one’s avenue of professional preparation or one’s specific practice setting—the school, health department, worksite, hospital, state or federal agency, foundation, not-for-profit, or university—the SOPHE–AAHE partnership promises to enhance the profession, is an action long overdue, and, most of all, is a cause for celebration.</p>

<label>Editor’s Note</label>
<p>SOPHE has been working for several years with leaders of the American Association for Health Education (AAHE) to strengthen the health education profession by uniting our resources under one roof within SOPHE. This has been no small task, in part since AAHE has been a part of the American Alliance for Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance (AAHPERD) for some 70+ years. It is expected that AAHPERD’s National Associations (including AAHE) and Research Consortium will unify as of May 2013 (upon approval of revised bylaws by the AAHPERD Alliance Assembly). At that time, AAHPERD will primarily focus on physical education, physical activity, and health. AAHE will be sunset. SOPHE has been negotiating with AAHPERD leaders about particular AAHE products or services that could be integrated into SOPHE as the principal independent organization representing the health education profession.</p>
