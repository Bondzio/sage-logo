<p>This book covers a wide theoretical and historical terrain within its limited length, offering a unique view of Google and what it calls “the culture of search.” The authors in the Introduction lay out the argument that Google is a messianic-type leader of what it calls “the culture of search.” It describes Google as “a nexus of power and knowledge newly constituted through extremely rapid changes in the social expectations and desires attending to them” (p. 6). Google has become more than an Internet search engine in the minds and hearts of its users, according to the authors:
<disp-quote>
<p>The firm’s rise reflects and benefits from a generational-inflected growth in the perception that <italic>everything</italic> that matters is now on the Web and that almost everything is already archived in some online database and <italic>should</italic>, in the moral sense of this verb, be accessible through search. (p. 6)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Although educators, as well as many over the age of thirty, would refute the latter claim, authors Hillis, Petit and Jarrett back up their position with reports on the statistical rate of use of Google, especially by users under age twenty-nine years (p. 6). In addition, other evidence is given including the listing in the <italic>Oxford English Dictionary</italic> that authorizes “to google” as a transitive verb meaning “to search for information about (a person or thing)” (p. 6).</p>
<p>In Chapter 3, “Universal Libraries and “Thinking Machines,” the authors state “. . . we offer a set of intellectual histories of the longstanding, Idealist desire for a universal library. We begin with the pre-1900 thoughts, desires, theories, and systems of belief that collectively inform contemporary search” (p. 77). Here the authors discuss intricacies of the 1939 essay “La Biblioteca Total” (The Total Library) by Jorge Luis Borges, the Judeo-Christian story of the Tower of Babel, the ancient Ptolemaic rulers’ desire to develop a library collection encompassing languages and knowledge from all over the world (In 283 BCE at the beginning of the Ptolemy’s II reign the library at Alexandria had collected 200,000 scrolls) and the ideas of 14th century philosopher Ramón Lull’s “Thinking Machine.” In Chapter 4, the authors draw more historical comparisons between contemporary search culture and the ideas propagated by philosopher H. G. Wells in his work World Brain (1938). Chapter 5 covers post-WWII efforts to develop ever-expanding electronic databases that utilize the ever-broadening information retrieval and search technologies, which the authors describe with “foci on the interplay among information, metaphysics and search” (p.124).</p>
<p>Instructors of journalism, communication, and library and information science may find the aforementioned book as a whole unwieldy for classroom instruction, but may find chapters 1, 2, 6, and 7 useful for upper-level undergraduate classes or graduate seminars as a teaching tool to help “jump-start” thoughtful discussions and provide interesting insights into Google, as well as into “the culture of search” interpretation.</p>
<p>“Welcome to the Googleplex,” chapter 1, outlines the entity of Google. Much of the book revolves around the Google trademark technology PageRank, “which underpins Google’s search technologies [and] transformed the practice and conceptualizations of what it was to search the Web” (p. 3), but Google is more than the search algorithm. The authors ask, “What is Google?” Their answer is, “It is a technology firm, a media corporation, an automated ad agency, a platform, a financier of automated vehicles and alternative energy projects” (p. 30).</p>
<p>Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page were early web adopters and emerged after studying as students at Stanford University. The company has been able to keep some of its do-it-yourself “California ideology” alongside commercialism and a for-profit motivation. The following conclusion is drawn:
<disp-quote>
<p>Google’s revenue stream relies on an established economic model shared by broadcast mass media—the audience is the commodity sold to advertisers (Smyth 1981). In recent years between 96 and 97 percent of the firm’s revenue has been attributable to advertising from both Google-owned sites and networked partners (2010, 2011a). Google is profoundly shaped, therefore, not only by its technology-loving and altruistic engineering culture that values autonomous production, but also by the field of advertising and its contradictory emphasis on large-scale production and short-term financial gain. (p. 38)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the authors put forward the view that Google maintains a hybrid existence and a convincing public image based on its economic and symbolic capital.</p>
<p>Google has acquired over 150 businesses, including the key purchases of YouTube (in 2005 for $1.65 billion), Double Click (in 2007 for $3.1 billion), and Motorola Mobility (in 2011 for $12.5 billion; p. 50). On the other hand, Google has accumulated “symbolic capital” by maintaining its California ideology, touting its unofficial corporate slogan of “Don’t Do Evil,” and providing substantial financial support to a range of philanthropic areas that extend to environmental and social justice issues, which ingratiates public trust (p. 43).</p>
<p>Chapter 2, “Google Rules,” examines more closely the interworking philosophy of Google, particularly the “concept of relevance” as appropriated by Google and others in the search industry. In fact, an assessment it purports is that Google sets search industry standards: “Its models of a good search engine, a good search result, and good algorithmic logic have become normalized as <italic>the</italic> industry standard” (p. 53).</p>
<p>Google establishes “relevance” by a utilitarian ranking system and by tracking each user’s previous searches that are tied to a user’s IP address, allowing search engine algorithms to “predict” the user’s queries even before queries are fully typed into the system (pp. 54–59). Chapter 2 outlines other features that the Google search offers to its users, including speedy responses and a seemingly endless, unmitigated freedom of choice to information, but at the same time Google influences in myriad ways what the public knows and how it knows it.</p>
<p>Chapter 6, “The Library of Google,” discusses the legal and economic battles of Google in a grand project to digitize books from the world’s leading libraries to create a universal library, “a library to last forever.” Google initiated the project in 2004 with a plan to scan books from the University of Michigan, Stanford, Harvard, the Bodleian Library in Oxford, and the New York Public Library. Google’s plan was to start scanning 15 million books within a ten-year period, beginning with post-1923 books that were in the public domain or “orphaned” books with questionable copyright status. However, the plan quickly met with resistance in fall 2005 with two U.S.-based lawsuits citing copyright infringement, one on behalf of authors (<italic>Authors Guild v. Google</italic>) and the other brought by the Association of American Publishers and the individual publishers McGraw-Hill, Pearson Education, Penguin Books USA, Simon &amp; Schuster, and John Wiley &amp; Sons. In the chapter, a fairly detailed review is made of various in-court and out-of-court settlements and legal maneuvering that occurred through the end of 2011. Nevertheless, by 2005, Google had scanned over 5 million books, which they used to create Google Translate, establish research partnerships, and engage in various activities. Again, the Google Books Project represents an aggressive stance by Google over its control or use of information.</p>
<p>Chapter 7, “Savvy Searchers, Faithful Acolytes, ‘Don’t be Evil,’ ” is followed by an Epilogue titled “I Search, Therefore I Am” and reads like a critical essay that ties together all the theoretical and historical analyses from the previous chapters. The book as a whole, as stated by its authors in the “Introduction” is intended to “. . . offer an intellectual history and a form of media archeology attentive to the ideas, techniques, and practices that inform the culture of search and its undergirding networked technologies” (p. 25).</p>
<p>In conclusion, students and others may find <italic>Google and the Culture of Search</italic> a denser read than other commentaries on Google, such as <italic>Googled: The End of the World as We Know It</italic>, by Ken Auletta (2009), but it is a useful read to bring one more up-to-date with the actions of Google and to keep discussion open about Google and the search engine industry, which may have an impact on those involved in media, journalism, and other information institutions.</p>
