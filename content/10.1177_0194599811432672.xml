<body>
<p>Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) provides important prognostic information for patients with cutaneous melanoma, and patients with a positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) commonly undergo completion lymph node dissection (CLND), as recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Melanoma Practice Guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599811432672">1</xref></sup> This procedure is sometimes referred to as completion therapeutic lymph node dissection,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811432672">2</xref></sup> thus illustrating the theory that CLND improves patient outcomes by removing occult regional disease. Despite its wide acceptance as the standard of care for patients with SLN-positive melanoma, there remains a lack of strong evidence that CLND improves survival. In fact, 2 recent studies found no significant difference in disease-free or disease-specific survival between patients with melanoma who underwent SLNB alone compared to those who had CLND, thus supporting nodal observation (ie, delay lymph node dissection until nodal metastasis becomes apparent clinically, either by palpation or imaging) as a reasonable alternative for patients who are not suitable candidates for CLND.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599811432672">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599811432672">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Notably, these 2 studies, as well as most of the landmark melanoma trials, included melanomas from all sites together, despite the nonuniform prognosis among various locations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599811432672">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599811432672">7</xref></sup> In addition, the therapeutic role of SLNB is less defined for cutaneous melanoma of the head and neck (CMHN) due to the complexity of regional lymphatic drainage patterns and subsequent risk to cranial nerves and major blood vessels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599811432672">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599811432672">8</xref></sup> Given the significant risk of morbidity that is associated with CLND in the head and neck region, it is important to understand the impact, if any, that this procedure has on survival. Our objective was to determine whether CLND improves survival in patients with CMHN, using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program.</p>

<title>Data Source</title>
<p>The SEER registries routinely collect data on patient demographics, primary tumor site, tumor morphology, stage at diagnosis, first course of treatment, and follow-up vital status. Continuous quality control activities to ensure the collection of high-quality data and the 17 registries included in our analysis represent an estimated 26% of the US population from several geographic regions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599811432672">9</xref></sup> The study population for this analysis was selected using SEER*Stat version 6.6.2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.seer.cancer.gov/seerstat">www.seer.cancer.gov/seerstat</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Patient Selection</title>
<p>Patients who were diagnosed with CMHN from January 1, 1998, through December 31, 2007, and underwent excisional surgery were selected by <italic>International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd Edition</italic> (<italic>ICD-O-3</italic>) primary site and histologic type codes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599811432672"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). Patients were excluded if they did not have nodal metastasis, if they had not undergone SLNB, or if they had missing data regarding the quantity of examined or positive nodes. Sentinel lymph node–positive patients were then categorized according to the extent of their lymph node assessment, that is, to SLNB only and SLNB + CLND if ≤5 and ≥10 nodes were examined, respectively. Patients who had SLNB and 6 to 9 nodes removed were excluded from our cohort because it was unclear whether the procedure was an extensive SLNB or an incomplete CLND. The 1 patient who had survived less than 1 month from diagnosis was also excluded.</p>

The end point for our analysis was 5-year disease-specific survival (DSS).</p>

<p>Number of lymph nodes removed was not tested statistically because it was the basis of categorizing the surgical procedure as either SLNB only or SLNB + CLND. Number of positive lymph nodes also was not tested because of the high likelihood of misclassification bias in the SLNB-only group: actual number of positive lymph nodes would not be known without CLND. Similarly, the ratio of positive LNs/LNs removed is subject to greater misclassification bias in the SLNB-only category.</p>

<p>Differences in clinicopathologic characteristics between patients who underwent SLNB only and SLNB + CLND were compared by χ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811432672">2</xref></sup> test (categorical variables), Fisher exact test when categories had small numbers, and Student <italic>t</italic> test or nonparametric rank sum test (continuous variables).</p>
<p>The influence of patient and tumor factors of known or potential prognostic value on mortality was determined by Cox proportional hazards regression models, where hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated to estimate the relative risk of death for patients who received SLNB + CLND compared to SLNB only. Because the SLNB + CLND group was significantly younger than the SLNB-only group, analyses were stratified on age at diagnosis, with the categories defined as &lt;60 and ≥60 years to be consistent with the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599811432672">5</xref></sup> and because median age in our population was very similar to this (58 years overall; 54 years for SLNB + CLND and 62 years for SLNB-only group). Within each age stratum, multivariable model-building procedures began with a full model, including age at diagnosis (to control for residual confounding), extent of nodal surgery, gender, race, tumor location, thickness, and ulceration. Independent variables were removed sequentially starting with the highest <italic>P</italic> values until a parsimonious model that included type of nodal surgery was obtained, guided by the log-likelihood ratio and minimizing changes in remaining HRs. Survival curves were estimated by Kaplan-Meier analyses and compared statistically using the log-rank test. All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata software version 10.0 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas). Statistical significance was set at <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05. All tests were 2-sided.</p>

Of the 24,387 patients diagnosed with primary CMHN during 1998 to 2007, there were 4477 who underwent excisional surgery and SLNB. Of these, 400 (8.9%) had a positive SLN. After excluding the 49 patients for whom extent of lymph node surgery was unclear and the single patient who survived less than 1 month, the final study population included 350 patients: 140 (40%) who were considered to have had SLNB only (≤5 nodes removed) and 210 (60%) who were considered to have undergone completion SNLB + CLND (≥10 nodes removed).</p>
<p>Patient, tumor, and nodal characteristics are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599811432672"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>. Patients in the SLNB-only group had a significantly higher age at diagnosis compared to the SLNB + CLND group (mean 62.1 vs 53.2 years, respectively; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Clinicopathological factors, including patient demographics, tumor location, thickness, and ulceration, were otherwise statistically similar between groups. Length of follow-up for the SLNB-only group was somewhat longer than for the SLNB + CLND group (median 26 and 24 months, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = .047). The median number of nodes removed was 2 (range, 1-5) and 30 (range, 10-90+) for patients who had SLNB only and SLNB + CLND, respectively. The median number of nodes was the same in both groups, although the range was wider among the CLND group, reflecting the greater number of nodes examined (ranges, 1-3 and 1-40, respectively).</p>
<p>Results of 5-year DSS Cox proportional hazards analyses are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599811432672"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>.

<p>The 5-year DSS curves as calculated by Kaplan-Meier analysis are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599811432672"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>. Survival for the cohort as a whole, as well as within each age group, was similar regardless of whether patients underwent CLND (log-rank <italic>P</italic> &gt; .20). However, we were also interested in whether CLND improved DSS among patients having different prognoses based on the tumor characteristics available in the SEER database—namely, thickness and ulceration. We therefore examined 5-year DSS for prognostic groups defined on these characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0194599811432672"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>). Among patients with a poor prognosis (tumor &gt;2 mm thick and/or ulcerated), CLND did not significantly affect survival, regardless of age category or number of poor prognosis features. In contrast, among patients with the best prognosis (ie, those with a nonulcerated tumor ≤2 mm thick), survival differed statistically based on surgical procedure in both age groups (age &lt;60 years: <italic>P</italic> = .039; age ≥60 years: <italic>P</italic> = .023) but in opposite directions: CLND was associated with improved survival among younger patients and poorer survival among older patients.</p>

<p>Theoretically, CNLD might be of least utility in patients who have the lowest risk of metastases beyond the SLN, and tumor thickness ≤2 mm, absence of ulceration, and increasing number of SLNs harvested (≥3) have each been identified as independent predictors of negative non-SLN disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811432672">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599811432672">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599811432672">12</xref></sup> To test this notion, we further selected only those patients from our original low-risk group (nonulcerated thin [≤2 mm] tumors) who had at least 3 SLN harvested, of which only 1 was positive for metastasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0194599811432672"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Popularized by Morton et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599811432672">13</xref></sup> in the early 1990s, SLNB has become the standard of care for staging patients with melanoma, as SLN status is the most significant predictor of recurrence and survival in these patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599811432672">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599811432672">15</xref></sup> By identifying the first lymph node in a nodal basin that receives the afferent lymphatic drainage from a given anatomic area, SLNB allows for careful pathologic evaluation of 1 or a few SLNs that are most likely to harbor metastatic disease. Thus, patients with micrometastases can receive more aggressive therapy, often including CLND, and those with SLN-negative disease are spared the potential morbidity that is associated with regional lymphadenectomy.</p>
<p>The presumed therapeutic benefit of CLND is based on the theory that uncontrolled disease in the nodal basin is a source of systemic disease. However, disease recurrences in SLN-negative patients are most frequently systemic,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599811432672">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599811432672">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599811432672">17</xref></sup> and a number of recent studies have demonstrated that most recurrences in SLN-positive patients are systemic regardless of CLND.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599811432672">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599811432672">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599811432672">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599811432672">19</xref></sup> The conception that distant metastasis, despite regional control, may be the most important factor affecting survival in SLN-positive patients questions the value of additional node dissection in these patients.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, only 2 other studies have investigated the effect of CLND on survival in patients with SLN-positive melanoma, and we are the first to report specifically on its effect in the head and neck. Both studies found that the rates of recurrence-free survival and DSS in SLN-positive patients who had CLND were very similar compared to those who did not have CLND.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599811432672">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599811432672">4</xref></sup> Likewise, we detected no difference in survival based on the extent of lymph node surgery for the cohort as a whole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599811432672"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). However, subgroup analysis based on age and tumor-related factors demonstrated that CLND was associated with significantly improved DSS for patients meeting the following criteria: age &lt;60 years, tumor depth ≤2 mm, and absence of tumor ulceration. In contrast, we found that among patients age ≥60 years with these same tumor characteristics, those who underwent CLND had a significantly increased risk of death from melanoma relative to those who had SLNB only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0194599811432672"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>The difference in therapeutic efficacy of lymph node dissection based on age was suggested more than a decade ago by the Intergroup Melanoma Trial (IMT), which randomized 740 patients with clinically node-negative, intermediate-thickness (1-4 mm) melanomas to receive either immediate elective lymph node dissection (ELND) or wide excision with nodal observation and therapeutic lymph node dissection if nodes became clinically apparent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599811432672">20</xref></sup> Patients were prospectively stratified for tumor thickness, ulceration, and primary site based on the known prognostic value of these variables. Multivariable regression analysis after completion of the study confirmed the significant prognostic values of the stratification variables and also revealed that age (both as a continuous variable and age &gt;60 years) was a significant prognostic factor as well. On subsequent subgroup analysis, the authors reported improved 5-year and 10-year DSS rates after ELND for patients age 60 or younger with tumors that were either nonulcerated or ≤2 mm thick. Although the validity of these results has been questioned because of the number of subgroup analyses performed, as well as the identification of subgroups not included in the pretrial stratification, it is remarkable that the subgroup of patients who benefitted from CLND in our study was based on the same prognostic features as in the IMT. Although the IMT suggested that ELND improves survival for patients age ≤60 years with either nonulcerated or thin (1-2 mm) tumors, we suggest that both of these characteristics must be present for CLND to be therapeutic. Regardless, the premise of our results is the same in that there appears to be a narrow timeframe during which regional micrometastases are sufficiently isolated so that their removal prevents further dissemination to distant sites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599811432672">20</xref></sup> The risk of distant metastasis increases as tumors become thicker and ulcerate, and the survival benefit of regional node dissection decreases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599811432672">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Non-SLN status is another important prognostic factor for patients with clinically localized CMHN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599811432672">21</xref></sup> Several studies have attempted to identify patients who have an increased risk for non-SLN metastases based on tumor and SLN characteristics, with the goal of precisely selecting patients for CLND so that patients with a low risk of non-SLN positivity can be spared the procedure. Primary tumor thickness, ulceration, number of collected and positive SLNs, and SLN tumor burden have each been identified as independent predictors of non-SLN status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811432672">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599811432672">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599811432672">12</xref></sup> In contrast to the current notion that nodal observation may be an appropriate alternative to CLND for SLN-positive patients with a significantly low risk of non-SLN metastases,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811432672">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599811432672">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599811432672">12</xref></sup> we propose, founded on the results of this study, that the therapeutic effect of CLND may, in fact, be limited to these patients.</p>
<p>To test our inference, we analyzed the effect of CLND among the patients in our cohort with the lowest risk of non-SLN disease. Thus, this subgroup consisted of patients with nonulcerated thin (≤2 mm) tumors who had no more than 1 positive SLN when at least 3 nodes were examined. Therefore, patients in the CLND group had pathologically confirmed negative nodal disease beyond the single positive SLN, and those in the nodal observation (SLNB-only) group had only 1 positive SLN out of at least 3 that were harvested. Remarkably, CLND significantly improved survival among patients &lt;60 years old in this subgroup (<italic>P</italic> = .003), substantially reducing the risk of death from melanoma. Thus, younger patients with a considerably <italic>low</italic> risk for non-SLN metastases who are observed may have missed their opportunity for a potentially curative intervention. Notably, among older patients in this subgroup, the effect of CLND was reversed (<italic>P</italic> = .028). That is, among older patients who are unlikely to harbor non-SLN metastases, CLND appears to have a considerably negative effect on melanoma-specific survival. The reasons for the opposite treatment effects among the 2 age groups are largely uncertain and should be explored in future studies. Nonetheless, positive non-SLNs appear to indicate advanced disease with a significant risk for distant metastasis that is unlikely to be offset by regional treatment.</p>
<p>There are several apparent limitations to this study. First, analyses are limited to the data collected by the SEER registries. The database does not currently record whether positive lymph nodes are SLNs or non-SLNs. However, assuming that patients with a negative SLN would not undergo CLND, we construe that single node–positive patients in our cohort who underwent CLND did not have positive non-SLNs. Still, we were unable to analyze patients in the CLND group who may have had &gt;1 positive SLN because it was unclear whether the additional positive nodes were SLNs or non-SLNs. In addition, data regarding adjuvant therapy and the adequacy of surgery (including completeness of margins) are limited. Moreover, the SEER database does not contain data regarding disease recurrence; hence, we were unable to discern recurrence patterns or determine the effect of CLND on disease-free survival.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations that are inherent in using population-based registry data, this study has multiple strengths. We were able to study a very specific patient cohort with sufficient statistical power to detect significant differences in treatment outcome, even on subgroup analysis. The ability to perform subgroup analysis proved essential in this study to precisely describe patients who are likely to benefit from CLND. Of the 24,387 patients we identified with CMHN, only 400 (1.64%) had at least 1 positive SLN; it would be exceedingly difficult to accrue as many patients in any single or multi-institutional study. Furthermore, such population-based data, as included in the SEER database, lack the referral biases that may be inherent in institutional studies. In addition, regional treatment biases are minimized, and such data represent the standard of care of melanoma across a spectrum of community and county hospitals, academic medical centers, and health maintenance organizations.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Awaiting the results of the Multicenter Selective Lymphade- nectomy Trial II (MSLT-II, a prospective trial designed to determine the therapeutic efficacy of CLND by randomizing SLN-positive patients to CLND or nodal observation), we present our analysis of the related SEER data as further evidence that CLND does not significantly improve survival for the majority of patients with CMHN. However, CLND appears to have a protective effect for a specific subgroup of patients who are &lt;60 years old with thin (&lt;2 mm) nonulcerated melanomas. Contrary to previous recommendations for nodal observation in this low-risk subgroup, our results support CLND for these patients. However, nodal observation may be warranted for patients not meeting these criteria given the unproven therapeutic benefit of CLND and its significant risk of morbidity in the head and neck.</p>
<p>Our results challenge the intuitive perception that CLND improves survival by excising disease-positive non-SLNs. Instead, they support the notion that significant tumor depth, ulceration, and nodal metastases denote a more invasive metastatic property of melanoma and a substantially increased risk of harboring distant microscopic disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599811432672">5</xref></sup> Thus, systemic metastasis is likely the most important determinant of survival in patients with high-risk characteristics, and the significant threat of distant disease presumably offsets any potential benefit that can be offered by a regional operation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599811432672">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Last, age appears to be a significant factor in CMHN that is related not only to prognosis but to treatment outcomes as well. The basis for this should be explored in future studies, and melanoma trials should take into account patient age as well as other prognostic factors, both in study design and outcomes analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599811432672">20</xref></sup></p>
