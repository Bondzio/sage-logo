<p><italic>Subjects and Methods</italic>. All patients who underwent free flap reconstruction of lateral mandibular defects from 1999 to 2010 were included in this study. Patients were classified into 2 groups based on type of reconstruction: (1) osteocutaneous radial forearm (n = 73) and (2) fibula free flap reconstruction (n = 51).

The recipient site complication rate approached 27% and included infection (n = 11), mandibular malunion (n = 9), exposed bone or mandibular plates (n = 9), and flap failure (n = 5). Most patients demonstrated little to no trismus following reconstruction (94%) and were able to resume a regular or edentulous diet (73%). No difference in complication rates or postoperative outcomes was seen between osteocutaneous radial forearm and fibula free flap groups (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05).

<p>Oromandibular defect reconstruction following tumor resection remains a significant challenge for the head and neck surgeon. Unlike defects that involve the anterior mandibular arch, lateral defects result in disruption of the muscles of mastication and create an imbalance of the forces required to maintain mandibular form and function. A wide variety of reconstruction techniques have been described to restore continuity of the mandible, including nonvascular bone grafting,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599811430897">1</xref></sup> mandibular bridging with reconstruction plates,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811430897">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599811430897">4</xref></sup> and soft-tissue or osteocutaneous free flap reconstruction. In a study by King et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599811430897">5</xref></sup> patients who underwent vascularized bony reconstruction demonstrated improved functional results when compared with those who underwent soft-tissue reconstruction alone.</p>
<p>Osteocutaneous free-tissue transfer has therefore become the gold standard for mandibular defect reconstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599811430897">6</xref></sup> Donor site selection, however, has remained controversial. Donor sites most commonly include the fibula, scapula, and iliac crest. Use of the osteocutaneous radial forearm free flap (OCRFFF) was first described in 1978,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599811430897">7</xref></sup> although early reports of donor site morbidity limited its widespread use until recently. Prophylactic radius plate fixation has reduced the risk of fracture and donor site morbidity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599811430897">8</xref></sup> In a recent study comparing fibula and OCRFFF reconstruction of segmental mandibular defects,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599811430897">9</xref></sup> the OCRFFF was found to provide comparable functional outcomes with reduced overall morbidity. In the present study we evaluate outcomes in patients undergoing free flap reconstruction of lateral segmental mandibular defects and compare use of the fibula and OCRFFF in vascularized bony free flap reconstruction.</p>
<sec id="section1-0194599811430897" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Following University of Alabama Institutional Review Board approval, a retrospective review of all patients presenting to the University of Alabama at Birmingham and Oregon Health and Science University for osteocutaneous lateral mandibular defect reconstruction between 1999 and 2010 was conducted. Lateral defects were defined as those that extended from the anterior ramus of the mandible to the ipsilateral parasymphysis. A total of 124 patients were identified who underwent osteocutaneous radial forearm (n = 73) or fibula free flap reconstruction (n = 51).</p>
<p>Patients who required lateral mandibular defect reconstruction as a result of trauma or due to osteoradionecrosis were excluded from this study. In cases in which tumor resection involved the retromolar trigone (RMT), a marginal resection of the RMT was performed and the bone graft was plated directly to the preserved posterior segment of the ramus. When a portion of the ramus was removed (as in some RMT resections), nearly the entire masseter muscle was detatched from the mandible. If tumor resection did not involve the ramus, approximately 50% of the masseter muscle was detatched for placement of a reconstruction plate. A 2.4-mm locking reconstruction plate was used in all cases and adapted to the native mandible prior to tumor resection. Flap selection was largely dependent on surgeon preference, and no osteotomies were performed during fibula free flap reconstruction in order to allow for a side-by-side comparison of fibula and OCRFFF reconstruction techniques.</p>
<p>Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, adjuvant treatment, length of hospitalization, recipient and donor site complications, and flap failure rates were reviewed. Early complications were defined as those occurring during the immediate postoperative period and required intervention. Late complications included those cases that required readmission. Extent of surgical resection (including percentage of oral tongue excised), preoperative and postoperative dentition, dental implantation, trismus, and postoperative diet were evaluated. Trismus was defined as the inability to achieve a mouth opening of 2 cm and was considered severe if limited to 1 cm or less. Descriptive variables are reported as means (±SD) and categorical variables as percentages. Descriptive statistics were compared by general linear models for normally distributed variables or the Kruskal-Wallis test for otherwise. Survival time was calculated from date of surgery to date of death or date of last follow-up using the Kaplan-Meier method. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS version 9.2 software (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>From November 1999 to January 2010, a total of 124 patients underwent lateral mandibular defect free flap reconstruction. Mean age was 66.5 years (range, 31-96 years). Most patients were male (68%) and presented with advanced stage (71%) squamous cell carcinoma (94%) involving the alveolus (21%), RMT (23%), or oral tongue (21%; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599811430897"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). One patient presented with 2 separate primaries involving the oral tongue and buccal mucosa and required a composite resection and partial glossectomy. Glossectomy (n = 46) was limited (&lt;25% of tongue removed) in most patients who required resection (73%). Two patients underwent total glossectomy, and 10 required near total resection.</p>

<p>Thirty-two patients (27%) had undergone previous radiation, and 64 (55%) required postoperative radiotherapy; 19 (16%) required chemotherapy. There was no difference in adjuvant treatment between OCRFFF and fibula groups (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05). Mean follow-up time was 17 months. Patients undergoing OCRFFF reconstruction demonstrated shorter follow-up times (12.5 months) when compared with those undergoing fibula free flap reconstruction (20.2 months; <italic>P</italic> = .02). This finding reflects the more recent use of the OCRFFF for lateral segmental defect reconstruction.</p>
<sec id="section3-0194599811430897">
<title>Reconstruction</title>
<p>All patients (n = 124) underwent osteocutaneous free flap reconstruction. The fibula was more commonly used in the reconstruction of RMT (n = 17, 33%) and oral tongue lesions (n = 15, 29%), while the OCRFFF was the preferred choice in buccal (n = 9, 13%) and lateral floor-of-mouth defect reconstruction (n = 13, 19%; <italic>P</italic> = .01). Surprisingly, fibula free flap reconstruction was more commonly performed in patients requiring limited tongue resection (43% vs 16%), while patients with extensive defects were more likely to undergo OCRFFF reconstruction (40% vs 4%, <italic>P</italic> = .002). In accordance, more patients with advanced T-stage lesions (particularly T3) underwent reconstruction with the OCRFFF when compared with fibula reconstruction (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Mean mandibular defect size was similar between fibula (5.2 cm, range, 4.63-5.80 cm) and OCRFFF groups (5.4 cm, range, 3.72-7.02 cm; <italic>P</italic> = .86).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0194599811430897">
<title>Complications and Hospital Stay</title>
<p>The overall recipient site complication rate approached 27% (n = 34). Early complications including hematoma (n = 3), infection (n = 5), and fistula formation (n = 7) accounted for 42% of all complications. Most complications occurred following discharge (56%) and included bone or hardware exposure (n = 8) and mandibular malunion (n = 9). Flap failure occurred in 5 patients (4%). Two patients underwent repeat free flap reconstruction, and 3 were left to swing following debridement and primary closure. Two patients developed venous congestion requiring anastamotic revision without further complications.</p>
<p>There was no difference in complication rates between OCRFFF and fibula groups (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599811430897"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>). Early complications occurred in 15% of patients who underwent OCRFFF reconstruction compared with 8% of patients who underwent fibula free flap reconstruction (<italic>P</italic> = .07). Fistula formation occurred in 5 patients who were reconstructed with forearm flaps and 2 patients reconstructed with fibula flaps. Late complications occurred in 13% of OCRFFF reconstructed patients and 16% of fibula reconstructed patients (<italic>P</italic> = .94). Malunion occurred more frequently in patients undergoing fibula free flap reconstruction (n = 7 vs n = 2 OCRFFF), while hardware or bone exposure typically occurred in patients who underwent OCRFFF reconstruction (n = 7 vs n = 1 fibula free flap). Only 1 donor site complication occurred in a patient following fibula free flap reconstruction. The patient developed infection at the donor site incision, was readmitted, treated with intravenous antibiotics, and discharged 3 days after the infection resolved. No OCRFFF donor site complications were reported.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Lateral segmental mandibular defect reconstruction following tumor resection remains a significant challenge for the head and neck surgeon. Since the development of microvascular free tissue transfer, osteocutaneous flaps have become the workhorse for maxillofacial and oromandibular soft-tissue and bony reconstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599811430897">10</xref></sup> The fibula free flap has long been considered the flap of choice for reconstruction of the mandible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599811430897">11</xref></sup> Proponents of the flap cite the length and quality of bone stock available and the ease at which dental implants can be placed. Several studies, however, have shown future dental implantation is infrequent in this patient population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599811430897">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599811430897">12</xref></sup> and can be achieved with bone augmentation in OCRFFF reconstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599811430897">9</xref></sup> The thin, pliable nature of the radial forearm flap with its superior soft-tissue characteristics and lack of bulk allows for reconstruction of a variety of head and neck defects, and prophylactic plating of the radius has reduced donor site morbidity associated with its use. As a result, the OCRFFF has steadily gained popularity in mandibular reconstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599811430897">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599811430897">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599811430897">14</xref></sup> In the present study, we evaluated outcomes in patients undergoing osteocutaneous free flap reconstruction of lateral segmental mandibular defects. Patients reconstructed with the OCRFFF required shorter hospital stays and demonstrated equivalent wound healing and functional results when compared with patients who underwent fibula free flap reconstruction.</p>
<p>No difference in functional outcomes including postoperative diet at 12 months was seen between patients undergoing osteocutaneous radial forearm and fibula free flap reconstruction (<italic>P</italic> = .23). Return of oral function was achieved in 88% of all patients, and 35% were able to resume a regular diet; 6 patients (11%) remained gastrostomy tube dependent. In a study by Militsakh et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599811430897">12</xref></sup> 48% of OCRFFF patients maintained nutrition entirely by mouth at a mean time to follow-up of 40 months. Similarly, no difference in postoperative diet was observed between OCRFFF and fibula and scapula free flap reconstruction groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599811430897">12</xref></sup> Most patients in this study were able to maintain their native dentition (43%) or had dentures placed following reconstruction (7%). Despite a reasonably long-term survival rate (51% at 5 years), only 1 patient underwent dental implantation. The patient had undergone OCRFFF reconstruction and required bone grafting prior to placement of implants. In accordance with previous studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599811430897">8</xref></sup> the rate of dental implantation is low for this patient population and should not preclude use of the OCRFFF for mandibular reconstruction.</p>
<p>Just as dentition plays a critical role in the ability to tolerate a normal diet, trismus can severely limit a patient’s ability to take in oral nutrition. Most patients in this study demonstrated little to no trismus (94%); however, patients undergoing fibula free flap reconstruction were more likely to develop moderate to severe trismus (36%) when compared with patients undergoing OCRFFF reconstruction (12%, <italic>P</italic> = .008). Whether the increased bulk of the fibula flap or other factors associated with the tumor subsite and the resulting defect contributed to reduced mouth opening in these patients requires further clarification. Lateral mandibular defects can disrupt the muscles of mastication and create an imbalance of the forces required to maintain mandibular form and function. Perhaps the most likely explanation for this difference, though, is the larger number of malunion cases that occurred among patients following fibula free flap reconstruction.</p>
<p>Malunion is one of the most significant long-term complications seen in mandibular reconstruction and typically results from poor vascularity of the bone stock or inadequate bone contact at the donor-recipient site.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599811430897">10</xref></sup> Although the OCRFFF bone stock is limited, evidence suggests that malunion is actually more common in fibula free flap reconstruction. While there was no significant difference in late complication rates observed between fibula and OCRFFF reconstructed patients (<italic>P</italic> = .92), malunion occurred more frequently among fibula free flap patients while bone or plate exposure tended to occur among those patients reconstructed with the OCRFFF. The latter may be a function of reduced bone stock or the relative thinness of the OCRFFF in comparison to the skin paddle provided with the fibula flap. Early complications including infection, hematoma, and fistula formation tended to occur more frequently in those patients who had undergone OCRFFF reconstruction (<italic>P</italic> = .07). While infectious complications are generally multifactorial in nature, one explanation could be due to the smaller soft-tissue component provided by the OCRFFF in comparison to the fibula flap allowing for a potential dead space and risk of fluid accumulation. Importantly, no flaps were lost as a result of infection. Microvascular free flap reconstruction was successful in 96% of cases and comparable to those reported at other institutions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599811430897">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599811430897">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599811430897">15</xref></sup> Total flap failure rates were acceptable and equal among OCRFFF (4.1%) and fibula (3.9%) groups.</p>
<p>Early reports of significant donor site morbidity including fracture of the radius<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599811430897">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599811430897">17</xref></sup> limited widespread use of the OCRFFF until recently. Prophylactic plate fixation of the donor radius and careful harvesting techniques that take no more than 40% of the radial width have drastically reduced the risk of fracture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599811430897">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599811430897">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599811430897">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599811430897">18</xref></sup> In the present study, no donor site complications occurred among the OCRFFF group. One patient who underwent fibula free flap reconstruction developed an infection at the donor site and required readmission and IV antibiotics without further complications. Despite comparable complication rates between both groups, patients who underwent fibula free flap reconstruction required longer hospital stays (9.7 days) when compared with patients who underwent OCRFFF reconstruction (8.4 days; <italic>P</italic> = .04). Most patients who require mandibular defect reconstruction following tumor resection are elderly (mean age for this patient population was 67 years, with a range of 31 to 96 years) and may experience prolonged difficulty with walking following fibula free flap reconstruction. Whether an extended hospital stay was a function of difficulty in ambulating during the postoperative period in these patients is left to be determined.</p>
<p>Previous studies have highlighted limitations of the use of the OCRFFF in mandibular reconstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599811430897">9</xref></sup> The flap is typically contraindicated when a bony defect of &gt;10 cm exists, if more than 1 osteotomy is required to achieve appropriate contour, or in the presence of a large cutaneous or mucosal defect. In this study, defects were limited to those spanning from the anterior ramus to the ipsilateral parasymphysis and required no osteotomies. Accordingly, mean mandibular defect size was similar between OCRFFF and fibula groups (<italic>P</italic> = .86). Acceptable functional outcomes were achieved in lateral mandibular defect reconstruction with the use of the OCRFFF, even in the presence of large T3/T4 lesions and those that encompassed the floor of mouth or required extensive tongue resection. It is our institution’s practice to use a single osteotomy if required during OCRFFF reconstruction of mandibular defects, especially in those defects that include a portion of the anterior mandibular arch. However, when multiple osteotomies are required for mandibular reconstruction, when the defect involves the entire arch, or when a large bone stock is required for extensive mandibular defect reconstruction, the fibula free flap should be considered as an alternative.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The OCRFFF is a viable option for select lateral segmental mandibular defect reconstruction and provides comparable functional outcomes to those seen following fibula free flap reconstruction. Complication rates were similar between OCRFFF and fibula free flap groups, and hospital stay was reduced following radial forearm reconstruction. Although rare in this patient population, dental implantation can be achieved with bone grafting to augment the OCRFFF and should not preclude the use of this choice of vascularized bone graft.</p>
