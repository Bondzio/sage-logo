<sec id="sec1-0269094211424698"><title>Paul Farley and Michael Symmons Roberts, <italic>Edgelands: A Journey into England’s True Wilderness</italic>, Jonathan Cape: London, 2011; 264 pp.: 9780224089029, £12.99 (pbk)</title>
<p>I discovered this book not as a review copy, but because with a title like that I couldn’t resist it. I’d just got back from three cold grey days out by the Tangenziale, beyond an abandoned unfinished freight depot by Aldo Rossi in Milan. I was just on my way to meet a colleague in Bucharest who had researched the flatlands beyond Odai and Chiajna around the Soseaua de Centura. And I was the one who put the M25 in an alternative version of the Urban Design Group’s <italic>Good Places Guide</italic> and spent my A-level geography classes tracing abandoned railway lines round the edges of Kings Lynn between the allotments and the sluice gates. So this is not an objective academic review.</p>
<p>But then Paul Farley and Michael Symmonds Roberts are not urbanists. They are poets. My CV says I ‘retrained as a poet’ and my colleague in Bucharest is a poet,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0269094211424698">1</xref></sup> and these are the landscapes of Iain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269094211424698">Sinclair (2002)</xref> and Patrick <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269094211424698">Keiller (1997)</xref>—must be something in the air and the light and the water out there.</p>
<p>This little handbook (no illustrations or maps) to these forgotten and unrecognized places, unrecognized professionally except as ‘problems’, ‘opportunities for development’ by drive-by sat-nav planners, is in the tradition of the American revisionist urbanism of JB Jackson, Grady Clay and Robert <italic>‘Main Street is almost alright’</italic> Venturi. There is no narrative, no argument, no sequence just 28 unnumbered short (4 or 5 pages) first-person, anecdotal musings. So a fail mark then in most professional assessments.</p>
<p>But someone has to be the pioneer. Somebody has to get out there and look and think and write about the places we love to hate—‘subtopia’ and so on—even if as Farley and Roberts acknowledge they are not the first to use the term or develop an interest in these ‘lurky places’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0269094211424698">2</xref></sup> and their book begins with a nod to Marion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269094211424698">Shoard’s (2002)</xref> paper of the same name and Alan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269094211424698">Berger’s (2006)</xref>, less sympathetic, study of American ‘drossscapes’.</p>
<p>But where Berger did a fly-by study in his Cessna, and Shoard writes with academic panoramic vision, this is on foot in the rain and sleet and snow in the psychogeographical tradition (though they distance themselves from its <italic>derives</italic> and <italic>flaneurie</italic> right at the start) and in their texts (in a talk they explained the complex to and fro of manuscript and revision—they are poets not academic jobbing wordsmiths and this careful quality is apparent throughout) you can hear the birdsong and the traffic swishing on the arterials as they progress from cars to paths to dens to containers to landfill all the way through ruins and wastelands to airports and piers. It is everything you need to know about nowheres you would rather not know about—unless you have a dodgy motor to dispose of, or a rave to plan or a meeting with someone you shouldn’t be meeting (but keep clear of the plane-spotters logging you).</p>
<p>It’s been on Radio 4 already and it will be on my reading list next year for our pan-European urban design project and I have sent copies to Milan and Bucharest in preparation for this. Get yours before it gets remaindered and dumped as landfill and you have to scuttle through the bogs and mires to find a complete, stained and curled copy.</p>
