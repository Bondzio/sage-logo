<p>Smoking-associated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterized by inflammation, changes affecting small airways, and development of emphysema. Various short- and long-term models have been introduced to investigate these processes. The aim of the present study was to identify markers of early epithelial injury/adaptation in a short-term animal model of cigarette smoke exposure. Initially, male BALB/c mice were exposed to smoke from one to five cigarettes and lung changes were assessed 4 and 24 hr after smoking cessation. Subsequently, animals were exposed to smoke from five cigarettes for 2 consecutive days and lungs investigated daily until the seventh postexposure day. Lung homogenates cytokines were determined, bronchioloalveolar fluid cells were counted, and lung tissue was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Exposure to smoke from a single cigarette induced slight pulmonary neutrophilia. Smoke from two cigarettes additionally induced <italic>de novo</italic> expression of tight junction protein, claudin-3, by alveolar duct (AD) epithelial cells. Further increases in smoke exposure induced epithelial changes in airway progenitor regions. During the recovery period, the severity/frequency of epithelial reactions slowly decreased, coinciding with the switch from acute to a chronic inflammatory reaction. Claudin-3 and Clara cell 10 kDa protein were identified as possible markers of early tobacco smoke–induced epithelial injury along ADs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPDs) or airway diseases are the group of pulmonary diseases characterized by increased airflow resistance due to obstruction at any level of the bronchial tree. The group is comprised of several separate entities: emphysema of various etiologies, chronic bronchitis, asthma, and bronchiectasis. Clinically, chronic bronchitis and emphysema present in the same patient are referred to as COPD. The main etiological factor for COPD is smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0192623312448937">Husein 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Smoking-associated COPD is one of the leading health problems today and the fifth most common cause of death worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0192623312448937">Halbert et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0192623312448937">Pauwels and Rabe 2004</xref>), with one of the five cigarette smokers developing COPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0192623312448937">Taylor 2010</xref>). COPD is a multiorgan disease with renal and hormonal abnormalities, muscle wasting, osteoporosis, and anemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192623312448937">Celli and McNee 2004</xref>). Its pulmonary component is characterized by partially irreversible airflow limitation recognized as a progressive decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV<sub>1</sub>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0192623312448937">Rabe et al. 2007</xref>). The main pathological characteristics of smoking-associated COPD are inflammation along the bronchus and bronchioles, small airway and vascular remodeling, and development of centrilobular emphysema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0192623312448937">O’Donnell et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0192623312448937">Wright and Churg 2006</xref>). </p>
<p>Tobacco smoke contains many diverse toxic chemicals including a high proportion of reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), nicotine, and nitrosamines. Inhalation of tobacco smoke triggers a complex cell signaling cascade involving numerous cytokines. A correlation between exposure to tobacco smoke and the increased number of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) has been described in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0192623312448937">Pesci et al. 1998</xref>) and animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0192623312448937">Vlahos et al. 2010</xref>). In mouse models of cigarette smoke–induced inflammation, it has been shown that the initial neutrophil influx is mediated largely by keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2. In addition, elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-1β were found in BALF of experimental animals exposed to cigarette smoke for 10 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0192623312448937">Betsuyaku et al. 2008</xref>). Apart from neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes have been detected in BALF, as well as in sputum of COPD patients, when compared to smokers without COPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0192623312448937">Pesci et al. 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Disease progression has been shown to correlate with the changes affecting small airways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0192623312448937">Hogg et al. 2004</xref>). These are manifested as an increased proportion of small airways harboring neutrophils, macrophages, CD4- and CD8-T lymphocytes, and B-lymphocytes and the formation of lymphoid aggregates adjacent to the bronchiole wall. Emphysema in COPD develops as a consequence of a disrupted balance between tissue damage and the ability to restore the pulmonary architecture. Proteases, released into pulmonary tissue during inflammation by infiltrating neutrophils, macrophages, and alveolar macrophages, play a pivotal role in tissue destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0192623312448937">Vlahos et al. 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Decreased lung function, measured as FEV<sub>1</sub> and emphysema in COPD patients, has been linked to increased levels of sputum neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0192623312448937">Stanescu et al. 1996</xref>) as well as to a Th1-response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0192623312448937">Grumelli et al. 2004</xref>), suggesting that lung tissue damage may be driven by innate and adaptive immune responses. In addition, a direct toxic effect of cigarette smoke on epithelial cells has been documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0192623312448937">Broekema et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0192623312448937">Lin et al. 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>
<italic>In vitro</italic> cigarette smoke exposure induces DNA damage in bronchial epithelial cells, while in the pulmonary adenocarcinoma cell line (A549) cigarette smoke induces apoptosis and necrosis. In primary alveolar epithelial cells (AEC), cigarette smoke induces irreversible growth arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0192623312448937">Thorley and Tetley 2007</xref>). These <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments showed that apart from inflammation, parenchymal damage can be induced by the directtoxic effect of cigarette smoke on various types of epithelial cells. Recently, mechanisms involved in the intrinsic maintenance of pulmonary epithelial integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0192623312448937">Voelkel and Taraseviciene-Stewart 2005</xref>) and repair have attracted increasing attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0192623312448937">Bourbon et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0192623312448937">Thorley and Tetley 2007</xref>). Therefore, the scientific focus in studies on the etiology of COPD is slowly shifting toward endogenous pulmonary progenitor cells.</p>
<p>Therapeutic strategies in COPD are currently based mainly on the suppression of inflammation and indirectly target the development of emphysema. Antagonists or inhibitors of inflammatory mediators, however, have not yielded satisfactory results in COPD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0192623312448937">Barnes 2008</xref>). Therapies based on enhanced regeneration of resident pulmonary stem cells and allograft bone marrow–derived mesenchymal stem cells have been suggested as a possible therapeutic approach to COPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0192623312448937">Hackett, Knight, and Sin 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0192623312448937">Sueblinvong and Weiss 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Various animal models, using a multitude of approaches, have been employed to investigate COPD. Genetically modified animals have been engineered to assess the importance of specific pathways in the pathobiology of COPD. In wild-type animals, inflammation and emphysema have been induced, among others, by noxious chemicals, such as tobacco smoke. Short-term tobacco smoke exposure is mainly used to study the inflammatory response, while long-term models (3- to 6-month tobacco smoke exposure) were designed to study emphysema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0192623312448937">Wright, Cosio, and Churg 2008</xref>). The aim of the present study was to identify markers of early epithelial injury/adaptation using immunohistochemistry in a short-term tobacco smoke exposure COPD animal model. In order to determine the minimal smoke exposure needed to induce inflammation and/or epithelial alterations BALB/c mice were exposed to smoke from one to five cigarettes, and animals were sacrificed 4 and 24 hr postexposure. Aiming to explore an early postexposure recovery process, we exposed animals to smoke from five cigarettes for 2 consecutive days and sacrificed them daily until the seventh postexposure day. Cell-specific markers for macrophages (F4/80), epithelial cells (pan-cytokeratin [CK]), and marker for Clara cells (Clara cell 10 kDa protein) were used to determine the type of cells with altered morphology. The presence of cell injury caused by oxidative stress was investigated since it has been shown that oxidative stress plays a role in cell injury caused by tobacco smoke in humans and experimental animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0192623312448937">Churg, Cosio, and Wright 2008</xref>). Possible cellular adaptation to injury was approached by exploring the cell proliferation using Ki67 marker since increased proliferation rate following naphthalene, a constituent of tobacco smoke, has been documented in animal model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0192623312448937">Oliver et al. 2009</xref>). Impairment of airway epithelial barrier function induced by cigarette smoke has been shown in <italic>in vitro</italic> settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0192623312448937">Heijink et al. 2012</xref>). We, therefore, explored the expression pattern of several members of claudin family, a tight junction protein family variously distributed in pulmonary cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0192623312448937">Kaarteenaho-Wiik and Soini 2009</xref>). In lungs, claudin-3, claudin-4, and claudin-8 are involved in tightening the epithelial barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0192623312448937">Krause et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0192623312448937">Coyne et al. 2003</xref>). Collected data could provide insight into changes preceding the development of emphysema, as well as the suitability of the short-term tobacco smoke exposure model for the assessment of novel therapeutics facilitating the regeneration of resident pulmonary stem cells.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>Male BALB/c mice, 8 weeks old, were obtained from Charles River, Germany. Mice were maintained under standard laboratory conditions (temperature 23–24°C, relative humidity 60 ± 5%, 15 air changes per hr, artificial lighting with a circadian cycle of 12 hr). Pelleted food and tap water were provided ad libitum. All procedures on animals were approved by the ethics committee of GlaxoSmithKline Research Centre Zagreb Limited and performed in accordance with the European Economic Community Council Directive 86/609.</p>

<sec id="section4-0192623312448937">
<title>Cigarette Smoke Exposure</title>
<p>After acclimatization, mice were randomly divided into two main groups, cigarette smoke exposed (smoking groups) or sham exposed (control group). For whole body cigarette-smoke exposure, animals were placed inside a 2.0 l Plexiglas chamber (Braintree Scientific Braintree, MA) and exposed to the smoke produced by an indicated number of 3R4F reference cigarettes without filter (University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY; for details, see http://www.ca.uky.edu/refcig/3R4F%20Preliminary%20Analysis.pdf). Smoke was introduced into the chamber by a peristaltic pump (Masterflex L/S, Cole Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL) at a rate of 40 to 80 ml/min. Simultaneously, fresh air was insufflated at a rate of 0.4 to 0.8 l/min resulting in 10 to 20% saturation with cigarette smoke (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0192623312448937">Figure 1</xref>). Sham control animals were exposed to room air.</p>

</fig>
<p>For histological evaluation, mice (five per group) were exposed to cigarette smoke from one to five cigarettes. Cigarettes were lit consecutively except for exposure to five cigarettes, which was divided into two periods (3 + 2 cigarettes) separated by a 2-hr interval. Four and 24 hr after the last exposure to cigarette smoke, mice were killed and bronchoalveolar lavage was performed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in a total volume of 1 ml (three lavages with 0.4, 0.3, and 0.3 ml). Following bronchoalveolar lavage, lungs were excised and fixed in 10% buffered neutral formalin fixative.</p>
<p>To study pulmonary changes during a 7-day recovery period, mice (five per group) were exposed to smoke twice daily (3 + 2 cigarettes) for 2 consecutive days. Between each cigarette, a 1-min pause without smoke was introduced. The lungs and BALF were collected 24 hr after the last smoke exposure for a total of 7 days.</p>
<p>For measurement of inflammatory mediators in the lung tissue, mice (<italic>n</italic> = 70) were divided into fourteen groups. On the first day, animals were exposed to cigarette smoke from three cigarettes followed by a 2-hr break after which they were exposed to an additional two cigarettes. The same procedure was repeated on the second day. Animals were killed and lungs collected 0.5, 1, and 2 hr after exposure to the first three cigarettes and 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 hr after exposure to the additional two cigarettes on both days. Lungs were stored at −80°C until homogenization.</p>

<title>Histology and Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Lungs were inflated with 10% formalin, fixed for 48 hr and whole lung with ventral surface down was paraffin-embedded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192623312448937">Kittel et al. 2004</xref>). Slides were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS). Immunohistochemical staining was performed using the following primary antibodies: F4/80 (Acris, Germany, BM4008G, 1:50), claudin-3 (GeneTex, Irvine, CA, GTX15102, 1:50), claudin-4 (Abcam, UK, ab53156, 1:250), claudin-8 (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, sc-33065, 1:100), Clara cell 10 kDa protein (CC-10; Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, sc-9772, 1:100), CK, (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, NB600-579, 1:25), Ki67 (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, sc-7846, 1:50), and nitrotyrosine (Antibodies-online, Germany, ABIN339841, 1:100). Antibody binding was detected by secondary biotinylated antibodies, streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate, and diaminobenzidine chromogen (HRP-DAB System, R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Staining localization and intensity was examined by an observer blinded to the experimental design and subjectively graded according to the severity (0, <italic>absent</italic>; 1, <italic>minimal</italic>; 2 <italic>mild</italic>; 3, <italic>moderate</italic>; 4, <italic>marked</italic>) and distribution (1, <italic>focal</italic>; 2, <italic>locally extensive</italic>; 3, <italic>multifocal</italic>; 4, <italic>multifocal and coalescing</italic>; 5, <italic>diffuse</italic>) criteria. Scored parameters included alveolar macrophage hyperplasia, peribronchial mononuclear cells and neutrophils, perivascular mononuclear cells and neutrophils, and bronchioalveolar duct junction (BADJ)/alveolar duct (AD) inflammation, and epithelial changes.</p>

<title>Measurement of Inflammatory Mediators in Lungs</title>
<p>Lungs were homogenized on ice in PBS with protease inhibitors (1 µg/ml leupeptin, 2 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 µg/ml pepstatin, and 17 µg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride); 4 ml of PBS with protease inhibitors was added per gram of lung tissue. Homogenates were centrifuged (4°C, 2,500 g, 15 min) and stored at −80°C until analysis.</p>
<p>Samples were analyzed using xMAP coated microsphere technology (Luminex, Austin, TX), which enables simultaneous measurement of multiple biomarkers. Concentrations of granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon γ (IFNγ), IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-12p70, IL-13, IP-10, keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC), LPS-induced chemokine (LIX), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), monokine-induced by interferon gamma (MIG), MIP-1α, MIP-1β, MIP-2, regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed (RANTES), and TNF-α were determined with Milliplex MAP Kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In brief, 25 µl of samples were incubated with antibody-coated microparticles for 16 hr at 4°C. Afterward, washed beads were incubated with biotinylated detection antibody cocktail for 1 hr at room temperature, washed, and incubated for 30 min with streptavidin-phycoerythrin conjugate. After the final wash, the microparticles were resuspended in buffer and analyzed with Luminex 200 (Luminex, Austin, TX) and STarStation software v2.3 (Applied Cytometry Systems, Sheffield, UK) using five-parameter, logistic-curve fitting.</p>
<p>Concentrations of analytes in lung homogenates were further normalized to protein concentration in the samples and expressed as picograms of analyte per milligram of protein.</p>

<title>Cytokines in lung homogenates</title>
<p>Of nineteen measured cytokines, eight were present below or around the limit of detection of the kit used (GM-CSF, IFNγ, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and TNF-α). In addition, concentrations of IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-12p40, IP-10, M-CSF, MIG, and RANTES were weakly increased (data not shown). One hour after exposure to cigarette smoke from the first three cigarettes, a slight increase of KC and MCP-1 concentrations in lung homogenates was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0192623312448937">Figure 3A</xref> and D). Concentrations of both cytokines gradually increased from the first exposure to cigarette smoke, reaching their highest levels on the second day of exposure to cigarette smoke, that is, following exposure to six to ten cigarettes. On the other hand, concentrations of MIP-2 and LIX were significantly elevated after exposure to smoke from the first three cigarettes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0192623312448937">Figure 3B</xref> and C). Exposure of animals to cigarette smoke of additional cigarettes on the second day did not further increase the concentrations of these two cytokines.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Neutrophil accumulation in pulmonary parenchyma is one of the hallmarks of both COPD and cigarette smoke models of COPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0192623312448937">Bhalla et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0192623312448937">Di Stefano et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0192623312448937">Stanescu et al. 1996</xref>). In order to determine the minimal smoke exposure sufficient to induce inflammation, in the present study, we exposed BALB/c mice to smoke from one to five 3R4F cigarettes and evaluated various inflammatory parameters 4 and 24 hr postexposure. We have shown that brief exposure to smoke from a single 3R4F cigarette is sufficient to induce pulmonary neutrophilia. Four hours following exposure capillary vasodilatation and blood stasis were observed, while increased exposure to smoke induced accumulation of neutrophils in the interstitium. Twenty-four hours after exposure to smoke from a single 3R4F cigarette, neutrophils accumulated in lungs; mainly along bronchioles/ADs and adjacent vessels. Their count/percentage in BALF increased, while macrophage percentage significantly decreased. Further increasing smoke exposure to a maximum of five cigarettes did not significantly increase the 24 hr postexposure neutrophil count/percentage in BALF. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0192623312448937">Morris et al. (2008</xref>) showed that exposure to at least four 1R3F cigarettes was needed to induce an increase in the proportion of BALF neutrophils in BALB/c mice. The discrepancy between these studies could result from differences in animal gender and the type of cigarettes used.</p>
<p>The accumulation of neutrophils along bronchioles/arterioles and to a lesser degree along ADs is in line with the observation that 1 hr after first exposure to cigarette smoke, the concentrations of neutrophil chemoattractants, KC, MIP-2, and LIX, were strongly increased in lung homogenates.</p>
<p>Despite this early inflammatory reaction, smoke from a single cigarette failed to cause any epithelial damage in terms of changes in cell morphology and/or aberrant expression of markers used in immunohistochemistry. In contrast, following exposure to the smoke from two cigarettes, single cell loss along the bronchi could be detected. In addition, quite unexpectedly, this low smoke exposure level was sufficient to induce <italic>de novo</italic> expression of the tight junction protein, claudin-3, by AD epithelial cells. On the other hand, claudin-3 expression along cell membranes of bronchial epithelial cells remained unchanged following smoke exposure, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0192623312448937">Kaarteenaho-Wiik and Soini 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Prolongation of cigarette smoke exposure to five cigarettes for 2 consecutive days induced three major pulmonary changes: damage to bronchial epithelial cells, accumulation of neutrophils along bronchioles/arterioles, and hyperplasia of alveolar macrophages. Concentrations of KC and MIP-2 increased with the dose/duration of exposure to cigarette smoke as reflected in the increased intensity of neutrophilic pulmonary infiltration, detected histologically. The changes observed have been well documented in the literature on the murine short-term smoke model of COPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0192623312448937">D’Hulst et al. 2005</xref>). In addition, in these experimental settings, cigarette smoke induced overt intrapulmonary conducting airway epithelium cell loss.</p>
<p>It has been shown previously that cigarette smoke induces epithelial damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0192623312448937">Tarrant, Mills, and Williard 2009</xref>) in lungs with preferential damage of Clara cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0192623312448937">Plopper et al. 1992</xref>). In order to further highlight the airway epithelial cell reaction to cigarette smoke, antibodies against CK, claudin-3, claudin-4, and claudin-8, and CC-10 were used. Morphologically altered epithelial cells in the distal portions of the respiratory tree, that is, at bifurcations of bronchioles and BADJ, were identified as Clara cells (CK and CC-10 positive). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0192623312448937">Bolton et al. (2008</xref>) described metaplasia of Clara cells in transitional airways after exposure to LPS, which is also present in cigarette smoke. We confirmed, in line with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0192623312448937">Giangreco, Reynolds, and Stripp 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0192623312448937">Reynolds and Malkinson 2010</xref>), the high susceptibility of cells in distal airway progenitor regions, neuroepithelial bodies, and BADJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0192623312448937">Giangreco et al. 2009</xref>), to toxins from cigarette smoke. These findings support the hypothesis that the onset of emphysema, characteristic for COPD, is at least partially due to the failure of repair mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0192623312448937">Churg, Cosio, and Wright 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0192623312448937">Puchelle et al. 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>
<italic>De novo</italic> CK, CC-10, claudin-3, and claudin-8 expression by epithelial cells lining ADs could point to very early adaptive mechanisms induced by cigarette smoke exposure. Accordingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0192623312448937">Churg and Wright (2007</xref>) showed that ADs were the major site of lesions in a chronic murine model of smoke-induced emphysema.</p>
<p>In normal murine lungs, the cytoplasm of AEC-II was positive for claudin-3 and claudin-4 (data not shown), which is in agreement with observations by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0192623312448937">Kaarteenaho-Wiik and Soini (2009</xref>). Following smoke-exposure for 2 days, the majority of AEC-II were enlarged and some dividing, as observed in sections stained with claudin-3. The number of AEC-II expressing CC-10 and claudin-8 increased. There are scarce reports on claudin-8 expression in the respiratory epithelium of mammals. Expression of claudin-8 has been reported in cultured AEC-II of rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0192623312448937">Cohen, Lawrence, Margulies 2010</xref>) and the gills of puffer fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0192623312448937">Bagherie-Lachidan, Wright, and Kelly 2009</xref>). Bagherie-Lachidan proposed claudin-8 role in osmoregulation. Aberrant CC-10 expression by AEC-II was an unexpected finding. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0192623312448937">Park et al. (2006</xref>) noticed the CC-10 staining of a subpopulation of AEC-II which expressed Sox17. Sox17 is a transcription factor with a role in airway cell differentiation during both fetal and adult life. In mature lung tissue, its expression is restricted to bronchial ciliated cells. The relevance of altered claudin and CC-10 expression by AEC-II is yet to be explored.</p>
<p>In order to study the recovery process after exposure to smoke from 3 + 2 cigarettes for 2 consecutive days, pulmonary changes during the first 7 days after smoking cessation were observed. An acute inflammatory reaction, characterized by neutrophilic infiltration into the BALF and lung tissue, dominated for the first 4 days after the last cigarette. This was subsequently replaced by chronic monocytic inflammation. The concentration of the MCP-1 was significantly increased on the second day after smoke exposure leading to an increased accumulation of monocytes/macrophages. As a result, from the fifth day of observation, the macrophage count in BALF increased. Along with changes in BALF composition, monocytes prevailed among inflammatory cells in histological sections. Macrophages were mainly situated along bronchioles/arterioles, as indicated by the F4/80 marker. Within 7 days postexposure, their numbers diminished. In contrast, hyperplasia of alveolar macrophages was most prominent toward the end of the observation period.</p>
<p>In airways, no goblet cell metaplasia was evident, neither immediately after smoke exposure nor during the recovery period. Goblet cell metaplasia is characteristic of human COPD. In mice, even after prolonged smoke exposure, only minimal goblet cell metaplasia develops in lower airways. This is mainly due to different anatomical and histological characteristics in the mouse in comparison to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0192623312448937">Wright, Cosio, and Churg 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Changes in the epithelium lining terminal bronchioles and ADs were observed after smoke exposure, distributed diffusely throughout the lungs for the first 2 days after exposure and slowly decreased over the following days. By the end of the observation period, small foci of epithelial hyperplasia appeared, indicating repair of the bronchial mucosa. By day 7 after the last cigarette, small foci of bronchial metaplasia could be seen in ADs. Similar findings were described after exposure to naphthalene, which is found in cigarette smoke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0192623312448937">Jensen-Taubman, Wang, and Linnoila 2010</xref>). By the end of the recovery period, the AEC-II staining pattern for all observed markers was the same as in sham-exposed lungs.</p>
<p>Increased levels of oxidative stress have been described in smokers and COPD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0192623312448937">Churg, Cosio, and Wright 2008</xref>). In addition, oxidative stress in various lung compartments (airway epithelium, AEC-II, and alveolar macrophages) of animals exposed to cigarette smoke has been reported as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0192623312448937">Churg, Cosio, and Wright 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0192623312448937">Aoshiba et al. (2003</xref>) observed oxidative stress mediated DNA damage in AEC-II of animals exposed to cigarette smoke, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0192623312448937">Pechkovsky et al. (2002</xref>) showed that stimulated AEC-II and oxidative stress induced activation of alveolar macrophages. In our study, expression of nitrotyrosine was measured as an indicator of reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Cigarette smoke induced aberrant and transient nitrotyrosine expression by AEC-II and AD lining cells, as well as a sustained increase in nitrotyrosine expression by alveolar macrophages. These results support the proposal that increased nitrotyrosine expression by alveolar macrophages might be caused by cigarette smoke–induced oxidative stress in AEC-II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0192623312448937">Pechkovsky et al. 2002</xref>). Early nitrotyrosine expression by AD lining epithelial cells may have contributed to the more prolonged aberrant expression of various epithelial markers in our study.</p>
<p>In summary, in this study, we have described a model of cigarette smoke–induced lung injury characterized by an early onset of bronchiolar/AD and alveolar epithelial damage. We demonstrated the high susceptibility of Clara cells situated in airway progenitor regions to toxins from cigarette smoke and the smoke-induced aberrant expression of tight junction proteins by epithelial cells lining ADs. Furthermore, AEC were affected by toxins from cigarette smoke early after exposure. Therefore, the results presented in our study suggest that this short-term murine smoke model could be used to study pulmonary epithelial changes and epithelial injury/repair relevant to COPD that have been studied predominantly in long-term models. In addition, claudin-3 and CC-10 could be used as markers of early tobacco smoke–induced epithelial injury along ADs.</p>
