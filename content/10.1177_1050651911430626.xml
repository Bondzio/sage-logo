<abstract>
<p>Using tracings from a 1924 technical writing class, this article follows some normally unmarked processes of teaching and learning in order to highlight the humanities–utility binary from the perspective of the shadows of instructional practice. First, the article situates the humanities–utility debate as it is being addressed in postwar America, and second, it offers evidence of how far-reaching the resolution might have been, evidence taken from the margins of a copy of Watt’s (1917) <italic>The Composition of Technical Papers</italic>. Both the professional discussions and this textbook’s philosophy are reflected in jottings made by a technical writing student. This article suggests that tracing these issues through this underside of pedagogical history offers a type of evidence that is difficult to recover but worth seeking.</p>

<body>
<p>When I began the serious study of technical communication, my teachers urged me not to turn away from rhetoric (and humanities) in order to embrace writing, which was seen as a mere utility in the 1970s. After all, the positioning of that course in English departments, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1050651911430626">Sullivan and Porter (1993)</xref> have argued, was at best a lowly one and at worst that of a turncoat purveying the values of engineering, science, or business administration. In the common parlance of the day, technical writing was devoid of rhetoric and humanity, serving engineering’s values instead. Across that decade a definitional war sought to position technical writing institutionally in English or in engineering, and that war was waged with little overt consideration of rhetoric (though the conflict was rhetorical in nature). So <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1050651911430626">Miller’s (1979)</xref> attempt to clarify a humanistic rationale and argue—among other things—that technical writing belonged in English, where it would be taught with humanistic values, became useful to those who sought arguments that might open a space for rhetoric. But, while Miller demonstrated utility in aligning technical writing with English and humanities, her alignment did not jive with early accounts of technical writing’s instructional history. Or did it? Indeed, the knot of binaries that ties technical writing and English (often constructed as humanism) has sometimes seemed quite Gordian.</p>
<p>In this article, I worry that knot historically, reviewing the utility–humanities (or the utility–culture) binary using evidence from a post–World War I class held at Virginia Polytechnic Institute (VPI). I examine, first, whether or how the prewar binary debate had been resolved and, second, the extent to which in situ evidence from a class confirms or contests a position on the dispute. Of particular interest to this discussion is the construction of rhetoric at a time of postwar consolidation and growth. The 20th century educators had crystallized the utility–humanities debate, pitting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1050651911430626">Rickard’s (1908)</xref> “spurious coin” utility against <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1050651911430626">Aydelotte’s (1917b)</xref> “culture as belletristic” view as they formulated concerns about how engineers should be educated. Both positions downplayed an earlier rhetorically grounded view of utility found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1050651911430626">Valentine’s (1899)</xref> construction of first-year composition for engineers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and through this sharp construction of these binaries in the pre–World War I colleges, rhetoric was lost—or perhaps backgrounded—in 20th century instruction in technical writing. At least that is how it seems. I also look at methods that we use to assemble histories of instruction and argue that we cannot accept textbooks and published accounts of educators as providing a full portrait of those long-ago classes. Assuming that teachers from that era (as they do today) deploy portions of textbooks rather than transmit them whole cloth—an assumption not shared by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1050651911430626">Connors (1986)</xref>—and that educators who publish on curriculum do so to reform common practice (rather than to reflect an accepted one), I contend that we should seek in situ evidence to enrich the histories of technical writing instruction. Students’ in-class views, when we can uncover them, serve at best as unobtrusive measures of their teacher’s foci (as students “study” teachers to gain grades) and at worst as disinterested witnesses of what happens in class. Thus, while students’ views are as perspectival as the others involved in the practice of education, they can testify to what was addressed in a class.</p>
<p>In the following discussion, I build a context to consider whether the utility–culture debate was settled in postwar America, providing evidence from a popular textbook, from one university’s technical writing class of 1924, and from the witness of one student about the contents of that class. Along the way, I am alerted to how rhetoric got buffeted and discarded in the dispute—even though the dispute was highly rhetorical.</p>
<sec id="section1-1050651911430626">
<title>The Binary Battle</title>
<p>The sides for the utility-culture battles were taking shape at the end of the 19th century (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1050651911430626">Kynell, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1050651911430626">Longo, 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1050651911430626">Russell, 1991</xref>). The Society for the Promotion of Engineering Education (SPEE) included members from English by 1899, and its members vigorously advocated for both humanities-oriented and utility-oriented approaches to writing instruction. Published discussions entertained institutional and curricular placement of writing instruction for engineering students in freshman courses or later in their curriculum, and as engineering schools increasingly recognized the need for more writing instruction, they hired English teachers to teach it. The lines of public debate in those early 20th century venues were broader than just the placement of English (or other nontechnical instruction), as engineering educators were developing images of the educated engineer. Thus, sweeping debates, often framed in disciplines or in values, yielded little discussion of day-to-day classroom procedures. Our historical understandings became filtered through such high-level curricular–disciplinary arguments, teacher-penned articles, extant textbooks, and some testimonials of engineers about their education perspectives (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1050651911430626">Breitenbach, 1906</xref>).</p>
<p>Although we still know relatively little about technical writing classrooms, teacherly articles have told us a bit more about at least one school’s freshman writing instruction. Valentine offered one of the more detailed accounts of teaching practices in MIT’s first <italic>Technology Review</italic> in 1899, and it was discussed in several public venues. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1050651911430626">Russell (1991)</xref> identified Valentine’s and Aydelotte’s curricular approaches as highlighting the early axes of utilitarianism and humanism at MIT, with Valentine characterizing his approach as bringing utilitarian reform and Aydelotte later (when he became department chair in 1915) arguing that MIT needed to turn toward the humanities. Valentine contended that “in a system of philosophy there may be gaps between the stars, but there may not be one break in a system of water-works” (pp. 441-442), and therefore he promoted writing instruction for MIT students that focused on helping them state their thoughts clearly in writing to real readers. Valentine positioned the teacher as a middleman (which should not be surprising since he also is credited with starting the profession of industrial counselor) who operated between the supply and demand of communication. In his account, Valentine emphasized that students need the English department “not so much [as] stimulus to more thought, as drill in stating the thought he already has” (p. 442). So, MIT’s freshman English course in 1899 first asked students to describe their living quarters; later, it took students outdoors to describe an accident.</p>
<p>One of the most vivid accounts of freshman writing classes is found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1050651911430626">Valentine’s (1902)</xref> discussion of peer review. He explained—or perhaps defended—peer-grading practices by arguing the efficacy of having students grade each other’s work. Valentine contended that students need to be able to write to an audience other than the teacher in their professional work. His early treatise on peer review includes extensive examples of student texts with the annotations by their peers, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1050651911430626">Robinson (1909)</xref> noted this piece in an article in <italic>Science</italic> as a model of teaching practice.</p>
<p>Of course, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1050651911430626">Russell (1991)</xref> has related, the utilitarian movement at MIT did not outlive Valentine’s tenure. By the time that the United States became involved in World War I, Aydelotte had moved from Indiana University to chair MIT’s department and published <italic>English and Engineering</italic> (1917a), a reader (in the University of Wisconsin tradition of using readers and reading to teach writing) that connected engineering both to liberal education and to esteemed British stylists. In <italic>The Oxford stamp</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1050651911430626">Aydelotte (1917b)</xref> also added an elevated pro-British sentiment to advance his teaching agenda: “In an American university a man takes courses; at Oxford he studies a subject” (p. 16). Thus, he built broader support for a more humanistic (and literary) approach by linking humanists and writing instruction to reading and affixing the Oxonian stamp. Instead of grounding assignments in experience, observation, and reasoning for a real audience, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1050651911430626">Valentine (1899)</xref> did, Aydelotte used his <italic>English and Engineering</italic>, which offers 27 essays that he categorized into writing and thinking, the engineering profession, aims of engineering education, pure science and applied, science and literature, and literature and life. The more concrete discussions did introduce more literary ones—perhaps Aydelotte agreed that students needed to be motivated by placing engineering or scientific interests before Wordsworth, Arnold, Stevenson, Emerson, and so on, or perhaps he thought that reading essays on engineering and science was easier than reading literature and philosophy. Either way, he claimed in the preface that practicing engineers share his intense interest in English literature, have made valuable suggestions, and agree that literature and stylistics deserve the penultimate position in the text because they present the most difficult material to appreciate.</p>
<p>Thus, the kind of “Ford-meets-Freud” approach found at MIT during the Valentine regime, an approach that today would be seen as a rhetorically grounded one (albeit one that allowed limited room for invention), gave way to a more genteel and readerly model from literature and the humanities when Aydelotte arrived. Although we know less about the genteel, humanities-based model’s implementation, we might suspect that it increased reading and decreased writing (as such represented the Oxonian way for approaching education).</p>
<p>Our most concrete glimpse of Aydelotte’s humanistic classroom, however, comes later, after the Great War. In <italic>A Study of Engineering Education</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1050651911430626">Mann (1918)</xref> heralded Aydelotte’s vision as a great curricular experiment. Mann’s study of 20 prominent engineering schools, which even today is pointed to as one of the most influential educational documents for 20th-century American engineering, described Aydelotte’s work at MIT and Young’s work at Wisconsin as potential correctives for the poor writing and critical thinking skills displayed by engineers. Mann, referring readers to <italic>English and Engineering</italic>, described the conduct of the class: Starting with general questions, students read an essay about engineering, discussed the essay, wrote a theme, and met individually with the teacher to discuss faults with ideas and expression in order to build “a habit of self criticism from the point of view of the idea” (p. 64). Then students moved this work from essays in engineering, to such work on essays in science, and, ultimately, to literature. Mann, perhaps because he was not part of the English status quo, saw the injection of humanities into engineering education as a reform, and he provided the clearest picture of how the humanities classroom operated at that time (albeit in a first-year composition setting). But even his portrait is too sketchy to be totally satisfying.</p>

<title>Resolutions to the Binary Debates—Temporary or Otherwise—After the Great War</title>
<p>Aydelotte’s success at MIT, as amplified in the influential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1050651911430626">Mann (1918)</xref> report, might have created cognitive dissonance for us today because it provided support that a humanistic (rather than a utilitarian) argument allowed English to become a home for technical writing classes. Indeed, most see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1050651911430626">Rickard’s (1908)</xref> framing of technical writing as utility as a move that made technical writing understandable and acceptable in the engineering process, as a triumph that helped technical writing enjoy adoption across the sweep of the 20th century (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1050651911430626">Longo, 2000a</xref>). But the time was awash in slippery binaries: Should technical writing be a first-year composition replacement or a senior-level course focused on engineering forms? Should it be humanities oriented or utility oriented? Under the control of English or under the control of engineering programs? Vocational training or cultured education? Debated for almost 30 years at SPEE conferences (and for a shorter time in <italic>English Journal</italic>), these and most other questions were posed primarily as binary choices between technical and liberal arts. And each discipline inverted which part of the binary was status quo and which part was reform. Those in engineering education saw utility as the status quo and humanities as the reform while those in English reversed those positionings. But as they moved further away from the start of the century, both groups ceased to use rhetorically grounded (or even student-centered) approaches. More and more in published accounts, Aydelotte seemed to have triumphed. The question for post–World War I engineering education, then, became this, Was the triumph of Aydelotte’s humanistic approach extended into postwar education?</p>
<sec id="section3-1050651911430626">
<title>Binaries Were Still in Play</title>
<p>Because we have attended to the establishment of technical writing instruction, most pedagogical histories make few remarks about such instruction post–World War I. We relate its quick growth to the development of advanced courses in technical reporting, but our sustained gaze is more properly trained on the start of the 20th century. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1050651911430626">Hagge (1995)</xref> did include this period, unpacking textbooks’ ideologies and concluding that textbooks in the early 20th century (1908-1938) are invested in portraying the “engineering profession as a learned and genteel one” (p. 449). He argued that the early textbooks embraced “humanistic enculturation,” which he saw as a cover term for the general idea that engineers should broaden their cultural horizons and experience the humanities rather than limit their education to technical matters (p. 483, Note 7). Oddly enough, Hagge’s investigation of textbooks led him to conclude that Aydelotte’s view won, though most histories show the utilitarian view as the winner. Because the textbook situation across the 30-year stretch that Hagge studied does not totally jibe with the conclusions of the earliest discussions, looking at whether the utility–culture binary was relevant after the Great War is a worthwhile investigation.</p>
<p>In 1918, Swain, a civil engineering professor at Harvard University, addressed this binary broadly as one between technical and liberal approaches to education; he then tried to dissolve the various attendant binaries that he saw alternately framed as utilitarian and humanistic, vocational and professional, or engineering and humanities. Swain sought to bust up those binaries by linking <italic>professional</italic> and <italic>liberal</italic> into a new binary that operated in contrast with <italic>vocational</italic>. Doing so allowed him to portray engineering education as striving to move from vocational training for an occupation (as it was in the early 19th century) to professional, liberal education (as most colleges aimed to emulate). Swain identified the “liberal element” and contended that it<disp-quote>
<p>arises from a recognition of the fact … that since we live among men, an educated man should have some knowledge outside his own vocation, of language, literature, history, and economics, so that he may understand and appreciate what goes on about him, that he may know something of the thoughts and deeds of the great men of the past, and may be able to write and to express himself clearly and logically. Without these things, a man may have great skill and knowledge, but not attain his greatest usefulness or development. (pp. 99-100)</p>
</disp-quote>But because he saw engineering education as aiming to include a liberal element, Swain focused on “motivation” as a key to reaching engineering students whose liberal subjects do not match well with their subject-matter knowledge and experience (as cooperative education does).</p>
<p>When <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1050651911430626">Swain (1918)</xref> turned to English courses, he suggested focusing writing instruction on developing good reports in which the engineers must express themselves “clearly, forcibly, concisely, and logically” (p. 105). Swain did not want a traditional course because<disp-quote>
<p>it is of little importance to the engineering student whether Keats was a greater poet than Shelly [sic]; but if the student is led up to the study of good writers through his own, experience in trying to express himself, or by seeing the relation of the subject he reads about to the necessities of his own profession, he will gain an interest heretofore often lacking. (p. 105)</p>
</disp-quote>Such a position rearranged the utility–humanities debate because Swain’s call for “liberal education” stripped key literary elements from the older notions of humanities. Thus, while his approach structurally resembled Aydelotte’s (1917a) humanities focus, Swain’s construction of the content of a class also treated learning in the more utilitarian approach found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1050651911430626">Valentine’s (1902)</xref> vision because they shared an initial focus on student experiences through writing. Thus, Swain’s sense of the liberal element hardly matched Aydelotte’s literary construction of the central place that humanities should hold in an engineer’s education. If Swain had aligned with humanities (or liberal learning), he had done so for its professional utility.</p>
<p>While there is little evidence Swain’s argument accomplished the binary busting he undertook, he and the other authors addressing the utility–culture binary did realize that they were constructing “us–them” arguments, and ultimately these arguments were not satisfying to them. Indeed, binary construction of curricular arguments actually conflicted with postwar sentiments toward an economy-driven principle of textbook construction, one in consonance with older notions of pedagogical authorship: namely, that every new textbook borrowed freely from (and without need to credit) every previous one. And such a practice of binary construction could quickly muddle together philosophically divergent curricular approaches. So both argument and commonsense practice militated against sustaining these binaries purely, if at all.</p>

<sec id="section4-1050651911430626">
<title>Courses had Stabilized</title>
<p>The importance of technical writing courses seems to be stabilized if we accept the discussion by 1920.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1050651911430626">1</xref></sup> While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1050651911430626">Park’s (1920)</xref> “Preliminary Report of Committee No. 12, English” described the state of English instruction in engineering programs (in part because the committee viewed English as floating and unlikely to have a group that takes charge), it also affirmed the importance of English. Park found that a majority of programs required both freshman English and an advanced course in report writing, and most placed the courses in English departments. Committee No. 12 had run a successful national survey of engineering programs (with 58 of 62 responding), and a vast majority of engineering programs valued writing instruction, as 93% required freshman composition; 64% required an advanced course in report writing, technical journalism, public speaking, or argumentation; and 76% required some other nontechnical course work (e.g., economics). Thus, by the early 1920s (just 20 years after MIT was discussing technical writing inside the freshman course), a technical writing course at a senior level, such as the one I describe next, had become a popular requirement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1050651911430626">
<title>Textbooks Accommodated</title>
<p>We might think an examination of textbooks would reveal attitudes toward instruction and perhaps offer clues to how the binary debate was resolved. But despite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1050651911430626">Hagge’s (1995)</xref> findings, textbooks operate in an economic climate (i.e., in which publishers need to sell books), and this economic imperative mutes their stated philosophies of instruction (utilitarian or humanistic) in at least two main ways: First, they seek an ever-broadening audience by including divergent camps, and second, they operate as instructional resources, not the story or blueprint. Indeed their politics are complex.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1050651911430626">Connors (1986)</xref> demonstrated writing textbooks’ complexity more generally, arguing that the growth in colleges (both in numbers and in student enrollment) in the last quarter of the 19th century had led to a shortage of writing teachers:<disp-quote>
<p>Thus were the rhetoric textbooks born: out of a paucity of new rhetorical material, out of the weakness and ignorance of untrained teachers, and out of the increasing power of a newly technologized publishing industry that was quickly gaining the ability to control the content of textbooks by the exertion of market pressure. For more than a century afterwards, these three conditions would continue to be key elements affecting composition textbooks. (p.183)</p>
</disp-quote>Textbooks, Connors stated, changed from assistants in the discovery of knowledge in the mid-19th century to purveyors of what we (as a culture or a discipline) already know. Thus, he outlined a tyranny of the textbook that has become almost an assumption among those who study pedagogical history. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1050651911430626">Longo (2000b)</xref> applied this line of thinking to technical communication when she placed the American technical writing textbook in that tradition. She related Rickard’s (1908) <italic>A Guide to Technical Writing</italic> to older textbook traditions flowing from Comenius that standardized the content of a discipline (from earlier oral transmission of key ideas):</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Now students and teachers had the same text in their hands. Students no longer needed to depend on the teacher for knowledge. The textbook contained the knowledge that would be transmitted in the classroom and students could read it for themselves….Teachers no longer needed to read aloud for students to copy….This system ensured that students were trained in a specific way. (p. 299)</p>
</disp-quote>Longo further commented that the textbook standardizes both the teachers’ and the field’s knowledge because it authorizes what should be taught in a class, a point that is made clear by looking back on the period from the vantage of its history.</p>
<p>Because the published curricular discussions of the day (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1050651911430626">Kynell, 1996</xref>) join this scholarship about textbooks (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1050651911430626">Connors, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1050651911430626">Hagge, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1050651911430626">Longo, 2000a</xref>) to frame our historical views of technical writing pedagogy, we rarely glimpse students (or their in situ writing). Further, we rarely uncover an intact syllabus that predates the World War II era, and this lack of information about day-to-day activities means that those who are interested in the history of pedagogy lack direct access to instruction (well, to the extent that documentation counts as direct evidence).</p>

<sec id="section6-1050651911430626">
<title>A Postwar Case From VPI</title>
<p>Our portraits of early technical writing classrooms, then, accumulate through a piecing process that is reminiscent of the forensic manipulation of trace evidence: They are stitched together in patterns that depend on serendipitous evidence. Typically, we treat that testimony as truth rather than understand that those patches could also be mismatched. So the questions attending information about student and classroom voices usually are the ones raised about cases: How do you justify this case? And how far can we trust what it says?</p>
<p>The following case uses the marginal writings of a senior in a technical writing class, Emmett Lee Owens, to look into classroom activities after the Great War. It offers fragments of a 1924 writing class, English 424: Technical English, held at VPI, drawing its evidence primarily from Owens’s copy of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1050651911430626">Watt’s (1917)</xref>
<italic>The Composition of Technical Papers</italic>. It assembles tracings of a normal practice in the 1920s and highlights questions about day-to-day classroom practices. Owens’s sometimes faint penciled markings in the margins of his textbook help us to inspect some shadows of a post–World War I technical writing class and to discern whether and to what extent the binary debates indeed were settled.</p>
<p>This evidence from Owens’s marginal markings, while spare, shines light on perspectives (namely, student responses) that almost always elude our histories, and it suggests an important question for historians of instruction: What would a better understanding of students add to our understanding of technical writing pedagogy? Shining a light on these historical shadows can prompt us to pose questions that are normally unasked when we assume that the material conditions of those early classrooms (primarily that the tremendous expansion in the number of students in college severely taxed the modest number of well-educated teachers) urged underprepared teachers to follow textbooks from front to back. Were textbooks deployed with scriptural adherence? Did students read them? How did students interact with texts? Did they engage in lively discussions? In what ways did the classroom positively influence the students’ writing? What forms did student and teacher resistance take and toward whom or what was it directed? And so on. While Owens can speak only for himself—and not for other students in his class (and certainly not his teacher)—his comments remind us that other perspectives on classroom activities still lurk in the shadows.</p>

<title>VPI in the Early 1920s</title>
<p>VPI, chartered in 1872 as Virginia’s response to the Morrill Act for educational pursuits in agriculture and mechanics, was a college experiencing that burst of growth that followed the Great War. By 1922, Smyth reported that VPI’s enrollments had grown to 975 in 1921-1922 (from 132 in 1872-1873); it had awarded 1,459 undergraduate degrees and 276 graduate degrees; undergraduate majors had expanded from the original three options in Agriculture, Agriculture &amp; Mechanics, and Mechanical Engineering to 15 options, with majors in Agriculture, Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering dominating the enrollments. The academic years after World War I brought considerable change to VPI, with new President Julian A. Burruss reorganizing it, offering new majors, and—important for our interests—adding new English courses in agricultural journalism, technical English, and public speaking. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1050651911430626">Park’s (1920)</xref> committee had reported, advanced courses in one of these areas were required in 64% of engineering schools nationally by its survey in 1920. So VPI’s curricular additions demonstrated knowledge of and care for putting VPI in step with national trends. Since 57 of the 75 graduates in 1922 were engineering majors, the technical English course probably drew the largest enrollment of the three new courses, and perhaps in scrambling to staff this course, the English faculty were encouraged to teach by following a textbook’s lead.</p>
<p>The 1923-1924 <italic>V.P.I. Bulletin</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1050651911430626">VPI, 1924</xref>) lists five faculty in English: two professors (one the department chair), two assistant professors, and one instructor. The faculty offered 16 different undergraduate courses (not including those requiring multiple sections)<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1050651911430626">2</xref></sup> and graduate instruction by tutorial. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1050651911430626">Smyth (1922)</xref> noted, Burruss added staff rapidly after 1919, which may have meant that the addition of three new courses had paved the way for hiring the instructor that taught technical English.</p>
<p>The course English 424, titled Technical English, was scheduled for the second or third term of the academic year:<disp-quote>
<p>In this course the engineering student is specially prepared to do the kinds of writing chiefly required in his career. After a general review of principles of exposition, special attention is devoted to such forms as technical description, process-exposition, pure exposition, reports, and business letters. Extensive practise is given in the writing of these forms. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1050651911430626">VPI, 1924</xref>, p. 114)</p>
</disp-quote>This description suggests that the English department saw the course as helping engineering students perfect their deployment of the forms of exposition by practicing extensively in order to be “specially prepared” for their work. Because the catalog description was rather recently penned at the time Owens took his class (it could have been no more than 2-years old), we can surmise that the course would be offered in much the way it was described. Indeed, the closeness of the list of contents to the chapters in Watt’s textbook suggests that whoever wrote the catalog description did so after that text was published in 1917 and with it firmly in hand. Further, since I could find no evidence that any English faculty saw their intellectual calling to be technical writing or its instruction—since none of them published on technical writing or was a member of SPEE—Owens’s class was likely taught as a service.</p>
<p>In all, the VPI that emerges matches fairly closely to typical post–World War I engineering education: a land-grant university with growing engineering offerings, an expanding student population and faculty, and an expanding writing instruction that included senior-level technical writing courses but no faculty who specialized in technical writing. The catalog description portrayed a course that specialized on and practiced exposition (which is more of a humanities term than <italic>report</italic> would be), which both makes sense, given what we can discover about the faculty of the day, and suggests that the humanistic approach advanced by Aydelotte held sway with those at VPI who instituted the course.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1050651911430626">
<title>Watt’s Textbook</title>
<p>If we map the course description to Watt’s textbook, we find a close match and suspect that the department and course leaned toward a humanities orientation and that VPI positioned itself on the humanities side of the utility–humanities dispute about technical writing.</p>
<p>In the early 1920s, Watt’s book would have been recommended to VPI as a well-received text. Published in 1917 when Watt was an assistant professor of English at New York University, the textbook was praised in <italic>Booklist</italic> as “an excellent book for the teaching of English to engineering students who are supposed to have had freshman English. Particularly useful in emphasizing the importance of technical English by examples taken from technical literature. Based on experience in the University of Wisconsin” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1050651911430626">American Library Association, 1918</xref>, p. 53). The text quickly established a national adoption base (Colorado School of Mines, e.g, made it a required text in 1918) and had five impressions before a new edition (coauthored with P. B. McDonald) was published in 1925. As <italic>Booklist</italic> hints, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1050651911430626">Watt’s (1917)</xref> textbook belongs in the humanities camp, and it adds the wrinkle commonly found in humanistic approaches that are adjusted for use in advanced courses—it foregrounds exposition as a fundamental skill for good engineering writing. Watt connected his approach with his teaching at the University of Wisconsin in both a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1050651911430626">1916</xref> <italic>Engineering Education</italic> article and in the preface of this book:<disp-quote>
<p>The book is the result of a teaching experience of several years at the University of Wisconsin, and embodies the methods employed there in a one-semester, three-hour course elective for juniors and seniors in the College of Engineering. (pp. vi-vii)</p>
</disp-quote>Using readings as models for instruction, Watt followed a common University of Wisconsin practice that is a hallmark of the humanities approach. In the preface, too, Watt outlined the structure of the course that the book was intended to support:<disp-quote>
<p>Two weekly class meetings for informal talks on technical writing, analyses and study of specimens from various sources, drill in paragraphs and sentences, and other class exercises. A weekly five-hundred word theme of the type under consideration in class. A regular weekly conference of at least fifteen minutes with each student. A semester paper of from two to three thousand words on a subject of especial interest to the student. (p. vii)</p>
</disp-quote>
So while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1050651911430626">Watt (1917)</xref> expressly stated that the course had one aim, “to teach engineering students to write better technical reports,” and underlined that aim by having weekly “informal talks on technical writing” (p. vii.), he undercut that direct, utilitarian, and potentially vocational aim through three moves that express loyalty to the humanistic approaches of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1050651911430626">Aydelotte (1917a)</xref>: He (a) described a set of procedures for a first-year course (reading and analyzing writing, drilling on paragraphs and sentences, and producing 500-word themes) as the normal procedures for an advanced course in technical writing, (b) explained the course’s approach using freshman-course language rather than reporting language more often used by engineers (500-word themes rather than reports, instructions, or memos), and (c) focused on teaching reading through the use of incrementally more complex models of argumentation.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1050651911430626">Watt (1917)</xref> acknowledged two extant approaches (i.e., the binaries discussed earlier) to teaching English composition to engineering students: “Following the present trend of engineering education away from narrow overspecialization” and “preparing the engineering student to write successfully such papers as his vocation will demand of him” (p. v). In this acknowledgment, Watt tried some binary busting when he claimed that the two approaches should not be “antagonistic” and argued that his text could accommodate both. Still, he situated himself in the second camp: Watt was most interested in advanced courses aimed at teaching report writing to upper-level engineering students, courses that he thought should reside in English.</p>

<title>The 1924 Class Through Owens’s Marginalia</title>
<p>A student in Technical English at VPI, Owens added marginal notes into his copy of <italic>The Composition of Technical Papers</italic> (for more on Owens, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1050651911430626">Sullivan (2012)</xref> for more on marginalia, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1050651911430626">Jackson, 2001</xref>). Because Owens marked and dated the assigned work from the book, we know the class met on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays during the spring term of the 1923-1924 academic year. While Owens’s marginal notes do not yield all the information that a modern syllabus would (e.g., teacher, office hours, statement about course goals, listing of work requirements, grading criteria, calendar, and statements about policies), they do chart how major sections of the book flowed into the class calendar and help us extend our knowledge of day-to-day technical writing pedagogy in post–World War I American engineering education.</p>
<sec id="section10-1050651911430626">
<title>Class opening</title>
<p>As an opening move, the teacher had the class complete sentence-correction exercises in the first part of the volume—General Principles of Expository Writing (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1050651911430626">Appendix</xref>). This move makes sense for a class populated by senior engineering students, as the text’s avowed dual populations (first-year engineering students in a composition class or advanced students in a specialized class) would tend to direct teachers to use different sections of the text with advanced classes and perhaps view the opening sections as more properly the purview of freshman composition. But this choice also meant that the course began without covering either the inspirational material that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1050651911430626">Watt (1917)</xref> wrote to convince engineering students that good English is important to engineers or the overview of technical report writing. Instead of attempting to inspire students to take this class seriously by asserting that engineers need to write well to be successful or providing an overview to report structures and processes, the teacher began Owens’s class by having students correct page after page of problem-laden sentences.</p>
<p>This carried into assignments, as the class skipped the textbook’s motivational and big-picture discussions (“The Value to the Practicing Engineer of a Training in English Composition”, p. 3), the most directly rhetorical section of the text (“Fundamental Problems—Getting the Reader’s Point of View”, p. 12), the genre overview (“The Types of Writing with which the Engineer is Concerned”, p. 6), and the process overview (“Principles Which Govern the Planning and Writing of the Whole Composition”, p. 20). Instead, they began on p. 123 with “Defective and Weak Sentences for Revision”, which meant that in the first week of their class, students corrected 150 defective sentences instead of being convinced that good English and humanities, audience, genre, and process were important to their future engineering careers.</p>
<p>Some marginal comments suggest that Owens surveyed at least a portion of the opening section on his own (or that the class examined it briefly at some point), as he commented that “Outline 4: The Laying of Underground Concrete Conduits” (p. 36) had a problem with expression: “not const sub-div… should be alike” (which translates, “not consistent subject divisions … should be alike”). He also corrected a typo on p. 49 in the discussion of the whole composition. Thus, Owens may well have read the chapter on planning and writing the whole composition. But there is no evidence that he read the introductory material that Watt intended to help students connect English with their study of engineering. So, Owens started Technical English in a way that neither English faculty focused on humanizing engineering writing nor engineering faculty focused on building utilitarian education would have recommended. On the flip side, we have to leave open the possibility that Owens’s teacher may have deemed the students sufficiently motivated and therefore began with correcting expression.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1050651911430626">
<title>Progression through the text</title>
<p>Once the teacher assigned reading from the text, Owens’s markings show that the assignments moved in sequence through the book, covering most of the second part of the text (the class ultimately read about 60% of the textbook). The assigned reading omitted a few student examples and a few models in the “Exposition of Ideas” (chapter 8) and then returned—near the end of the class—to include “Sand-Drying Plant of the Metropolitan Street Railway, New York” (which was published in <italic>Popular Science Monthly</italic>). The last article was either assigned for its pleasure (near the end of the course) or was intended to offer a model of a technical journal article. The class ultimately covered discussions of technical description, exposition of processes, exposition of ideas, reports, and business letters (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1050651911430626">Appendix</xref>). For each of these topics, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1050651911430626">Watt’s (1917)</xref> text included an explanation, some student examples, and some published professional examples. And the reading assignments for this class suggest that even though the opening did not follow Watt’s orientation, the class generally followed Watt’s plan—that is until chapter 8—as only a few of the examples were omitted from the reading assignments. Further, Owens’s marks in the text show that he read the material assigned and that the teacher probably made some points about the text in class (e.g., judgments about an example’s quality). Owens also read one of the essays marked for omission—“Refining Crude Petroleum” (p. 241), by Walter Sheldon Tower (from his book <italic>The Story of Oil</italic>)—and marked the lines of argument set out by the author although he added no metacomments that revealed why he read this piece so carefully.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1050651911430626">
<title>Huxley and the exposition of ideas</title>
<p>Chapter 8 of the textbook provided seven essays to serve as models for engineering students to use in scaffolding their reading of sophisticated technical articles (and by extension connecting that sophistication to the kind of reading done in the humanities). Here Watt most directly followed Aydelotte’s lead in preparing engineering students to read as the educated read and thereby gain the Oxford stamp. Chapter 8’s models are positioned to (a) reveal how a technical journal is structured and how to read an article in a technical journal, (b) present an argument representing good scientific method through an excerpt from Huxley’s <italic>Six Lectures to Workingmen on the Phenomena of Organic Nature</italic> (1863), and (c) instantiate the structure and argument by adding strong examples of good technical articles they should expect to read as practicing engineers. Through this assemblage of readings, Watt models not only the good technical reading habits for engineers but the habits that will raise them to “genteel.”</p>
<p>Owens’s marginal comments show that the class read the two how-to essays and then spent considerable time discussing the Huxley excerpt. But the class was assigned to read only one of the remaining four essays, and these aimed to consolidate good reading behavior. Thus, the fullness of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1050651911430626">Watt’s (1917)</xref> intended instruction in educated reading was abbreviated by Owens’s class. This dwelling on the Huxley excerpt suggests that the teacher shared Watt’s humanistic values, but just as interesting, the curtailing of Watt’s full instruction on the application of Huxley’s approach to the students’ interests further suggests a humanities faculty member who was disengaged from extending principles of humanistic reading into professional engineering arguments. Yet again, Watt’s text makes an effort to bind humanities together with engineering, and that too was skipped by Owens’s class. The class in some ways enacted a humanities-oriented approach, but in other ways it did not engage directly with Watt’s implied stance that humanities and English are good for engineering students. The course ultimately skipped two major components of the process built into Watt’s introduction to critical reading, and thus, this enactment of a humanities class might surprise both those who struggled through the binary debates and more current historians who imagine that faculty of those days were slaves to their textbooks’ authority and messages.</p>

<title>Owens’s Responses to the Class</title>
<p>When <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1050651911430626">Park (1920)</xref> asked engineering deans to characterize their students’ attitudes toward English, the deans reported that students sometimes resented being required to take nontechnical classes, particularly those in humanities—an indication, to the extent that it was accurate, that technical writing needed to separate itself from humanities and embrace utility. As Dean Benjamin of Purdue University puts it, “The attitude of the student is not hostile but rather inclined to be utilitarian. He usually lacks interest in a subject whose application he can not foresee” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1050651911430626">Park, 1920</xref>, p. 414). Do we see evidence that Owens’s comments aligned with this view of student attitudes, or do his marginal comments indicate that at least this one student held a more complex attitude? While his marks are most closely aligned with reflecting the structure of the class, his marginalia suggest a matter of factness rather than a full-blown resistance. Owens engaged most keenly with process descriptions, and while his skill at critique grew, he limited his criticisms to student examples. He did not display the resistance that Dean Benjamin expected, but Owens also evidenced little enthusiasm.</p>
<sec id="section15-1050651911430626">
<title>Marginal comments were most enthusiastic in the process section</title>
<p>Owens’s comments were typically aimed at charting the assigned reading, noting the main points, outlining the sample reports or readings, and making corrections. He rarely evidenced much enthusiasm for the work though his comments increased in amount and probity when the subject matter turned to descriptions of technical processes. Owens was particularly thorough in his reading of and commenting on technical processes. They are the only sections that drew consistent outlining, forceful double check marks, and extensive comments. It is curious though that Owens, in these sections that were the only sections of the textbook that consistently included visuals and diagrams, evidenced no interest in those visuals. He usually outlined processes but never commented on visuals.</p>
<p>Just as he ignored visual explanatory tools, Owens seemed not to notice overviews that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1050651911430626">Watt (1917)</xref> provided at the start of chapters to build frameworks for the material covered. Instead, Owens seemed to go directly to the facts. He changed this fact-centered reading pattern once, in the process description section. There, Owens underlined those orienting sentences that spoke of the key components: “Give first some statement of the <italic>general</italic>
<italic>direction</italic> of the whole process,” “brief historical account of the evolution of the process may often be used effectively to give a better understanding,” and the introduction should “not be over-long in proportion to the whole composition” (p. 202). As these sentences do not begin or end paragraphs, and Owens did not routinely underline sentences, we cannot expect he was enacting a general reading strategy. More likely the underlinings reinforce that process descriptions were important to Owens.</p>
<p>But he also took <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1050651911430626">Watt’s (1917)</xref> instructions to heart, as his reading and commenting on examples began to reflect the language Watt used in addressing examples he found problematic.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1050651911430626">
<title>Commentary usually targeted student examples and used Watt’s language</title>
<p>In his commentary, Owens typically treated professional examples differently from student examples. He matter of factly noted the main points that professional authors made by numbering the moves in the arguments or developing a marginal outline of their texts, seeming to expect that the published accounts would follow the rules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1050651911430626">Watt (1917)</xref> expressed in his explanations. This outlining may have been assigned, as Owens was careful to follow the rules laid down early in the textbook about outlining. He relabeled his outline for Hale’s article “The Construction of a Large Reflecting Telescope” (pp. 233-241), for example, when he mistakenly labeled both the third and fourth stages as the third stage. But because he was working using pencil, he could erase (though not so thoroughly that a later reader could not see the original writing) and correct his outline. All in all, his comments treat the professional texts as models to be appreciated and followed.</p>
<p>Interestingly, he also used the textbook’s language in addressing a student example he found problematic—commenting that it included “no gen direction” and “no hist.” Since his criticisms about this student’s writing were well founded and in keeping with what Watt himself might have said, Owens displayed the ability to absorb and deploy the text’s advice. Perhaps he felt authorized to criticize the student examples because Watt cautioned readers at the start of the student writings, “They are <italic>not designed to serve as models</italic>” (p. 157), and he repeated that invitation to criticize before each set of student examples. It may also be the case that he was assigned to criticize the student examples, and thus his remarks reflect a mix of homework and class discussion as much as they do his own readings.</p>
<p>Later in the text, when Owens tracked professional reports, he also mimicked Watt’s language appropriately (and in a way that showed he had understood how Watt wanted him to read). For the “Letter Reporting a Test” (p. 377), to offer an example, he labeled the report “information and recommendation,” pointed to where the report gives “analysis of prob.,” and noted that it follows “logical order.” He seemed to view both the published articles and the reports as professional writing that should be respected and followed, but his search to locate where and how they stated and organized their problems led him to read reports more actively than he read articles.</p>
<p>One exception to Owens’s careful regard for professionals’ texts occurs in the chapter covering the expositions of processes (chapter 7). In reading Herbert M. Wilson’s “Erecting a Tent” (pp. 220-222), which was excerpted from <italic>Topographic Surveying</italic>, Owens took issue with the opening of the piece, commenting “no introduction ... no description.” Perhaps he missed that the text was excerpted from a textbook and seemed to be intended to show how procedural writing was already embedded in the texts that the students frequently read and used. Owens recognized that this writing differed from the process descriptions that preceded it (it was actually similar to contemporary instructions) and did not agree with Wilson’s approach. Regardless of the reason for this divergence from his normal pattern, Owens’s commentary about the piece shows growth in confidence and writerly vocabulary.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1050651911430626">
<title>Utility or humanities</title>
<p>Owens’s comments about the descriptions of technical processes (and one part of the reporting) display at least engagement with the material. He is taking it seriously and absorbing the critical language he needs to use in relation to the subject matter. This engagement belies the deans’ comments that students resist technical writing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1050651911430626">Park, 1920</xref>), particularly when we take into account the inelegant way that the class Owens took was framed. But in the chapter on “Exposition of Ideas,” a section in which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1050651911430626">Watt (1917)</xref> modeled a humanistic approach to reading technical arguments, Owens did not engage with the material any more than it seemed to be necessary. In other chapters, he commented regularly, often insightfully, about weaknesses in the student examples. But for the eight student examples covering exposition, Owens commented on the first example, “from simple to complex … logical arrangement of topics”; gave two examples a double check mark; and wrote nothing else in the margins. Further, his comment was phrased “logical arrangement of topics” rather than his preferred “logical order,” which may signal that he copied it down in class rather than made it during his reading. He was not engaged with this section of the course, the section Watt intended for use in transforming Owens and his classmates into American Oxonians; put another way, he seemed to resist the Oxford stamp.</p>
<p>So while Owens did not seem as resistant as the deans in Committee No. 12 might predict, he also did not seem to embrace humanistic reading and critique with enthusiasm. Owens was far more engaged with processes and technical order. His markings seemed far more utilitarian than humanistic. We must remember, though, that whatever his attitudes were (and they were not on display overtly in his commentary), Owens increasingly displayed himself to be a more able critic of writing as the class progressed.</p>

<title>Reframing the Postwar Classroom: Was Rhetoric Present?</title>
<p>The teacher of this 1924 class is not identified, and thus we view the class from an underrepresented view of pedagogical history—namely the notations of a student. Wiped away from the slate in the tracing of this class is the teacher’s rationale for classroom activities; featured instead are dates in which assignments start and end, answers to drill exercises, and notes on assigned readings. Wiped away is what we as teachers are comfortable with for establishing an authoritative account of a class, namely the teacher’s documentation. Thus, this tracing of that 1924 class is an unusual one. Further, it does not deliver a testimonial from this student. Here, we have a day-to-day scribing of class, and because of its clinical precision, it intrigues as much as it discloses. Did the teacher sufficiently motivate Emmett Lee Owens to care about improving his writing? We cannot say. What would Owens have told us had we been present to gather his testimony? We can wonder, certainly, but we cannot be satisfied that we have ascertained his attitudes: This sort of inquiry can only read—and speculate on—what a student wrote literally between the lines (and in the margins).</p>
<p>Rhetoric certainly was not a prominent topic in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1050651911430626">Watt’s (1917)</xref> textbook. While the text did address audience early on, there was no evidence that the class (or Owens on his own) read that section. The course that Owens documented began with an atomistic approach—starting with sentence drills and progressing through modal genres (description to persuasion) and building to four themes. Indeed, there is little evidence that the teacher assigned the section that is most overtly rhetorical in intent (an introduction covering testimony on the importance of writing to engineers), and the class consistently skipped the sections of the textbook that brought up motivational material or taught humanities approaches in a deeper way. Instead, the teacher began the class with a portrait of English teachers that was as unflattering as possible: “Let’s start by correcting faulty sentences.” Such a move would seldom inspire anyone to proclaim that good English is essential to the education of an engineer. Of course the teacher can no more defend his actions to us than Owens can, and at least two alternative readings make sense. First, the teacher may have considered Watt’s opening more a bit of pre–World War I talk than an appropriate motivational for the new engineering students in a postwar era. A revised edition of the book was published the next year, and thus this textbook’s hortatory comments may have seemed dated. Or second, the teacher may have been forced to teach technical English to engineering students who were difficult to reach and responded defensively by displaying editorial expertise as a wordsmith. Fortunately, this darker reading is not warranted through Owens’s comments because he never reflected a cynicism that would likely have flowed in such a negative space. Indeed, his comments were evenhanded and on point, usually showing him to be both smart and attentive.</p>
<p>In taking this student’s marginal notes seriously and as a window on whether utility or humanities held more sway in his class, I have advocated that we seek evidence from normally hidden student voices as a way to extend our understandings both of ideology as it shines through day-to-day classroom practice and of the workings of in-situ instruction. As this case demonstrates, this evidence is fragmented and resistant to easy renderings of the stories we would like it to tell us. Students do not write their marginal notes in textbooks for historians from the future; they write to remember, to remind, to highlight material to themselves. Thus, we overhear conversations not intended or shaped for our ears. That does not diminish their value; it only renders them a bit more opaque to decoding.</p>
<p>Because comments such as Owens’s add richness to our portraits of past classrooms, I contend that the marginal notations that students have made in past textbooks should be added to our arsenal of historical evidence and treated carefully and systematically. Doing so, of course, is not unproblematic. While Owens seemed to keep his textbook, as no other student had marked in it, not all students keep their texts. In fact, most scholars who study marginalia from the 18th and 19th centuries expect to find markings from multiple readers in the margins of texts, and they handle this phenomenon by studying the markings as evidence of the conversations that readers developed about the books they were reading (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1050651911430626">Jackson, 2001</xref>). In studying classroom activities, then, we are likely to uncover texts that have been used many times and contain a veritable palimpsest of commentary in their margins, but these multimarked texts will not designate the activities of one class as clearly as Owens’s markings do. Such texts will be more difficult to sort than Owens’s text has been, but they will lead back to the literature on marginal conversations and thus will be useful for different purposes. We should not expect, though, that annotated texts will continue to be plentiful. Libraries, the main fixtures for our historical work with textbooks, typically remove the books that have too many marginal comments from their collections, so textbooks with significant glosses on classes are likely headed to the library book sale (if they have not already been placed there). And if we think that the massive digitization project that libraries and Google are conducting will preserve those student-embossed texts, we need to think again. While a few of those digitized books reveal marginalia, the markings are difficult to decipher because even excellent scanners do not render pencil markings readable.</p>
<p>Still, regardless of the difficulties, these perspectives that students added to their texts and preserved in the margins are worthy of inclusion in our portraits of historical instruction even though the marginalia likely reveals a differing register of opinions than more formal student writing would. My position is that any student writing is helpful to efforts to better understand the technical writing classrooms of long ago. Whenever we can find and situate a student’s text—as I have with Owens’s marginal comments—we can then dig deeper into the cultural surround from which that text sprang and hopefully enrich our understandings of long-ago classrooms. Through such efforts, we can inspect the shadows of our dominant stories of classroom instruction and, more important, put at least some traces of the students’ experiences back into their classrooms.</p>
<p>What, then, does Owens highlight about his post–World War I Technical English class? Through his textual markings he shows us a flip side to a class that probably would have identified itself as a humanities-oriented course. It did use a humanities-affiliated textbook and humanities terminology, focus carefully on reading models, and value correct[ing of] expression. But there is little evidence from this flip side of instruction that the class provided a thorough modeling of educated professional reading that would mark an educated man with the American Oxonian stamp. It seemed to lack an extensive modeling of careful reading that Aydelotte had advanced—this promise of an education that included a humanities polish—to sell MIT and the wider community of engineering educators on the value of humanities to engineers. If the English faculty member teaching Owens’s course reduced the intellectual scope of the class because he was talking to engineers (and he believed that a focus on correct sentences was what engineers wanted), that person was out of step with the wider professional discussion in early 20th-century engineering education about the value of humanities. Of course, the markings provide little evidence that Owens missed the fuller humanities experience that could have been afforded him, but they also give ample evidence that he was bright enough to handle it. Is it possible that later in the 20th century, technical communication teachers had to reassert or reintroduce a humanistic approach to teaching technical writing because this post–World War I group did not pursue it with vigor? Or did the increasing technical demands on engineering education make the in-depth reading that Watt intended an untenable curriculum for college seniors with only marginally developed critical reading skills before they started a senior course—thus discouraging the Oxford stamp? Both scenarios suggest a continuing need to recover the ways in which technical writing classes (and students) after the Great War both embraced and resisted both utility and humanism, even when they expressed their allegiances to one or the other. Owens’s commentary suggests that while no rhetorical theory was overtly taught, one certainly was enacted.</p>

<p>Institutional placement for technical writing classes could have turned out differently, that is, other origin stories for technical communication instruction could be fashioned. Contracts and specifications, for example, a class found as early as the 1880s in engineering departments, offers an alternative. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1050651911430626">Haupt (1878)</xref> taught contracts and specifications at the University of Pennsylvania in the late 19th century and published a popular textbook, <italic>A Manual of Engineering Specifications and Contracts</italic>, that focused on learning to write those genres. Alternative histories of technical writing instruction might also be built around agricultural journalism, the much larger phenomenon of business writing for engineers, or science writing.</p>
