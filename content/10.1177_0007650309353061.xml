<abstract>
<p>This research draws on the stakeholder salience framework to explore more deeply the web of business–stakeholder relationships that characterize the <italic>Fortune</italic> Global 100’s corporate social responsibility and sustainability reports. By better understanding stakeholder salience, defined as the power, legitimacy, and urgency attributed to stakeholders in these corporate reports, this research enables business leaders and scholars to further their recognition and comprehension of the characteristics of the critical stakeholder relationships that link business’s social and sustainability performance with its economic performance—the triple bottom line. Despite the predictions of this research, nationality was not found to be a differentiating factor of stakeholder salience, whereas industry membership, in one of two instances, was found to differentiate stakeholder salience in the corporate reports. Implications of these findings are discussed.</p>

<p>For decades, corporations have communicated with their various stakeholders through annual financial reports, often due to a regulatory mandate. Recently, however, a new and powerful communication tool to present information to a wide array of possible stakeholder groups has emerged: the corporate sustainability or social responsibility report. This research was undertaken to apply the stakeholder salience tool to better understand the descriptive power of these reports in the context of the business–stakeholder web of relationships and to discover if organizational factors, such as national or industry differences, explain variances across these reports.</p>
<p>Pressure to develop corporate sustainability or social responsibility reports emanated from both internal and external stakeholders, ranging from global nongovernment organizations (NGOs) to potential or current investors to government regulators, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0007650309353061">Ballou, Heitger, &amp; Landes, 2006</xref>). Moreover, public relations scandals, such as the use of lead-based paint in children’s toys, caused many stakeholders to seriously question business’s legitimacy and performance. Increases in corporate social disclosure represented a strategic business response to enhance the firm’s public image and reestablish its legitimacy as a powerful influence in the social network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0007650309353061">Hooghiemstra, 2000</xref>). The annual corporate social responsibility or sustainability reports opened up a new “window” for business organizations to inform stakeholders of their organizational successes, and sometimes failures, and their commitment to address the areas found lacking.</p>
<p>These reports noted the importance of many recognizable stakeholder groups, such as the community, consumers, employees, stockholders, and others. More recently, significant attention toward the area of sustainability surfaced, given the importance placed on this emerging stakeholder by business leaders. In a survey of 400 CEOs and senior executives, 9 of 10 corporate leaders stated they are “doing more than they did five years ago to incorporate environmental issues into their core business strategies” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0007650309353061">United Nations Global Compact, 2007</xref>).Sustainability had become a central issue for business executives and organizations and a critical research question for scholars. While sustainability encompassed a wide range of activities—the greening of building construction, business operations, product design, labeling and advertisement, energy use, and many other business practices—it also had found its way into another critical business action—corporate reporting.</p>
<p>Arriving on the scene in the 1970s, corporate nonfinancial reports initially focused narrowly on the social environment and stakeholder relationships associated with the social environment. Two decades later, the quantity and quality of information within these reports had vastly improved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0007650309353061">Kolk, 2005</xref>). They now reflect business’s commitment to both the traditional social stakeholders as well as the arena of sustainability. These reports have become as common for the world’s largest corporations today as the articulation of corporate codes of business conduct. While scholars have begun to dissect the content of these reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0007650309353061">Adams, Hill, &amp; Roberts, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0007650309353061">Ballou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0007650309353061">Cooper &amp; Owen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0007650309353061">Gray, Kouhy, &amp; Lavers, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0007650309353061">Jose &amp; Lee, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0007650309353061">Kolk, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0007650309353061">2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0007650309353061">KPMG, 2005</xref>), this research digs deeper into these corporate reports using a framework developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0007650309353061">Mitchell, Agle, and Wood (1997)</xref>—stakeholder salience. We explore the stakeholders’ attributes of power, legitimacy, and urgency found in the web of business organization–stakeholder relationships described in the <italic>Fortune</italic> Global 100 corporate social responsibility or sustainability reports to better understand manifestations of stakeholder salience.</p>

<p>To better comprehend the context of this research project, it is important to understand the development and current state of corporate social reporting and the stakeholder salience framework created by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0007650309353061">Mitchell et al. (1997)</xref>.</p>

<title>The State of Corporate Social Reporting</title>
<p>In the early 1970s, a handful of companies, mostly headquartered in the United States and Western Europe, began to publish nonfinancial information within their annual reports. Within a few years, this trend took hold in the United States and, as reported by the public accounting firm Ernst &amp; Ernst, 90% of the <italic>Fortune</italic> 500 (U.S.) companies reported their social performance in their annual reports. The information provided by these U.S.-based companies tended to focus on local community programs and was limited to less than a page in the report. In Europe, nonfinancial or social information was likely found in annual reports for companies located in Germany, the Netherlands, and France (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0007650309353061">Kolk, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0007650309353061">U.S. Department of Commerce, 1979</xref>). In contrast to the reports by U.S. businesses, European companies tended to focus on employee issues and presented information in a quantitative format. But this trend was short lived, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0007650309353061">Ans Kolk (2005)</xref> reported: “Overall, however, this phenomenon lasted less than a decade; in the 1980s, social reporting lost momentum” (p. 35). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0007650309353061">Dierkes and Antal (1986)</xref> and other scholars observed, social reporting was never institutionalized.</p>
<p>A renewed emphasis in environmental issues brought greater attention to communicating nonfinancial information to business stakeholders, with NGOs at the forefront of this reemergence of social reporting. Eastman Kodak and Norsk Hydro published environmental reports in 1989 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0007650309353061">Kolk, 2005</xref>), and the practice mushroomed in the 1990s. KPMG, which surveys the corporate social reporting field every 2 years, found a profound increase in the number of companies having sustainability or social responsibility reports from less than 15% in 1993 to more than 40% in 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0007650309353061">KPMG, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0007650309353061">Kolk (2005)</xref> found that more than 70% of U.K. companies published nonfinancial reports. Only Japanese firms had a higher percentage of nonfinancial reports in 2002 and 2005, with more than 80%. In contrast, social or sustainable reporting peaked in the United States in 1996, with 42% of U.S. firms having such reports, but it dropped to 38% by 2005.</p>
<p>By 2007, the scope of the nonfinancial reporting widened to include not only community and employee issues but also environmental reporting and accounting. It appeared that government agencies, financial investments groups, the media, and other stakeholders were placing more pressure on companies to publish social or sustainability reports, and the contents of these reports were often mandated by government regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0007650309353061">Jose &amp; Lee, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the widespread presence of and access to sustainability and corporate social responsibility reports published by large business organizations and the wealth of information contained within these reports, corporate reports appeared to be a viable source of information when seeking to recognize and assess corporate stakeholder salience. The framework describing stakeholder salience is presented next.</p>

<title>Stakeholder Salience</title>
<p>Although discussed within business circles as early as the 1960s, the publication of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0007650309353061">Freeman’s 1984</xref> landmark book, <italic>Strategic Management: A Stakeholder Approach</italic>, resulted in scholars and business practitioners more commonly using the term <italic>stakeholder</italic>. The term stakeholder was understood as persons or groups that affected, or were affected by, an organization’s decisions, policies, and operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0007650309353061">Freeman, 1984</xref>). Stakeholders were classified as market-based, or primary, stakeholders—such as employees, consumers, and stockholders—as opposed to nonmarket-based, or secondary, stakeholders—such as the media, government agencies, and community activist groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0007650309353061">Lawrence &amp; Weber, 2008</xref>). It was widely understood that each organization had multiple stakeholders, and these persons or groups had a multitude of interests and placed a plethora of demands on the organization. The challenges of understanding, weighing, and responding to these stakeholder demands became a critical issue for business practitioners and scholars toiling in the research field of stakeholder management, as evidenced by the special issue of <italic>Business &amp; Society</italic> in March 2008.</p>
<p>A significant enhancement in our understanding of stakeholder management appeared in 1997 when scholars created a framework for detecting stakeholder salience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0007650309353061">Mitchell et al., 1997</xref>). The framework built on previous analyses of stakeholders to identify that stakeholder relationships existed and were often discussed in terms of dimensions of power and legitimacy. The issue of urgency was also added to the dimensions of stakeholder relationships to culminate in a triad framework: power, legitimacy, and urgency. (These three salience terms are defined later in this article.) As these three dimensions of stakeholder salience were observed in reality and their potential for overlap or intersection appeared, the classification of stakeholder relationships took on a complexity resulting in eight different stakeholder relationship types. These types are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0007650309353061">Figure 1</xref>, as defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0007650309353061">Mitchell et al. (1997)</xref>.</p>

<p>There have been only a few empirical assessments using the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0007650309353061">Mitchell et al. (1997)</xref> stakeholder salience framework reported in the management literature during the past decade. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0007650309353061">Agle, Mitchell, and Sonnenfeld (1999)</xref> examined stakeholder salience by surveying CEOs at 80 firms and found “that in the minds of CEOs, the stakeholder attributes of power, legitimacy and urgency are individually (with only two exceptions) and cumulatively (with no exceptions) related to stakeholder salience” (p. 520). Based heavily on Agle et al.’s work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0007650309353061">Gago and Antolin (2004)</xref> surveyed environmental managers from 277 Spanish manufacturing firms to discover their perceptions of organizational stakeholder’s power, legitimacy, and urgency—stakeholder salience. Likely due to their specific focus on environmental issues alone, they reported that “the government stands out among the stakeholders” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0007650309353061">Gago &amp; Antolin, 2004</xref>, p. 68) due to its power to impose environmental actions. Gago and Antolin further reported that the power dimension of stakeholder salience “significantly influences the environmental salience of all stakeholders except for owners and suppliers” (p. 71). However, any conclusions drawn from this work must be limited since the sample only included Spanish firms.</p>
<p>More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0007650309353061">Parent and Deephouse (2007)</xref> sought to examine how managers themselves identified and prioritized stakeholders. Overall, their research “supported the positive relationship between number of attributes and salience” (p. 18). They also found that most stakeholder relationships fell into the dormant–dominant–definitive stakeholder pathway, as theorized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0007650309353061">Mitchell et al. (1997)</xref>, indicating the overwhelming importance of power—contained in all three of the stakeholder relationship types—and to a slightly lesser extent legitimacy—found in two of the three stakeholder relationship types, as found by Parent and Deephouse. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0007650309353061">Magness (2008)</xref> used the stakeholder salience model to examine two environmental accidents in the mining industry and found that decision makers attributed different levels of priority to various stakeholder groups in these incidents.</p>
<p>Given the potential explanatory power embodied in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0007650309353061">Mitchell et al.’s (1997)</xref> stakeholder salience dimensions and the limited empirical exploration based on their model, it seemed prudent to further explore stakeholder salience by utilizing an increasingly popular form of corporate communication—the corporate social responsibility or sustainability report.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0007650309353061">
<title>Research Propositions</title>
<p>The lack of prior research applying the notion of stakeholder salience imposes some caution when developing testable hypotheses. Corporate social responsibility and sustainability reports are often a public affairs or public relations tool providing transparency for the company (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0007650309353061">Hooghiemstra, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0007650309353061">Kolk, 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0007650309353061">Nieminen &amp; Niskanen, 2001</xref>). As defined, a public affairs tool seeks to span across multiple stakeholders, both internal and external to the company, and provides a “window in, window out” function—where the stakeholder can see into the company and the company can provide information to its stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0007650309353061">Lawrence &amp; Weber, 2008</xref>). Therefore, a number of plausible relationships based on the limited prior research investigating corporate social responsibility or sustainability reports were developed and provided the basis for analyzing our research hypotheses.</p>
<p>We argue that the three dimensions of stakeholder salience—power, legitimacy, and urgency, as found in the corporate social responsibility or sustainability reports—may be influenced by various organizational demographic factors. Two of these possible demographic factors are described next.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0007650309353061">
<title>The Company’s Nationality</title>
<p>Although there appeared to be some consistency in the corporate social responsibility and sustainability reports published by companies around the world, some differences appeared when sorting the social reports by nationality. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0007650309353061">Levy and Kolk (2002)</xref> argued that the home country’s institutional context created pressure on the multinational regarding its disclosure of financial and nonfinancial information, and this pressure was evident in the corporation’s social report.</p>
<p>Specifically, corporate social reporting by U. S. companies tended to focus on the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0007650309353061">Adams et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0007650309353061">U.S. Department of Commerce, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0007650309353061">Welford, 2005</xref>), due to greater attention to philanthropic activities and reporting by U.S.-based firms. This leads to our first hypothesis:</p>
<list id="list1-0007650309353061" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: The proportion of companies exhibiting stakeholder salience (a) power, (b) legitimacy, and (c) urgency toward the community is greater among American firms than among non-American firms.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Other stakeholders surfaced when investigating their salience based on regional differences. An increased emphasis on the employees and human resource issues by European firms, but less focus on employee issues by Asian firms, was reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0007650309353061">Welford (2005)</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0007650309353061">Everaert, Bouten, VanLiedekerke, DeMoor, and Christiaens (2008)</xref> identified that Belgian firms overwhelmingly reported on employee issues or labor practices, as did <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0007650309353061">Vuontisjarvi’s (2006)</xref> analysis of Finnish companies. Therefore, we hypothesize that</p>
<list id="list2-0007650309353061" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: The proportion of companies exhibiting stakeholder salience (a) power, (b) legitimacy, and (c) urgency toward their employees is greater among European firms than among non-European firms.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Recently, European and Japanese companies stood out among all companies with social responsibility or sustainability reports in their tendency to focus inward and provide environmental costs and benefits in their report, particularly more than their United States counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0007650309353061">Jose &amp; Lee, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0007650309353061">Kolk, 2005</xref>). This echoes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0007650309353061">Kolk’s (2003)</xref> analysis of the <italic>Fortune</italic> Global 250 where she found “very high levels of sustainability reporting . . . in the UK, Japan and Germany” (p. 283). Therefore, we hypothesize that</p>
<list id="list3-0007650309353061" list-type="simple">

<sec id="section6-0007650309353061">
<title>The Company’s Industry Membership</title>
<p>Industry-level research, particularly in the field of social responsibility and corporate citizenship, emphasized that companies operating in different industries focused on different stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0007650309353061">Miles, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0007650309353061">Weber &amp; Wasieleski, 2003</xref>). Much of this work was based on the resource dependency argument that firms have limited resources available to meet the demands of their stakeholders, and thus firms must select which stakeholders will be allocated various amounts of the finite resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0007650309353061">Oliver, 1991</xref>). Specifically, scholars laboring in the stakeholder management fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0007650309353061">Berman, Wicks, Kotha, &amp; Jones, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0007650309353061">Russo &amp; Fouts, 1997</xref>) wrestled with developing a strategic formula in response to the overwhelming demands by stakeholders causing businesses to prioritize or weigh these demands prior to the allocation of the resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0007650309353061">Hess &amp; Warren, 2008</xref>). The stakeholder salience model, developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0007650309353061">Mitchell et al. (1997)</xref>, was one technique available to reconcile these perplexing challenges for business managers. In this section of the research, we propose that stakeholder salience would vary based on the industry membership of the firms in our sample.</p>
<p>Companies selling directly to the public or producing a product with the potential for high negative contingencies or harm for consumers, what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0007650309353061">Miles (1987)</xref> called high customer exposure, have a natural affinity to allocate scarce resources and offer greater stakeholder salience to customers. Companies belonging to the consumer products, electronics, financial services, food and beverage, health care, and retailing industries have a high customer exposure and may accentuate, or give salience to, its customer stakeholder relationship. Therefore, we hypothesize that</p>
<list id="list4-0007650309353061" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 4</italic>: The proportion of companies exhibiting stakeholder salience (a) power, (b) legitimacy, and (c) urgency toward consumers is greater among companies with direct-to-customer sales or potential for customer harm from their products, such as companies in the retailing, consumer products, or financial services industries, than companies in other industries.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Other companies, such as those in the energy, oil and gas, and utility industries, are dependent on the acquisition of natural resources for their business operations and sales. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0007650309353061">Jose and Lee (2007)</xref> found that companies in the environmentally sensitive industries, such as oil and gas and utilities, “are more inclined to disclose environmental performance information” (p. 319) than companies in finance and other service industries. Therefore, we hypothesize that</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>Given the growth of reporting and the possibility of differences in stakeholder salience across various countries or geographic regions, an international sample of social reports was needed. The <italic>Fortune</italic> Global 100 companies (a subset of the Global 250) was used as the basis for locating and analyzing corporate social responsibility or sustainability reports. By further exploration of the Global 100’s Web sites, we discovered a wide range of report titles associated with these reports. Companies typically used “Corporate Social Responsibility Report” or “Sustainability Report” as titles for their reports, but a broader net was cast to ensure that all corporate social responsibility or sustainability reports were included in our data set.</p>
<p>When evaluating this data, we also discovered that some firms placed their social responsibility or sustainability information on their Web pages, making it more difficult for us to consistently assess stakeholder salience. Therefore, we limited our data set to only those companies with stand-alone or downloadable reports for greater consistency in our evaluation and presentation of data. Of the <italic>Fortune</italic> Global 100 sample, 59 companies had separate, downloadable social responsibility or sustainability reports at the time of our data collection—fall 2008.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0007650309353061">1</xref></sup> The nationality and industry membership attributed to each firm in our sample is shown in the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0007650309353061">appendix</xref>.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p>As we began our data exploration, we discovered that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0007650309353061">Mitchell et al.’s (1997)</xref> definitions of the salience dimensions were rather qualitative and thus lacking for our empirical exploration. Therefore, we analyzed the qualitative descriptions for each of the stakeholder salience dimensions provided by Mitchell et al. in an effort to develop usable measures when analyzing secondary material, such as corporate social responsibility or sustainability reports.</p>
<sec id="section10-0007650309353061">
<title>Power</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0007650309353061">Mitchell et al. (1997)</xref>, power was presented in three forms: coercive (defined as a tool to inflict punishment, able to force control), utilitarian (seen in the materials, goods and services, or rewards of the stakeholder), and normative (understood as symbolic or in the forms of the stakeholder’s prestige or esteem). The corporate reports in our data set did not emphasize the coercive nature of a stakeholder, thus we turned to the measures of utilitarian power and normative power for our analysis. The reports indicated stakeholder power in terms of their prestige or esteem (normative power), and in the goods and services offered by the stakeholder to the firm (utilitarian power).</p>
<p>Using indicators from the field of journalism, where the “top story” was afforded power or importance by receiving a larger headline font and more inches of coverage, we assessed stakeholder’s power in the reports in terms of (a) which stakeholder was mentioned first (power primacy), (b) which stakeholders were explicitly discussed in the report (utilitarian power), and (c) what percentage of the pages in the report was dedicated for discussing the company–stakeholder relationship (normative power). While these specific criteria may appear to be subjective, the original measurement of stakeholder power seemed even more subjective to us as it was presented as self-reported perceptions by CEOs (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0007650309353061">Agle et al., 1999</xref>). Our expansion of this salience dimension and introduction of new quantitative measures added greater comparability across the reports in our data set. As discussed later, a pretest exploration was undertaken to assess the interrater reliability of our assessments due to the relatively subjective nature of this and other measures in this study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0007650309353061">
<title>Legitimacy</title>
<p>The second measure of stakeholder salience is the legitimacy of the stakeholder. Legitimacy is defined in terms of how socially desirable, proper, or appropriate the stakeholder appears to be within some socially constructed system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0007650309353061">Mitchell et al., 1997</xref>). We looked at stakeholder legitimacy in terms of its recognition as one of the critical stakeholders in the vision of the corporation’s social responsibility network or socially constructed system. Many companies utilized a stakeholder map or list of stakeholders to frame their responsibilities or relationships in their business operations. If a stakeholder was placed on the map or in the list, then the company was assessed as assigning legitimacy—desirability, properness, or appropriateness—to this stakeholder. In addition, if there was any indication that the stakeholder relationship added value to the company, a norm or value within the socially constructed system, then legitimacy was attributed to the stakeholder.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0007650309353061">
<title>Urgency</title>
<p>Urgency is the third measure of stakeholder salience. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0007650309353061">Mitchell et al. (1997)</xref> presented this notion as “calling for immediate attention or pressing” (p. 867), and this was often seen in terms of the stakeholder’s time sensitivity to the company or the stakeholder’s degree of criticality to the company. A stakeholder’s urgency was discovered in the corporate social responsibility or sustainability reports when a time-bound priority was assigned to dealing with the company–stakeholder relationship. If a company used the global reporting initiative (GRI) as a measure of its social responsibility or citizenship, then the company often developed a timetable for achieving specific outcomes when seeking to improve the stakeholder relationship. In addition, a company may have emphasized the changing business climate as an indicator of the need for immediate attention (urgency) in addressing the stakeholder relationship. Any of these indicators demonstrated the urgency of a stakeholder for the company.</p>
<p>From these definitions and descriptors of power, legitimacy, and urgency, we coded the information contained in each company’s sustainability or corporate social responsibility report for each stakeholder, represented as either a “0” or “1,” per the instructions found in many content analysis guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0007650309353061">2</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0007650309353061">
<title>Stakeholders</title>
<p>These three measures of stakeholder salience were assessed across a variety of potential stakeholders drawn from current academic thought: stockholders/investors, employees, customers, suppliers, and wholesalers and retailers (or business partners), comprising the “market-based” stakeholders. In addition, “nonmarket-based” stakeholders were considered, such as community, government, NGOs, and media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0007650309353061">Lawrence &amp; Weber, 2008</xref>). Whether the natural environment is a stakeholder has been actively debated among academic scholars (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0007650309353061">Driscoll &amp; Starik, 2004</xref>). Given the emergence of the natural environment’s importance and the focus of the corporate sustainability reports, it is necessary to include the natural environment in our list of potential stakeholders to assess salience.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0007650309353061">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Content analysis as a qualitative measure has been used extensively in corporate social and environmental responsibility research (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0007650309353061">Gray et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0007650309353061">Maignan &amp; Ralston, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0007650309353061">Nieminen &amp; Niskanen, 2001</xref>). Following generally accepted content analysis practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0007650309353061">Neuendorf, 2002</xref>), two examiners analyzed the information contained in the sustainability or corporate social responsibility reports using the framework described above for defining and identifying the power, legitimacy, and urgency for each stakeholder. Both coders were familiar with the content analysis procedures from prior research explorations as well as knowledgeable in stakeholder management theory and the stakeholder salience model.</p>
<p>Initially, five reports were randomly selected (ING Group, Assicurazioni Generali, Royal Bank of Scotland, Proctor &amp; Gamble, and Fiat) and assessed independently by the two examiners. There was an 82% agreement across the researchers’ independent results. A Cohen’s kappa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0007650309353061">Cohen, 1960</xref>) was calculated, generally thought to be a more robust measure than a simple percentage agreement calculation, as the Cohen’s kappa measure (<italic>k</italic>) takes into account the agreement occurring by chance. When this measure was used, a <italic>k</italic> of 64% was found. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0007650309353061">Landis and Koch (1977)</xref>, 64% agreement among two examiners is equivalent to “full agreement.” Nonetheless, further discussion ensued among the researchers to better coordinate and equate the criteria used for analyzing the corporate reports until perfect agreement—more than 90%—was reached, and the framework for assessing the remainder of the company reports in the data set by both examiners was adjusted based on this discussion.</p>

<sec id="section15-0007650309353061" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>To test our hypotheses, we used Fisher’s exact test for comparing proportions. The Fisher’s exact test is based on the hypergeometric distribution to compare two proportions under the null hypothesis that states there is no difference between the two proportions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0007650309353061">Huck, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0007650309353061">Lehmann, 1986</xref>). This test is considered superior to the chi-square test when sample sizes are small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0007650309353061">Bower, 2003</xref>). Because our hypotheses proposed that one of the two proportions is greater than the other, we used the Fisher exact one-sided test statistic.</p>
<p>The Fisher exact test probabilities for our analysis are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0007650309353061">Table 1</xref>. Only Hypothesis 4 was supported by our analysis of the data and will be discussed here. None of the hypothetical relationships posed in Hypotheses 1, 2, 3, or 5 were found to demonstrate statically significant differences between the groups posed.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>In Hypotheses 4a, 4b, and 4c, we compared firms competing in the consumer industry with firms from other industries. There were 30 firms in the consumer industry (50.8%) and 29 firms in our other industry category (49.2%). In Hypothesis 4a, we considered stakeholder salience power toward consumers. In our consumer industry group, there were 17 out of 30 firms (57%) exhibiting this characteristic compared with 8 out of 29 firms (28%) in the other industry group. Using Fisher’s exact test statistic, we found that the proportions were significantly different between these two groups (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05); therefore, Hypothesis 4a is supported.</p>
<p>Next, we examined stakeholder salience legitimacy. In our consumer industry group, there were 22 out of 30 firms (73.3%) compared with 12 out of 29 (41.4%) in our other industry group exhibiting legitimacy for the consumer stakeholder. The proportion of firms exhibiting this characteristic was significantly greater in our consumer industry group (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05); therefore, Hypothesis 4b is supported. In Hypothesis 4c, we addressed the same two groups regarding stakeholder salience urgency. There were 14 out of 30 (46.6%) firms in our consumer group that exhibited this characteristic compared with 4 out of 29 firms (13.7%) in our other industry group. Because the proportion of firms in our consumer industry group addressing this characteristic was significantly greater (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), Hypothesis 4c is supported.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This research was undertaken to apply stakeholder salience as an analytical tool to better understand the descriptive power of corporate social responsibility and sustainability reports in the context of the business–stakeholder web of relationships and to discover if organizational factors, such as national or industry differences, explained variances across these reports. A number of important advances emerged from this exploration. Most notable was the emergence of the natural environment as a “definitive” organizational stakeholder, possessing all three salience dimensions: power, legitimacy, and urgency. This discovery reflects the growing rhetoric found in conversations among business executives and increasing governmental sustainability efforts, particularly in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>The European Union’s Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) encourages voluntary disclosure of corporate environmental efforts through an annual environmental statement or report, indicating corporate responsiveness to external governmental pressure. Similar conditions are emerging in Asia where the Japanese government, for example, recommends companies provide environmental accounting and indicators on a regular basis in their company social reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0007650309353061">Kolk, 2003</xref>). Given these external pressures, it comes as little surprise that the natural environment was a stakeholder with significant salience—power, legitimacy, and urgency. Therefore, the stakeholder salience tool may be useful in identifying emerging stakeholders, those growing in importance in the web of business–stakeholder relationships.</p>
<p>In addition to identifying emerging stakeholders, salience may be a useful tool in detecting those traditional stakeholders with continuing importance to business organizations. Our results were generally in line with previous investigations of stakeholder salience, for example, by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0007650309353061">Jose and Lee (2007)</xref>, where the major stakeholders—employees, consumers, and the community—were perceived as having high stakeholder salience (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0007650309353061">Table 2</xref>). These three stakeholders appear to have strong salience and are considered core organizational stakeholders for most businesses.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0007650309353061">Table 2</xref> also illuminated two key differences between our study’s results and the results reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0007650309353061">Jose and Lee (2007)</xref>. They reported significant salience for suppliers as an organizational stakeholder, yet this stakeholder was virtually ignored in the corporate sustainability or social responsibility reports investigated in our study. In addition, Jose and Lee marginally noticed the natural environment as a salient stakeholder, but it emerged as an overwhelming salient stakeholder in our research. Based on our results, stakeholder salience appears to be a rich investigatory tool in identifying emerging stakeholders, confirming traditional or stable stakeholders, and uncovering changes in stakeholder salience. These discoveries should afford executives greater insight into how to manage and allocate resources in the business–stakeholder web of relationships.</p>
<p>This research also explored the descriptive power of the corporate social responsibility or sustainability report as a critical communication tool for business organizations. Our research uncovered that the use of these reports is definitively a common business practice among the largest companies in the world. Fifty-nine of the <italic>Fortune</italic> Global 100 companies had separate, downloadable social reports, with another 33 companies choosing to develop a report through multiple Web pages on their company Web site.</p>
<p>Our investigation also indicated that social reports were a viable descriptive way for businesses to communicate the salience attributed to various stakeholders. Members of these stakeholder groups should be interested in whether their group is seen as powerful, legitimate, or urgent in its relationship with the company, or more importantly, if the company does not see their stakeholder group as possessing salience. Thus, it is essential for companies to ensure that the desired information is communicated through their corporate report, a testament to the powerful impact of this descriptive tool.</p>
<p>Moreover, this research found widespread variation among the corporate reports, indicating that not all reports are universally the same. Companies did not treat all stakeholders alike or even include the same stakeholders in their reports. The implications of the inclusion or exclusion of various stakeholders in these reports should be explored. Further investigations should target the existence and strength of the “reporting-action” link (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0007650309353061">Vurro &amp; Perrini, 2009</xref>). Are these reports merely window-dressing and public relations rhetoric? If so, then there is little connection between reporting on organizational stakeholders and the company addressing their demands. Alternatively, do these reports manifest an integration of stakeholder’s concerns into corporate policies and practices? If this is the case, then this may be a demonstration of a firm’s willingness to be attentive to its many stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0007650309353061">Kolk, 2004b</xref>).</p>
<p>There also are important lessons to be learned from the specific results found when analyzing the data in our sample. Although previous explorations looking at the presence of stakeholders in corporate social responsibility and sustainability reports indicated that there were regional differences regarding which stakeholder received greater attention by the firms in their reports (notably <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0007650309353061">Jose &amp; Lee, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0007650309353061">Kolk, 2005</xref>), our results did not support these predictions. All of our hypotheses investigating regional or country differences were not statistically supported (Hypotheses 1a, 1b, and 1c; Hypotheses 2a, 2b, and 2c; and Hypotheses 3a, 3b, and 3c). These results (or lack of significant differences) may be due to the truly global nature of business as practiced by the largest business organizations in the world. Attention to specific stakeholders, such as the community by United States’ firms or employees by companies headquartered in the European Union, are no longer specific to those regions, as all businesses around the world attend to these core stakeholders. The emergence of sustainability as a stakeholder with high salience also seems to transcend regional differences when assessing the power, legitimacy, and urgency of the business stakeholders.</p>
<p>However, differences were found when exploring the attention paid to the consumer stakeholder by businesses with high consumer exposure. A significantly greater percentage of firms with high consumer exposure attributed a greater degree of stakeholder salience—power, legitimacy, and urgency—to the consumer stakeholder group than the other firms in our sample, as illustrated in the statistically significant support for Hypotheses 4a, 4b, and 4c. This finding may point to the importance of industry-focused research, as opposed to regionally or domestic-focused research. Industry-specific analysis appears to be a promising level of analysis for research exploring trends in corporate social responsibility and sustainability when investigating the beer industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0007650309353061">Griffin &amp; Weber, 2006</xref>), steel industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0007650309353061">Schuler, 1996</xref>), or examining cross-industry trends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0007650309353061">Griffin &amp; Mahon, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0007650309353061">Waddock &amp; Graves, 1997</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0007650309353061">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>There are some limitations in this research that should be recognized and discussed. First, we utilized <italic>Fortune</italic> Global 100 companies in our sample. These companies are likely to have characteristics and resources that render them unlike the majority of all business organizations. These firms, due to their size, are more likely to be in the public’s eye or the media spotlight and thus may be more attentive to how they communicate the importance of key stakeholders. Therefore, a form of social desirability may be evident in their social reports. Subsequent research should utilize a more stratified sampling of business organizations, explicitly including midsized businesses, small businesses, or NGOs, to see if their understanding of stakeholder salience is similar to what was reported here.</p>
<p>Second, the qualitative measurement used to assess stakeholder salience should be refined and further tested. While salience appears to be a strong theoretical concept, operationalizing power, legitimacy, and urgency was challenging in this research given the lack of development in the original model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0007650309353061">Mitchell et al., 1997</xref>). We encourage scholars to continue to refine this construct to improve its validity.</p>
<p>Third, we drew on information found in corporate social responsibility or sustainability reports. Admittedly, this type of report is only one form of corporate communication, and other vehicles may lead to different results in understanding the salience for business stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0007650309353061">Quaak, Aalbers, &amp; Goedee, 2007</xref>). We also acknowledged that some companies did not have separate, downloadable social reports, preferring the option of developing Web pages on their company’s Web site. Subsequent research should compare our results with those found when looking only at social reports found in the company’s Web site.</p>
<p>Finally, a growing number of the <italic>Fortune</italic> Global 100 firms utilized the GRI as their framework for presenting their activities involving various stakeholders. The GRI framework likely influenced the firm’s selection of the stakeholders included in their corporate sustainability or social reports, which biased our data collection and results. Future research should compare GRI versus non-GRI compliant firms in the analysis of stakeholder salience.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0007650309353061">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>Both business practitioners and academic scholars may benefit from the results reported here. Managing the dynamic and complex web of business–stakeholder relationships is a demanding task for executives. By providing an illustration of how to assess stakeholder salience, business practitioners should be better able to understand and address those stakeholders that influence and are influenced by the company’s policies, programs, and practices. For example, if a company does not yet acknowledge the natural environment as an important stakeholder, our results might encourage a company to explore and better understand the power, legitimacy, and urgency that this stakeholder represents.</p>
<p>Academic scholars, likewise, should further investigate the valuable tool of stakeholder salience when developing cases for educational purposes as well as crafting new research projects that explore the dynamic and complex web of business–stakeholder relationships. Seeing a business stakeholder only in terms of legitimacy, for example, would be incomplete and vulnerable to the unexpected impacts emanating from the additional salience dimensions of power or urgency embedded in the business–stakeholder relationship. Given the relatively few investigations using stakeholder salience, the potential for further exploration seems limitless.</p>
<p>It appears that corporate social or sustainable reporting is not a short-term fad. Moreover, the importance of understanding and managing the dynamic and complex web of business–stakeholder relationships is more critical now for business executives and academic scholars than ever before. Therefore, stakeholder salience may be a critical instrument in the business practitioner and academic scholar’s toolbox as we continue to investigate the web of business–stakeholder relationships through the emerging communications medium of corporate social reporting.</p>

<p>Of the remaining 41 Global 100 firms, all but 8 had social responsibility or sustainability reports. But the format for these 33 reports made it impossible for us to be consistent in our evaluation of this material and assessment of stakeholder salience. Thus these reports were excluded from our sample. Nonetheless, our sample contained a majority of the Global 100 firms and their reports.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn2-0007650309353061">
<label>2.</label>
<p>Dichotomous variables were used since a more detailed continuous rating of these dimensions was not possible given the exploratory nature of this research and lack of development of the salience dimensions in the original work. The use of a dichotomous variable is acceptable and often preferred given our research situation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0007650309353061">Carney, 1972</xref>, pp. 222-224; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0007650309353061">Stemler, 2001</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0007650309353061">U.S. General Accounting Office, 1996</xref>, p. 20).</p>
