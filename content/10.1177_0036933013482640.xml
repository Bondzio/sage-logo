<title>Background and aims</title>
<p>The abuse of illicit substances is very common amongst forensic psychiatry populations and is known to be one of the most potent risk factors for interpersonal violence. Forensic psychiatry units hence strive to keep themselves as free as possible from illicit substances and in Scotland drugs of abuse have traditionally been screened for by means of urine testing. The aim of this study is to examine patients’ preferences for drug testing methods and to compare the acceptability of urine testing versus oral fluid testing (OFT) within a secure hospital setting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-0036933013482640">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Patients in three continuing care wards at the State Hospital, Carstairs were offered the choice of either urine or oral fluid testing. We developed protocols and recording forms and trained staff in the administration of the OFT. We recorded the sampling time for OFT and urine, and the views of patients and staff on the testing procedures over a six month period.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-0036933013482640">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Sixty-two samples were taken, with 53 (85%) opting for OFT and nine (15%) opting for urine sampling. The average time taken for OFT was 13 minutes, while the average time taken for urine sampling was 33 minutes. The majority of patients and staff rated oral fluid and urine testing as comfortable and easy. Patients recorded comments on 46 (87%) of OFT samples, only two of which were negative. In general they preferred the OFT because it was quicker and easier and they commented on it being more dignified and private. Patients recorded comments on five (55%) of urine samples, with one of the primary reasons for opting for urine sampling appearing to be a reluctance to try new things, though a few said they did not want to have anything in their mouths. Staff returned comments on 24 (45%) of OFT samples and one (11%) of urine samples. Comments on the OFT were overwhelmingly positive and pointed out the relative speed and ease of this sampling method.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-0036933013482640">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We concluded that the pilot study was successful. OFT was found to be generally preferred by patients and staff. Although there was an additional financial cost, this was considered to be outweighed by the significant benefits arising from offering patients choice, the preservation of patient dignity and staff time savings. The option of OFT has now been extended to all patients within the State Hospital. Practitioners will wish to consider the value of OFT in forensic psychiatry inpatient settings given the benefits identified within this study.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0036933013482640" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The abuse of illicit substances is extremely common amongst forensic psychiatry populations and is recognised as one of the most potent risk factors for interpersonal violence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0036933013482640">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0036933013482640">2</xref></sup> Substance misuse in mentally disordered individuals is also associated with increased risk of relapse of psychosis, increased frequency of hospitalisation, poorer compliance with treatment and impairment of the integrity of therapeutic regimes in hospitals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0036933013482640">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0036933013482640">4</xref></sup> In recent years research has emerged revealing the significant and increasing prevalence of alcohol and drug misuse histories in patients in secure hospital settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0036933013482640">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0036933013482640"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0036933013482640">7</xref></sup> In the State Hospital, Carstairs (the special security psychiatric hospital for Scotland and Northern Ireland), a study of patients in 1992–1993 revealed that 21% were intoxicated at the time of the index offence or behaviour leading to admission, 48% had a history of alcohol misuse, 47% had used illicit substances, and 55% had a substance dependence diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0036933013482640">8</xref></sup> In 2000 and 2001, of 86 male patients admitted to the State Hospital, 81% had misused alcohol and 75% had misused drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0036933013482640">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Substance misuse is directly relevant to the treatment of mental disorder and the assessment and management of further violence. Substance misuse needs to be addressed in secure hospitals, both in terms of the management of patients whilst in hospital and the minimisation and prevention of substance misuse after discharge. It is important that secure hospitals are as drug-free as possible, to enable the uncontaminated assessment and treatment of mentally disordered offenders. Strenuous efforts are made to prevent patients accessing illicit substances and in the main these efforts are successful. Over a three year period of testing at the State Hospital between 1999 and 2001, only 40 out of 7069 samples (0.6%) were true positives, with 13 of these stemming from drug use prior to admission. The extremely low levels of substance use within hospital are in contrast with findings from UK prisons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0036933013482640">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Successful prevention of substance misuse reduces the negative impact it has on the integrity of therapeutic regimes, patient–staff relationships, ward atmosphere, compliance with prescribed medication and frequency and severity of violent incidents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0036933013482640">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0036933013482640">12</xref></sup> As such routine voluntary urine testing for drugs of abuse has been part of practice at the State Hospital and similar institutions for many years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0036933013482640">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0036933013482640">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Previously at the State Hospital, non-prescribed substances have been screened for solely by means of urine testing. Whilst generally reliable, this method has a number of limitations, for example, the patients’ inability to provide a sample, substitution or tampering with samples (e.g. by dilution or adulteration with chemicals such as bleach, vinegar, liquid soap etc. to produce false negative results) and gender issues relating to supervision of male patients by female nursing staff (and vice versa).</p>
<p>The oral fluid test (OFT) represents an alternative method of drug testing which potentially addresses a number of the limitations of urine testing. The OFT employs a special mouth swab which collects salivary fluid from the oral cavity with the resulting sample being analysed for the presence of specified illicit drugs. The collection of oral fluid can be observed and is generally considered less invasive than collecting either blood or urine. The detection times for drugs of abuse in oral fluid approximate those of blood, and oral fluid usually contains parent drug rather than the drug metabolites that are generally detected in urine. Therefore, oral fluid drug concentrations are better indicators of recent use and of more interpretative value than urinary drug concentrations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0036933013482640">14</xref></sup> An outline of the advantages and disadvantages of using oral fluid to detect drugs of abuse is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0036933013482640">Figure 1</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0036933013482640">15</xref></sup> This method is already used widely within industry and certain clinical and forensic settings and has been used in Scottish community addictions services for a number of years.

<p>The OFT is legally robust and able to withstand judicial scrutiny.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0036933013482640">16</xref></sup> It is accepted by the Scottish Government Health Department and is used in Drug Testing and Treatment Orders (DTTO’s) imposed by Scottish Courts, but thus far has not been used within inpatient forensic psychiatry units in Scotland. The aim of this study was to examine patients’ preferences for drug testing methods and to compare the acceptability of urine testing versus OFT in a high secure forensic psychiatric facility.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0036933013482640" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title>
<p>During the six month study, patients requiring drug testing on three wards were offered the choice of either urine or oral fluid testing. The wards each had 24 adult male continuing care patients with a range of psychiatric morbidity compatible with high secure forensic care, the majority of patients being diagnosed with schizophrenia. None of the wards specialised in personality disorder treatment although patients with co-morbid personality disorder were accommodated in all three wards. The wards were chosen to represent the majority of the hospitals population which at the time was largely male continuing care (as opposed to smaller populations of male admission, rehabilitation and learning disability patients). They already used urine drug testing on a random and regular (variable frequency) basis and the standard urinary drugs of abuse screen includes amphetamines, benzodiazepines, methadone, opiates, cannabinoids and cocaine. A patient information leaflet was developed and given to all patients within these wards. In addition, patients were given the chance to speak to members of staff regarding the testing process. Staff on the pilot wards were consulted widely and appropriate training was implemented in conjunction with Altrix Healthcare (the OFT suppliers), with lead persons identified on each of the wards. Staff were trained in the administration of the OFT and a protocol and flowchart was developed to guide them on a day to day basis.</p>
<p>We used the Intercept OFT Collection device and during sample collection, staff ensured patients refrained from eating, drinking, smoking or chewing for 10 minutes prior to sample collection, as recommended by Altrix Healthcare. The following drugs were routinely tested for: amphetamines, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids and opiates. These are known to be the four drug classes usually abused within the State Hospital.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0036933013482640">10</xref></sup> A range of other drugs (including methadone, cocaine, methamphetamines, barbiturates, phencyclidine and buprenorphine) can be tested for using the OFT but this would generally only be necessary in this setting if there was suspicion of circulation or use of a particular drug type. A recording form was administered by nursing staff at the time of sampling to gain information on patients choice of testing method (urine or OFT), their reasons for choosing either, time taken from first approach by staff, and staff/patient views of the sampling procedure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0036933013482640" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>During the six month pilot 62 drug tests were carried out on the three wards. Of these 53 (85%) opted for OFT and nine (15%) for urine sampling. The OFT samples came from 26 individual patients. One positive sample was recorded.</p>
<p>The time taken for OFT samples (as recorded by nursing staff at the time of sampling) ranged from five minutes to 30 minutes and averaged 13 minutes. The time taken for urine samples ranged from five minutes to 60 minutes and averaged 33 minutes. Patients and staff were asked to rate both urine and OFT on a 4-point Likert scale based on ease of providing samples and psychological/physical comfort in doing so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0036933013482640">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0036933013482640">3</xref>).

<p>Patients recorded comments on 46 (87%) of 53 OFT samples taken. Of the 46 comments only two were negative, one commenting it took longer and another that they disliked the salty taste. In general, patients noted that they preferred the OFT because it was quicker and easier. They commented on it being more dignified and private. OFT was preferred because it also meant the staff were not having to ask them repeatedly for samples. Some patients commented on the salty taste of OFT, but as mentioned above only one stated it as a reason for disliking oral fluid sampling.</p>
<p>Among the nine patients that chose urine tests all recorded reasons for opting for urine and five (55%) recorded comments. It is difficult to comment on the trend of comments due to small numbers but one of the primary reasons for opting for urine sampling appeared to be a reluctance to try new things, though a few said they did not want to have anything in their mouths.</p>
<p>Staff returned comments on 24 (45%) out of 53 OFT samples and one (11%) of nine urine samples. For OFT the comments were overwhelmingly positive (23 out of 24) noted that the procedure was quicker and easier to carry out than urine sampling and no concerns were noted. One member of staff noted that the patient appeared uneasy after the test. For the urine sampling one comment noted that the urine sampling took too long.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0036933013482640" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>This pilot study has found that OFT was well received and generally preferred by patients and staff as compared with traditional urine testing. Available evidence suggests that the majority, if not all, drugs of abuse testing in secure hospital settings is carried out by way of urinalysis. This is certainly the case in Scotland where the authors have broad experience of practicing in hospital settings, and discussion with colleagues in other parts of the country supports the situation being similar across the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>There are many factors to consider in relation to costs and benefits of OFT compared to urinalysis, which include patient choice, dignity, gender issues (both for those giving and taking the specimens), possible adulteration of samples and financial considerations (OFT costs more than urinalysis). Adulteration of samples can happen for a variety of reasons: the patient trying to avoid detection; staff not observing the process or procedures with proper diligence; or general inefficient practices. It has been suggested that the adulteration of urine specimens could be unacceptably high. George and Braithwaite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0036933013482640">17</xref></sup> estimated that 20% of specimens submitted were outside physiological urinary pH and that 84% of specimens submitted would need retesting if the dilution cut-off for urine creatinine concentration recognised by the National Institute of Drug abuse (1.8 mmol/L) was applied. In reality, it appears that very little is done beyond observing colour and temperature of the urine specimen to ensure its authenticity in many hospital settings.</p>
<p>In this study, we considered it a strength that staff on the pilot wards were consulted widely and appropriate training was implemented in conjunction with Altrix Healthcare, with lead persons identified on each of the wards. Importantly, we did not identify any issues in relation to consistency of administration or sample adulteration.</p>
<p>OFT was identified as an alternative to urinalysis both to offer patients greater choice and for the benefits highlighted above. Initiating a new practice in an established institution presented us with challenges including persuading staff of its efficacy and reliability and persuading the hospital management team that the benefits of the introduction of OFT would justify the increase in cost to the organisation. The cost of the standard laboratory urinalysis per sample was £10.50 compared to the cost of the OFT which was £15.54. Whilst this does appear to be a large increase we noted considerable time savings related to the OFT which allowed staff increased time for direct patient care as well as the other benefits detailed.</p>
<p>Overall there were immediate benefits in terms of patient’s choice and dignity, with the majority of patients tested during the pilot choosing OFT over urinalysis. From a staff perspective they found OFT to have many benefits and generally they were supportive of the use of OFT. Difficulties encountered mainly related to human error (forms not filled in properly and/or incorrect use of the bar code system, on two samples only, with results excluded from the analysis). There was only one positive sample and some problems with reporting led to difficulties in confirmation and action in relation to this. This has led to refinement of procedures to obviate repetition of these difficulties.</p>
<p>We found the pilot study to be successful – the OFT proved popular with patients and staff as an alternative to urine testing. Benefits were noted particularly in respect of time saved and preservation of patient dignity. We concluded that there is a role for OFT within the State Hospital and recommended that all patients be offered the choice of <italic>either</italic> urine or OFT as part of their routine drug testing. As a result of this recommendation, the option of OFT has been supported by hospital management and extended to all patients within the State Hospital. Future examination of the results of the wider implementation of this approach will allow greater understanding of its strengths and weaknesses as well as addressing the limitations of this pilot study. In the meantime though, practitioners in other forensic psychiatry units may wish to consider the value of OFT given the benefits identified within this study.</p>
