Previous research, however, has shown that a significant minority of TV weathercasters disagree with the consensus science. Using multivariate analyses, this article identifies political ideology (conservative) and gender (male), but not age or science training, as predictors for being unconvinced that global warming is occurring; only ideology (conservative) predicts being unconvinced of anthropogenic causes of global warming. Ideology is also the strongest predictor, and gender is a secondary predictor, of trust in sources of climate change information: Conservative weathercasters expressed less trust in all seven science-based sources that were examined. These findings suggest that efforts to improve the quality of climate change reporting among these high-profile specialists must address political and personal ideology in addition to increased science training.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>TV weathercasters</kwd><kwd>climate change</kwd><kwd>skepticism</kwd><kwd>political ideology</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="section1-1931243112469610"><title>Introduction</title><p>As winter 2010–2011 officially arrived, “Snowmageddon 2” was in its genesis stages on the West Coast of the United States bringing torrential rains, mudslides, and flooding to California. As it barreled across the country, snow fell deep in the South bringing a white Christmas to Atlanta for the first time since 1881. As this low pressure moved up along the Atlantic seaboard, it developed into a blizzard that dumped up to 3 ft. of snow in places and paralyzed transportation across the country during one of the busiest travel weeks of the year. This storm was followed by a rare tornado outbreak in the center of the country on New Years Eve, which killed eight people. Weather led the news headlines all week as stranded travelers tried to get home, expensive cleanups began and more storms were forecast.</p><p>Not surprisingly, television weathercasters played prominent roles in communicating forecasts that allowed millions of people, businesses, governments, and organizations to prepare—saving untold money and lives. While weathercasters are now regularly credited with saving lives in severe weather (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1931243112469610">Henson, 2010</xref>), many are also expanding their reach beyond the forecast and increasingly being called on as expert sources on other topics.</p><p>As often the only person in a TV newsroom trained in science, they’ve become the go to person on a variety of related topics beyond the weather forecast, including climate change. Nearly all embrace this expanding role of “station scientist” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1931243112469610">Wilson, 2008</xref>), an initiative fostered by The American Meteorological Society (AMS), which credentials more than 1,000 TV meteorologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1931243112469610">American Meteorological Society [AMS], 2012</xref>). But longitudinal research has identified a substantial minority of weathercasters who hold views about climate change that differ from the widely accepted views held by climate scientists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1931243112469610">Wilson, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1931243112469610">2009</xref>). Given the prominence of these high-profile science communicators, these inaccuracies about climate change could have serious repercussions for effective communication of that science.</p><p>This study is the largest and most representative survey of television weathercasters conducted to date. By asking questions from previous surveys, it confirms findings from earlier research and also advances those studies with new questions and analyses to further investigate the important role of TV weathercasters as informal climate change educators. This article answers several important research questions: Who do TV weathercasters most trust as sources of climate information? What factors affect those trust levels? Why do many TV weathercasters hold views about climate change that differ from the widely held views among climate scientists? What variables predict that skepticism? Answering these questions allows for recommendations and strategies to overcome these obstacles and enhance the efficacy of climate chance communications to large mediated audiences.</p></sec><sec id="section2-1931243112469610"><title>Background and Literature Review</title><p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the world’s leading authority on climate issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1931243112469610">Oreskes &amp; Conway, 2010</xref>) and has issued four assessment reports, each with more and more certain language and using the term <italic>unequivocal</italic> in its latest 2007 report to describe the warming of Earth and a discernable human fingerprint in that warming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1931243112469610">Pachauri &amp; Reisinger, 2007</xref>). In a previous survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1931243112469610">Wilson, 2009</xref>), 80% of TV weathercasters said they should be knowledgeable about the findings of the IPCC (only 7% disagreed), but follow-up questions showed sharp disagreement with IPCC conclusions that Earth is warming (45% agreed) and that the warming is human induced (24% agreed). The debate on the authenticity of global warming and the role played by human activity is largely nonexistent among scientists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1931243112469610">Anderegg, Prall, Harold, &amp; Schneider, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1931243112469610">Doran &amp; Zimmerman, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Most Americans don’t learn about climate change directly from scientists or scholarly research, but rather from the media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1931243112469610">Leiserowitz, Maibach, &amp; Roser-Renouf, 2010a</xref>). Even with dramatic changes in the media landscape, Americans are spending more time following the news today than at any point since the mid-1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1931243112469610">Pew Research Center, 2010</xref>), and local television news is still the preferred primary medium for that news and information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1931243112469610">Pew Research Center, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1931243112469610">Potter, Matsa, &amp; Mitchell, 2011</xref>). At the same time, there are very few science and environment reporters employed in American media, especially in local TV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1931243112469610">Sachsman, Simon, &amp; Valenti, 2008</xref>) and TV weathercasters are often the only person in a newsroom with any science training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1931243112469610">Wilson, 2008</xref>). TV consultants and news managers know that the weather segment is the most important part of the TV newscast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1931243112469610">Silcock, Heider, &amp; Rogus, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1931243112469610">Smith, 2007</xref>), and members of the public consider TV weather reporters to be a trusted source of information about global warming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1931243112469610">Leiserowitz, Maibach &amp; Roser-Renouf, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1931243112469610">2010a</xref>). More American adults trust television weather reporters (56%) than they trust the mainstream news media (36%), religious leaders (45%), or various political leaders; only scientists (74%) are a more trusted source of global warming information than TV weather reporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1931243112469610">Leiserowitz et al., 2010a</xref>).</p><p>Previous research has identified a pattern of skepticism among this prominent group of specialists that is also tested and expanded in this study. For example, nearly a third (29%) of AMS weathercasters in a smaller survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1931243112469610">Wilson, 2009</xref>) agreed with the provocative assertion made by a prominent TV weathercaster that “global warming is a scam”; a number that is corroborated in this new larger survey (26%). The genesis of that question came from a blog post by a San Diego TV weatherman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1931243112469610">Coleman, 2007</xref>), who as one of the founders of The Weather Channel (TWC) had his “global warming is the greatest scam in history” comments prominently covered by various media outlets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1931243112469610">Dawson, 2008</xref>). An earlier study found that weathercasters’ global warming attitudes and beliefs were more strongly predictive of their accurate knowledge of the science than were traditional demographic variables such as market size, or the weathercaster’s education, length of experience, seniority, or professional seals of approval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1931243112469610">Wilson, 2002</xref>). Despite the weight of scientific evidence, climate change is increasingly becoming a more partisan issue. This wasn’t always the case. Both of the 1988’s major party presidential candidates spoke out in favor of action on global warming, with George H. W. Bush promising to do “something about it” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1931243112469610">Henson, 2010</xref>). Just 4 years ago, in the 2008 presidential election, Republican John McCain said, “we stand warned by serious and credible scientists across the world. Time is short and the dangers are great” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1931243112469610">Peach, 2011</xref>). With Republicans taking control of the House in 2010, “many of them are no longer content to ignore the science, they have decided to go after the scientists” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1931243112469610">Kolbert, 2010</xref>). One of the leading Republican candidates for president in 2012, Mitt Romney, went from saying, “I believe the world is getting warmer and humans contribute to that” in June, 2011 to “we don’t know what’s causing climate change” 4 months later as the impact of the Tea Party grew in the Republican party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1931243112469610">Peach, 2011</xref>). Democrats’ and liberals’ belief in climate change as real and human caused has risen steadily throughout the past decade, while Republicans’ beliefs have declined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1931243112469610">Dunlap &amp; McCright, 2008</xref>), leading to significant ideological and partisan polarization of the topic over the past decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1931243112469610">McCright &amp; Dunlap, 2011</xref>). This politicization of science goes beyond just climate change. In a study tracking public trust in science from 1974 to 2010, researchers found that although conservatives began the period with the highest trust in science, they ended that time period with the lowest trust, adding that this pattern was unique when compared to other institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1931243112469610">Gauchat, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Ideology is also increasingly associated with people’s choice of certain news sources. Today conservatives enjoy keeping up with news more than any other ideological group and 80% who regularly listen to Rush Limbaugh or watch Sean Hannity identify as conservative, roughly twice the national average of 36% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1931243112469610">Pew Research Center, 2010</xref>). This increasing partisanship in audiences is reflected in other data: 40% of Republicans regularly watch Fox News (up from 18% a decade ago) and only 12% regularly watch CNN; as recently as 2002 Republicans were as likely to watch CNN (28%) as Fox News (25%). Impacts on news coverage of climate change have also been noted. Fox News editors have written guidelines to staff to “immediately point out that climate change is just a theory . . . and it’s not our place to assert such notions as facts, especially as the debate intensifies” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1931243112469610">Hagey, 2010</xref>).</p><p>What hasn’t been tested before is whether these partisan attitudes also affect the understanding of climate science among TV weathercasters, more than half of whom have college degrees in science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1931243112469610">Wilson, 2008</xref>). A volatile combination of politics and science has occurred over time with this particular group of science communication specialists. In 1997, then Vice President Al Gore invited 100 TV weathercasters to a climate summit at the White House. To some, the fact that a politician was seeking to educate science-trained meteorologists about climate change was offensive and to others who weren’t invited it was perceived as professional snub (Henson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1931243112469610">2010</xref>). While Gore’s efforts may have backfired and inflamed the rhetoric, he was one of the first to recognize the potential role these prominent science communicators could play in the education process, even if their ideology was not considered one of the initial influences on their understanding of climate change.</p><p>Media coverage constitutes a key influence in shaping public climate change information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1931243112469610">Boykoff &amp; Boykoff, 2007</xref>) and weathercasters play a prominent role in the dissemination of that information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1931243112469610">Wilson, 2008</xref>). By identifying patterns that influence how that information is processed and transmitted, this research addresses how to bridge the “schism between most researchers and many television weathercasters on the subject of global change” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1931243112469610">Henson, 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="section3-1931243112469610"><title>Research Questions</title><p>Given the prominence and platform of television weathercasters to educate large audiences about science topics like climate change this research investigates the following research questions:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>Research Question 1</italic>: Who do TV weathercasters trust as sources of climate change information?</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Research Question 2</italic>: What factors predict trust in climate change sources among TV weathercasters?</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Research Question 3</italic>: What factors predict climate change skepticism among TV weathercasters?</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="section4-1931243112469610" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p>The online survey of 1,373 television weathercasters—a census of the broadcast television members of the AMS and National Weather Association (NWA)—was administered in January and February 2010. Of the 1,408 names and email addresses provided by AMS and NWA, 35 people were ineligible because it was determined that they no longer worked as TV meteorologists and 44 email addresses proved to be incorrect (and despite an active search, correct email addresses could not be located), creating a valid sample denominator of 1,373. Fifty-nine of these people refused to participate, 743 did not respond, and 571 completed at least some portion of the survey, yielding a minimum response rate of 41.6% (which assumes that all nonrespondents were eligible to participate). Using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1931243112469610">American Association of Public Opinion Research’s (AAPOR, 2008) </xref>formula for estimating eligibility rate (e) among nonrespondents (Refusals/[Refusals +known ineligibles]), we estimated the nonrespondent eligibility rate at 62.8%. Applying AAPOR’s adjustment for estimated eligibility among nonrespondents ([completed and partial interviews]/[completed and partial interview] + [refusals] + e[UnknownEligibility]) yielded an adjusted response rate of 52.1%. All participants were offered $30 to complete the approximately 20-min survey. Many of the almost 50 questions asked in the survey were assessed using various bivariate and multivariate analyses for this study. The regression and multinomial analyses used three steps to measure potential impacts of a variety of independent variables, including gender and age in the first step; possession of a seal of approval from one of the credentialing organizations in Step 2 as a measure of training; and in Step 3 political ideology.</p><p>Trust in various scientific, professional, media, and other sources of climate change information—conceptualized as dependent variables—was assessed by having respondents rate their trust in various sources as follows: strongly distrust, somewhat distrust, somewhat trust, strongly trust. Skepticism was analyzed using a similar multiple linear regression model for one continuous variable question from the survey and also in multinomial logistic regression analyses with three other questions that did not use continuous scales. Using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, the distributions of all variables were examined and cross tabulated and indices were created that for the first time included political ideology as a potential predictor of both TV weathercaster trust in climate change sources and skepticism about climate change science.</p></sec><sec id="section5-1931243112469610"><title>Findings and Discussion</title><p>The sample of 571 is the largest measure of these potentially prominent science communicators in the scholarly literature and the findings confirm previous research that TV weathercasters play—or can play—an important role as climate change communicators. Nearly all respondents (94%) said they work at stations that do not have anyone else covering science or environmental issues full-time. This number verifies other research showing that only about 10% of TV stations have a dedicated specialist to cover these topics (Sachsman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1931243112469610">2008</xref>). Two thirds of respondents report on science issues once per month or more frequently and one third would like to report on science issues more frequently.</p><p>TV weathercasters also embrace the idea of expanding their role beyond forecasting to becoming “station scientists,” a proposal advanced by the AMS (2012) to make the weathercasters the point person in a TV newsroom on a variety of science topics. Four of the five respondents (79%) indicated they were comfortable serving in this role and only 9% indicated they weren’t. In many cases, this means weathercasters will need to seek out more resources and training in order to cover issues outside their own specialty of meteorology.</p><p>One of the most common science topics TV weathercasters discuss is climate change. Nearly all respondents (87%) had in some way discussed climate change as part of their duties. Only 14% of the 571 weathercasters report their own lack of scientific knowledge on climate change as an obstacle to their reporting. The large majority of respondents say they are <italic>very well</italic> or <italic>fairly well</italic> informed on the different causes of global warming (93%), the different consequences of global warming (89%) and ways in which we can reduce global warming (86%). Even so, almost two thirds of the sample (61%) say “there is a lot of disagreement among scientists about whether global warming is happening or not,” despite the growing scientific consensus.</p><p>Incorporating a series of questions from a previous study, “Global Warming’s Six Americas,” this sample of television weathercasters shows a marked contrast to public attitudes about climate change. While 18% of Americans are “alarmed” and 33% “concerned” about climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1931243112469610">Leiserowitz, A., Maibach, E., &amp; Roser-Renouf, C. 2010b</xref>), only 11% and 16% of weathercasters in this research fit those two categories. At the other end of the spectrum, 7% of Americans in the 2010 Six America’s study were “dismissive” and 11% “doubtful” about climate change, while those numbers are more than double for TV weathercasters in this sample (17% <italic>dismissive</italic> and 18% <italic>doubtful</italic>). Digging deeper into the data reveals some of the causes for this disparity among this group of science-trained specialists and the public who relies on them.</p><p>In addressing Research Question 1, TV weathercasters express varying degrees of trust in sources of climate change information. Using percentages, overall the most trusted sources of climate change information are state climatologists (85%), the NWA (83%), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the National Weather Service (NWS; 82%), peer-reviewed journals (80%), the AMS (79%), and climate scientists (73%). The least trusted climate sources were politicians (4%), religious leaders (11%), mainstream news media (18%), the IPCC (44%), and other TV weathercasters (53%).</p><p>Using a different measure with a 4-point scale (<italic>strongly distrust</italic> = 1, <italic>somewhat distrust</italic> = 2, <italic>somewhat trust</italic> = 3, <italic>strongly trust</italic> = 4), means were also tabulated. Again, the same pattern is noted with the NOAA and state climatologists considered the most trusted sources (3.1), followed by peer-reviewed science journals and NWA conferences (3.0), and AMS conferences and climate scientists (2.9). The least trusted sources were political leaders (1.38), religious leaders (1.58), mainstream media (1.81), the IPCC (2.32), and other TV weathercasters (2.47).</p><p>To test which weathercaster characteristics would best predict trust outcomes in answering Research Question 2, a set of hierarchical multiple linear regressions was conducted (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1931243112469610">Table 1</xref>). The following predictors were included in Step 1: gender (male or female) and age (&lt;29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, and 60+). Gender and age were considered in Step 1 based on anecdotal evidence from weathercaster interviews, comments, and information sessions at meteorological conferences and previous research on the “white male effect” on risk perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1931243112469610">Kahan, Braman, Gastil, Slovic, &amp; Mertz, 2007</xref>). In Step 2, predictors were entered representing whether weathercasters had earned seals of approval from the AMS (Certified Broadcast Meteorologist-CBM, or AMS seal of approval) and/or the NWA. Step 3 included political ideology as an independent variable with the question: “In general, do you think of yourself as: very conservative, somewhat conservative, moderate, somewhat liberal, very liberal?” In this sample, 7% of weathercasters identified as very conservative, 31% as somewhat conservative, 36% as moderate, 19% as somewhat liberal, and 7% as very liberal, which parallels other surveys of public ideology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1931243112469610">Pew Research Center, 2010</xref>).

Even after controlling for other variables in the previous steps, ideology plays the most prominent role in influencing trust among weathercasters for all 11 sources. The statistical significance for ideology is at the <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 level for 7 of the 11 sources and shows a consistent pattern of decreased trust among those who self-identify as conservative. In many cases (peer-reviewed journals, mainstream news media, and political leaders), ideology was the only predictor of decreased trust. In only two cases, conservatives show more trust in climate sources: other television weathercasters and religious leaders, suggesting not only an ideological but also potentially a religious component to trust, as well as the formation of a cadre of skeptics within the conservative TV weathercaster community who trust each other more than traditional research organizations, such as the IPCC or climate scientists.</p><p>In general, women weathercasters are more trusting of 6 of the 11 sources, but only one (NOAA/NWS) with the same statistical significance as ideology as a predictor. Gender plays a consistent but more modest secondary influence with men more skeptical of climate scientists (<italic>B</italic> = .214, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), the AMS (<italic>B</italic> = .268, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), the IPCC (<italic>B </italic>= .348, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), NOAA and the NWS (<italic>B</italic> = .290, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and state climatologists (<italic>B</italic> = .166, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Age was also found to play a minor role as a predictor of decreased trust with increasing age with 8 of the 11 climate sources, but only with a few instances with statistical significance: Older weathercasters are less trusting of other television weathercasters (<italic>B</italic> = −.083, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), state climatologists (<italic>B</italic> = −.064, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), and NWA conferences and meetings (<italic>B</italic> = −.060, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).</p><p>Measuring professional expertise in Step 2 with seals of approval shows very little influence on trust levels. The few exceptions include both those with the CBM and AMS seal having more trust in the IPCC (both at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), those with just the CBM seal having less trust in religious leaders (<italic>B</italic> = −.144; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and those with just the NWA seal showing more trust in their own credentialing organization (<italic>B</italic> = .170 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Earning the CBM seal, which is the most demanding certification and requires passing a written exam on a wider range of issues, shows a small, but consistent pattern of increased trust compared to having the AMS, NWA, or no seal of approval, except for trust in the competing credentialing organization, the NWA, as a climate source. While the value of the various seals sparks intense debate among TV weathercasters themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1931243112469610">Wilson, 2006</xref>), previous research has shown having a seal of approval had no impact on accurate climate knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1931243112469610">Wilson, 2002</xref>). In the 2006 study, weathercasters said they believed the seals measured on-air skill more than forecasting skill and mattered most to news management and the audience (those hypotheses have not been confirmed in the scholarly literature), but longitudinal studies show the seals have very little impact on the lives of weathercasters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1931243112469610">Wilson, 2008</xref>) and in this study seals have only a minor impact in predicting differences in trust levels.</p><p>In general, weathercasters don’t put much trust in mainstream media, which is an ironic twist given that most of them work in it, but once again it is only conservative ideology that predicts any statistical significance in difference in those trust levels (<italic>B</italic> = .240, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). In answering Research Question 2, overwhelmingly it is political ideology that has the most consistent and dramatic influence on predicting trust among all 11 sources of climate change information.</p><p>A similar multiple linear regression model was used to test one other survey question as the first part of creating a skepticism index to analyze Research Question 3. The question <italic>How do you feel about the statement: Global warming is a scam</italic> was measured from 1 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>, 2 = <italic>agree</italic>, 3 = <italic>neutral</italic>, 4 = <italic>disagree</italic>, and 5 = <italic>disagree strongly</italic>, with a mean 3.29 for that dependent variable: Nearly a quarter of TV weathercasters agreed (17%) or strongly agreed (9%) with the statement in this survey, slightly less than the 29% of just AMS weathercasters who agreed to the same question in a smaller survey 2 years prior. As with the trust index, the most significant predictor of agreeing with this statement is found in Step 3 (ideology) of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1931243112469610">Table 2</xref>. While age and gender explain only 1% of the variability in the dependent variable in Step 1, and credentials explain just over 1% of that variability in Step 2, ideology accounts for more than 22% of the variability in how weathercasters responded to this question (<italic>B</italic> = .53, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).

The model used “most scientists think global warming is happening” as the reference category as it accurately reflects the scientific consensus and the findings. Results show that the odds of stating that “most scientists believe global warming is not happening” versus stating that “most scientists believe it is happening” decrease by a factor of .24, or 76%, per unit increase in the ideology scale from conservative to liberal. The results also show that the odds of stating that “most scientists believe global warming is not happening” versus acknowledging the scientific consensus in the reference category decrease by a factor of .44, or 56%, per unit change in age from younger to older. Essentially, these findings state that the more liberal and older the weathercasters are, the lower the odds of believing that scientists think global warming is not happening. That same relationship appears with the second option: The odds of stating “there is a lot of disagreement among scientists about whether global warming is happening” versus acknowledging the scientific consensus in the reference category decrease by a factor of .53, or 47%, per unit increase in the ideology scale from conservative to liberal, as well as decrease by a factor of .75, or 25% per unit change from younger to older. Finally, the “don’t know enough to say” option finds only ideology as a statistically significant predictor in weathercaster responses with the odds of choosing that option over “most scientists think global warming is happening” decreasing by a factor of .55, or 45%, per unit increase in the ideology scale from conservative to liberal.</p><table-wrap id="table5-1931243112469610" position="float"><label>Table 5.</label><caption><p>Estimated Multinomial Logistic Regression Model for Scientific Certainty About Global Warming</p></caption><graphic alternate-form-of="table5-1931243112469610" xlink:href="10.1177_1931243112469610-table5.tif"/><table><thead><tr><th colspan="2"/><th><italic>B</italic></th><th>Standard Error</th><th>Exp(<italic>B</italic>)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="7">Most scientists think global warming is not happening</td><td>Intercept</td><td>3.185</td><td>1.507</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gender</td><td>−.14</td><td>.82</td><td>.87</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>−.82**</td><td>.30</td><td>.44</td></tr><tr><td>Ideology</td><td>−1.43***</td><td>.34</td><td>.24</td></tr><tr><td>CBM seal</td><td>−.11</td><td>.67</td><td>.90</td></tr><tr><td>AMS seal</td><td>.51</td><td>.63</td><td>1.67</td></tr><tr><td>NWA seal </td><td>.44</td><td>.57</td><td>1.56</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="7">There is a lot of disagreement among scientists about whether it is happening </td><td>Intercept</td><td>2.93</td><td>.59</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gender</td><td>0.54</td><td>.28</td><td>1.71</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>−0.29**</td><td>.09</td><td>.75</td></tr><tr><td>Ideology</td><td>−0.64***</td><td>.10</td><td>.53</td></tr><tr><td>CBM seal</td><td>−0.26</td><td>.23</td><td>.77</td></tr><tr><td>AMS seal</td><td>−0.42</td><td>.22</td><td>.66</td></tr><tr><td>NWA seal</td><td>0.35</td><td>.21</td><td>1.42</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="7">Do not know enough to say</td><td>Intercept</td><td>−0.03</td><td>1.55</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gender</td><td>0.53</td><td>.72</td><td>1.69</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>−0.36</td><td>.27</td><td>.70</td></tr><tr><td>Ideology</td><td>−0.61*</td><td>.28</td><td>.54</td></tr><tr><td>CBM seal</td><td>0.05</td><td>.65</td><td>1.05</td></tr><tr><td>AMS seal</td><td>−0.44</td><td>.62</td><td>.65</td></tr><tr><td>NWA seal</td><td>−0.39</td><td>.68</td><td>.68</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="table-fn6-1931243112469610"><p><italic>Note.</italic> <italic>N</italic> = 571.

Weathercasters say they discuss climate change in a variety of venues and one of the most common is in anchor “chit-chat” going in and out of the on-air weather segment so even weathercasters in other parts of the country also often faced spontaneous questions about the seeming contradiction of a harsh winter amid the scientific assertion of global warming.</p><p>Despite such regional and seasonal fluctuations, evidence continues to mount that Earth is warming with 2010 tying with 2005 for the warmest year on record and the 34th consecutive year the planet was warmer than 20th-century averages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1931243112469610">United States Department of Commerce, 2011</xref>). The world’s leading climate scientists continue to conclude with even more certain language that this warming has a discernable human fingerprint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1931243112469610">Pachauri &amp; Reisinger, 2007</xref>). Most people won’t find out about this climate research, however, by reading it in scientific journals, but rather from media reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1931243112469610">Boykoff &amp; Boykoff, 2007</xref>). Local television news remains the primary source of information for most Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1931243112469610">Potter et al., 2011</xref>) and local TV weathercasters are often the most popular and visible element of local newscasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1931243112469610">Silcock et al., 2007</xref>). TV weathercasters are also often the only person in the newsroom with any science training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1931243112469610">Wilson, 2008</xref>) and nearly all of them have discussed climate change as part of their duties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1931243112469610">Wilson, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Despite the strong scientific consensus among climate scientists, almost two thirds (61%) of TV weathercasters in this sample think there is a lot of disagreement among scientists about whether global warming is happening (only one third believe there is a scientific consensus), which reveals what this research shows to be the biggest obstacle to accurate climate change reporting: a sizable minority of weathercasters placing personal ideology above their training in meteorology.</p><p>Using multiple linear regression and multinomial logistic regression analyses, ideology was found to be the primary predictor not only of climate science skepticism but also of “trust issues” with a variety of sources of climate change information. NOAA, who reported the most recent 2010 climate data, is one of the most trusted sources of information among this group, but even with this trusted government agency conservative weathercasters were statistically less trusting (<italic>B</italic> = .145, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Only 44% of all television weathercasters express trust in the IPCC, despite its role as the leading international climate body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1931243112469610">Oreskes &amp; Conway, 2010</xref>) and data analyses reveal that is especially true among conservative weathercasters (<italic>B</italic> = .384, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Self-described conservative TV weathercasters are statistically less trusting of 9 of the 11 tested sources, expressing more trust only in each other (other TV weathercasters) and religious leaders, even though as a group these two categories were considered less trustworthy than most other sources. Recent events like the hacked “Climategate” emails from Britain’s University of East Anglia have also been linked to growing skepticism among weathercasters based on their political ideology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1931243112469610">Maibach, Witte, &amp; Wilson, 2011</xref>) even though multiple inquiries exonerated those climate scientists involved.</p><p>The impact of science training in this study, as measured by possession of one of the coveted seals of approval bestowed by the AMS and NWA, has very little influence on either climate skepticism or trust in climate sources. This is consistent with previous findings that demonstrated that accurate climate change knowledge among weathercasters was not predicted by any of the traditional demographic variables associated with their work (education, newscast position, market size, and years of experience, in addition to seals of approval), but rather through their own personal beliefs and attitudes about the subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1931243112469610">Wilson, 2002</xref>).</p><p>The role of gender as a predictor of trust in climate sources is also noted in this research, but at more modest impact than ideology. Overall, women are more trusting of 9 of the 11 sources (and at the mean with the other two sources: other TV weathercasters and religious leaders) and show statistically significant more trust in 6 of the 11 sources, including the IPCC and climate scientists. This pattern is consistent with other sociological work using 8 years of polling data that found women more likely than men to believe in the science of global warming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1931243112469610">McCright, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Age was also found to play a minor role as a predictor of decreased trust with increasing age with 8 of the 11 climate sources, but only with a few instances with statistical significance. Age was also found to predict one of the four outcomes in the skepticism index: Older weathercasters were more likely to acknowledge that “most scientists agree that global warming is happening” rather than other options to that question, but at a less significant level than the robust predictor of political ideology.</p><p>Even though most TV weathercasters work in mainstream media, they score it very low in trust as a climate change source, but once again it is only conservative ideology that predicts any statistical significance in differences in those trust levels. The public says they trust weathercasters more than anyone else, except scientists, as sources of climate change information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1931243112469610">Leiserowitz et al., 2010a</xref>) meaning that the public is turning to the very mainstream media that weathercasters work in, even though overall TV weathercasters express little trust in it themselves.</p><p>Political leaders score the lowest on trust among all 11 sources and this is especially true for those who identify as conservative; yet, it is the very mixing of partisan beliefs among many of these weathercasters that predict decreased trust and increased skepticism in climate science. This impact of political ideology on trust in science among TV weathercasters is corroborated in a study of public attitudes over the past three decades that showed public trust in science has not declined since the 1970s, except among conservatives and those who frequently attend church (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1931243112469610">Gauchat, 2012</xref>). The difference, of course, is that most TV weathercasters are trained in science and would not be expected to demonstrate the same pattern as the general public, but in this study conservative ideology trumps that training in meteorology.</p><p>Inevitably, the harsh 2010–2011 winter weather did lead to opportunities for on-air meteorologists to explain global warming in that context. TWC meteorologist Carl Parker addressed the seemingly disconnect between the record cold and snow and the scientific consensus in an “Earth Watch” episode.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1931243112469610">1</xref></sup> He followed that up with another segment responding to viewer feedback with one admonishing him and TWC to “keep politics out of science.” His on-air response to this viewer was direct, “that’s exactly what we’re doing” as he explained that while many people think climate change is political, scientists do not. The TWC wasn’t always so bold in addressing climate change, but now regularly mentions the increasingly strong conclusions of climate scientists and has its own statement that parallels the IPCC and AMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1931243112469610">Henson, 2010</xref>). TWC’s Senior Director of Weather Communications, Stu Ostro, shares his conversion from onetime climate skeptic with other meteorologists around the country in conferences and online blogs relating that weather patterns are difficult to totally explain by natural variability. By “speaking their language,” he directly addresses their concerns about the science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1931243112469610">Henson, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Some conservative weathercasters have recently “come out” about climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1931243112469610">Douglas, 2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1931243112469610">Douglas (2012)</xref>, a former TV weathercaster and founder and owner of Broadcast Weather in a commentary to his colleagues writes, “I’m going to tell you something that my Republican friends are loath to admit out loud: climate change is real.” Douglas argues that many of his TV brethren mistakenly apply their suspicion of short-term weather models to long-term climate models: a problem identified among TV weathercasters in previous research (Wilson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1931243112469610">2009</xref>) and he urges them instead to take the time to dig into climate science and that “acknowledging that the atmosphere is warming doesn’t make you a liberal” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1931243112469610">Douglas, 2012</xref>). These kinds of personal testimonies may impact others in the tight weathercaster community, especially given the findings here of the influence of conservative weathercasters on each other.</p><p>Recognizing their potential impact, many organizations are reaching out to the weathercaster community to provide education and training on the topic. The National Environmental Education Foundation (NEEF) has an Earth Gauge program with more than 200 participating weathercasters who receive weekly climate facts, as well as other video and graphic materials for use on-air, online, and in community speaking events.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1931243112469610">2</xref></sup> In conjunction with The University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, NEEF teamed up to create a 2-hr training module on climate science tailored specifically for broadcast meteorologists and used direct links to original research to address weathercasters’ skepticism about sources of information discovered in earlier research and confirmed in this study.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1931243112469610">3</xref></sup></p><p>The Yale Forum on Climate and the Media holds day-long regional seminars with TV weathercasters and leading climate scientists with opportunities to interview these sources on camera for use in reporting (one of the things weathercasters in this research said would assist them in their coverage).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1931243112469610">4</xref></sup> George Mason’s Center for Climate Change Communication is leading several initiatives to improve overall public understanding of global climate change and potential regional and local impacts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1931243112469610">5</xref></sup> That partnership is reaching out to all three categories of weathercasters identified in this research—the 54% of weathercasters who concur with the consensus science; the 25% who reject the science; and the 20% who remain undecided. One of the 4Cs partners is Climate Central a nonprofit group of scientists and communicators who seek to bridge the meteorology and climatology communities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1931243112469610">6</xref></sup> Climate Central’s Director of Communications is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1931243112469610">Heidi Cullen (2006</xref>), who also used to work for TWC as their climate expert, and who got mired in the fray with skeptical weathercasters when she blogged that AMS-credentialed meteorologists should be able to distinguish between solid, peer-reviewed research, and junk political controversy and if they can’t speak to that fundamental science then perhaps the AMS shouldn’t give them a seal of approval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1931243112469610">Cullen, 2006</xref>). Some leading TV weathercasters followed up on this idea and encouraged their colleagues to read the AMS’ statement on climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1931243112469610">Ryan &amp; Toohey-Morales, 2007</xref>), which acknowledges both the warming of the planet and the human fingerprint in that warming (“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1931243112469610">Climate Change,” 2007</xref>). Like Coleman’s (2007) “scam blog,” Cullen’s Weather Channel blog gained widespread attention when it was referenced by a staffer for Senator James Inhofe, a vocal climate critic, but it distorted her message and accused her of advocating that broadcast meteorologists be stripped of their certification if they express climate skepticism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1931243112469610">Morano, 2007</xref>). All of this has added to the already incendiary nature of the debate among this small, but very important community of informal science communicators. While Cullen was vilified by many TV weathercasters, she acknowledges their role as important science sources and says “I have tremendous respect for the community because I understand how much is required of them on a daily basis” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1931243112469610">Henson, 2010</xref>).</p><p>These outreach efforts recognize the important role that local weathercasters can play in the climate change communication process and that there are both opportunities and obstacles for them reporting on the subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1931243112469610">Wilson, 2009</xref>). Only one third of weathercasters in this research say they experience obstacles to such reporting, which was lower than expected. Those tested obstacles included lack of time on-air and for field reporting, but with lower numbers for other work environment factors such as lack of news management or owner support. A smaller concurrent study of news directors using some of the same battery of questions found less skepticism about the science of climate change among this sample of news managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1931243112469610">Maibach, Wilson, &amp; Witte, 2010</xref>). In that survey, news directors expressed high levels of trust in their own weathercasters as sources of climate change information (86%), but nearly all of them (92%) said their weathercasters and news staffs would benefit from additional training and resources. Part of that training might include traditional journalism practices (verification, accuracy, objectivity, attribution) that news directors may be able to instill in their coverage of climate change that some TV weathercasters may not have had as much exposure to in their meteorology education.</p><p>Scientific knowledge is filtered through a fundamental set of cultural values and simply blasting more facts at those who reject science because of those values is not necessarily a solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1931243112469610">Kahan, Jenkins-Smith, &amp; Braman, 2010</xref>). The journal Nature published an editorial arguing that while climate science facts do matter, it’s not enough to just explain the facts very clearly, but that building public trust requires a change in practices (Editorial: “A question of trust,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1931243112469610">2010</xref>). While not specifically mentioning the role of weathercasters, both articles point out that people get their information from a variety of sources, not just scientists, and make decisions out of self-interest, fear, and personal values that may not match up with what researchers deem self-evident. This study tracks a pattern of such behavior among many members of this group of science-trained specialists in a closely related field to climatology. Addressing this disconnect will require not only more “facts” and education about climate science but also open and direct conversations (<italic>speaking their language</italic>) about these deeply entrenched attitudes and values that many of these individuals carry with them regardless of their science training and expertise.</p></sec><sec id="section7-1931243112469610"><title>Limitations and Suggestions for Further Research</title><p>As with all survey research, limitations include not knowing what nonrespondents think, however, the large sample size and high response rate help obviate many of those concerns. This study used many questions from previous surveys and the findings remained consistent over time indicating a consensus of opinions among respondents. Another inherent weakness of survey research is that it relies on the self-reporting of respondents, some of whom may vary in their definitions of key terms used in the study. Still, the statistical significance of the findings and a response rate of over half of working TV weathercasters ameliorate some of those issues as well.</p><p>This study represents the fifth in 10 years studying this group of high-profile specialists and continues to build on previous results. By answering questions in one study, new questions are then raised; including in this research directly asking TV weathercasters about their ideology as it became apparent over time that other factors were not significant contributors to first their climate change knowledge and then to their trust and skepticism issues. One next study would be to evaluate the success of the various outreach activities detailed in the conclusions to determine their efficacy in enhancing TV weathercasters’ communication about climate change, specifically in which ways are “values,” “attitudes,” “beliefs,” and “ideology” most successfully incorporated into those training and educational materials.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict" id="fn7-1931243112469610"><label>Declaration of Conflicting Interests</label><p>The author declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn8-1931243112469610"><label>Funding</label><p>The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by a National Science Foundation grant: Award # DRL-0917566.</p></fn></fn-group><notes><title>Notes</title><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1-1931243112469610"><label>1.</label><p>Available at: http://www.weather.com/tv/programs/Earthwatch.html</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn2-1931243112469610"><label>2.</label><p>Available at: http://www.earthgauge.net/</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn3-1931243112469610"><label>3.</label><p>Available at: www.meted.ucar.edu/bmet_training.php</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn4-1931243112469610"><label>4.</label><p>Available at: http://www.yaleclimatemediaforum.org/index.php</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn5-1931243112469610"><label>5.</label><p>Available at: http://www.climatechangecommunication.org/index.cfm</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn6-1931243112469610"><label>6.</label><p>Available at: http://www.climatecentral.org/</p></fn></fn-group></notes><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-1931243112469610"><citation citation-type="book"><collab collab-type="author">American Association for Public Opinion Research</collab>.
