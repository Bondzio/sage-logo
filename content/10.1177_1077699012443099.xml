<p>Justice William J. Brennan Jr. left the Supreme Court of the United States in 1990 and died seven years later. He is arguably the second most important justice to ever serve on the Court—behind only John Marshall, the first chief justice. Brennan’s impact on free speech jurisprudence is unmatched by any other justice. He wrote what is probably the most important opinion in a free speech case, <italic>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan</italic>, and his fingerprints are on important cases that cover the gamut of free speech issues from obscenity and indecency to expressive conduct to prior restraint.</p>
<p>This book by Seth Stern and Stephen Wermiel, however, is the first substantive biography of Justice Brennan; it has been anticipated for nearly two decades. Wermiel was Supreme Court reporter for the <italic>Wall Street Journal</italic> when he approached Brennan about the biography, and the justice agreed. As part of the original agreement, Wermiel promised not to publish the biography until Brennan was no longer on the Court. In 2006, nearly a decade after Brennan’s death, Wermiel took on legal journalist and Harvard law graduate Seth Stern as coauthor, and the book was published three years later.</p>
<p>On one level, the book is disappointing. First Amendment scholars, in particular, will not like the short shrift that the authors give to Brennan’s involvement in free speech cases, even <italic>Times Co. v. Sullivan</italic>. One has to search the discussion of free speech cases to find tidbits that have not been published elsewhere. In addition, the book’s awkward citation system makes it difficult for readers to track down specific sources. Fewer than 100 of nearly 550 pages of narrative are about Brennan’s early life, so there is much about his life on the Court, and the book is full of anecdotes. But there are no footnotes, and a reader has to track down citations by looking for the page numbers on which the narrative falls. The system makes it inconvenient, if not difficult, to follow the sources of many of the most interesting anecdotes.</p>
<p>On another level, however, the biography is highly rewarding. It contains rich descriptions of the justice’s Court life, his relationship with other justices, and the leadership role he assumed on the Court. Brennan is portrayed not as a hero, though he certainly achieves hero status, but as a principled jurist who is sometimes faced with difficult questions. Stern and Wermiel raise the issue, for example, that Brennan may have sometimes voted with Chief Justice Earl Warren to curry the chief justice’s favor. They also describe in some detail Brennan’s decision to withdraw an offer of a clerkship to a law student because of political pressure. The student, Michael Tigar, may have had some tenuous connection with the Communist Party, about which Brennan was unaware when the offer was made.</p>
<p>Stern and Wermiel also report on Justice Brennan’s almost unforgiving anger at Abe Fortas for the controversy that forced Fortas off the Court, and his distain for Chief Justice Warren Burger.</p>
<p>The book, then, succeeds in going beyond caricature and providing a full picture of a justice who is admired by all free speech advocates. In addition, by the end of the book, despite his possible flaws, readers develop a genuine affection for the justice. The book is an admirable portrait of one of the Court’s most important justices and probably the justice who has done the most to advance the cause of free speech and a free press.</p>
