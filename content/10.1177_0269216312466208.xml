<p>A case report is usually a report of a single patient with a known disease. The report will describe the findings, course and outcome in that particular patient and then explore these in the context of other cases reported in the literature. Case reports in palliative care often comprise the unusual presentation or the unexpected outcome, but also the ‘Oh my goodness, this was difficult’. Case reports sometimes also seem to provide a means of catharsis, or even, dare we say it, self congratulation? If we purport to practice evidence-based medicine, what is the role of the case report, and should a journal like <italic>Palliative Medicine</italic>, striving to be a high-quality research journal, continue to publish them?</p>
<p>Put [case report] and [palliative medicine] or [palliative care] into a Medline search and you get 4220 hits. Limit these to English language articles about adults and you have 2810 articles, of which 1793 have abstracts you can read online. The vast majority of these articles are about patients with unusual presentations of oncological disease, often rare metastases to unusual sites, or patients responding to unusual/experimental treatment approaches. While these are interesting to read, they are not always relevant to the day-to-day practice of palliative medicine. In a completely unsystematic review of the last 500 articles retrieved (these were published over the last 5 years), we considered 124 relevant to palliative care. Reading through these abstracts, a number of themes emerge.</p>
<p>The majority of the articles are written by health-care professionals in palliative care for their palliative care colleagues. These articles include case reports about usual palliative care situations managed in unusual ways: ‘<italic>consider this</italic>’ reports, or situations unusual in palliative care (often secondary to us increasing the range of our services to patients with non-malignant disease) from which the authors have learned; ‘<italic>remember this</italic>’ reports. Others report unusual situations managed in innovative ways: ‘<italic>you might try this</italic>’ reports, and a very few are ‘<italic>don’t miss this</italic>’ reports, for example, the self-induced vomiting in the patient unresponsive to anti-emetics or the patient whose existential distress was due to her previously undisclosed childhood sexual abuse.</p>
<p>Another group of case reports is written by health-care professionals in palliative care for health-care professionals in other fields. These case reports induce a certain amount of publication envy, along the lines of ‘why didn’t I think of submitting that to such a high profile general medical journal?’ These case reports are often about situations we meet frequently in palliative care and that we forget our colleagues might find challenging or might learn from or might not have thought previously of involving palliative care professionals in. We forget that what has become ordinary for us may remain extraordinary for our colleagues. Perhaps, we should see the case report submitted to the general medical, oncology or haematology journal as one of the weapons in our armamentarium in educating our colleagues about what we do or could do?</p>
<p>A further group of case reports appears in both palliative care and general medical journals. These case reports present often complex palliative care situations followed by analysis and discussion of the moral and ethical issues raised, often ‘to treat or not to treat’ decisions, do not attempt resuscitation orders, advance care planning at the end of life, palliative sedation, stopping eating and drinking and the application of the doctrine of double effect, to name but a few. These case reports use the vehicle of a single, not necessarily extraordinary, patient case to raise and debate more general ethical and philosophical issues encountered in patient care.</p>
<p>The editorial board has debated its stance on case reports. Should we continue publishing them? If not would we risk depriving our readers of important clinical reminders and learning, if so would we be out of sync with other palliative care journals? Many palliative care journals continue to publish case reports, but specify how these should contribute to knowledge. <italic>BMC Palliative Care</italic> publishes reports which ‘contribute to medical knowledge through their educational value or which highlight a need for change in clinical practice or diagnostic/prognostic approaches’. The <italic>Journal of Palliative Care</italic> accepts case reports that describe and analyse ‘individual patient problems, clinical or psychosocial, and discuss treatment solutions’. The <italic>Journal of Pain and Symptom Management</italic> publishes ‘clinical notes or case series’, ‘palliative care rounds’, which comprise an informative case and a brief narrative literature review and ‘ethical issues in palliative care’, comprising the single case and the ethical issues raised as discussed previously. The <italic>Journal of Palliative Medicine</italic> publishes brief reports made up of small series on which a hypothesis can be formulated and tested, and the <italic>British Medical Journal: Supportive and Palliative Care</italic> accepts case reports with instructions for authors, which appear to be based on the <italic>British Medical Journal</italic>’s requirements for articles such as ‘lesson of the week’, ‘interactive case report’ and ‘evidence-based case report’. Current trends therefore support publication of case reports but with defined and worthwhile lessons to be learned.</p>
<p>We wish to continue to publish case reports. How then should we position ourselves among this variety of possible journals for case report submission? <italic>Palliative Medicine</italic> is a research journal and our approach to case reports is therefore based on this premise. We will publish case reports of unusual clinical presentations or novel approaches to care to highlight issues of clinical interest, which help readers to pose research questions. Case reports should be should be between 1000 and 1400 words and will therefore need to be succinct and focused. The format for the written case report should, where possible, follow the same structured format as for the structured abstracts we require, but in greater detail. The research focused learning points should be explicit within the report, and case reports will not be accepted for review if this is not the case.</p>
<p>We hope therefore to continue to publish ‘<italic>consider this</italic>’, ‘<italic>remember this</italic>’, ‘<italic>you might try this</italic>’ and ‘<italic>don’t miss this</italic>’ case reports as long as they raise worthwhile and feasible research questions. We welcome ethical and philosophical research questions raised by clinical cases; we encourage our readers and authors to consider how the case report might educate our colleagues reading other journals, but <italic>Palliative Medicine</italic>, as a research journal, cannot be the place to publish our ‘Oh my goodness, this was difficult and didn’t we do well’ stories – unless they raise potential future research questions.</p>
