<abstract>
<p>Adhering to a constructivist approach, this teacher focused on problem solving and group discussion as she initiated a study of traditional notation. She began with the metronome to make the steady beat less abstract for those students who still learn best through concrete operations. The students were challenged to match magnets of various proportional lengths to the number of metronome beats in each word of a familiar song. The completed colored template provided a visual and tactile illustration of the relative length of each sound. With the music map as a guide, the students replaced the colored lengths with traditional notation and added the time signature. Using the aural, visual, and tactile base provided by the metronome beat and the iconic graphic that looked the way the music sounded seemed to help the students understand symbolic notation on a deeper level than previous lecture modes of instruction.</p>

<p>I never thought much about the metronome. Most of the time, it sat on top of the piano at home. Recently, however, I have brought it into the elementary general classroom and placed it right in the spotlight. The reason for this newfound appreciation is that I have finally caught on to its ability to provide a more concrete demonstration of the various note values—something especially valuable for those younger students who are still learning best from explicit and tangible examples. Of course, I have always used a metronome in my own music practice, when necessary, and have encouraged my private piano students to do the same. But those elementary school–age general music students who are still most responsive to concrete learning experiences also benefit from the metronome’s uncompromising beat. Using it as a teaching aid can help students focus on the steady pulse and assist in demonstrating the relationships among the various rhythmic values as they correlate to the time signature.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1048371312438134">Phillips and Phillips (1994)</xref> wrote, “Failures are caused by moving students into symbols before they have had enough time to construct relationships with objects” (p. 51). For years that quotation has been hanging on my office wall, acting as one of my guiding principles and motivating me to provide many visuals and manipulatives for my students. I believe that deeper understanding is fostered if teachers present new concepts in ways that allow students first to experience the specific element enactively (through movement), then with icons (pictures that look like the music sounds) and, later, with a more abstract symbol system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1048371312438134">Boardman, 1997</xref>). Such a sequence of learning also provides a logical basis for designing an effective spiral curriculum throughout the K–5 music program.</p>
<p>Like most music teachers, I begin rhythmic instruction in the primary grades with activities that allow students to show what they hear in the music by moving to the rhythm. Following common practice, I encourage students to match the steady beats with large muscle actions such as marching, clapping, and playing classroom instruments with various rhythmic patterns and diverse styles of music. As students become more proficient with these enactive tasks, I introduce iconic (visual) representations that allow them to touch music maps, to read the pictures as they sing or play instruments, and to represent what they hear or compose through their original icons. At this stage, I am careful to present icons that truly look like the music sounds, rather than using cute pictures that might capture students’ attention but do not precisely represent the sound. For example, I would consider the segment of “Brother John” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1048371312438134">Figure 1</xref> to be a poorly constructed representation because the characters in the first line representing quarter notes are only slightly wider than the eighth notes rather than exactly twice as wide. In the second line, the half note icons are far too narrow in relation to the quarter notes. In addition, the notes of longer duration are also taller, which, to a novice, might very well indicate an increase in volume instead of duration. On the other hand, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1048371312438134">Figure 2</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1048371312438134">Meske, Andress, Pautz, &amp; Willman, 1988</xref>, p. 67) illustrates a well-made representation using horses in exact proportional length to portray accurate note duration without indicating any change in dynamic level.</p>

<p>Where there is no satisfactory visual supplied, a teacher can design an original representation using correct mathematical proportions such as the sample for “Great Big Stars” shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1048371312438134">Figure 3</xref>. When reproducing or devising these iconic representations, the ruler and/or graph paper are essential guides, for the goal is that the relative pitch placements and rhythmic lengths will be exact. Drawing on graph paper provides a quick template for both duration and pitch dimensions. Constructing larger, poster-size representations, of course, requires using a ruler or yardstick. Like a global positioning system (GPS) that must be accurate to help us find our way in geographical space, any visuals we use to assist students to perceive and understand mental schema must accurately represent the sound through pictures. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1048371312438134">Hyerle (1996)</xref> writes, “Unlike geographic maps, which show explicit <italic>physical</italic> models of the world, visual tools generate and unveil <italic>mental</italic> models of interrelationships developed by learners, along with the unique patterning capacity of each learner’s mind” (p. 9). Our job as teachers is to provide precise and illustrative models.</p>

<p>The right time to introduce symbolic notation varies depending on the music experience and understanding of the particular students in question. In my schools, where our schedule only allows for one 25-minute music lesson per week, students are usually ready in the third grade. One day, I realized that, despite my precision about designing iconic representations, I had always been somewhat ambiguous when I introduced the underlying steady beat that determines the length of all the other notes. That is, when my students were ready to do more than enactively match the steady beat in the music and follow iconic maps, it seemed to me that I had a disconnect. When the third grade class discussion focused on the traditional symbolic system of time signatures and rhythmic note values, I realized that I started the lesson series by more or less grabbing a steady beat out of the air. Did the students ever question how I decided on that random steady beat? Probably not. Still, I began to wonder if there might be a smoother, more logical way to approach the rhythmic relationships between the steady beat and the various note values. I wanted my students to do more than just take my word as true—to think deeper than simple rote memorization.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>“So, Teacher, you are telling me that four colored-in notes are the same as one big round note? And one of those big round notes can fill each box, er, measure in this song? Okay, if you say so, Teacher!”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>would simply not suffice. In the end, I wondered if working with the metronome would illustrate and define the steady beat in a more concrete way for those middle elementary students just beginning to grasp rhythmic relationships with traditional written notation.</p>
<p>As I pondered over this, I returned to those sources that had informed me years earlier. I remembered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1048371312438134">Bruner (1977)</xref>, who wrote
<disp-quote>
<p>While the child is in the stage of concrete operations, he is capable of grasping intuitively and concretely a great many of the basic ideas . . . [b]ut he can do so only in terms of concrete operations . . . What is most important for teaching basic concepts is that the child be helped to pass progressively from concrete thinking to the utilization of more conceptually adequate modes of thought. (p. 38)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Basing her practice in part on Bruner’s ideas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1048371312438134">Boardman (2002)</xref> modeled and taught the importance of giving students the opportunity to work through the transition from known to unknown by active, hands-on discovery. “Many musical concepts are so abstract that the importance of providing concrete experiences with music cannot be overemphasized,” she wrote (p. 13). Current sources have echoed Bruner and the other early educators. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1048371312438134">Reys, Lindquist, Lambdin, Smith, and Suydam (2004)</xref> write, “Children need many experiences with concrete models before they can work meaningfully with abstract symbols” (p. 32). Even in third through fifth grades, some students will “still be very hands-on and will need opportunities to share their knowledge in more tactile ways” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1048371312438134">Sprenger, 2007</xref>, p. 105).</p>
<p>As I considered all I’d learned from these and other thinkers, I realized that in traditional common practice, music teachers might simply have verbally explained the note values and time signatures. Following that “stand-and-deliver” lecture, there would have been practice activities of various sorts until students were able to recite the information themselves. Such a presentation might have helped auditory and visual learners understand (or at least memorize) the facts but would have been less beneficial to kinesthetic/tactile learners who often have difficulty in the traditional classroom where the teacher may be focused on visual or auditory instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1048371312438134">Sprenger, 2007</xref>, p. 113).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1048371312438134">Fosnot (1996)</xref> describes traditional teacher-delivered instruction as “a view of learning as the acquisition of specific facts, rules, and attitudes that are picked up by exposure and a view of the teacher’s role in the process as showing and telling students what they need to know” (pp. 205-206). After studying constructivist principles, I no longer viewed learning as the accumulation of particular facts or rules simply by explanation and repetition. I no longer pictured the ideal teacher as dispenser of knowledge, but as a facilitator to students’ personal constructions of basic concepts. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1048371312438134">Fosnot (1989)</xref> expresses it, “A constructivist takes the position that the learner must have experiences with hypothesizing and predicting, manipulating objects, posing questions, researching answers, imagining, investigating, and inventing, in order for new [mental] constructions to be developed” (p. 20). Teachers striving toward a constructivist approach keep in mind several guiding principles:</p>
<list id="list1-1048371312438134" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Teachers need to allow learners to raise their own questions, generate their own hypotheses and models as possibilities, and test them for viability.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Challenging, open-ended investigations in realistic, meaningful contexts need to be offered, thus allowing learners to explore and generate many possibilities, both affirming and contradictory. Contradictions, in particular, need to be illuminated, explored, and discussed.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Dialogue within a community engenders further thinking. Learners (rather than the teacher) are responsible for defending, proving, justifying, and communicating their ideas to the classroom community.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Learning proceeds toward the development of [cognitive] structures. As learners struggle to make meaning, progressive structural shifts in perspective are constructed [that form understandings about major underlying concepts]. (Compiled and adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1048371312438134">Fosnot, 2005</xref>, pp. 33-34)</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In short, I wanted to facilitate students as they smoothly and logically transitioned from the iconic stage of understanding to an ability to understand and use traditional music symbols. As they began to form individual understanding about time signatures and relative note values, I wanted to create a situation where students themselves could discover those relationships and discuss their understanding with each other. I hoped to begin the process at the very beginning—with the underlying steady beat.</p>
<p>That is the background I brought as I thought about the possibility of using the metronome as a teaching tool. Instead of striking up a random steady beat, as I had for so many years, it now seemed both interesting and logical to begin with a metronome’s beat. I guessed, correctly, that no third grader in any of my seven classes would know what the metronome was, and I purposely used the electric one that looked like a plain black box with only a dial on the front and an unlit dome on top. “What do you suppose this is?” I queried. All kinds of answers were suggested: A toaster? A game? A heater? A radio? To all the answers, I replied with more questions, “A toaster? Let’s see . . . where would you put the bread?” Such speculation resulted in all students giving the curious problem their full attention. For some classes, a hint was eventually necessary. Perhaps, I would draw the old pendulum-style metronome on the chalkboard, or perhaps, I finally would have to turn on the metronome. All students in my third grade classes were working together to suggest and consider many possibilities, both divergent and logical. All were focused and engaged with the problem.</p>
<p>And we weren’t done thinking, yet. There was the problem of the dial. What was that for? It was quickly obvious as students turned it that it controlled the speed of the ticking, but when I asked, “Ticks per what?” they were stumped again. What did I mean? “Well, 72 ticks per <italic>mile</italic>? 72 ticks per <italic>song</italic>? per <italic>inch</italic>?” After they agreed on “ticks per minute,” I posed, “So if I wanted it to tick every <italic>second</italic>, where would we have to set it?” Ah, a real-life application of their math facts! (Any of their classroom teachers who happened to be present smiled broadly at this math integration in the lesson.)</p>
<p>Then how much fun it was to sing a familiar song at contrasting tempos! If we had recently been exploring the idea of “phrase” with “The Ghost of John,” then that was the song we used.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>How does it make you feel to sing it very fast? Is it as scary when it is fast as when we sing it more slowly? No? So we could say that changing the tempo of a song usually changes its effect on people? How cool is that!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At this point, I put a template on display that represented four lines of two measures each in 4 × 4 time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1048371312438134">Figure 4</xref>). The top squares would ultimately represent the duration of the notes in the song; the rectangles below the squares represent the unchanging steady beat. I set the metronome for a reasonably slow tempo for “Ghost of John,” and busied myself putting an assortment of colored magnetic squares randomly on the chalkboard, I explained that each square on the template represented one “tick” of the metronome. I demonstrated that verbal explanation by touching each square on the empty template in time with the audible ticks. Any magnets that were that same size and shape as the squares on the template (in my case, the yellow magnets) also represented one “tick” or one beat. “Your job,” I challenged them, “is to use these magnets to match the words of the song to the metronome’s beat. If a word takes one tick or beat, attach a magnet to the beat-sized box. Who wants to start?” The temptation to manipulate the brightly colored magnets lured everyone to take a turn.</p>

</fig>
<p>At the end of the first phrase, the word “John” lasted two beats, so they realized that they needed the red magnet that was twice as long as the yellow ones to cover two squares of the template. (Below the red magnet, they could still see the rectangles, assuring them than the red strip did, indeed, cover two beats. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1048371312438134">Figure 5</xref>.) Many classes were stumped for a bit when they encountered the eighth notes on beat 4 in the second phrase. (The text was “long white bones <italic>with the</italic> skin all gone.”) However, if they listened carefully to the metronome, it became clear that two magnets (words/notes) should fit into one beat box.</p>

</fig>
<p>I never gave my opinion about right or wrong throughout the process but instead asked the class to sing what the student had just put on the board (starting each time from the beginning of the short song). For example, if the student working at the board used two yellow magnets (representing one beat each) for the eighth notes, I’d say, “Let’s see how that feels.” When we reached the eighth-note pattern, I’d be certain to sing the words (“with the”) to match the metronome’s steady (quarter note) beats as I pointed to the beat boxes, thus clearly illustrating the error of using a magnet that matched the beat instead of two shorter magnets. Once they realized that two shorter magnets could fit neatly into one beat box, they could work more easily with the six eighth notes in the fourth phrase. In this way, the class constantly worked together to choose the length of magnet that represented the rhythm of the words. They all had a chance to work out the problem in their own minds and as a community of learners. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1048371312438134">Fosnot (2005)</xref> writes about the problems or “perturbations” that result in new learning:
<disp-quote>
<p>We know the world <italic>through</italic> the schemes and structures we use to explore it. Perturbations to these assimilatory schemes cause cognitive reordering (accommodation). These perturbations can come about when learners reflect on their actions and infer them to be insufficient or inefficient. They can come about when a cognitive structure is perturbed; or when two ideas seem to be contradictory. Thus, teachers need to become facilitators, provocateurs, and questioners. (p. 288)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1048371312438134">Bruner (1996)</xref> seems to concur with Fosnot when he writes, “The art of raising challenging questions is easily as important as the art of giving clear answers . . . Good questions are ones that pose dilemmas, subvert obvious or canonical ‘truths’, force incongruities upon our attention” (p. 127). To summarize, the magnets not only served as “perturbations” or puzzles but also as visual and tactile tools—<italic>iconic notation</italic> that helped the students form a more defined mental concept of the song’s rhythm. (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1048371312438134">Figure 5</xref> for a photo showing the magnets in use.) As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1048371312438134">Hyerle (1996)</xref> wrote, “Visual tools are neither contents nor processes; they are tools of the learner’s trade for concretely <italic>forming</italic> knowledge” (p. 25). We made the connection strong by touching each beat box of a completed phrase as we worked through the task to check our accuracy and celebrated at the end by singing the entire piece.</p>
<p>Throughout this process, the metronome acted as an aural tool that gave my students and me an unwavering beat and provided an ostinato to remind us that all the work we were doing referred to the metronome beat that had started the lesson. I kept it beating much of the time as we worked out the placement of the magnets to keep us grounded in the concreteness of the steady beat and focused on relationships to the underlying beat. Hearing the metronome helped continually remind the students that the steady beat was the focal point of the learning, not the manipulation of the magnets—that the magnets were simply representations or pictures of the steady beat we were hearing.</p>
<p>At this point in the lesson, I took time to give duplicate copies of the blank template to each student so that they could color their page to match the magnets. This, I trusted, would serve as an immediate reinforcement and review. When they finished, we sang the song yet again, along with the metronome, as they now touched their own “music.”</p>
<p>The next step in the progression of lessons was to move into symbolic notation, so on a subsequent day, we reviewed the rhythm using their own papers. Then I drew a quarter note on the board and told them the note “stood for” the steady beat. Passing out fresh copies of the template, I asked them to draw a quarter note in any box that they heard one metronome tick—or, in other words, in any box that had contained a yellow magnet in our former task. From there, we continued learning about the rhythmic notation needed to finish the tune: half, eighth, and whole notes. With their previously colored templates at hand and my magnets in place on the board, they had visual reminders of the proportional relationship of each new kind of note to the steady beat. That is, they could be assured that the new half notes they were now drawing were twice as long as the quarter notes because they had already worked that out for themselves and had colored their templates accordingly. Of course, we checked our work against the ubiquitous metronome beat, and when we finished, we sang the tune as they pointed to their new charts of symbolic notation.</p>
<p>At every stage, I insisted that they actually touch the colored boxes or symbolic notation with their fingers rather than just reading with their eyes or touching with pencil tips. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1048371312438134">Armstrong (1994)</xref> wrote, “Students who show signs of bodily-kinesthetic intelligence should have opportunities to learn by manipulating objects or by making things with their hands” (p. 76), but it seems logical to me that <italic>all</italic> learners can benefit from stimulation of <italic>all</italic> their senses in the learning process. Coloring their own musical maps to match the magnetic representation on the board might reinforce what the students see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and touching the map with their finger uses their tactile sense.</p>
<p>From this point on, the lesson process was not only logical, but simple. Now that they had completed the whole song, I asked how many ticks or beats were in one measure. “Four, of course,” they assured me, for it was now obvious to us all. Just to make sure, though, we checked measures of various kinds of notes against the metronome to assure ourselves that they did indeed contain four beats. Convinced, we added a 4 at the beginning of the song. “And which of the notes exactly matches the steady beat (ticks)? The quarter note!” So we added a quarter note under the 4, and now we had our time signature that could tell anyone looking at this music about its rhythm organization. (If students have enough math background to understand that a quarter is one fourth, I may go ahead and explain how musicians may use a 4 on the bottom of the time signature to represent the quarter note.) How much clearer the time signature seemed to my students now than when I just tried to explain it without this lesson sequence!</p>
<p>After this initial set of lessons, it is critical to experience the same sequence of discovery using different melodies. It is also important to use the process in other settings and in subsequent grade levels, such as fourth-grade recorder lessons and chorus practice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1048371312438134">Sprenger (2007)</xref>, in her book about teaching students to remember, reminds us “information that enters immediate memory is lost rapidly unless it is manipulated in some way. . . . [P]roviding numerous episodes for our students is . . . a necessary component of elaborative rehearsal” (p. 103). It is also logical to use the same magnets to segue from learning about rhythmic notation into an illustration of the melodic direction of the same song (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1048371312438134">Miller, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>I do not claim that every student will understand symbolic rhythmic notation when we are through with this type of lesson. This is, rather, one way to approach teaching that I think helps many students begin to conceptualize rhythmic notation on their own. Students with special needs seem especially to benefit from this approach, since it relies on multiple entries (visual, tactile, auditory), encourages active participation, and makes no presumptions about a student’s ability to process abstract ideas. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1048371312438134">Fosnot (2005)</xref> says,
<disp-quote>
<p>From a constructivist perspective, we cannot direct learning to get everyone to the same ‘ah ha’ at the end of the lesson. We can only facilitate ‘coupling’ with problematic situations, help raise questions and puzzlements, and support discourse and development. (p. 279)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Before learning to use the various lengths of magnets in this manner—and before incorporating the metronome to undergird the lessons—I felt that the relationship of eighth, quarter, half, and whole notes was information that my students seemed to simply memorize without real understanding. Even if they succeeded in memorizing the relationships between the notes, they still found it hard to grasp the connection between the notes and the time signature. Using this initial method and following through with similar applications in other situations seems to result in deeper comprehension for my own students.</p>
