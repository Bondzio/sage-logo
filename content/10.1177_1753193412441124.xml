<abstract>
<p>The dorsal scapholunate (SL) ligament may disrupt in variety of ways. Each form of injury requires specific fixation. To investigate the incidence of each type of ligament failure, the records of 45 patients with adequate information, good quality pictures, or videos demonstrating injury characteristics were reviewed. Four types of SL injury were found: type 1 (lateral avulsion from the scaphoid) was the most frequent, present in 19 patients (42%); type 2 (medial avulsion from the lunate) was the least frequent, with 7 cases (16%); type 3 (mid-substance rupture) was found on 9 occasions (20%); and type 4 (partial rupture plus elongation) was observed on 10 occasions (22%). Based on our observations, we submit that an arthroscopically assisted SL capsuloplasty may not be possible in all cases, particularly not when the ligament has avulsed off the bone (60% of the cases), leaving no ligament remnant on one side. Most patients will require ligament reattachment techniques using transosseous sutures, bone anchors, or ligament reconstruction.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Scapholunate (SL) ligament injury is common among young individuals, often the consequence of a fall from a height or a motorcycle accident. In a fall from a height, the outstretched hand hits the floor and becomes a fixed pivot point upon which the falling body rotates; in a head-on collision, the cyclist’s hand remains blocked by the handle bar and the body’s inertia is what causes the damage. In both instances, a violent torque is generated forcing the wrist into extension and variable degrees of radioulnar inclination and/or intracarpal pronosupination. In such circumstances, the bones of the proximal row do not displace in similar directions; while the scaphoid is pulled distally by the scaphocapitate and scaphotrapeziotrapezoidal ligaments, the lunate remains solidly constrained against the radius by the two palmar, short and long radiolunate ligaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193412441124">Garcia-Elias, 2011</xref>). If the wrist is radially deviated at the moment of impact, a scaphoid waist bending fracture is likely. If the wrist is ulnarly inclined, an SL injury more often occurs. However, some cases with coexisting injuries also occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193412441124">Jorgsholm et al. 2010</xref>). Certainly, an SL dissociation may be associated with a wide multiplicity of local injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412441124">Adolfsson and Povlsen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412441124">Andersson and Axelsson, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, the dorsal SL ligament may fail in a variety of ways. A number of factors may explain such diversity of failure modes, such as wrist position at the moment of impact; direction, velocity, and point of application of the damaging force; integrity of the secondary ligament stabilizers; muscle status at the moment of the accident. Assessing the failure mode of a ligament injury not only may help clinicians to understand its pathomechanics, but also to decide the most adequate treatment for each individual case.</p>
<p>Very little has been published about the incidence of the different failure modes of the dorsal SL ligament injury. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193412441124">Lavernia et al. (1992)</xref> stated that “the scapholunate interosseous membrane is usually avulsed from the scaphoid and remains attached to the lunate.” Cohen and Taleisnik wrote (1998) that “the ligament is typically torn off of the scaphoid (occasionally with a small fragment of articular cartilage) while remaining attached to the lunate. However, it can avulse off of the lunate and remain attached to the scaphoid”. Aside from bone avulsions, other forms of injury have also been observed, but their relative frequency is unknown.</p>
<p>Recently, some arthroscopy-guided SL ligament repairs have been introduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193412441124">del Piñal et al., 2010</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193412441124">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753193412441124">Mathoulin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753193412441124">Stuffmann et al., 2010</xref>). When feasible, the advantages of such minimally invasive surgeries are obvious. These techniques, however, are only possible if there are repairable ligament remnants on both sides of the joint. Avulsion injuries would not be good candidates. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relative incidence of the different failure modes of the dorsal SL ligament and, particularly, to ascertain the percentage of patients that could benefit from arthroscopy repair.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>All surgical reports that contained good quality pictures or videos of an acute or chronic dorsal SL ligament injury were retrospectively analyzed. Only four cases were excluded due to poor photo quality. The final series consisted of 45 patients with SL ligament ruptures (30 men, 15 women; average age 38 [range 18–70] years), all of them treated surgically between 2003 and 2011 in our departments. The dominant hand was involved in 32 patients. Ten patients had surgery within the first 3 months after trauma, while 35 had a chronic SL ligament injury, 11 of whom with signs of radioscaphoid cartilage degeneration. High energy trauma was present in 18 cases (40%). The injury was managed arthroscopically in 18 patients and the remaining 27 patients had had open surgery. All available audiovisual material from these cases was independently scrutinized by the two investigators, with the aim of identifying the type of ligament injury in each case. Full agreement was reached in all cases. The degree of scarring of the capsule and tissue degeneration in chronic cases did not impair classification of the SL injury.</p>
<p>Four distinct injury types were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412441124">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The incidence of the different types of SL derangement in this series is detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753193412441124">Table 1</xref>. The dorsal SL ligament was found to be avulsed from the scaphoid (type 1) in 19 of 45 cases (42%). The avulsed ligament included an osteochondral fragment on five occasions. Type 2 injury (avulsion off the lunate) was found in seven cases (16%), of which one had an osteochondral fragment from the lunate attached at the end of the avulsed ligament. Type 3 injury (mid-substance rupture) was identified in nine patients (20%), and type 4 (partial rupture plus elongation) in 10 cases (22%).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>When the wrist is ulnarly deviated at the moment of impact, the unconstrained scaphoid will be pulled away from the lunate until the tensioned SL ligaments reach their limit of tolerance and a progressive derangement of the SL interosseous ligament complex takes place. Most often, this starts palmarly and progresses dorsally, until the last fibres of the dorsal SL ligament disrupt, completing the SL dissociation. The dorsal SL ligament plays an important role in the stabilization of the loaded carpus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412441124">Berger et al.,1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193412441124">Short et al., 2007</xref>). Its importance, however, should not be overemphasized. Complete rupture of that ligament does not necessarily imply carpal collapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753193412441124">Short et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The compensatory effects of the adjacent capsuloligamentous structures on one side, plus the dynamic action of certain muscles on the other, may effectively ensure carpal stability, particularly in low-demand patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193412441124">Hagert, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753193412441124">Salva-Coll et al., 2011</xref>). In general, however, if an SL ligament injury has not healed properly, the chances of progressive joint deterioration are high. Consequently, if the healing potential of a torn SL ligament is optimal, repairing the lesion to recover its original functional strength appears to be the most reasonable approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412441124">Cohen and Taleisnik, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193412441124">Garcia-Elias et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193412441124">Lavernia et al., 1992</xref>). Indeed, the wrist will be better prepared to sustain loads if this ligament is functional.</p>
<p>This study has demonstrated the existence of different forms of dorsal SL injury, each requiring one particular type of repair. While type 3 mid-substance ruptures (only 20% of the cases) may allow a direct repair, ensuring end-to-end contact of the two ligament stumps, types 1 or 2 ligament avulsions do not allow that. Indeed, if the entire ligament has been pulled off the bone, the only feasible solution is to reattach the avulsed ligament to the denuded bone with transosseous sutures or, most commonly, with anchor sutures. Type 4 injuries, involving elongation of a partially ruptured SL ligament, can be treated by detaching the elongated fascicle and advancing it to a more distal position over the dorsolateral ridge of the scaphoid, plus augmentation of the repair with some sort of capsulodesis or tenodesis. In some of the cases who had a type 4 injury, arthroscopic plication may also be a good alternative.</p>
<p>Based on our observations, we submit that an arthroscopically assisted SL capsuloplasty may not be possible in all cases, particularly when the ligament has avulsed off the bone (60% of the cases), leaving no ligament remnant on one side. The proposed classification, therefore, has both a descriptive but also therapeutic value.</p>
<p>Although current non-invasive radiology may suggest some injury characteristics, the actual extent and nature of most ligament tears is not known until the case is assessed arthroscopically or by open surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412441124">Adolfsson and Povlsen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412441124">Andersson and Axelsson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193412441124">Lindau 2000</xref>). This implies that the surgeon needs to decide <italic>in situ</italic> what treatment strategy will best adapt to each individual case. Unfortunately, detailed information of how best to treat all the different clinical forms that one may encounter in the operating room is not yet available.</p>
<p>In the early literature, management of SL dissociation was discussed as if all ligament injuries had similar rupture characteristics. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193412441124">1996</xref>, Geissler et al. were the first to propose a classification based on the arthroscopic assessment of the amount of SL instability. In 2006, Garcia-Elias et al. suggested a staging system based on five prognostic factors, including the extent of ligament rupture, repairability of the ligament tear, reducibility of the carpal displacements, status of secondary stabilizers, and condition of the cartilage. None of them discussed the different types of ligament rupture as a factor to consider. In our opinion, any treatment algorithm that does not take into account whether the ligament has stretched out, ruptured, or torn off the bone is incomplete. Indeed, for the treatment to be successful, it needs to be based on a detailed evaluation of all the factors influencing the outcome. Certainly, the type of ligament rupture is an important one.</p>
<p>As stated above, a number of factors may explain the diversity of ligament failure modes observed in this study. Unfortunately, the retrospective nature of this investigation did not allow establishing correlations between those factors and the type of ligament injury. Another limitation of this study was the inclusion criteria: about one-tenth of the cases treated in the same period had to be excluded from the study because of a lack of good quality pictures that could allow characterization of the SL ligament rupture. Probably, the descriptive statistics would have been similar if all of them had been included; but certainly, a more detailed, prospective investigation would be needed to clarify this.</p>
