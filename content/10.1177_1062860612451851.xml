<abstract>
<p>This study assessed the perceptions and actions of rural hospital nurse executives with regard to patient safety and quality improvement (QI). A national sample of rural hospital nurse executives (n = 300) completed a survey measuring 4 domains related to patient safety and QI: (<italic>a</italic>) patient “Safety Culture,” (<italic>b</italic>) adequacy of QI “Resources,” (<italic>c</italic>) “Barriers” related to QI, and (<italic>d</italic>) “Nurse Leader Engagement” in activities supporting QI. Perceptions of Safety Culture were strong but 47% of the Resources needed to carry out QI were inadequate, 29% of Barriers were moderate to major, and 25% of Nurse Leader Engagement activities were performed infrequently. Nurse Leader Engagement in quality-related activities was less frequent among nurses in isolated and small rural town hospitals compared with large rural city hospitals. To further QI, rural nurse executives may need to use their communications and actions to raise the visibility of QI.</p>

<body>
<p>Through passage of the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA), Congress sent a strong message to providers to improve clinical quality and patient safety or face reduced Medicare payments. The ACA goes beyond previous legislation that linked hospital payment with the submission of quality data through the establishment of a hospital value-based purchasing (VBP) program. Under VBP, incentive payments are made to hospitals that meet quality achievement and performance improvement standards.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1062860612451851">1</xref></sup> Approximately 883 of the 3092 hospitals expected to participate in VBP are located in rural areas. Despite the unique challenges they face, rural hospitals are not sheltered from the threat of payment reductions if quality parameters are not met. (The exception to this is critical access hospitals—small rural hospitals having up to 25 beds and an average length of stay no longer than 96 hours. These will not be included in the VBP program at the start but may be incorporated in the future.)</p>
<p>Although many hospitals find meeting the growing demand for quality improvement difficult, taking on this resource-intensive work is particularly challenging for rural hospitals. With 68 (24%) fewer registered nurses per 100 000 population in rural counties compared with urban counties, it is difficult for rural hospitals to have nursing staff participate in quality improvement projects while continuing to meet bedside demands.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1062860612451851">2</xref></sup> In addition, nurses who practice in rural hospitals tend to be less educated; they are more apt to be licensed practical nurses than registered nurses, and registered nurses are less likely to have earned bachelor degrees.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1062860612451851">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1062860612451851">4</xref></sup> Rural nurses also serve patients with greater health needs; compared with people who reside in urban areas, rural residents are more likely to be older than 65 years of age, have low income, lack health insurance, and engage in risky health behaviors such as smoking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1062860612451851">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nurse leader commitment is a critical factor that influences the development of a positive quality and patient safety culture in their hospitals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1062860612451851">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1062860612451851">6</xref></sup> and is even more essential in overcoming the substantial barriers to improving quality in the lower-resourced environment of rural hospitals. Strong nurse leaders are in a position to initiate strong quality and patient safety programs by raising awareness, transforming the hospital culture, and forming internal and external partnerships.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1062860612451851">7</xref></sup> In interviews, nurse leaders cited a number of strategies to engender a successful quality improvement and safety culture: being actively engaged in quality work, encouraging open communication about patient safety problems, setting expectations that quality is a shared responsibility, engaging clinical champions, holding staff accountable, and providing feedback to staff.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1062860612451851">5</xref></sup> Nurse leader commitment to safety can be leveraged to motivate staff nurse ownership of patient safety and to promote a focus on identifying and addressing factors that contribute to risk and suboptimal care rather than assigning blame.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1062860612451851">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1062860612451851">8</xref></sup> In addition to fostering quality and safety practices at the bedside, nurse leaders also have an important role in improving hospital board members’ and chief executive officers’ (CEOs) understanding of the linkage between nursing care and patient safety and quality outcomes, as well as their willingness to allocate resources for quality improvement efforts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1062860612451851">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite the challenges rural hospitals face as payment is restructured to be contingent on quality care, little is known about nurse leadership as it relates to quality improvement in rural hospitals. The purpose of this study was to profile nurse executives who work in rural hospitals, identify the resources related to nursing quality and patient safety that are available in the rural hospital work environment, and assess nurse executive engagement in supporting quality improvement as well as their perceptions of hospital patient safety culture.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-1062860612451851">
<title>Study Population</title>
<p>The authors surveyed nurse executives working in rural hospitals located in the following 11 states: Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Maryland, Maine, New York, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. Because this survey was part of a larger study relating survey results to Patient Safety Indicators calculated with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’s Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Database (SID) data, the authors chose among the 39 states that contributed data to the SID in 2008, selecting at least 2 per US Census region, with a preference for states with greater numbers of rural hospitals. Rural–urban commuting area (RUCA) codes, version 2.0, were applied to determine whether hospitals were located in rural areas. RUCA codes classify US Census tracts on a scale of 1 to 10 based on measures of population density, urbanization, and daily commuting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1062860612451851">10</xref></sup> A metropolitan area (codes 1-3) has a population center of at least 50 000 people; a large rural city (codes 4-6) has a center of at least 10 000 but less than 50 000 people; and a small rural town (codes 7-9) has a center of at least 2500 people but less than 10 000 people. Isolated rural areas (code 10) are not part of an area with a concentrated population. Hospitals in areas rated 4 through 10 (large rural cities, small rural towns, and isolated rural areas) were included in this study. Among these hospitals, only nonfederal, acute care hospitals were included, for a total of 530 hospitals.</p>
<p>After securing approval from the Fox Commercial Institutional Review Board (Springfield, IL), the survey was mailed directly to the senior nurse executive (chief nursing officer or director of nursing) at each of the 530 rural hospitals. Nurses who did not respond to the survey were telephoned up to 6 times to encourage them to respond and were offered the opportunity to complete the survey by phone. Data were collected in the spring of 2010.</p>

<sec id="section3-1062860612451851">
<title>Survey Instrument</title>
<p>After reviewing the literature and instruments to assess patient safety-related concepts, the authors developed a survey to measure nurse leader perceptions in 4 domains: (<italic>a</italic>) hospital patient “Safety Culture,” (<italic>b</italic>) the adequacy of quality improvement “Resources,” (<italic>c</italic>) “Barriers” related to quality improvement, and (<italic>d</italic>) “Nurse Leader Engagement” in performing behaviors that support quality improvement. Although a number of instruments are available to measure patient safety culture, none could be found that fit the context or multifaceted purpose of this study. Key concepts underlying each domain were identified, after which survey items were developed. The instrument was reviewed for content validity by 5 external experts in survey research, rural health care delivery, and executive nurse leadership in rural hospitals.</p>
<p>The Safety Culture domain measured level of agreement (strongly disagree, disagree, agree, or strongly agree) with 7 statements concerning the following: CEO effectiveness, support for quality improvement training, application of quality improvement concepts, taking corrective action when targets are not met, evaluating effectiveness of changes to improve patient safety and quality, adverse events occurring from multiple system failures versus an individual’s actions, and mistakes leading to systematic changes to improve patient care. The Resources domain consisted of 6 items that support quality improvement efforts; adequacy of resources was rated on a 4-point scale (exceptional, more than adequate, minimally adequate, not adequate). The Resource items included the following: staff to coordinate quality improvement efforts, access to quality improvement implementation training, staff to analyze and report patient safety and quality data, access to data systems to generate reports, ease of using data systems for reporting, and overall level of resources. The Barriers domain asked about 9 potential barriers, assessed as major, moderate, small, or did not exist. The potential Barriers were the following: not knowing which improvements or measures of improvement were best, low numbers of staff (nursing and other), resistance to making quality improvement–related changes (physician and other), inadequate institutional leadership, insufficient staff resources related to data (collection of data and expertise to analyze data and prepare reports), and insufficient training to teach staff how to implement quality improvement strategies. Last, the Nurse Leader Engagement domain items were measured on a scale of frequency (not at all, once or twice, several times, monthly or almost monthly, and weekly or more often) of performing 9 activities in the previous year. These activities included the following: reviewing quality data (within hospital data and comparison to benchmarks), holding discussions with staff (regarding goals, regarding quality data, and regarding quality performance targets), holding discussions regarding quality improvement initiative progress (with hospital senior management and with hospital board of directors), making safety rounds, and following up on quality improvement opportunities or concerns raised by staff. The survey also asked nurse executives about personal attributes (race, sex, and education), work-related responsibilities, and years of experience in their current role as well as about their hospital’s quality improvement activities and collaborations with other organizations, hospital accreditation, and nurse staff turnover. These data were supplemented by data from the 2008 American Hospital Association (AHA) annual survey that provided background information on the hospitals (location, bed size, teaching status, ownership, electronic medical record [EMR], public reporting of quality indicators, and system membership).</p>
<p>Survey domains were scored by highlighting the hospitals in which nurse leaders’ reports were less favorable, indicating that opportunities for improvement existed. The authors counted the number of responses in which nurse executives indicated potential areas of weakness: they disagreed with statements indicating a strong Safety Culture; they felt that Resources were minimally adequate or inadequate; they believed Barriers to patient safety to be major or moderate; and they infrequently (several times per year or less) carried out activities that further patient safety or quality improvement in hospitals (Nurse Leader Engagement). The total number of items indicating potential areas of weakness in each domain was divided by the number of items in the domain to create a percentage.</p>
<p>Confirmatory factor analysis was performed to verify the relatedness of the items in each domain. Factor loadings ranged from .45 to .87 with the internal validity of all domains acceptable as determined by Cronbach α scores of at least .76. Three additional items did not load on a construct at .40 or greater; these are reported separately. Descriptive statistics were generated to describe the nurse leaders and the hospitals in which they worked. Chi-square tests and analysis of variance were used to determine if there was any variation in response by nurse executive or hospital characteristics. In instances in which cell counts were less than 5, the Fisher exact test was used to determine if differences were statistically significant.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Of 529 nurse executives surveyed, 300 (57%) responded. Executives who worked in isolated rural area hospitals (69%) and small rural town hospitals (56%) were more likely to complete the survey than those leaders employed by large rural city hospitals (49%). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1062860612451851">Table 1</xref> provides an overview of respondent and associated hospital characteristics by rural location. Almost three quarters of the nurse executives were responsible for non-nursing departments such as pharmacy, respiratory therapy, and dietary services. Twenty-two percent of nurse executives reported providing direct patient care, with more than one third of those executives working with patients 9 hours or more per week. When asked about governance committee participation, nurse executives commonly reported attending hospital board of directors meetings and voting on the strategic planning committee, but were less apt to be voting members of the hospital finance committee or the executive committee. Nurse executives working in large rural city hospitals were more likely to have broader responsibilities for non-nursing departments and were less likely to provide direct patient care compared to nurses located in isolated or small rural town hospitals.</p>

<p>Between 2006 and 2008, all but 6% of hospitals were very active in quality projects related to nursing care, with most hospitals undertaking patient satisfaction (97%) and fall prevention (97%), followed by projects on preventing pressure ulcers (82%), catheter-associated urinary tract infection prevention (78%), and pain management (78%). (Data not shown.) Sixty percent of hospitals carried out all 5 types of quality projects listed in the survey over the 3-year period while 33% of hospitals were involved in 3 to 4 quality projects.</p>
<p>Rural hospitals frequently worked in partnership with other organizations to carry out quality improvement activities. Approximately 92% of nurse executives reported that their hospital participated in at least 1 ongoing quality improvement partnership, and 44% of nurse executives reported their hospitals participated in 4 or more such partnerships (data not shown). The most common collaborating group was the state hospital association (71%), followed by the state quality improvement organization (59%), state department of health (53%), other hospitals in their system (45%), rural health network (42%), state office of rural health (33%), foundations, institutes, or associations (30%), and, last, grant awarding organizations (18%).</p>
<p>The authors examined Safety Culture, Resources, Barriers, and Nurse Leader Engagement overall and then by hospital and nurse executive characteristics. The mean percent of less favorable responses for each domain and several additional measures are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1062860612451851">Table 2</xref>. Adequacy of Resources for quality was the greatest challenge, with nurse executives indicating almost half of the resources listed in the survey were minimally adequate or not adequate. On average, nurse executives felt that 29% of Barriers believed to slow or derail quality improvement efforts existed to a moderate or major extent. When asked about the frequency of Nurse Leader Engagement in quality-related activities, nurse executives reported performing 25% of these behaviors several times per year or less. Ratings of Safety Culture tended to be favorable, with nurse executives disagreeing or strongly disagreeing with only 8% of statements indicative of a strong quality culture.</p>

<p>Nurse executive perceptions about their hospitals’ Safety Culture were moderately correlated with Resources for quality improvement (<italic>r</italic> = .29, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01) and Barriers to quality (<italic>r</italic> = .33, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01) but not with Nurse Leader Engagement in quality improvement activities (<italic>r</italic> = .10, <italic>P</italic> = .12).</p>
<p>Nurse executives’ perceptions about their hospital’s Safety Culture did not differ significantly by rural location nor did Barriers to quality improvement. Resources for quality improvement were viewed as a greater problem by nurse executives working in isolated rural areas and small rural towns compared with large rural cities, but the differences were not statistically significant. Nurses working in isolated rural areas and small rural towns carried out activities supporting quality improvement less frequently than nurse executives located in large rural cities (28% vs 18%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Other than rural location, no other nurse executive characteristics or hospital characteristics, including bed size, were significantly associated with Safety Culture, Barriers, Resources, or Nurse Leader Engagement.</p>
<p>When specific types of Resources for quality improvement were examined, a few common trouble areas were found that often were rated as minimally adequate or not adequate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1062860612451851">Figure 1</xref>). Sixty-seven percent of nurse executives rated ease of generating quality reports as inadequate, and more than half rated access to data systems for report generation as inadequate. Other resources were less commonly cited as inadequate.</p>

<p>Barriers to quality improvement were not quite as problematic as resource availability but, nevertheless, were viewed as substantial by many nurse executives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1062860612451851">Figure 2</xref>). Physician resistance to changes developed through quality improvement initiatives was rated as a moderate to major barrier by 49% of nurse executives, while staff resistance was not quite as common. Data again appeared to be a problem with insufficient staff expertise to analyze data and prepare reports and resources to collect data rated as moderate to major obstacles.</p>

<p>Nurse executives were asked about the frequency with which they performed Nurse Leader Engagement activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1062860612451851">Figure 3</xref>). Almost 40% of nurse executives reported making patient safety rounds several times per year or less; almost one third followed up on patient safety quality opportunities and concerns brought up by patient care staff just as infrequently. Less than 20% of nurse executives infrequently discussed patient safety or quality performance targets with staff. When asked about discussing the progress of quality improvement and safety initiatives with senior hospital executives, less than one quarter of nurse executives reported doing so several times per year or less; approximately one third infrequently had similar discussions with the hospital board of directors. Nurse executives working in more rural areas were significantly less likely to discuss quality improvement progress with senior management and the boards of directors than those located in large rural city hospitals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1062860612451851">Table 2</xref>).

<p>Finally, a few items were not included in domains because of low correlation with other items but are relevant to the study. Almost half of nurse executives agreed that patient safety- or quality-related mistakes were considered in nursing staff performance reviews (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1062860612451851">Table 2</xref>). Only 14% of executives felt that the information available on patient safety and quality improvement did not fit their hospitals, but this was a more frequent problem for nurse executives working in isolated rural areas. Also, one quarter of nurse executives reported that there were few opportunities to collaborate with other hospitals similar to their own on quality improvement. When nurse executives were asked about access to information on quality improvement, 86% agreed they personally had frequent opportunities to stay current on quality improvement but 29% believed they lacked the time to keep current (not shown).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Nurse executives can play a central role in promoting patient safety and quality improvement by routinely focusing on the quality of patient care in their interactions with hospital leadership and staff. In our study, nurse executives generally viewed their hospital’s safety culture as strong, yet not all rural nurse executives took advantage of their position to further quality improvement.</p>
<p>Although rural hospitals are conducting safety and quality improvement initiatives, for a portion of rural hospitals, the resource infrastructure needed to carry out these projects lacks key pieces and barriers to quality improvement exist. Information systems and personnel trained in data extraction, collection, analysis, and reporting are all needs identified by nurse executives. Additional staff training—including approaches to reducing staff and physician resistance to changes—is desired by many rural nurse executives. Isolated rural area hospitals and small rural town hospitals are in greatest need of support to break down barriers to quality improvement, improve resource availability, and educate nurse executives about how they can integrate quality improvement leadership into their daily activities.</p>
<p>Our findings raise the concern that although a number of rural hospitals seem to have the infrastructure and nurse executive leadership to meet the demands for improving quality and patient safety, a segment of rural hospitals may be left behind. The vast majority of hospitals partnered with outside organizations on safety and quality improvement initiatives and many had ongoing relationships with 4 or more groups within their state. The widespread participation of rural hospitals in quality collaborations may reflect the resources for quality made available through federal funding—for example, the Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Program—to strengthen the state rural health care infrastructure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1062860612451851">11</xref></sup> Despite the opportunities for quality improvement partnerships, a substantial number of nurse executives—particularly those in more rural locations—felt that the collaborations did not include hospitals similar to their own. Rural hospitals that are struggling with resource constraints and barriers to quality may require more tailored support than is typically provided in a quality improvement learning collaborative, as well as opportunities to learn from similar hospitals that have successfully overcome limitations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1062860612451851">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1062860612451851"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1062860612451851"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1062860612451851">15</xref></sup> Training programs should account for the difficulty of relieving staff from bedside duties and staff turnover by making training accessible (eg, on-site, remote learning) and condensed, with opportunities to readily apply new knowledge on the job. Training on measurement and data analysis should consider the smaller scale of the rural setting,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1062860612451851">16</xref></sup> the low frequency of many patient safety events, and ways to simplify data extraction, collection, and analysis in a setting in which staff must perform multiple functions.</p>
<p>As part of their leadership role, nurse leaders should carefully weigh how much their hospitals can take on and do well. Many of the hospitals in our survey had undertaken all 5 of the nursing care-related quality projects over 2 years. It is possible that the growing expectations for quality improvement by outside groups are leading to the splintering of scarce resources within rural hospitals and resulting in less progress than if a more focused approach to quality improvement were followed.</p>
<p>Several limitations should be considered when interpreting our findings. The data used in this study were self-reported; response bias may explain the consistently positive ratings by nurse executives of their hospital’s safety culture. Generalization to all rural hospitals should be made with some caution because there was greater representation of nurse executives working in rural hospitals with smaller bed size. However, the study does provide data from a broad cross-section of rural hospitals across the country.</p>
<p>A multipronged approach to support rural hospitals that are struggling with building quality improvement capacity is critical to ensuring that these hospitals can successfully participate in value-based compensation programs and have an equal opportunity to improve performance. Support should be given to allow rural hospitals to focus scarce resources on a select number of quality improvement initiatives, with plans to expand to new areas over time as internal capabilities grow. Training opportunities should be tailored to the rural hospital setting and target all levels of the organization. Rural nurse executives may benefit from learning new approaches to leveraging their position and furthering quality improvement through their communication and actions. Resistance to change by physicians and nursing staff must be addressed using approaches such as engaging clinical champions. Approaches for overcoming data-related resource constraints are needed and may include providing external support for data extraction, analysis, and reporting or developing simple and efficient methods of data management tailored to the rural hospital context that could be undertaken by hospital staff.</p>
