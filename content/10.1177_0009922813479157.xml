<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Eating disorders (ED) are becoming increasingly prevalent, affecting up to 3% of the population, particularly, “at-risk” demographics, such as adolescent females and athletes. Identification of ED can be difficult and labor intensive as symptoms may manifest in numerous organ systems, and patients frequently attempt to hide their disordered eating.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922813479157">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922813479157">2</xref></sup> Additionally, many patients who suffer from ED do not neatly fit into diagnostic criteria for lack of specific symptoms (eg, loss of at least 3 menstrual cycles),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922813479157">3</xref></sup> such that most eating disorder patients are classified as “Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified,” further complicating diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922813479157">4</xref></sup> Moreover, screening tools and questionnaires have provided variable results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922813479157">5</xref></sup> Although ED are highly treatable and have high rates of recovery, early diagnosis is critical and associated with improved prognosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922813479157">6</xref></sup> Delay in treatment of ED can increase the risk of serious medical complications, including osteopenia, brain atrophy, and sudden cardiac death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922813479157">7</xref></sup>; in fact, mortality rates for ED are higher than any other psychiatric conditions, reaching 18% when left untreated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922813479157">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922813479157">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Early diagnosis is often difficult because patients report waiting nearly 5 years before seeking treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922813479157">9</xref></sup> Moreover, studies suggest that physicians have a low index of suspicion of ED when these patients do present for evaluation, resulting in underdiagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922813479157">10</xref></sup> Considering prevalence rates, a normal practice would be expected to treat approximately 50 ED patients. However, 30% of physicians report never having diagnosed an eating disorder, whereas a staggering 60% of surveyed physicians reported treating no bulimic patients at the time of the study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922813479157">11</xref></sup> Furthermore, a study by Bryant-Waugh et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922813479157">12</xref></sup> in which surveys containing 2 clinical vignettes of teenage ED patients were sent to pediatricians and adult primary care physicians (PCPs), revealed that whereas 31% of pediatricians listed an ED as a diagnostic possibility, only 2% of PCPs suspected ED.</p>
<p>It has been reported that a majority of mental health services are provided in the primary care setting,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922813479157">13</xref></sup> including the diagnosis and treatment of ED.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922813479157">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922813479157">14</xref></sup> Despite this, and the fact that early diagnosis and treatment are essential, PCPs report being ill-equipped to diagnose and manage these patients. Surveys of practicing physicians have suggested clear deficits in knowledge of the symptoms and how the disease manifests physically.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922813479157">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922813479157">15</xref></sup> Older reports demonstrate that approximately 70% of physicians representing various specialties described their training in ED as inadequate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922813479157">16</xref></sup> More recently, physicians have continued to express the need for more training and have admitted lack of experience and expertise in the diagnosis and management of ED, though they do report greater comfort in diagnosing ED than managing the disorder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922813479157">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922813479157">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Residency training is an ideal arena for physicians to develop skills necessary for diagnosing and treating ED. Williams and Leichner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922813479157">18</xref></sup> showed that a majority of Canadian psychiatry residents were interested in working with patients with ED and indicated that ED training was important. However, a majority of these residents indicated that they considered their training in ED to be inadequate; 82% of senior residents surveyed reported no clinical experience in the treatment of ED during their residency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922813479157">18</xref></sup> To the authors’ knowledge, there has been no report investigating primary care residents’ attitudes about ED and their comfort with diagnosing and treating ED. The purpose of this study was to investigate the training that residents in primary care specialties receive in this area, the factors affecting their comfort with diagnosing and treating ED, and their interest in ED. The effects of specialty and exposure to training in an ED program were also assessed.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Institutional review board approval was obtained prior to commencement of this study. A 22-question Internet survey developed for this study was designed to assess resident training in, and attitudes about, ED. Questions were presented in multiple choice format using Likert-type scale responses.</p>
<p>E-mail addresses for U.S. family medicine, internal medicine, and pediatrics and medicine–pediatrics residency programs were obtained from American College of Graduate Medical Education, American Board of Pediatrics, and American Academy of Family Practice Web sites, and from the Web sites of the respective residency programs. A description of the study and a request to distribute the survey to residents were sent by e-mail to residency programs with accessible e-mail addresses. Program directors were asked to forward the e-mail, which contained the survey Internet link, to postgraduate year (PGY)-3 family medicine (FM), PGY-3 internal medicine (IM), and PGY-3 pediatrics and PGY-4 medicine-pediatrics (Peds) residents. Medicine–pediatrics residency programs were combined with pediatrics programs in this study because of their exposure to a pediatrics curriculum. A reminder message was sent 3 weeks after the initial message was sent.</p>
<p>Response rate was estimated by obtaining the number of PGY-3 and PGY-4 residents in training programs during the 2007-2008 academic year from the American College of Graduate Medical Education and American Academy of Family Practice Web sites. Residency programs not reporting the number of PGY-3 and PGY-4 residents were contacted by e-mail to obtain this information. Programs that did not respond to requests for information were excluded from response rate calculations.</p>
<sec id="section6-0009922813479157">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Because of the sampling technique used in this study, possible self-selection bias prevents direct estimation of population proportions but does not affect the estimation of associations between variables.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922813479157">19</xref></sup> As such, our analysis focused on evaluating the strength and direction of the association between various components of residency training programs and comfort in diagnosing ED, comfort in treating ED, and interest in ED to circumvent possible self-selection bias, as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922813479157">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Chi-square tests and Fisher’s exact tests, where appropriate, were used to compare equivalence of various proportions. Logistic regression was used to assess the nature and degrees of association between various elements of residency programs and the outcomes of interest (comfort in diagnosing or treating ED and interest in ED). The results of the logistic regression models are summarized in the tables of odds ratios.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Residency programs without accessible e-mail addresses and programs declining participation were excluded. It was assumed that all program directors forwarded the request to participate to residents. Therefore, 460 FM, 309 IM, and 245 Peds residency programs were included, with 11 362 residents potentially receiving the request to participate. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922813479157">Table 1</xref> presents the distribution by specialty of residency programs included. Overall, 617 responses were received (208 FM, 157 IM, and 246 Peds), yielding a 5.4% response rate. Among the 617 respondents, 77 were excluded from the final analysis because of missing values for one or more fields.</p>

<p>The following variables were dichotomized in preparation for fitting a logistic model: respondent’s residency specialty, whether the residency program had faculty with an interest in ED, whether the residency program had an ED program, the number of times a resident treated ED outpatients, the number of times a resident treated teenagers with ED, the resident’s comfort level in diagnosing ED, the resident’s comfort in treating ED, and the resident’s level of interest in ED (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0009922813479157">Table 2</xref>). A cross-tabulation of the dichotomized variables as a function of the outcomes of interest (interest in ED, comfort diagnosing ED, and comfort treating ED) is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0009922813479157">Table 3</xref>. Responses were dichotomized such that the responses “Somewhat Comfortable,” “Comfortable,” and “Very Comfortable” were grouped into the “comfortable” category, whereas “Not Comfortable” and “Not Sure” responses were grouped into the “not comfortable” category. Base odds and the odds for residents who satisfied all the following conditions: were male, had a Peds specialty (pediatrics or medicine–pediatrics combined), were in a program that did not have an ED program, were in a program that did not have faculty interested in ED, did not treat any ED outpatients, and did not treat any teenagers with unexplained weight loss.</p>

Furthermore, those residents who reported having previously treated teenagers with unexplained weight loss also reported a greater degree of comfort in diagnosing ED (OR = 1.64; CI = 0.72-1.75; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05).</p>

<p>A second logistic regression model was used to identify the factors that had a significant association with comfort in treating patients with ED. Our results suggest that having seen ED patients in an outpatient setting (OR = 1.99; CI = 1.27-3.12; <italic>P</italic> = .003), and having treated teenagers with unexplained weight loss during residency training (OR = 2.01; CI = 1.33-3.03; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) was associated with higher odds of being comfortable treating patients with ED (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0009922813479157">Table 5</xref>). Surprisingly, neither being in a residency program with an ED program associated with the hospital, nor having a faculty member with interest or training in ED was associated with residents’ reported comfort in treating patients with ED.</p>

<p>Finally, a third logistic regression was used to model the association between interest in ED and the same set of explanatory variables used in the previous 2 regression models. Being female and having treated patients with ED during residency training were both associated with higher odds of having an interest in ED, as was being in a specialty other than pediatrics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0009922813479157">Table 6</xref>).</p>

<p>Our results indicate that whereas residents in a residency program with an ED program associated with the hospital and with faculty with interest in ED are more comfortable in diagnosing ED in their patients, only those who actually treated ED outpatients or treated teenagers with unexplained weight loss were more comfortable in treating ED. Those respondents who were female and treated patients with unexplained weight loss were more likely to report interest in ED.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>It is important that PCPs be comfortable with diagnosing ED because of the increasing prevalence and associated morbidity and mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922813479157">20</xref></sup> PCPs have the greatest opportunity to make the diagnosis, as it has been shown that ED patients visit their PCP more often than other patients in the 5 years before diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922813479157">21</xref></sup> Making the diagnosis of ED is difficult, as laboratory screens will not indicate the disorder, and patients with ED are frequently in denial of their illness and may attempt to conceal their disorder. Based on the <italic>Eating Attitude Test</italic> scores, 39% of patients in an ED program were in denial of their disorder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922813479157">22</xref></sup> Currently, most physicians admit that they do not screen patients for ED until medically indicated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922813479157">17</xref></sup> A high level of vigilance, which can be fostered by adequate training during residency, is ideal.</p>
<p>Perhaps more troubling than physicians’ admission that lack of training and education contribute to their inability to diagnose ED is the fact that most PCPs are ill-equipped to manage the disease, especially when one considers that 50% of mental health services are provided in the primary care setting and 59% of ED patients receive treatment from their general practitioner alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922813479157">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922813479157">14</xref></sup> Qualitative studies of physicians’ experience with diagnosing and treating ED suggest that PCPs may not screen for ED, in part because they feel unable to treat the patient once the diagnosis is made.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922813479157">6</xref></sup> Many physicians do not follow up with patients after diagnosing an ED, though those with more knowledge about the disorder have been shown to be more likely to do so.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922813479157">15</xref></sup> Many of the practitioners surveyed admit that they refer out most, if not all, aspects of care for ED patients, whereas only 3% report that they treat all aspects themselves.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922813479157">11</xref></sup> Although most ED patients seek treatment from their PCP, approximately 68% considered their general practitioner to be unhelpful, citing lack of knowledge, empathy, and referral delays as contributors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922813479157">9</xref></sup> Treatment is estimated to be delayed by 7.4 months, on average, while patients wait for referrals from the primary care physician.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922813479157">23</xref></sup> PCPs should serve as care coordinators once the diagnosis is made; research indicates that in order for screening to be effective, a protocol should be in place for those who screen positive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922813479157">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>An intensive ED training curriculum, including lectures, case examples, and video presentations, has been shown to increase the frequency with which primary care social workers screen their clients for ED.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922813479157">20</xref></sup> Researchers have aimed to investigate whether programs designed to increase clinical competence in ED can successfully improve knowledge, skills, and confidence in ED treatment among participants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922813479157">24</xref></sup> A 2-year educational program for health care workers involved in the care of ED patients was shown to increase participants’ comfort with managing these patients and improved participants’ attitudes about ED.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0009922813479157">25</xref></sup> Additionally, ED educational programs to improve PCP detection and prevention of ED have been described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0009922813479157">26</xref></sup> Although many studies have focused on improving practicing physicians’ competence with respect to ED, it is necessary to target PCPs while in residency training programs. To date, no study has investigated the effects of a dedicated ED curriculum during residency training on primary care residents’ comfort in diagnosing or treating ED and residents’ interest in ED.</p>
<p>Existing literature suggests that physicians rate their clinical training as unsatisfactory, whereas residents agree that diagnosis and management of ED training should be mandatory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922813479157">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922813479157">18</xref></sup> Residents surveyed in previous studies have voiced a desire for more hands-on training; active learning in a clinical setting has been shown to be superior to passive classroom lectures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0009922813479157">27</xref></sup> In our study, residents who were exposed to an ED program in their hospital, teenagers with unexplained weight loss, or a faculty member with interest and/or training in ED expressed greater comfort with diagnosing ED than those residents who did not have exposure to these factors. Likewise, residents who were exposed to ED patients in the outpatient setting and to teens with unexplained weight loss were more likely to report greater comfort treating patients with ED than those residents who were not. Finally, female residents, residents who treated patients with ED, and residents from a primary care specialty other than Peds were more likely to express an interest in ED.</p>
<p>Residency programs can ensure that future PCPs have adequate training in detecting and treating ED. Based on the findings of this study, several educational factors affect resident comfort with diagnosing and treating ED. These factors include the presence of faculty interested in ED, the presence of an ED recovery program accessible to the hospital, exposure to teenagers with unexplained weight loss, and exposure to ED outpatients. Many residency programs are associated with hospitals having ED recovery programs, in which residents have high levels of exposure to patients with ED. Hospitals without these programs can still train their residents well in the diagnosis and medical management of ED. First, it is important that faculty who are comfortable with the topic participate in the education of residents. Early exposure to ED topics allows residents to consider ED in their differential diagnoses when examining patients with unexplained weight loss or low body mass index. Second, if ED patients are not commonly seen in the training hospital, residents can spend time at an ED recovery program during rotations, such as psychiatry, behavioral medicine, or adolescent medicine. Although a brief immersion experience may not be as beneficial as involvement with continuity care of ED patients, it can serve to lower physician threshold for consideration of ED when seeing patients with weight loss or low body mass index.</p>
<p>Several limitations exist in this study. First, Although a large number of survey responses was received, only a small sample of the total residents in primary care training programs across the country are represented. Program directors were contacted by e-mail and were asked to forward requests to their graduating residents, so there was no way of determining whether residents actually received the survey. If all 11 362 primary care residents received the survey, the response rate was 5.4%. Furthermore, there is no way of determining how many responses came from individual residency programs. It is possible that residents from programs with considerable training in ED were more likely to respond to the survey than residents from programs with less training. It is also possible that graduating residents may be overconfident in their diagnostic abilities because they felt well-trained, a finding known as the “Lake Wobegon” effect in social psychology literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922813479157">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0009922813479157">28</xref></sup> This could affect how residents responded when asked about comfort in diagnosing and treating patients with ED. Therefore, responses received to the survey may not be representative of primary care residents as a whole, and it may not be possible to generalize conclusions to primary care residency training as a whole. However, we believe that within the pool of responses we received, the information obtained from respondents about factors affecting their interest in ED and comfort in diagnosing and treating patients with ED is valuable.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it is important that PCPs be comfortable with identifying patients with ED to prevent long-term complications and even death. Primary care residencies serve important roles in teaching future physicians about ED. The presence of lectures, faculty interested in ED, an ED recovery program, and inpatient and outpatient exposure to ED patients positively affect residents’ comfort with diagnosing and treating ED. Although not all residency programs can include all these elements in their curricula, inclusion of 1 or 2 may enhance resident education about ED. Future studies may evaluate the effects of an ED curriculum on primary care residents’ comfort with diagnosing and treating ED, as well as the effect on these physicians’ practices after residency.</p>
