               <title>Purpose</title>
               <p>To assess and compare semi-quantitative parameters of myocardial infarct (MI) in the subacute and chronic phase, and to correlate these parameters with qualitative enhancement analysis.</p>

               <p>Perfusion MRI at rest and DE-MRI were performed in 63 patients with anterior wall MI at 2–3 weeks after revascularization and repeated after 6 months. Descriptive enhancement parameters of contrast arrival time, initial upslope, enhancement at normal tissue peak (TTP<sub>n</sub>) and wash-out slope, and kinetic tissue parameters rBF, <italic>K</italic>

                  <sub>e</sub> were calculated. Subacute infarct tissue was compared to normal myocardium and chronic infarct tissue. Patients were stratified at baseline according to a qualitative grading of hypoenhancement based on first-pass enhancement and presence of microvascular obstruction (MO) at perfusion MRI and on persistent MO at DE-MRI. The qualitative grade was correlated to semi-quantitative perfusion MRI parameters.</p>

               <title>Conclusion</title>
               <p>Perfusion is decreased in subacute reperfused infarct tissue compared to normal tissue. <italic>K</italic>
                  <sup>trans</sup> is not decreased, consistent with increased surface area of the vascular bed of the subacute infarct. Infarct tissue <italic>v</italic>
                  <sub>e</sub> is increased, and decreases with scarring. The presence of persistent MO correlates to more pronounced perfusion reduction and results in delayed contrast arrival, indicating microvascular collateral circulation.</p>

         <p>Contrast-enhanced perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is regularly utilized for the qualitative detection of reversible ischemia; shown as a region of first pass hypoenhancement at stress, not present at rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C1">1</xref>). After acute myocardial infarction (MI), regions of hypoenhancement may be seen at the infarct core after the first pass contrast-enhancing phase, indicating microvascular obstruction (MO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C4">4</xref>). MO represents a zone of no-reflow in more severely damaged tissue after prolonged ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C5">5</xref>) and reperfusion and is considered an important prognostic factor after acute MI. MO is shown to increase during the first 48 h after reperfusion, and may be related to tissue hemorrhage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C6">6</xref>).</p>
         <p>Assessment of hemodynamic parameters from MRI is based on measurement of dynamic signal intensity changes during first pass and wash-out after contrast agent injection. Several parameters with varying terms have been introduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C7">7</xref>). A simplified hierarchical scheme of some parameters is provided in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="AR-475605F1">1</xref>. Descriptive enhancement parameters are measured directly from the enhancement curve obtained during image acquisition. Mathematical deconvolution of the tissue response curve with the arterial input function (AIF) obtained in the left ventricular (LV) lumen, enables estimation of kinetic parameters describing the transfer constant of contrast agent extravasation (<italic>K</italic>
            <sup>trans</sup>) and the rate constant for vascular return (<italic>k</italic>
            <sub>ep</sub>). <italic>K</italic>
            <sup>trans</sup> is generally dependent on tissue characteristics like tissue flow (F) and the product of permeability and surface area of the vascular bed (PS product) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C8">8</xref>). In addition, tissue and vascular characteristics like the extravascular, extracellular volume fraction (<italic>v</italic>
            <sub>e</sub>) and the intravascular volume fraction (<italic>v</italic>
            <sub>p</sub>) are estimated. The parameter <italic>v</italic>
            <sub>e</sub> reflects the tissue distribution volume fraction (leakage space) of the contrast agent. An estimate for F (rBF) can be directly measured from the tissue residue function derived from AIF deconvolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C11">11</xref>). Myocardial perfusion MRI studies have indicated reduced flow in MI tissue, assessed through a variety of different perfusion parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C15">15</xref>). However, there are few reports on the relation between these parameters, or between semi-quantitative analyses and visual reading of perfusion MRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C17">17</xref>).

         <p>The data presented in this study are based on the Autologous Stem-Cell Transplantation in Acute Myocardial Infarction study (ASTAMI) in which the primary aim was to investigate the effects on LV function of intracoronary injection of autologous mononuclear bone marrow cells (mBMC) after reperfused MI. There were no short- or long-term effects on cardiac function of mBMC treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C21">21</xref>). The MRI protocol of the study included perfusion imaging at rest and delayed contrast-enhanced MRI (DE-MRI). Perfusion MRI was in this respect the combined study of first-pass perfusion, leakage phase with contrast agent extraction, and wash-out.</p>
         <p>In the present study we assessed comprehensive analyses of a range of semi-quantitative descriptive enhancement and kinetic tissue parameters in MI tissue and normal myocardium, in addition to qualitative tissue analyses. The aims were to follow the semi-quantitative parameters of infarct tissue longitudinally from subacute to chronic phase at 6 months after the infarct. Furthermore, we aimed to correlate these semi-quantitative measurements of subacute infarct tissue to qualitative enhancement analyses.</p>

            <p>Methods and techniques used in the ASTAMI trial have previously been reported in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C18">18</xref>). Briefly, 100 patients with acute left anterior descending artery MI treated with successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent implantation on the culprit lesion were randomized to either intracoronary injection of autologous mBMC or control with no sham injection 4–8 days after PCI. Baseline MRI was performed in a subacute phase 2–3 weeks after onset of symptoms and was repeated after 6 months. The study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the protocol was approved by the regional committee for research ethics. All patients gave written informed consent. MRI analyses were performed blinded to treatment allocation. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00199823.</p>

            <p>Perfusion and DE-MRI were acquired in the same session on 1.5 T systems (Magnetom Vision Plus or Magnetom Sonata, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) using a phased array body coil.</p>
            <p>Perfusion MRI was performed at rest with an inversion recovery fast low angle shot (FLASH) sequence with three short-axis slices standardized on the apical half of the LV. After sequence start, 0.05 mmol/kg gadopentetate dimeglumine (Magnevist, Bayer Schering Pharma AG, Berlin, Germany) was intravenously injected at a speed of 5.0 mL/s followed by saline infusion. The patient was instructed to hold his/her breath for as long as possible followed by quiet respiration. Midway in the study, the magnetic resonance unit was upgraded, and the perfusion sequence changed. Before upgrade, the flip angle was 8°, echo time (TE) 1.2 ms, and inversion time (TI) 300 ms. Spatial resolution was 1.17 × 1.17 mm and slice thickness was 10 mm. Three slices were scanned every other heart beat, with a total of 60 stacks. After upgrade, the flip angle was 15°, TE 0.96 ms, and TI 100 ms. Spatial resolution varied within the range 1.36–1.52 × 1.36–1.52 mm due to individual field of view (FOV) adjustment, and slice thickness was 8 mm. A total of 120 stacks were scanned with three slices every heart beat.</p>
            <p>DE-MRI images were obtained in multiple short-axis projections covering the LV with a breath-hold inversion recovery turbo gradient echo sequence 10–20 min after additional intravenous injection to a total of 0.2 mmol/kg gadopentetate dimeglumine, with a slice thickness of 7 or 8 mm, an increment of 10 mm, and in-plane spatial resolution of 1.17 × 1.17 to 1.50 mm. Myocardial borders and late enhancing areas were manually delineated using a standard PACS workstation (PACS IDS5 11.4, Sectra Imtec AB, Linköping, Sweden) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C23">23</xref>). Relative MI volumes were obtained globally (LV infarct size), and for the infarct segment analyzed for perfusion in each patient (segmental infarct size), according to the 17 segment model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C24">24</xref>). Subendocardial dark areas centrally within the MI were classified as areas of persistent MO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C25">25</xref>).</p>

            <title>Perfusion MRI analysis</title>
            <p>Perfusion MRI analysis was performed on an image slice corresponding to a DE-MRI slice with both a clearly defined infarct area and normal myocardium. Two oval regions of interest (ROI) of identical size and configuration were placed for intensity measurement on delayed enhancing and normal myocardium, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="AR-475605F2">2</xref>). Long and short axes of the ROI were 15 × 30 pixels corresponding to an area of 41.2 mm<sup>2</sup> before upgrade and 12 × 24 to 27 pixels corresponding to a mean area of 38.6 mm<sup>2</sup> after upgrade. The long axes varied due to different in-plane resolution after FOV adjustment. Particular attention was paid to placing the ROIs on the similar two regions of myocardial tissue on the similar slice at the two time points in each patient. A third, circular ROI with diameter equal to the tissue ROI long axis was placed centrally in the LV lumen to measure the AIF. When necessary, the ROIs were manually repositioned from frame to frame in order to follow respiratory movements.

            <p>Relative intensity curves were generated by calculating percent increase in signal intensity relative to precontrast baseline. Simultaneously, the depth-dependent signal attenuation variation was corrected. The relative enhancement was assumed to be proportional to contrast agent concentration. This is a plausible assumption due to very short TE (minimal T2* effects) and short TI (linear 1/T1 signal dependence).</p>
            <p>The relative enhancement parameters contrast arrival time, initial upslope, peak enhancement, and time to peak enhancement (TTP) were directly calculated from the resulting time intensity curves (TICs). Infarct tissue enhancement at normal tissue peak enhancement (TTP<sub>n</sub>) was manually read from the curves. The wash-out slope was calculated by linear regression analysis of the wash-out phase of the TICs. The wash-out phase was defined from the frame of the LV blood volume second pass peak intensity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="AR-475605F3">3</xref>) to the last perfusion sequence frame.

            <p>Qualitative perfusion analysis was performed with visual correlation to the corresponding DE slice. Stable hypoenhancement of the infarct zone during first pass perfusion was noted. Presence of MO was based on a stable or constant hypoenhancement zone within the MI on perfusion images 1–2 min after contrast agent injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C30">30</xref>). Combined with information from DE-MRI analysis the patients were stratified to one of four groups: 1, No hypoenhancement; 2, First pass hypoenhancement; 3, MO (perfusion MRI); 4, Persistent MO (DE-MRI) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="AR-475605F5">5</xref>). The classification was performed by two independent observers, and decided by consent when disagreement occurred. All patients in group 4 also had MO at perfusion MRI, and all patients in groups 3 and 4 also had a first pass hypoenhancement zone.

            <p>Continuous data are presented as mean ± standard deviation. All variables for baseline and end-point analyses approximated a normal distribution. Paired samples t-tests were performed for the comparison between normal myocardium and infarct tissue at baseline and for infarct intra-group changes. Kruskal-Wallis test was performed to assess differences across the four enhancement groups. If difference was significant, follow up Mann-Whitney U test was performed for difference between pairs of groups with Bonferroni adjustment of the alpha level to 0.008. Chi-square test was performed between the four enhancement groups for categorical variables. Correlation was assessed with linear regression analyses with treatment randomization and perfusion method before or after upgrade as covariates. For comparisons between treatment groups, two-sample t-tests were performed for continuous data; categorical variables were analyzed with the chi-square test. Treatment group development between baseline and 6 months was assessed by analysis of co-variance, with the baseline values used as a co-variate. PASW Statistics 18.0.3 software (IBM Corporation, New York, NY, USA) was used. Tests were two-sided, and <italic>P</italic> values &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p>

            <p>There were 87 complete pairs of MR examinations for the assessment of LV infarct size and tissue perfusion. Dynamic range of the perfusion sequences changed with hardware and software upgrade, thus 63 patients with paired examinations either before (<italic>n</italic> = 39) or after upgrade (<italic>n</italic> = 24) were included in the present study. Before upgrade the perfusion sequence was unstable and aborted early after AIF second pass peak during the run of six patients at baseline and three patients at 6 months. In these patients only first-pass descriptive enhancement parameters were measured. At baseline three additional examinations were lost for qualitative first pass enhancement and MO assessment due to image noise of the perfusion sequence. One patient refused to receive the final contrast agent injection at 6 months and was excluded from DE-MRI analysis. Fifty-four patients were included in all analyses.</p>

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>In the present study 63 patients with reperfused anterior wall MI were examined with contrast-enhanced perfusion MRI subacutely (2–3 weeks post MI) and 6 months later. Comprehensive kinetic analyses revealed substantial hemodynamic differences between infarct tissue and normal tissue at both time points. By qualitative analyses the patients could be grouped into four enhancement groups with different hemodynamic characteristics and infarct size. The spectrum of the chosen parameters provided more detailed information on the microvascular changes of the damaged myocardium than that obtained by visual observation of tissue intensity changes.</p>
         <p>Intensity upslope and tissue enhancement at TTP<sub>n</sub> were lower in infarct tissue subacutely and at 6 months, confirming findings from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C16">16</xref>). As illustrated in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="AR-475605F1">1</xref>, first pass tissue intensity and upslope reflect combined tissue characteristics, being dependent on absolute flow and contrast agent extravasation. In addition, these parameters have an inherent weakness, potentially reflecting general hemodynamics and infusion procedure variations due to direct measurement from the TICs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C31">31</xref>). In the present study, such variations were minimized with hemodynamically stable patients and standardized infusion procedures. We consider the changes of first pass descriptive enhancement measurements of infarct tissue to relate to an absolute reduction of blood flow, confirmed by reduced rBF in infarct tissue. However, the changes were not related to contrast agent volume transfer as expressed by the kinetic parameter <italic>K</italic>
            <sup>trans</sup>.</p>
         <p>There were no significant differences of <italic>K</italic>
            <sup>trans</sup> in infarct tissue compared to normal tissue at baseline. This intriguing finding was in contrast to the sharply demarcated drop of the capillary transfer constant <italic>K</italic>
            <sub>i</sub> in the infarct zone of seven patients studied by Nielsen <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C15">15</xref>). <italic>K</italic>
            <sub>i</sub> is strongly related to <italic>K</italic>
            <sup>trans</sup> given by the equation <italic>K</italic>
            <sup>trans</sup> = <italic>K</italic>
            <sub>i</sub>·ρ·(1-Hct) where ρ is myocardial tissue density and Hct is the hematocrit. Two important differences in study design exist. In the study of Nielsen <italic>et al</italic>., perfusion MRI was performed acutely, ≤12 h from symptom onset, and most patients did not receive reperfusion therapy before the perfusion sequence. After successful reperfusion of one patient, the <italic>K</italic>
            <sub>i</sub> drop was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C15">15</xref>). In the present study, all patients received successful revascularization, and baseline perfusion MRI was performed at 19 ± 5 days after the acute event. During this time span vascular and fibroblast proliferation is profound in infarct tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C32">32</xref>).</p>
         <p>
            <italic>K</italic>
            <sup>trans</sup> is dependent on flow (F) and the product of permeability and surface area of the vascular bed (PS product). Independent estimation of F is required in order to correctly interpret observed measurements of <italic>K</italic>
            <sup>trans</sup>. In two studies, direct comparison between rest and stress of ischemic myocardium has indicated that the transfer constant is more perfusion than PS-product limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C34">34</xref>). However, another study revealed flow-dependent variations of both the extraction fraction (E) and the PS-product of Gd-DTPA in healthy myocardium, derived from a non-linear relationship between <italic>K</italic>
            <sup>trans</sup> and F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C35">35</xref>). In the present study, the diseased myocardium was examined in the subacute phase post MI, when vascular proliferation is profound. Perfusion was reduced, without significant change of <italic>K</italic>
            <sup>trans</sup>, indicating that the PS product was increased. In this respect, the contrast agent gadopentetate dimeglumine is a relatively small molecule of ∼550 Dalton, and endothelial permeability is not thought to be restricted in peripheral tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C36">36</xref>). Thus, an increased surface area of the vascular bed was indirectly indicated in subacute MI tissue. This finding emphasizes the need for further studies on the complex microvascular changes over time in myocardial infarct tissue.</p>
         <p>The higher wash-out slope in infarct tissue again reflects a combination of tissue characteristics being dependent on <italic>k</italic>
            <sub>ep</sub>, <italic>v</italic>
            <sub>e</sub>, and plasma clearance of the contrast agent. The relative contribution of these factors is thought to be tissue dependent. The rate constant <italic>k</italic>
            <sub>ep</sub> is related to <italic>K</italic>
            <sup>trans</sup> and <italic>v</italic>
            <sub>e</sub>. <italic>K</italic>
            <sup>trans</sup> was stable, and the observed reduction of <italic>k</italic>
            <sub>ep</sub> in infarct tissue could thus be a result of an increased <italic>v</italic>
            <sub>e</sub>. Increase of <italic>v</italic>
            <sub>e</sub> and the related decrease of <italic>k</italic>
            <sub>ep</sub> both contribute to the increase of the wash-out slope in infarct tissue, in turn pointing towards the contrast agent accumulation causing shortened T1 in non-viable myocardial tissue in equilibrium phase.</p>
         <p>It is well known that the distribution volume of an extracellular agent, <italic>v</italic>
            <sub>e</sub>, increases immediately in acute MI tissue due to cell membrane disintegration, and remains higher than normal myocardium because of intercellular edema and infiltration of inflammatory tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C37">37</xref>). In the chronic phase, scar tissue is formed with collagen deposition. In the present study <italic>v</italic>
            <sub>e</sub> was found to increase in infarct tissue at baseline, and after 6 months <italic>v</italic>
            <sub>e</sub> had decreased, but levels were still above normal tissue values. This is in accordance with findings from other studies, although performed through measurement of the tissue-blood partition coefficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C38">38</xref>). <italic>v</italic>
            <sub>e</sub> was the only parameter to be changed from the subacute phase to 6 months. Perfusion, as expressed by rBF, was still reduced in chronic infarct tissue in which scar tissue with possible permanent down-regulation of capillary density is formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C39">39</xref>).</p>
         <p>Infarct tissue of the persistent MO group was characterized with delayed contrast arrival, lower enhancement at TTP<sub>n</sub>, higher wash-out slope, and lower rBF, <italic>K</italic>
            <sup>trans</sup>, and <italic>k</italic>
            <sub>ep</sub>. Even though the oval ROIs did not perfectly match the endocardial persistent MO areas, this indicated an even more pronounced reduction of perfusion in the low intensity than in the late enhancing infarct tissue. This finding is in accordance with an earlier finding of reduced myocardial perfusion index (MPI) in myocardial infarct tissue with MO, where MPI is the initial infarct tissue upslope relative to the AIF upslope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C14">14</xref>). Delay of the contrast agent arrival is a marker of collateral-dependent tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C40">40</xref>). Even though vascular proliferation may be profound in infarct tissue in the subacute phase, the damage of the vascular bed of the no-reflow region is considered more severe, and local collateral circulation may result.</p>
         <p>Some limitations exist in the present study. First, the absolute quantification from kinetic analyses requires a known relationship between measured signal intensity increase and the corresponding change in T1 relaxation rate and contrast agent concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C7">7</xref>) and could not be performed. The parameters estimated from this study are relative and therefore not directly applicable to other studies. The dose injected for perfusion imaging was too high to have a linear relation between the signal intensity in the LV cavity and concentration of Gd. Perfusion is overestimated to some extent, and calculation of relative perfusion is prone to error. However, Gd dose was equal between the patients, and between the two time points for each patient. Thus, we believe the relative error to be balanced. Second, the change of parameter settings of the perfusion sequence before and after upgrade may have increased variability between patients. Third, the ROI was placed on the perfusion slice on infarct tissue as judged by DE-MRI. Enhancement variations could not be excluded, and the method is vulnerable to through-plane movements. Thus, partial volume effects were expected, and differences may have been masked. Fourth, T2 sequences were not included in the protocol. Correlation between the magnitude of tissue edema, myocardial hemorrhage, and perfusion parameters could not be explored in this study. T2 sequences are more relevant in the acute phase post MI. Fifth, the baseline examinations were performed later after the acute event than in earlier studies on the effect of MO and persistent MO, a fact which may preclude direct comparison of results. On the other hand, the persistence of MO at a later stage has been shown to be an even stronger predictor of adverse remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C3">3</xref>).</p>
         <p>In conclusion, descriptive enhancement parameters and semi-quantitative kinetic parameters of subacute and chronic infarct tissue demonstrated reduced perfusion and increased extravascular, extracellular volume fraction compared with normal myocardium. This was not associated with a decrease of <italic>K</italic>
            <sup>trans</sup>, suggesting an increase of the surface area of the vascular bed in the subacute phase. At 6 months infarct scar formation was accompanied by decrease of <italic>v</italic>
            <sub>e</sub>, but no additional perfusion change was found. Infarct tissue of individuals with persistent MO had even more pronounced perfusion reduction, and a delayed contrast arrival time suggested microvascular collateral circulation.</p>

               <p>Semi-quantitative contrast agent permeability analysis was performed using the extended Tofts model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C43">43</xref>). In short, the exchange of contrast agent between the intravascular and extravascular extracellular space (IVS, EES) can be expressed in terms of the two-compartment kinetic model

                  <sub>e</sub> were then obtained from linear least squares fitting after converting <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="AR-475605M1">Equation 1</xref> to a linear form as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C26">26</xref>).</p>

An independent estimate of tissue perfusion was therefore obtained. Perfusion analysis was based on the assumption that intravascular perfusion and extravascular extravasation can be treated as two dynamic processes separable in time, in accordance with the so-called adiabatic approximation to the tissue homogeneity model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C44">44</xref>). Tissue perfusion can then be derived using classical tracer kinetic models originally proposed by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C45">45</xref>) and later modified for MRI applications by Ostergaard <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C10">10</xref>). Here, tissue perfusion is expressed in terms of a convolution operation between the AIF and the tissue residue function:
<disp-formula id="AR-475605M2">
                     <graphic position="float" xlink:href="10.1177_0284185113475605-eq2.tif" xlink:type="simple"/>
                  </disp-formula>where k is a tissue specific constant depending on hematocrit and tissue density (assumed to be constant across patients and scan sessions), BF is tissue perfusion and R(t) is the tissue specific residue function which, in the absence of contrast agent extravasation is a monotonously decreasing function describing the fraction of the injected tracer present in tissue at time t. In the absence of delay effects R(0) is then by definition equal to unity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C46">46</xref>). In the presence of extravasation R(t) will have a more complex form, reflecting both perfusion and extravasation. However, applying the adiabatic approximation described above, the initial portion of R(t) only reflects perfusion and BF can thus be estimated by solving <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="AR-475605M2">Equation 2</xref> for BF<sup>.</sup>R(t). <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="AR-475605M2">Equation 2</xref> can most readily be solved computationally by converting the expression to matrix form:

                  </disp-formula>The most established method for solving <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="AR-475605M7">Equation 7</xref> is the use of singular value decomposition (SVD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C10">10</xref>) which is a model-free approach (i.e. making no assumptions about the shape of R(t)) and which has shown to produce stable perfusion estimates in the presence of noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C47">47</xref>). SVD inverts the AIF matrix A by decomposition of the matrix into three easily invertible components:

                  </disp-formula>where U and V are orthonormal matrices and S is a diagonal matrix consisting of the singular values of A in descending order:

                  </disp-formula>The solution to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="AR-475605M7">Equation 7</xref> is then given by:
<disp-formula id="AR-475605M10">
                     <graphic position="float" xlink:href="10.1177_0284185113475605-eq10.tif" xlink:type="simple"/>
                  </disp-formula>Since the singular values in the denominator of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="AR-475605M8">Equation 10</xref> can be arbitrarily small, the solution needs to be regularized in the presence of noise and a regularized solution can be expressed as:

                  </disp-formula>where θ<sub>i</sub> is a filter factor of the form:
<disp-formula id="AR-475605M12">
                     <graphic position="float" xlink:href="10.1177_0284185113475605-eq12.tif" xlink:type="simple"/>
                  </disp-formula>and λ is a regularization factor controlling the relative attenuation of each singular value. We used so-called Tikhonov regularization to determine the optimal value of λ, by iteratively testing a range of λ–values and choosing the value which optimally (in a least-squares sense) balances the error in the solution against the oscillation in the resulting residue function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475605C48">48</xref>).</p>
